APPENDIX A

PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT

INTRODUCTION
This appendix provides responses to public and agency comments on the Delta Islands Levees
Feasibility Study (FS)/ Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), as received during the public comment
period.
PUBLIC COMMENTS SUMMARY
On January 31 2013, USACE published a NOI in the Federal Register (Vol. 78, No. 921) to prepare
an EIS. In February 2013, two scoping meetings were held for the project study. The meetings were held
to educate the public about the study efforts and to garner input on the proposed scope, in accordance
with NEPA. On February 19, 2013, the first meeting was conducted from 5:00 to 7:00 p.m. at the Old
Sugar Mill in Clarksburg. The second meeting was conducted on February 19, 2013 from 2:00 to 4:00
p.m. at the Sheraton Grand Hotel in Sacramento. The meetings were open‐house style workshops in
which attendees could read and view the information about the proposed alternatives and interact with
project staff, including representatives of USACE and DWR.
During the FS public review period, a total of 7 comments were received from the public,
including 2 Federal agencies, 3 State agencies and 2 local agencies and organizations. Comments
received were primarily focused on: (1) consistency with Delta land use plans; (2) permitting
requirements; (3) air quality considerations; and (4) salinity and water quality modeling.

COMMENTS AND RESPONSES
The following pages include all public comments received and the Corps’ responses to those
comments. The responses are included directly with the comment in which they are responding to.
The original letters received follow the responses.

Response to Comments
Delta Islands and Levees Feasibility Study Draft EIS
Sacramento, San Joaquin, Solano, Contra Costa, Alameda, and Yolo Counties, California
A. Letter from the Contra Costa Water District (CCWD), dated June 2, 2014.
1. Comment: CCWD relies solely on the Delta to serve water to its 500,000 customers in central and
eastern Contra Coast County. Therefore, CCWD requests that USACE analyze the potential water
quality and supply impacts of the proposed project using qualitative modeling tools, such as
CalSimII for California water operations and DSM2 for hydrodynamics and water quality
simulations.
Response: During feasibility level design, Corps engineers assessed the material proposed
for use for restoration; the material proposed for use is located in the Stockton DWSC to
the immediate north of the restoration site. This material contains the same levels of
salinity concentrations as Big Break. Additionally this project will not alter the tidal prism
of the Delta. Material is being relocated from the Stockton DWSC across and south of
Jersey Island to Big Break. No net increase in material in the tidal prism will occur.
Findings determined that the material consists of fine sand and coarse silt. Baffle plates
will be used to reduce energy and spreading beyond the intended footprint. Further, hay
bales would be used to confine lateral spreading beyond the restoration area. Silt
curtains are a contingency plan should unforeseen water quality issues arise. As a result,
there would be no effect to water supply, and it is unlikely that water quality would be
affected outside of the footprint.
2. Comment: At a minimum, changes to the following parameters resulting from the proposed
project should be calculated and disclosed in a revised FR/EIS:
o
o
o
o
o

Salinity at drinking water intakes in the Delta, including CCWD’s intakes at Mallard
Slough, Rock Slough, OId River near Highway 4, and Middle River on Victoria Canal
Turbidity at drinking water intakes in the Delta
Compliance with the water quality objectives set by the State Water Resources Control
Board’s Decision 1641
The position of X2, the 2000 parts per thousand isohaline in the Delta
Upstream reservoir operations by the State Water Project and Central Valley Project
Response: During feasibility level design, Corps engineers assessed the material proposed
for use for restoration; the material proposed for use is located in the Stockton DWSC to
the immediate north of the restoration site. This material contains the same levels of
salinity concentrations as Big Break. Additionally this project will not alter the tidal prism
of the Delta. Material is being relocated from the Stockton DWSC across and south of

will be used to reduce energy and spreading beyond the intended footprint. Further, hay
bales would be used to confine lateral spreading beyond the restoration area. Silt
curtains are a contingency plan should unforeseen water quality issues arise. As a result,

there would be no effect to water supply, and it is unlikely that water quality would be
affected outside of the footprint.
Prior to construction, the Corps would coordinate with the CVRWQCB to seek a Section
401 Water Quality Certification for the restoration area. Site specific water quality issues
related to dredged material placement will be addressed with the CVRWQCB through the
401 permitting process. The Corps would implement any requirements of the permitting
action in order to minimize water quality effects.
The proposed Delta marsh restoration would have no effect on upstream reservoir
operations.
3. Potential impacts to Delta water quality or supply that should be disclosed could occur during
construction, when diversions from the Delta used to create slurry from the dredge materials
could alter Delta hydrodynamics and/or state the federal water projects operations, as well as in
the long‐term, due to the permanent changes to the bathymetry of the Delta. The cumulative
impacts of this proposed project with other proposed restoration projects should also be
evaluated and presented.
Response: During feasibility level design, Corps engineers assessed the material proposed

curtains are a contingency plan should unforeseen water quality issues arise. As a result,
there would be no effect to water supply, and it is unlikely that water quality would be
affected outside of the footprint.
The proposed restoration would not impact State or Federal water project operations.
While the proposed restoration would change the bathymetry in the restoration area, this
would not significantly alter the overall bathymetry or hydrodynamics of the Delta at
large.
A cumulative effects analysis is included at the end of Chapter 5 of the FR/EIS.

B. Letter from the Central Valley Flood Protection Board, dated June 2, 2014.
1. Comment: Pursuant to 23 CCR components of any selected project alternative and plan
implementation within the Board’s jurisdiction could require Board encroachment permits for
the following:

o

o

o

Placement, construction, reconstruction, removal, or abandonment of any landscaping,
culvert, bridge, conduit, fence, projection fill, embankment, building, structure,
obstruction, encroachment, excavation, the planting, or removal of vegetation, and any
repair or maintenance that involves cutting into the levee (23 CCR Section 6);
Existing structures that predate permitting, or where it is necessary to establish the
conditions normally imposed by permitting. The circumstances include those where
responsibility for the encroachment has not been clearly established or ownership and
use have been revised (23 CCR Section 6);
Vegetation plantings require submission of detailed design drawings; identification of
vegetation type; plant and tree names (both common and scientific); quantities of each
type of plant and tree; spacing and irrigation method; a vegetative management plan for
maintenance to prevent the interference with flood control operations, levee
maintenance, inspections, and flood fight procedures (23 CCR Section 131).

Response: Thank you for your comments. All required permits and coordination would
occur prior to construction.
C. Letter from the US Department of the Interior, dated June 2, 2014.
1. Comment: No comments to offer.
Response: Thank you for your response.
D. Letter from the Delta Protection Commission, dated June 2, 2014.
1. Comment: The Commission favors utilizing public land for habitat restoration before private
agricultural land is converted for this purpose. The Project alternatives at Big Break, Little Franks
and Franks Tract currently propose using public lands for habitat restoration and would not
involve the conversion of any agricultural land. In addition the Commission supports the use of
dredging materials for habitat restoration projects. As a result, staff finds that the proposed
Project is not inconsistent with the LURMP.
Response: Thank you for your support of the project. No change has been made as a
result of this comment.
E. Letter from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California dated, June 2, 2014.
1. Comment: Specifically, Metropolitan requests that the Army Corps model and disclose the
project‐specific and cumulative impacts on the water quality, the location of X2, and related
effects to water supply that may result from the Tentatively Selected Plan (“Project”) that
recommends restoration of approximately 89.5 acres of the Sacramento‐San Joaquin River Delta
to its natural tidal marsh state.
Response: During feasibility level design, Corps engineers assessed the material proposed
for use for restoration; the material proposed for use is located in the Stockton DWSC to
the immediate north of the restoration site. This material contains the same levels of
salinity concentrations as Big Break. Additionally this project will not alter the tidal prism
or hydrodynamics of the Delta. Material is being relocated from the Stockton DWSC

across and south of Jersey Island to Big Break. No net increase in material in the tidal
prism will occur.
Findings determined that the material consists of fine sand and coarse silt. Baffle plates
will be used to reduce energy and spreading beyond the intended footprint. Further, hay
bales would be used to confine lateral spreading beyond the restoration area. Silt
curtains are a contingency plan should unforeseen water quality issues arise. As a result,
there would be no effect to water supply, and it is unlikely that water quality would be
affected outside of the footprint.
A cumulative effects analysis is included at the end of Chapter 5 of the FR/EIS.
2. Comment: Notwithstanding the environmental benefits of such restoration projects, where they
have the potential to adversely impact water quality of the location of X2, individually or in
combination with other related past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future projects, NEPA
requires that such impacts be analyzed even if the overall environmental benefits outweigh the
adverse impacts. Indeed there is a precedent for analyzing a project’s significant environmental
benefits in an EIS. There are models available that enable the Army Corps to quantify the project‐
specific and cumulative impacts of the Project. Such modeling should take into account a range of
water year types, consistent with standard modeling practices. But the FR/DEIS lacks any such
modeling or analysis.
Response: NEPA does not require any modeling of impacts. NEPA requires public
disclosure of potential environmental effects and compliance with environmental laws
and regulations. The Clean Water Act does require coordination with the CVRWQCB
through the 401 permitting process, which the Corps has committed to completing prior
to construction.
During feasibility level design, Corps engineers assessed the material proposed for use for
restoration; the material proposed for use is located in the Stockton DWSC to the

there would be no effect to water supply, and it is unlikely that water quality would be
affected outside of the footprint.
3. Comment: A quantitative analysis of the adverse and/or beneficial impacts to water quality and
water supply that may result from tidal marsh restoration in the Delta is essential to the informed
decision making and public participation NEPA requires.

Response: During feasibility level design, Corps engineers assessed the material proposed
for use for restoration; the material proposed for use is located in the Stockton DWSC to
the immediate north of the restoration site. This material contains the same levels of
salinity concentrations as Big Break. Additionally this project will not alter the tidal prism
or hydrodynamics of the Delta. Material is being relocated from the Stockton DWSC

curtains are a contingency plan should unforeseen water quality issues arise. As a result,
there would be no effect to water supply, and it is unlikely that water quality would be
affected outside of the footprint.
4. Comment: Not only would an adverse impact on salinity or X2 have direct impact on the Delta, it
could have significant direct and indirect impacts on water supply, which, in turn, can have
significant adverse impacts on other resources including energy use and air quality for beyond
the Delta. This, the project‐specific and cumulative impacts of the Project should be modeled to
fully disclose potential impacts to salinity, X2, and related impacts. If such modeling supports the
conclusions in the FS/DEIS, Army Corps will have fulfilled its obligation under NEPA. However, if
modeling reveals significant direct, indirect, or cumulative impacts, the project should be
modified to avoid, minimize, or mitigate such impact to less than significant.
Response: NEPA does not require any modeling of impacts. NEPA requires public
disclosure of potential environmental effects and compliance with environmental laws
and regulations. The Clean Water Act does require coordination with the CVRWQCB
through the 401 permitting process, which the Corps has committed to completing prior
to construction.

A cumulative effects analysis is included at the end of Chapter 5 of the FR/EIS.

5. Comment: However, in addition to construction related impacts, the resulting alteration of the
bathymetry at these sites could affect broader water quality and water supplies of interest reliant
on the Delta. Unfortunately, the FR/DEIS contains no analysis whatsoever of project‐specific or
cumulative impacts to salinity, X2, or water supply resulting from the altered bathymetry.
The FR/DEIS acknowledges the potential impacts of the altered bathymetry on salinity and X2
because it identifies the following thresholds of significance:
o

o

Substantially degrade surface water quality such that it would violate criteria or
objectives identified in the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board basin
plan or otherwise substantially degrade water quality to the detriment of beneficial uses.
Adversely affect salinity flow patterns at water conveyance facilities (affect the X2 line).

However, neither threshold is explicitly applied to the long term impacts of the Project on salinity
or X2. Instead of analysis, the document simply declares: “The placement of material to restore
intertidal marsh habitat at Big Break would not affect salinity in the study area.” (FR/DEIS at p.
188.) Likewise, the Biological Assessment in Appendix G simply states: “The placement of
material to raise the elevation of Big Break Island will not affect salinity in the project area or
downstream.” (FR/DEIS, App. G, Biological Assessment at p. 13.) The FS/DEIS mentions “[s]alinity
and hydraulic analysis taken from existing reports” on page 84. But it is in the context of a
preliminary discussion of impacts to water levels, not salinity and X2. Moreover, there is no
citation to the “existing reports” that could provide the public or decision makers with relevant
evidence to supports the conclusion that the Project will how no adverse impact. Such conclusory
statements do not satisfy the Army Corps’ obligation under NEPA to analyze and disclose the
project‐specific impacts of the Project of the human environment.
Response: The proposed restoration would not impact State or Federal water project
operations. While the proposed restoration would change the bathymetry in the
restoration area, this would not significantly alter the overall bathymetry or
hydrodynamics of the Delta at large.
Prior to construction, the Corps would coordinate with the CVRWQCB to seek a Section
401 Water Quality Certification for the restoration area. Site specific water quality issues
related to dredged material placement will be addressed with the CVRWQCB through the
401 permitting process. The Corps would implement any requirements of the permitting
action in order to minimize water quality effects.

there would be no effect to water supply, and it is unlikely that water quality would be
affected outside of the footprint.
A cumulative effects analysis is included at the end of Chapter 5 of the FR/EIS.
6. Comment: Under NEPA, Army Corps must also analyze the cumulative impacts on salinity and
X2. But the FR/DEIS lacks any cumulative impacts analysis. Most notably, the BDCP and Draft
EIR.EIS for the BDCP have been circulating for public agency comment since December 2013. As
noted above, the BDCP project alternatives include substantial restoration of tidal marsh habitat.
In addition, there are several tidal marsh restoration projects planned in the Delta and Suisun
Marsh that may affect salinity, X2, water supply, and other related resources. Currently, DWR is
planning to implement the Dutch Slough Tidal Marsh Restoration Project, Reclamation District
2130 is planning its Mallard Farms Conservation Bank in the Suisun Marsh, and the State and
Federal Water Contractors Agency had approved the Lower Yolo Restoration Project and is
planning additional tidal marsh restoration in the Suisun Marsh, It is also reasonably foreseeable
that the proposed projects to deepen the ports of Sacramento and Stockton may impact salinity
and the location of X2. Thus, at a minimum, Army Corps should analyze the cumulative impacts of
the Project in combination with these and other projects in the Delta and Suisun Marsh that may
affect salinity or the location of X2.
Response: The cumulative effects analysis in the FR/EIS include assessment of the
cumulative impacts of past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions within the
geographic and temporal scope of the analysis. Refinements have been made the
geographic and temporal scope to better define the limitations of the cumulative effects
analysis. Other marsh restoration projects in the area are considered as a part of this
analysis. Additionally, it is noted that the deepening of the Sacramento and Stockton
DWSCs is no longer considered to be reasonably foreseeable since these studies have
been inactive.
The proposed restoration would not impact State or Federal water project operations.
Prior to construction, the Corps would coordinate with the CVRWQCB to seek a Section
401 Water Quality Certification for the restoration area. Site specific water quality issues
related to dredged material placement will be addressed with the CVRWQCB through the
401 permitting process. The Corps would implement any requirements of the permitting
action in order to minimize water quality effects.
During feasibility level design, Corps engineers assessed the material proposed for use for
restoration; the material proposed for use is located in the Stockton DWSC to the
immediate north of the restoration site. This material contains the same levels of salinity
concentrations as Big Break. Additionally this project will not alter the tidal prism or
hydrodynamics of the Delta. Material is being relocated from the Stockton DWSC across
and south of Jersey Island to Big Break. No net increase in material in the tidal prism will
occur.

7. Comment: In addition, to the extent that the currently proposed Project is being used as a first
step in a much larger program to dispose of dredged materials from other Army Corps projects in
the Delta, the broader program should be studied in a program EIS to avoid improperly
segmenting the environmental impact analysis in a way that could mask significant adverse
impacts that would otherwise require mitigation. Metropolitan requests that the Army Corps
comply with NEPA by modeling the individual and cumulative impacts the Project may have on
water quality and location of X2 and conduction the required analysis of the Project’s direct and
indirect impacts on water supply and other related resources. Metropolitan is familiar with
relevant models and sources of information that can provide a solid foundation for the required
analysis. We would be pleased to guide you to those resources.
Response: At this time, USACE is only proposing this restoration project. Due to the
status of BDCP/Cal WaterFix at the time of alternative formulation, a number of
opportunities were eliminated from consideration because they were being considered for
implementation by the State of California. Due to the reformulation of Cal WaterFix/Cal
EcoRestore, some of these previously eliminated opportunities are once again available in
the Delta. USACE could pursue these opportunities in an additional Feasibility Study in
the future; however, such a study would require funding and authorization from
Congress. These opportunities would not be pursued until the selected plan has been
implemented.
The impacts associated with the Selected Plan have been assessed in the EIS, however, no
impacts were determined to be above the significance thresholds. The proposed
restoration would not impact State or Federal water project operations. NEPA does not
require any modeling of impacts. NEPA requires public disclosure of potential
environmental effects and compliance with environmental laws and regulations.
Prior to construction, the Corps would coordinate with the CVRWQCB to seek a Section
401 Water Quality Certification for the restoration area. Site specific water quality issues
related to dredged material placement will be addressed with the CVRWQCB through the
401 permitting process. The Corps would implement any requirements of the permitting
action in order to minimize water quality effects.

8. Comment: Finally, Section 3.1, Table 3‐3 and figure 3‐2 do not provide adequate information for
an independent assessment regarding which assets are or are not of statewide importance. The
table and figure assess a broad range of infrastructure types and resources on Delta islands in
drawing conclusions of statewide importance based on information which is unavailable to the
reader. Notably, DWR’s interagency draft Delta Flood Emergency Management Plan, April 2014,
discloses that portions of Old and Middle River levees constitute important levee systems for
emergency water supply conveyance subsequent to flood or earthquake initiated multiple island
failures. Thus, the islands identified in DWR’s interagency draft plan should be considered and
expressly noted in the FR/DEIS.
Response: Water conveyance infrastructure was not a benefit category used for the
economic evaluation for the purposes of this interim report and study.

F. Letter from the Delta Stewardship Council, dated June 2, 2014.
1. Comment: Delta Stewardship Council and Delta Plan. The council is the successor of the CALFED
Bay‐Delta Program. On page 5, Subsection 1.5.1, we suggest replacing the “CALFED Bay‐Delta
Program” with “Delta Stewardship Council and Delta Plan”. We propose inserting the following
language: “The Delta Reform Act (California Water Code Section 85212) created the Council as an
independent agency of the State and charged the Council ‘to develop, adopt, and commence
implementation of the Delta Plan.’ The Delta Plan is a comprehensive, long‐term management
plan for the Delta. It creates legally enforceable regulatory policies as well as nonbinding
recommendations to further the state’s coequal goals for the Delta: improve statewide water
supply reliability, and protect and restore a vibrant and healthy Delta ecosystem, all in a manner
that preserves, protects and enhances the unique agricultural, cultural, and recreational
characteristics of the Delta. The Delta Plan was adopted on May 16, 2013 and its regulatory
policies became effective on September 1, 2013. The plan can be found on the Council’s web site
at http://deltacouncil.ca.gov/.”
Response: Section 1.5.1 has been updated to include similar language to the
recommendation by the Delta Stewardship Council. Note that the CALFED Bay‐Delta
Program was not removed because this is intended to be a comprehensive list of past,
present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions for the purposes of the NEPA
Cumulative Effects analysis, as well as for study purposes. As a result, since the CALFED
Program is a past program that has since evolved, we are maintaining that section in the
document.
2. Comment: Bay Delta Conservation Plan (BDCP) and the Delta Plan. The draft FR/EIS (page 16)
states that “ecological problems exist that will be resolved through the implementation of the
BDCP/Delta Plan.” We suggest explaining the differences and connections between the Delta
Plan and the BDCP to avoid confusion. It is important to note that the Delta Plan was adopted in
2013, while the BDCP is still under development. The Delta Stewardship Council’s Delta Plan is a
comprehensive management plan authorized by the Delta Reform Act, as described above. The
Delta Plan contains numerous goals, objectives, recommendations and the policies that are
largely implemented through coordination of actions by other agencies including the USACE. The
BDCP is being developed as a 50‐year Natural Community Conservation Plan (NCCP) with the goal
of recovering endangered or threatened species in the Delta. It is comprised of 22 conservation
measures, including improved conveyance of water to the pumps of the Central Valley Project
and State Water Project, parameters for operating those projects, and restoration of large
portions of the Delta to provide functional habitat and reduce stressors such as invasive species
and pollutants. When complete, the BDCP will provide the basis for the issuance of endangered
species permits for the operation of the state and federal water projects. It is being developed by
a group of local water agencies, environmental and conservation organizations, state and federal
agencies, and other interest groups. The Delta Reform Act requires that the BDCP, when
completed and successfully permitted and if it meets certain statutory incorporation
requirements, shall be fully incorporated into the Delta Plan (Water Code Section 85320 (a)). It is
anticipated this will occur in 2015 at the earliest. It is then that two plans intersect.
Therefore, we suggest revising the statement on page 16 to read, “Implementation of the Delta
Plan is advancing the state’s coequal goals of statewide water supply reliability, and a vibrant and
healthy Delta ecosystem, done in a way that preserves, protects and enhances that rural,

agricultural and recreational characteristics of the Delta. The Delta Reform Act requires that the
BDCP, when completed and successfully permitted and if it meets certain statutory incorporation
requirements, shall be fully incorporated into the Delta Plan.” Based on the differences between
the two plans, described above, we also suggest revising the term “BDCP/Delta Plan” on page 19
to read “BDCP.”
Based on our discussions, we understand that USACE is constrained in its authority to analyze
problems and likely solutions under consideration by other federal agencies, such as the habitat
restoration areas and measures proposed in the Draft BDCP. The Draft FR/EIS (page 19) states
that, “Formulated alternatives and the recommended plan must [neither] impede…[nor] be
dependent on the BDCP/Delta Plan’. We do suggest that the “No Project Alternative” should not
include BDCP, as it had not been approved and if approved most of the habitat restoration may
not have an identified fund source.
Response: The majority of this concern has been resolved with time ‐‐ with BDCP evolving
into Cal Water Fix, there is less confusion about the differences between these projects.
The FR/EIS has been updated to explain the current status of the Cal Water Fix.
3.

Comment: Priority Habitat Restoration Areas. We encourage USACE to consider the priority
habitat restoration areas designated in the Delta Plan (Figure 4‐8, Recommended Areas for
Prioritization and Implementation of Habitat Restoration Projects, Delta Plan, p. 151), as well as
Delta Plan Recommendation ER R2, Prioritize and Implement Projects that Restore Delta Habitat.
This recommendation, combined with the ecosystem restoration policies described below,
represent the widely accepted framework for habitat restoration in the Delta. We believe that
using the Delta Plan as a guide to restoration priorities alternatives and the recommended plan
must neither impede nor be dependent on the BDCP. We are aware that USACE has recently
provided sediment to the Montezuma Wetland Restoration Project in the Suisun Marsh, one of
the priority habitat restoration areas identified in the Delta Plan. Additional USACE support for
this project and similar efforts in the Delta is welcome and encouraged.
Response: Thank you for your recommendations. For the purposes of this interim study,
USACE identified a study risk regarding the future without project condition. Due to the
large‐scale changes that were/are under consideration for the Delta through the BDCP,
now Cal WaterFix and Cal EcoRestore, constraints were put into place for this interim
study in order to ensure a recommended project could be successful whether or not these
potential changes to future Delta conditions occurred. These constraints only apply to
this interim study; future USACE investigations will revisit and revise as necessary.

4. Restore Habitats at Appropriate Elevations. Given the current focus of the Draft FR/EIS on areas
outside the priority habitat restoration areas, including subtidal areas, we suggest considering the
guidance provided by Delta Plan Policy ER P2 (23 California Code of Regulations [CCR] Section
5006). This policy calls for habitat restoration to be carried out consistent with Appendix 3 of the
Delta Plan regulations. In Appendix 3, the section on subsided Delta lands and deep open water
areas, which are defined as below approximately six feet in elevation, states that "the most
subsided lands would be the lowest priority for restoration to tidal marsh because raising
elevations to the range appropriate for vegetation establishment is likely to be infeasible." The
higher priority areas for restoration identified in Appendix 3 are those areas that are not subsided
or only slightly subsided, since these areas are within the range of feasibility for subsidence

reversal. Since sediment supply in the Delta is limited, it is recommended that use of sediment
stockpiles in habitat restoration projects should be focused in areas that are already situated
near target elevations or are not highly subsided.
Response: As a part of the Corps’ Feasibility Level Design process, the Corps has
optimized the design elevation for this restoration project to maximize benefits for listed
fish species. This process both enabled the Corps to support restoration efforts under the
ESA, and also increased the acreage of the proposed restoration to provide greater
benefits. The use of sediment stockpiles was heavily considered as a part of this study
and was part of the tentatively selected plan at the time of the draft report release in
2014; however, further studies have shown that use of the sediment stockpiles is not a
cost effective solution for this restoration program. As a result, the Corps is proposing to
use direct placement of dredged material at the time of dredging to construct this habitat
restoration project. While this proposal does not reduce the acreage of existing stockpiles
in the Delta, it does assist in slowing the growth of these sites by reusing material directly
from the channel rather than disposing of it on land.
5. Protect Opportunities to Restore Habitat. Delta Plan Policy ER P3 (23 CCR Section 5007) calls for
protecting opportunities to restore habitat in priority habitat restoration areas. We suggest
evaluating whether removal of sediment from Decker Island is identified as an area within the
Western Delta Priority Habitat Restoration Areas as it contains potential intertidal, transitional,
and upland habitat.
Response: The use of sediment stockpiles was heavily considered as a part of this study
and was part of the tentatively selected plan at the time of the draft report release in
2014; however, further studies have shown that use of the sediment stockpiles is not a
cost effective solution for this restoration program. As a result, the Corps is proposing to
use direct placement of dredged material at the time of dredging to construct this habitat
restoration project. While this proposal does not reduce the acreage of existing stockpiles
in the Delta, it does assist in slowing the growth of these sites by reusing material directly
from the channel rather than disposing of it on land.
6. Respect Local Land Use When Siting Water of Flood Facilities or Restoring Habitats. We suggest
evaluating the potential impact that removal of sediment stockpiles from areas that are subsided
would have on those islands' vulnerability to flood risk. Dredge spoils may also be used to reverse
subsidence or used to bolster existing levees, which preserves their existing beneficial use by
reducing flood risk. Please see Delta Plan Policy DP P2 (23 CCR Section 5011) for additional
information.
Response: The use of sediment stockpiles was heavily considered as a part of this study
and was part of the tentatively selected plan at the time of the draft report release in
2014; however, further studies have shown that use of the sediment stockpiles is not a
cost effective solution for this restoration program. As a result, the Corps is proposing to
use direct placement of dredged material at the time of dredging to construct this habitat
restoration project. While this proposal does not reduce the acreage of existing stockpiles
in the Delta, it does assist in slowing the growth of these sites by reusing material directly
from the channel rather than disposing of it on land.

7. Flood Management. We feel it will be important to clearly explain to our partner agencies and
the public why the USACE and the Delta Stewardship Council, which is responsible for completing
a study prioritizing state investments in Delta levees, are likely to reach different conclusions
about the need for investment. In the future, we encourage USACE to consider non‐traditional
risk management options that may be more feasible, and to use system‐wide considerations and
categories to define the risks and benefits for the region. Consideration should be given to health
and safety threats as well as economic damages related to interruption of water conveyance;
economic damage of extended travel times for major transportation corridors; and risk to life of
population in transit on major transportation corridors.
Response: For the purposes of this interim report, the scope of the study was limited to
in‐Delta infrastructure and populations at risk. This does not preclude future USACE
investigations from evaluating additional benefit categories such as risks to water
conveyance infrastructure.
G. Letter from the US Environmental Protection Agency, dated June 2, 2014.
1. Comment: While EPA supports well planned and executed restoration, we are concerned that the
project misses an opportunity to reuse a larger amount of dredged material, may induce further
subsidence that could impact water quality, and defers analysis to the Preconstructions
Engineering and Design phase of the project. EPA recommends that the Final EIS include a
project objective to reuse existing dredged material, in furtherance of EPA’s and the Corps’
shared goal (as stated in the Nation Dredging Team’s charter) of promoting the beneficial use of
dredged material.
Response: While reuse of dredged material was an objective of the study, as stated in
Section 1.5.2 Studies, Delta Long‐Term Management Strategy & in Section 2.2.3
Opportunities, the review process on the study revealed that it was not a cost effective
alternative to construct the project using stockpiled dredged material. As a result, the
alternatives that included reuse of stockpiled material were removed from the final array
of alternatives, and the proposed action moving forward only incorporates direct
placement from O&M dredging. While this will not reduce the previously dredged
stockpiles in the Delta, it will reduce the quantity of material being added to the
stockpiles in the Delta over the course of project construction.
2. The FEIS should also clarify how the design phase and associated studies may alter the existing
environmental impact analysis.
Response: Significant revisions to the proposal were incorporated as a part of Feasibility
Level Design and are now evaluated as part of the Final Report. It is possible that
additional design and study in the preconstruction engineering and design phase could
further alter the proposal. If there is a significant change to the environmental impact
analysis, supplemental documentation would be prepared to account for those changes.
3. EPA notes that the DEIS acknowledges that different objectives in the future could lead to
further development of alternatives not considered within the current Feasibility Study. The
document specifically calls attention to the possibility that approval of the San Francisco Bay to
Stockton Navigation Improvement Project could lead to re‐evaluation of the unexplored

alternatives in this study because of additional availability of dredged material. Though not
indicated in the DEIS, EPA notes that such a re‐evaluation would likely require additional NEPA
review. We encourage the Corps to ensure that any future efforts related to this Feasibility
Study and similar projects include consideration of the economic value of existing and potential
ecosystem services in the Delta in the cost‐benefit analysis of alternatives.
Response: Any future investigations, such as those speculated upon in the DEIS would
require compliance with NEPA and would follow USACE policy regarding evaluation of
Ecosystem Restoration alternatives.
4. Explicitly incorporate “reuse of dredged material generated and/or stockpiled in the Delta, to
the maximum extent practicable” into the project objectives in the FEIS. Evaluate project
alternatives against this objective, considering different combinations of restoration sites and
sediment sources that may provide increased restoration acreage at still reasonable costs.
Compute the incremental and total costs of using Roberts 1 material for restoration at Frank’s
Tract 2 and consider including this restoration element in the final alternative selection.
Response: While reuse of dredged material was an objective of the study, as stated in
Section 1.5.2 Studies, Delta Long‐Term Management Strategy & in Section 2.2.3
Opportunities, the review process on the study revealed that it was not a cost effective
alternative to construct the project using stockpiled dredged material. As a result, the
alternatives that included reuse of stockpiled material were removed from the final array
of alternatives, and the proposed action moving forward only incorporates direct
placement from O&M dredging. While this will not reduce the previously dredged
stockpiles in the Delta, it will reduce the quantity of material being added to the
stockpiles in the Delta over the course of project construction.
5. Rank and evaluate each of the alternatives carried forward, according to the volume of dredged
material reuse each could achieve.
Response: While reuse of dredged material was an objective of the study, as stated in
Section 1.5.2 Studies, Delta Long‐Term Management Strategy & in Section 2.2.3
Opportunities, the review process on the study revealed that it was not a cost effective
alternative to construct the project using stockpiled dredged material. As a result, the
alternatives that included reuse of stockpiled material were removed from the final array
of alternatives, and the proposed action moving forward only incorporates direct
placement from O&M dredging. While this will not reduce the previously dredged
stockpiles in the Delta, it will reduce the quantity of material being added to the
stockpiles in the Delta over the course of project construction.
6. The FEIS should include the design guidelines developed from previous restoration of Donlon
Island and Venice Cut, including success metrics. It should also clearly identify the reports
describing salinity and hydraulic analysis referenced on page 84 and include a commitment to
monitor salinity and relevant hydraulic indicators (e.g. flow) during project implementation in
order to validate the DEIS’ conclusions that the project would not result in changes to flood
control structures.

Response: The citation to general salinity and hydraulic analyses has been removed from
the final report. The design guidelines from Donlon Island were used, in addition to the
Marsh Wren HEP model, to develop a target elevation during the draft report. Since that
time, USACE has optimized its designs to account for more valuable habitat for listed fish
species. This process both enabled the Corps to support restoration efforts under the ESA,
and also increased the acreage of the proposed restoration to provide greater benefits.
The final FR/EIS describes the process completed during Feasibility Level Design and the
assumptions that went into developing the updated design elevation.
During feasibility level design, Corps engineers assessed the material proposed for use for
restoration; the material proposed for use is located in the Stockton DWSC to the
immediate north of the restoration site. This material contains the same levels of salinity
concentrations as Big Break. Additionally this project will not alter the tidal prism or
hydrodynamics of the Delta. Material is being relocated from the Stockton DWSC across
and south of Jersey Island to Big Break. No net increase in material in the tidal prism will
occur.
Prior to construction, the Corps would coordinate with the CVRWQCB to seek a Section
401 Water Quality Certification for the restoration area. Site specific water quality issues
related to dredged material placement will be addressed with the CVRWQCB through the
401 permitting process. The Corps would implement any requirements of the permitting
action in order to minimize water quality effects. It is highly likely that these requirements
would include salinity monitoring; however, the Board requires a higher level of design
before beginning these coordination efforts. Monitoring for restoration success is
described in Appendix M, the Monitoring and Adaptive Management Plan.

7. The FEIS should include a detailed description of the surveys to be conducted during the PED
phase, including how their outcomes may influence the project design or cause reevaluation of
project impacts to water quality. EPA specifically encourages further study during PED of
hydrodynamics, tidal prisms, and formation and management of methylmercury. The FEIS
should also provide clarification as to whether or not changes to project design elements might
trigger additional environmental review under NEPA.
Response: A thorough physical and chemical characterization of restoration site
sediments will be performed during the preconstruction engineering and design phase of
the project prior to implementation. Dredged material is characterized every year under
the O&M dredging project. Unsuitable material will not be used for restoration and
would be disposed of under the O&M dredging project.
Prior to construction, the Corps would coordinate with the CVRWQCB to seek a Section
401 Water Quality Certification for the restoration area. Site specific water quality issues
related to dredged material placement will be addressed with the CVRWQCB through the
401 permitting process. The Corps would implement any requirements of the permitting
action in order to minimize water quality effects.

8. The FEIS should include a discussion of how peat‐based flooded islands behave under current
conditions and the expected responses of the islands and degraded levees to the placement of
relatively heavy sediments contained in dredged material. EPA encourages USACE to coordinate
with the U.S. Geological Survey’s Water Science Center and their Priority Ecosystems Science
program for the Bay Delta for expertise regarding peat‐based islands, hydrodynamics, sediment
transport processes, subsidence in the central and western Delta, and the formation and
management of methylmercury.
Response: Thank you for your recommendation to coordinate with USGS. Detailed
assessments of this nature will be performed during preconstruction engineering and
design.
9. The FEIS should include a commitment in the Monitoring and Adaptive Management Plan to
identify monitoring ‐ and project adaptions for potential induced subsidence and such
subsidence’s impacts to levee integrity.
Response: During feasibility level design, the Corps included a contingency in the final
target elevation to account for additional sediment losses from subsidence, sea level rise,
and wave wash erosion. This restoration project would not impact levee integrity.
10. The FEIS should include drafts of the NPDES permit application, the SWPPP and in‐water work
plan, and a commitment to implement plans at least as protective as the drafts. It should also
include the Section 401 Certification from the Central Valley RWQCB.
Response: The NPDES permit, SWPPP, and Section 401 Certification will be acquired prior
to construction and will not be included as appendices to the FEIS. The NPDES and SWPPP
are typically prepared by the construction contractor who would be implementing these
plans, and the CVRWQCB requires a 60% level of design to initiate the Section 401
process. The project would be at approximately a 30% level of design when the FEIS is
complete. If these processes result in any changes that impact the environmental
analysis, then supplemental NEPA document would be prepared, as necessary.
11. The DEIS states that a conformity assessment for ozone and PM10 must be completed and that
the assessment will evaluate whether or not the project’s construction or operational emissions
would exceed 25 tons per year of Reactive Organic Gasses or NOx, or 100 tons per year of
PM10. In the air quality impact analysis, it appears that these emission thresholds would not be
exceeded, but a formal assessment is still needed. The FEIS should include the general
conformity assessment for ozone and particulate matter.
Response: The FEIS includes updated air quality assessment, which resulted in no
violations of de minimus levels or local air quality thresholds. Please see the analysis in
Chapter 5 that includes updated air quality monitoring at a more detailed level than the
draft EIS.
12. The analysis for Alternatives 2 and 6 (the action alternatives) both specify “12 employee trips
per day, 20 miles each way.” Later analysis of growth‐inducing impacts suggests that Alternative
6 would create 20 jobs locally (page 216). It is unclear if the analysis for Alternative 6
appropriately accounts for all expected employee trips. The FEIS should clarify the number of

employee trips per day associated with each of the action alternatives and adjust the air quality
impact analysis accordingly.
Response: The project description at the end of Chapter 3 has been updated to reflect
the number of employee trips per day for each portion of the project implementation.
13. The No Action Alternative air quality analysis does not discuss the impacts to air quality of the
earthwork required for existing dredged material placement from the Operations and
Maintenance dredging of the Stockton Deep Water Ship Channel. These air impacts are used
later in the analysis for Alternatives 2 and 6 to demonstrate reduced air impacts from avoidance
of that earthwork. The FEIS should account for the air quality impacts of O&M activities in the
No Action Alternative to provide a foundation for the air quality benefits realized in the action
alternatives.
Response: Air Quality impacts associated with the O&M Dredging is not part of the Delta
Study proposed action and therefore will not be considered as part of the impact
assessment. The O&M Dredging Project includes a NEPA assessment and annual
permitting that are an existing/future without project condition that would occur
regardless of approval of the Delta Study.
14. The air quality mitigation section states that construction equipment powered by electricity
eliminates criteria pollutant emissions from diesel combustion (page 204); however, it does not
state that use of such equipment would be encouraged or required. Include, in the FEIS, either
a commitment to require contractors to use available electrical construction equipment
technology to the extent possible, or a commitment to give preference to contractor proposals
that would use such technology.
Response: The Corps has included language in the FEIS that encourages the use of
electrical equipment during construction. The Air Quality analysis is in compliance with all
local and Federal thresholds.
15. The DEIS includes a climate change impact analysis for greenhouse gas emissions in accordance
with federal and state policies and regulations. The GHG emissions from the project are not
expected to be significant, but USACE would implement mitigation measures to reduce the
cumulative impacts from the project. It states that the selected contractor would be
“encouraged to implement” additional GHG mitigation measures (page 207) where practical,
but it would not require most measures. During the contractor selection process, prioritize
contractors whose proposals include the identified voluntary GHG mitigation measures.
Response: Policy does not allow the Corps to prioritize contractors in this manner.
16. In light of the President’s November 1, 2013 Executive Order 13653 “Preparing the United
States for the Impacts of Climate Change,” there is an opportunity for the Delta Islands and
Levees project to explicitly illustrate and maximize the climate‐resilient benefits of ecosystem
restoration and intertidal marshes. Currently the DEIS addresses this resiliency in terms of the
restored ecosystem itself, but not its potential impact on the surrounding areas. Reference
Executive Order 13653 in the discussion of the regulatory environment. The FEIS should also

include a discussion about the impacts of each alternative on climate change resiliency of the
surrounding area, and consider those impacts in the final alternative selection.
Response: This Executive Order is no longer applicable, because the current
administration has revoked it. A sea level rise analysis has been conducted for the
proposed restoration project and has been incorporated into the Engineering Appendix.

(EIS#:20140120)
Dear Mr. Kidd:
Thank you for providing the Delta Protection Commission (Commission)
the opportunity to review the Delta Islands and Levees Feasibility Study,
Draft Integrated Feasibility Report and Environmental Impact Statement
(Project).
As the Project is within the Primary Zone of the Legal Delta, the
Commission offers the following comments regarding consistency with
our Land Use and Resource Management for the Primary Zone (LURMP).
The Commission favors utilizing public land for habitat restoration before
private agricultural land is converted for this purpose. The Project
alternatives at Big Break, Little Franks Tract and Franks Tract currently
propose using public lands for habitat restoration and would not involve
the conversion of any agricultural land. In addition the Commission
supports the use of dredging materials for habitat restoration projects. As a
result, staff finds that the proposed Project is not inconsistent with the
LURMP. The following LURMP policies pertain to the proposed Project:
Agriculture: P-2, Conversion of land to non-agriculturally-oriented
uses should occur first where productivity and agricultural values are
lowest.

CA Natural Resources Agency

CA State Lands Commission

Land Use: P-9, The implementation of the policies contained in the
resource management plan shall not be achieved through the exercise
of the power of eminent domain unless requested by the landowner.
Land Use: P-10, Maintain sites for the storage of dredged material from
channels within the Delta and discourage the conversion of existing
sites to other uses, as appropriate. Soil that is suitable for levee
rehabilitation and raising Delta lowlands should remain within the
Delta.

Robert Kidd, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
Page 2
Natural Resources: P-3, Lands managed primarily for wildlife habitat should be managed to
maximize ecological values. Appropriate programs, such as "Coordinated Resource
Management and Planning" (Public Resources Code Section 9408(c)) should ensure full
participation by local government and property owner representatives.
Natural Resources: P-6, Support the implementation of appropriate buffers, management plans
and/or good neighbor policies (e.g. safe harbor agreements) that among other things, limit
liability for incidental take associated with adjacent agricultural and recreational activities within
lands converted to wildlife habitat to ensure the ongoing agricultural and recreational operations
adjacent to the converted lands are not negatively affected.
Natural Resources: P-7, Incorporate, to the maximum extent feasible, suitable and appropriate
wildlife protection, restoration and enhancement on publicly-owned land as part of a Delta-wide
plan for habitat management.
Natural Resources: P-10, Ensure that design, construction, and management of any flooding
program to provide seasonal wildlife and aquatic habitat on agricultural lands, duck club lands
and additional seasonal and tidal wetlands, shall incorporate "best management practices" to
minimize vectors including mosquito breeding opportunities, and shall be coordinated with the
local vector control districts, (each of the four vector control districts in the Delta provides
specific wetland/mosquito management criteria to landowners within their district.)

Thank you for the opportunity to provide input. Please contact Raymond Costantino, Associate
Environmental Planner, at 916-375-4534 for any questions regarding the comments provided.

Delta Islands and Levees Feasibility Study, California, Draft Feasibility Report and
Environmental Impact Statement, Contra Costa and Sacramento Counties, California
[CEQ# 201401201

The Environmental Protection Agency has reviewed the Draft Environmental Impact Statement for the
Delta Islands and Levees Feasibility Study, California. Our review and comments are pursuant to the
National Environmental Policy Act, Council on Environmental Quality regulations (40 CFR Parts 15001508), and our NEPA review authority under Section 309 of the Clean Air Act.
EPA appreciates the efforts of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to exercise its ecosystem restoration
authority and flood risk management responsibilities, and understands that this Feasibility Study is
USACE’s mechanism to participate in a cost-sharing solution to address ecosystem restoration and flood
risk management in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. EPA further acknowledges the objectives and
limits placed on this Feasibility Study, namely to maximize net benefits in a cost effective manner, avoid
overlap with restoration considered by other plans (e.g. Bay Delta Conservation Plan), avoid impacts to
people and infrastructure, and favor areas with connectivity to existing habitat.
While EPA supports well planned and executed restoration, we are concerned that the project misses an
opportunity to reuse a larger volume of dredged material, may induce further subsidence that could
impact water quality, and defers analysis to the Preconstruction Engineering and Design phase of the
project.
In light of the above stated concerns, we have rated the preferred alternative Alternative 6 as
Environmental Concerns Insufficient Information (EC-2). Please see the enclosed “Summary of EPA
Rating Definitions.” EPA recommends that the Final EIS include a project objective to reuse existing
dredged material, in furtherance of EPA’s and the Corps’ shared goal (as stated in the National Dredging
Team’s charter) of promoting the beneficial use of dredged material. The FEIS should also clarify how
the design phase and associated studies may alter the existing environmental impact analysis. Additional
recommendations are provided in the enclosed Detailed Comments.

EPA notes that the DEIS acknowledges that different objectives in the future could lead to further
development of alternatives not considered within the current Feasibility Study. The document

specifically calls attention to the possibility that approval of the San Francisco Bay to Stockton
Navigation Improvement Project could lead to re-evaluation of the unexplored alternatives in this study
because of additional availability of dredged material. Though not indicated in the DEIS, EPA notes that
such a re-evaluation would likely require additional NEPA review. We encourage the Corps to ensure
that any future efforts related to this Feasibility Study and similar projects include consideration of the
economic value of existing and potential ecosystem services in the Delta in the cost-benefit analysis of
alternatives (see: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3339477/). In addition, we urge coordination
with other projects and agencies to identify the highest priority restoration locations and scientificallyevaluated restoration methodologies in the Delta.
We appreciate the opportunity to review this DEIS. Should you have any questions regarding our
comments, please contact me at (415) 972-3521, or contact Jean Prijatel, the lead reviewer for the
project. Jean can be reached at (415) 947-4167 or prijate1.jeanepa.gov.

SUMMARY OF EPA RATING DEFINITIONS*
This rating system was developed as a means to summarize the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) level of concern
with a proposed action. The ratings are a combination of alphabetical categories for evaluation of the environmental impacts
of the proposal and numerical categories for evaluation of the adequacy of the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).

“EC” (Environmental Concerns)
The EPA review has identified environmental impacts that should be avoided in order to fully protect the environment.
Corrective measures may require changes to the preferred alternative or application of mitigation measures that can reduce the
environmental impact. EPA would like to work with the lead agency to reduce these impacts.
“EO” (Environmental Objections)
The EPA review has identified significant environmental impacts that should be avoided in order to provide adequate protection
for the environment. Corrective measures may require substantial changes to the preferred alternative or consideration of some
other project alternative (including the no action alternative or a new alternative). EPA intends to work with the lead agency
to reduce these impacts.
“EU” (Environmentally Unsatisfactory)
The EPA review has identified adverse environmental impacts that are of sufficient magnitude that they are unsatisfactory from
the standpoint of public health or welfare or environmental quality. EPA intends to work with the lead agency to reduce these
impacts. If the potentially unsatisfactory impacts are not corrected at the fmal EIS stage, this proposal will be recommended
for referral to the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ).
ADEOUACY OF THE IMPACT STATEMENT
“Category 1” (Adequate)
EPA believes the draft EIS adequately sets forth the environmental impact(s) of the preferred alternative and those of the
alternatives reasonably available to the project or action. No further analysis or data collection is necessary, but the reviewer may
suggest the addition of clarifying language or information.

“Category 3” (Inadequate)
EPA does not believe that the draft EIS adequately assesses potentially significant environmental impacts of the action, or the EPA
reviewer has identified new, reasonably available alternatives that are outside of the spectrum of alternatives analysed in the draft
EIS, which should be analysed in order to reduce the potentially significant environmental impacts. EPA believes that the identified
additional information, data, analyses, or discussions are of such a magnitude that they should have full public review at a draft
stage. EPA does not believe that the draft EIS is adequate for the purposes ofthe NEPA and/or Section 309 review, and thus should
be formally revised and made available for public comment in a supplemental or revised draft EIS. On the basis of the potential
significant impacts involved, this proposal could he a candidate for referral to the CEQ.

U.S. EPA DETAILED COMMENTS ON THE DELTA ISLANDS AND LEVEES FEASIBiLITY STUDY,
CALIFORNIA, DRAFT FEASIBILITY REPORT AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT, CONTRA
COSTA AND SACRAMENTO COUNTIES, CA,JUNE 2,2014

Reuse of Dredaed Material
The ecosystem restoration alternatives in the DEIS include using dredged material-to achieve subsidence
reversal in flooded islands. The largest source of the dredged material proposed for use in the
Tentatively Selected Plan (Alternative 6) would come from Operations and Maintenance dredging from
the Stockton Deep Water Ship Channel. According to the DEIS, there would be zero cost of this source
material for the project, as it involves direct pumping from the SDWSC into Big Break.

-

While the cost of reusing existing dredged material would increase the cost per habitat acre, reusing
dredged material is a shared goal of USACE and EPA’ and would be consistent with the project’s
ecosystemrestoration objective. Ongoing USACE projects generate the vast majority of dredged
material in the Delta, and past USACE dredging accounts for most of the stockpiles of previouslydredged material around the Delta. This project represents an opportunity to access and reuse stockpiled
dredged material. Incorporation of reuse as an explicit project goal or objective may alter the evaluation
of project alternatives. For example, restoration of Frank’s Tract 2, which was included as part of
Alternative 9, would reuse over 2 million cubic yards of dredged material stockpiled at Roberts Island
(“Roberts 1”) to restore nearly 120 acres of tidal marshland. Alternative 9 was rejected from further
consideration due to the cost per acre analysis; however, its potential to further EPA’s and the Corps’
beneficial reuse goal does not appear to have been considered in the analysis.
-

Recommendations: Explicitly incorporate “reuse of dredged material generated andJor
stockpiled in the Delta, to the maximum extent practicable” into the project objectives in the
FEIS. Evaluate project alternatives against this objective, considering different combinations of
restoration sites and sediment sources that may provide increased restoration acreage at stillreasonable costs.
•Compute the incremental and total costs of using Roberts 1 material for restoration at Frank’s
Tract 2 and consider including this restoration element in the final alternative selection.
Rank and evaluate each of the alternatives carried forward, according to the volume of dredged
material reuse each could achieve.
Water Quality
The DEIS repeatedly references previous restoration projects using dredged material at Donlon Island
and Venice Cut and relies on the apparent success of those efforts to evaluate the potential impacts of
the proposed project. The DEIS states that studies of those restorations, and subsequent studies, have
been translated into design guidelines (p. 8) that would be used in the proposed project. These guidelines
are not included in the DEIS, nor are they provided as a link or addendum.

The DEIS lists a number of studies that would be undertaken as part of the design development for the
project during the Preconstruction Engineering and Design phase (pages ES 5, 245), including: a
geotechnical analysis of underlying substrates; hydraulic modeling for project design; and investigation
of installation of sacrificial hay bales for erosion protection. It is unclear whether these studies could
necessitate changes to the design that would change projected impacts of the project, particularly
impacts to water quality.
EPA is further concerned that the proposed process for restoration of degraded tidal marsh habitat in the
Delta could inadvertently impact water quality of the surrounding area, both inside and outside of the
levees at Big Break and Little Franks Tract. While many of these impacts are analyzed in the DEIS,
EPA continues to have questions about the possibility of dredged material placement on top of peat soils
inadvertently contributing to the existing subsidence problem. In such a case, the integrity of the already
“very degraded” levees could be compromised leading to impacts to the larger Delta hydrodynamic
system. It is unclear whether these impacts would be analyzed during the Preconstruction Engineering
and Design phase of the project, whether they may be accounted for in the design guidelines developed
from previous restoration projects, or whether they would be addressed in the Monitoring and Adaptive
Management Plan.
Without the design guidelines and studies to be conducted during the PED phase, it is unclear how the
project would address all potential water quality impacts that may be identified. It is also unclear
whether further environmental review would be needed after the design phase of the project, should the
design phase uncover additional impacts not currently analyzed.
Recommendations: The FEIS should include:
The design guidelines developed from previous restoration of Donlon Island and Venice
Cut, including success metrics. It should also clearly identify the reports describing
salinity and hydraulic analysis referenced on page 84 and include a commitment to
monitor salinity and relevant hydraulic indicators (e.g. flow) during project
implementation in order to validate the DEIS’ conclusions that the project would not
result in changes to flood control structures.

how their outcomes may influence the project design or cause reevaluation of project
impacts to water quality. EPA specifically encourages further study during PED of
hydrodynamics, tidal prisms, and formation and management of methylmercury. The
FEIS should also provide clarification as to whether or not changes to project design
elements might trigger additional environmental review under NEPA.

with the U.S. Geological Survey’s Water Science Center and their Priority Ecosystems

The “Sacramento/San Joaquin Delta Breached Levee Wetland Study” from the University of Washington shows that the
elevations at Donlon Island and Venice Cut remained constant in the years following restoration while there had been over
30mm of accretion at the surface. The study concluded that this indicates “that while material is accumulating, there are
processes below the surface counterbalancing the accretion and maintaining constant elevation.”

A commitment in the Monitoring and Adaptive Management Plan to identify monitoring
and project adaptions for potential induced subsidence and such subsidence’s impacts to
levee integrity.

The DEIS lists a number of permits and plans to be prepared by the selected project contractor and/or
USACE for water quality mitigation. The contractor would be required to prepare a National Pollution
Discharge Elimination System permit application, prepare and implement a Storm Water Pollution
Prevention Plan, and prepare an in-water work plan. USACE is in the process of working with the
Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board to obtain Section 401 Certification for the project,
which will include requirements for testing and monitoring. USACE will also coordinate with the
Central Valley RWQCB to determine whether additional testing of the dredged source material would
be required prior to placement. The DEIS indicates that these plans are expected to reduce water quality
impacts to less than significant.
Recommendation: The FEIS should include drafts of the NPDES permit application, the SWPPP
and in-water work plan, and a commitment to implement plans at least as protective as the drafts.
It should also include the Section 401 Certification from the Central Valley RWQCB.
Air Quality
The DEIS provides an air quality analysis of the construction impacts of the project, which would occur
over five years. Pollutants of concern are identified as ozone and particulate matter. The proposed
mitigation measures for impacts to air quality are extensive and contain EPA’s commonly recommended
best practices for limited idling, equipment maintenance and modernization, emission control devices,
and fugitive dust control plans. According to the DEIS, the proposed measures are expected to reduce air
quality impacts including those for ozone precursors and particulate matter to less than significant
and prevent exceedance of local air quality thresholds and the Federal de minimis thresholds.

Recommendation: The FEIS should include the general conformity assessment for ozone and

The analysis for Alternatives 2 and 6 (the action alternatives) both specify “12 employee trips per day,
20 miles each way.” Later analysis of growth-inducing impacts suggests that Alternative 6 would create
20 jobs locally (page 216). It is unclear if the analysis for Alternative 6’appropriately accounts for all
expected employee trips.

Recommendation: The FEIS should clarify the number of employee trips per day associated
with each of the action alternatives and adjust the air quality impact analysis accordingly.
The No Action Alternative air quality analysis does not discuss the impacts to air quality of the
earthwork required for existing dredged material placement from the Operations and Maintenance
dredging of the Stockton Deep Water Ship Channel. These air impacts are used later in the analysis for
Alternatives 2 and 6 to demonstrate reduced air impacts from avoidance of that earthwork.
Recommendation: The FEIS should account for the air quality impacts of O&M activities in the
No Action Alternative to provide a foundation for the air quality benefits realized in the action
alternatives.
The air quality mitigation section states that construction equipment powered by electricity eliminates
criteria pollutant emissions from diesel combustion (page 204); however, it does not state that use of
such equipment would be encouraged or required.
Recommendation: Include, in the FEIS, either a commitment to require contractors to use
available electrical construction equipment technology to the extent possible, or a commitment to
give preference to contractor proposals that would use such technology.
Climate Change
The DEIS includes a climate change impact analysis for greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with
federal and state policies and regulations. The GHG emissions from the project are not expected to be
significant, but USACE would implement mitigation measures to reduce the cumulative impacts from
the project. It states that the selected contractor would be “encouraged to implement” additional GHG
mitigation measures (page 207) where practical, but it would not require most measures.
Recommendation: During the contractor selection process, prioritize contractors whose
proposals include the identified voluntary GHG mitigation measures.
The DEIS also considers the risk of sea level rise for constniction of the project and states that the “life
cycle of the intertidal marsh vegetation is expected to be more than sufficient to accrue organic material
and increase land elevation, naturally compensating for changes in sea level.” (page 242)
In light of the President’s November 1, 2013 Executive Order 13653 “Preparing the United States for
the Impacts of Climate Change,” there is an opportunity for the Delta Islands and Levees project to
explicitly illustrate and maximize the climate-resilient benefits of ecosystem restoration and intertidal
marshes. Currently the DEIS addresses this resiliency in terms of the restored ecosystem itself, but not
its potential impact on the surrounding areas.
Recommendations: Reference Executive Order 13653 in the discussion of the regulatory
environment. The FE1S should also include a discussion about the impacts of each alternative on
climate change resiliency of the surrounding area, and consider those impacts in the fmal
alternative selection.

DELTA ISLANDS AND LEVEES FEASIBILITY STUDY
SCOPING REPORT
Introduction
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) initiated the Delta Islands and Levees
Feasibility Study at the request of the California Department of Water Resources (DWR), the
non-Federal sponsor for the study. USACE is the lead agency in the Feasibility Study, with
USACE taking the lead under the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA).
Numerous agencies, organizations, and individuals participated in the study including the
California Department of Water Resources (DWR), U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA Fisheries), U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, California Department of Fish and Wildlife, Sacramento
County, San Joaquin County, Contra Costa County, Yolo County, Alameda County, Solano
County, numerous levee maintaining agencies, local landowners and residents.
Delta Islands and Levees Feasibility Study
The feasibility report will present details on the USACE and non-Federal sponsor
(California Department of Water Resources) participation needed to implement the selected plan.
The report will conclude with a recommendation for Congressional authorization of a project, if
justified. It is anticipated that the planning efforts will result in an integrated planning document
discussing plan formulation and an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) which analyzes the
alternatives. The EIS would be prepared in accordance with the National Environmental Policy
Act (NEPA).
Notice of Intent/Preparation
In compliance with the requirements set forth in NEPA, USACE prepared a Notice of
Intent (NOI) describing its intent to prepare an EIS, the possible alternatives, and relevant
scoping meeting and contact information. The NOI was posted in the Federal Register, the
United States Government’s official noticing and reporting publication, on January 31 2013
(Federal Register, Vol. 78, No. 921). The official comment period for the NOI was January 31
2013 to March 15, 2013.
Mailings
USACE developed a postcard which was sent to interested stakeholders and agency
contacts. Additionally a previously developed mailing list of interested stakeholders and agency
contacts was sent by email notification encouraging attendance at the scoping meetings.

Notifications
Notices briefly introducing the lead agencies, the proposed projects and associated
environmental review processes, and the scoping meetings were placed in the Sacramento Bee

SR1-1

and Lodi News newspapers on February 6, 2013. Newsprint releases were published to reach a
local and regional public audience that residents routinely rely upon to keep them abreast of local
issues. A media release was also emailed out to a number media contacts within the region on
February 6, 2013. Attachment A contains copies of the following:

Public Meetings
In February 2013, two scoping meetings were held for the project study. The meetings
were held to educate the public about the study efforts and to garner input on the proposed scope,
in accordance with NEPA. Refer to Table 1-1 for the USACE planning and NEPA process.
The meetings were held at two different times over the course of two days. On February
19, 2013, the first meeting was conducted from 5:00 to 7:00 p.m. at the Old Sugar Mill in
Clarksburg. The second meeting was conducted on February 19, 2013 from 2:00 to 4:00 p.m. at
the Sheraton Grand Hotel in Sacramento.
The meeting locations were chosen because they are central to the region. The meeting
times were chosen to accommodate both the workday schedules of public agency representatives
and the general public, including residents and business owners.
The meetings were open-house style workshops in which attendees could read and view
the information about the two projects and interact with project staff, including representatives of
USACE and the California Department of Water Resources (DWR). The views expressed in the
scoping meeting are summarized as follows:
USACE staff was stationed at display boards to interact with public attendees and
provide additional detail or answer any questions. A Power Point presentation was on-going to
provide a brief introduction to the including objectives, schedule, environmental compliance, and
related flood control work in the region. A fact sheet, providing an overview of the Delta Islands
and Levees Feasibility Study including purpose and goals, maps of the corresponding study
areas, an overview of the environmental compliance process and timeline, was also made
available. Comment cards were prepared so that meeting attendees could provide feedback on
the projects. These cards could be filled out during the meeting and given to a project team
member. Attachment B contains copies of the following:

Corps to discuss Delta Islands and Levees Feasibility Study at public meetings
SACRAMENTO, Calif. – The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Sacramento District is set to host two public meetings
this month on its ongoing Delta Islands and Levees Feasibility Study, a cost-shared study with the state of California
to address critical water resources issues in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta.
The public meetings, scheduled for Feb. 19 at the Old Sugar Mill in Clarksburg and Feb. 20 at the Sheraton Grand
Hotel in Sacramento, are intended to provide a public forum to explain the Corps’ feasibility study process and what
the Delta Islands and Levees Feasibility Study aims to achieve.
The Delta Islands and Levees Feasibility Study will inform the Corps’ and state of California’s efforts to address a
variety of critical issues in the Delta, including flood risk management, ecosystem restoration, water quality, water
supply conveyance, emergency flood water storage and, emergency response.
The draft environmental impact statement outlining the potential impacts of proposed solutions is scheduled to be
available for public review and comment in 2014. The array of potential measures and program alternatives will be
determined based on information received during the scoping process and other associated studies.
In addition to providing comments at the public scoping meetings, written comments can be submitted by mail to
1325 J Street, Sacramento, CA, 95814 or by e-mail to spk-pao@usace.army.mil. Additional public comment periods
and public meetings will be conducted throughout the course of the study as part of the environmental impact
statement development process.
The Corps and its local partner, California Department of Water Resources, plan to attend local government, state
agency and other Delta-related meetings through the year to engage affected stakeholders and keep the public
apprised of progress on the study.

STUDY OVERVIEW
Delta Islands & Levees Feasibility Study
Study Focus

Flood Risk Management and Ecosystem Restoration (not water supply)

Study Area

The Sacramento – San Joaquin Delta
is a web of channels and reclaimed
islands, covering about 738,000 acres,
at the confluence of five rivers protected
by a network of 1,100-plus miles of
levees constructed over the last 150
years.
Home to hundreds of species of fish,
birds, mammals and reptiles, the Delta
is part of the largest estuary on the west
coast, and was named an Ecosystem of
National Significance by the Environmental Protection
and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act in 2011.
The Delta is also the largest single source of
California’s water supply, providing 25 million
Californians with drinking water, and irrigating millions
of acres of farmland in the Central Valley. With nearly
three-fourths of the Delta producing agriculture, it
directly impacts not only the livelihood of the more
than 500,000 people who live within the Delta, but the
entire U.S as the Delta contributes billions of dollars in
production to the nation annually.

BUILDING STRONG®

STUDY OVERVIEW
Delta Islands & Levees Feasibility Study
Ecological

There are a number of factors contributing to
the ecological decline of Delta species and
habitats, each of which has the capability
to produce adverse impacts independently
and/or in combination with each other.
Identified contributors of adverse impacts to
the ecological health of the Delta ecosystem
include:
• pesticides
• channelization
• exotic and non-native invasive species
• water supply diversions
• agricultural and urban runoff
• wastewater discharges
Specifically, channelization of rivers and
streams through the construction of levees
has resulted in the widespread loss of tidal
marsh, shaded riverine aquatic habitat,
and the disconnection of floodplains from
waterways.
If this loss of Delta habitats and
disconnection from floodplains continues,
the current substantial declines in the Delta’s
fisheries could result in the extinction of
culturally and economically critical species.
Many of the defining characteristics of
the pre-channelized ecosystem (spatial
extent, habitat heterogeneity, and dynamic
storage) have either been lost
or substantially altered as a
result of land use and water
management practices during
the past 100 years in California.
Nearly 95 percent of the historic
wetland habitat in the Delta has
been converted to agricultural
and urban uses.

Flood Risk

Delta levees protect critical
infrastructure such as:
• state highways
• rail lines
• natural gas fields
• gas and fuel pipelines
• drinking water pipelines
• businesses
• towns
While portions of Sacramento and
Stockton are located within the
Delta, most of its inhabitants are
located amongst six Delta islands.
As a result, the Delta Islands &
Levees Feasibility Study is closely
coordinating with Sacramento and
Stockton-related flood risk reduction
studies to ensure assumptions,
scopes, and alternative plans are
compatible.
Problems associated with inDelta flood risk are largely due to
the potential for levee failure and
overtopping during flood events.
These risks are increased as a result
of climate change, sea level change,
subsidence (as much as 25 feet
below sea level) and seismic risk.

Flood Risk Management
Water Supply, Reliability, and Environmental Improvements Act (Public Law (PL) 108-361), Section 103
(f) (3); as amended by the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) 2007 (PL 110-114), Section
3015; and the Energy and Water Appropriations Act of 2010.
The study area is located in Sacramento, San Joaquin, Solano, Contra Costa, Alameda, and Yolo
counties, California and extends from Sacramento south to the cities of Stockton and Tracy, and west
to and including Suisun Bay. The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta consists of about 740,000 acres of
land segregated into some 80 tracts and islands and 1,100 miles of levees. Title I of PL 108-361, the
CALFED Bay Delta Authorization Act of 2004 (CALFED Act), provided for Corps participation in the
CALFED Program by authorizing the Secretary of the Army to undertake the construction and implementation of levee stability programs or projects for such purposes as flood control, ecosystem restoration, water supply, water conveyance, and water quality as described in the 2000 Record of Decision for the Programmatic Environmental Impact Study/Report on the CALFED Bay-Delta Program.
The primary purpose of levee improvement projects is flood risk management, although it is recognized that incidental benefits for other purposes may accrue as a result of levee improvements in the
Delta.

FEDERAL INTEREST Delta levees protect 500,000 inhabitants, the water supply of 25,000,000 Californians, several Federal
navigation/transportation projects, and a $28B agricultural industry (10% of the nation’s output). The
Delta is home to over 750 plant and animal species including over 35 species listed under the Endangered Species Act.

PARTNERSHIP FUNDING

Up to $100,000 is available at full Federal expense to initiate Feasibility Phase activities, including preparing a Preliminary Draft Project Implementation Report (PDPIR), a Project Management Plan (PMP),
and to negotiate the Feasibility Cost Share Agreement (FCSA) for each project that proceeds
through the program. The cost share between the Corps and a non-Federal sponsor for Feasibility
Phase activities in the LSP beyond the initial $100k is 50/50. The cost share for design and construction
is 65% Corps/35% non-federal sponsor.

FY 10 ACTIVITIES

The Bethel Island Municipal Improvement District was the first non-Federal sponsor to sign a Feasibility
Cost Share Agreement (FCSA) with the Corps on 13 July 2010 for the Bethel Island-Horseshoe Bend
Project. The Corps team completed draft Project Management Plans (PMPs) for four additional
Levee Stability Program projects, including McCormack-Williamson Tract, Bacon Island, WalnutGrove, and River Junction, and began development of a PMP and FCSA for Brannan-Andrus Levee
Maintenance District. A Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) was signed between USACE and DWR,
allowing the Corps-DWR to initiate Phase 1 of GIS Flood Contingency Mapping and Emergency Response Planning for the Delta region. The team met with Delta counties in August 2010 to get input on
concepts for the GIS products, response report, and related data.

FY 11 ACTIVITIES

The Bethel Island-Horseshoe Bend Project Feasibility Phase Study is currently underway; a completed
PIR and initiation of a Project Partnership Agreement is anticipated in FY13. The McCormackWilliamson Tract PMP and FCSA are currently at the Corps’ Headquarters office for approval; the PIR
is anticipated to be under development in FY12. Phase 1 of GIS Flood Contingency Mapping and
Emergency Response Planning final product was completed in September 2011 and includes: standardized GIS database of Emergency Management Data; Flood Contingency Map Books and large
scale wall maps of the Delta region; and an accompanying report documenting the existing framework, existing data, and any potential data gaps.

Report 108-357 dated 7 Nov 2003 of the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act
(EWDAA), 2004
The study area is located in Sacramento, San Joaquin, Solano, Contra Costa, Alameda, and Yolo
counties, California and extends from Sacramento south to the cities of Stockton and Tracy, and west
to and including Suisun Bay. The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta consists of about 740,000 acres of
land segregated into some 80 tracts and islands and 1,100 miles of levees.
The Delta Islands and Levees Feasibility Study (Delta Study) is the Corps’ mechanism to participate in
a cost-shared solution to address ecosystem restoration, flood risk management, and related water
resources in the Delta and Suisun Marsh area. A Feasibility Cost Share Agreement (FCSA) was executed on May 26, 2006 with the DWR, the non-Federal sponsor. The Corps-DWR study team meets
regularly to move the study forward and holds periodic Agency Coordination Meetings with associated Federal, State, and local agencies. The study will culminate in a feasibility report that will make
recommendations on construction projects and/or additional studies for authorization by Congress.

FEDERAL INTEREST

The CA Bay-Delta Ecosystem of National Significance is home to over 750 plant and animal species
including over 35 species listed under the Endangered Species Act. Delta levees protect 500,000
inhabitants and protect the water supply of 25,000,000 Californians and a $28B agriculture industry
(10% of the nation’s output). This study will develop the long-term strategy for Corps projects in the
Delta region. The study will assess existing and future flood risks in the Delta, as well as opportunities
for ecosystem restoration, and develop a comprehensive roadmap for Corps involvement in a wide
range of water resources needs.

Background

The Sacramento – San Joaquin Delta (Figure 1) is part of the largest estuary on the west coast of the
United States; is home to hundreds of species of fish, birds, mammals and reptiles; and has been named
an Ecosystem of National Significance through the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity
Conservation (EPBC) Act in 2011. Agricultural land irrigated by Delta water contributes billions of dollars
in production for the nation. Two deep water ports serve as economic engines for the Central Valley,
Northern California, and the western States and are reliant on Delta waters and Federal Deep Draft
Navigation Channels and levees for navigation. Delta levees protect such critical infrastructure as state
and interstate highways, National rail lines, natural gas fields, gas and fuel pipelines, water conveyance,
drinking water pipelines, and numerous businesses and towns.
The Delta is a web of channels and reclaimed islands at the confluence of the Sacramento, San Joaquin,
Cosumnes, Mokelumne, and Calaveras Rivers. Forty percent of California’s land area is contained within
the watersheds of these rivers. The Delta, which covers about 738,000 acres, interlaced with hundreds
of miles of waterways, is legally defined by Section 12220 of California Water Code (CWC). Much of the
land is below sea level and protected by a network of 1,100 miles of levees which have been
constructed over the past 150 years to manage the flow of water through the Delta. The land behind
the levees is predominantly agricultural (corn, wheat, vineyards, cattle) and waterways provide
recreational outlets for nearby urban areas and essential habitat for fish and wildlife. The Delta is also
the largest single source of California’s water supply, providing 25 million Californians with drinking
water and irrigating millions of acres of farmland in the Central Valley. In addition, more than 500,000
people live within the Delta and rely upon it for water, recreation, and livelihood. The majority of that
population is in the greater Sacramento and Stockton areas and is the focus of other Corps FRM studies,
though there are communities within the Delta. Several historic towns, known as “legacy communities,”
remain within the Delta, some of which are listed in the national registry of historic places.
Historically, the Delta was defined by tidal wetlands, primarily comprised of peat soils. The Swamp and
Overflow Land Act of 1850 transferred ownership of all swamp and overflow land, including Delta
marshes, from the federal government to the State. This Act began the reclamation of wetlands in the
Delta through the construction of levees and drainage channels, typically by the new land owners. The
majority of levees in the Delta are still privately owned and maintained. Nearly three fourths of the
Delta is now in agriculture.

Economic Analysis

The economic analysis was conducted in two phases: 1) screening phase and 2) analysis phase. In the
screening phase, information contained in the Delta Risk Management Study (DRMS) was used to help
determine which Delta Islands that have a high likelihood of meeting the study’s FRM objectives. Based
on the screening criteria described in the next section, the four Delta Islands which have the highest
likelihood of meeting the objectives were analyzed in more detail in the analysis phase.
2.1

Screening Phase

All of the information used to conduct the screening phase of this economic analysis was obtained from
various components of the DRMS. DRMS was developed by the California Department of Water
Resources (DWR) and completed in two phases; Phase 1 assessed the performance of Delta and Suisun
Marsh levees and evaluated the economic, environmental, and public health and safety consequences
of levee failures to California as a whole; Phase 2 developed and evaluated risk reduction strategies.
The use of DRMS information was chosen because it is the only recent comprehensive analysis on the
local and statewide consequences of Delta levee failures. The screening criteria used to help refine
Delta Islands Feasibility FRM measures for the screening phase include the following three components:
1. the ratio of total inundation repair costs to upgraded levee costs
2. life safety risk
3. significance of statewide importance
1. Ratio of Total Inundation Repair Costs to Upgraded Levee Costs
To calculate the ratio of total inundation repair costs to upgraded levee costs, information was
taken from both phases of the DRMS. The total inundation repair costs values are from the
DRMS Phase 1 Impact to Infrastructure Technical Memorandum (IITM); these costs represent
the repair cost for each asset on a particular Delta island, based on inundation depths, the
percent damage incurred, and the original value of the asset. The assets considered in the IITM
include: a) points assets: structures and buildings (and their contents), bridges, marinas, natural
gas fields/storage areas, natural gas wells, commercial and industrial buildings, residences, and
pump stations and b) linear assets: railroads, highways, shipping channels, transmission lines,
aqueducts, and gas and petroleum pipelines. Since inundation repair costs are similar to the
Corps concept of damages it was determined to be an appropriate numerator value for a
screening criterion ratio. The upgraded levee costs were taken from DRMS Phase II report
Upgraded Delta Levees (Section 4); these costs consist of upgrading non‐project Delta Levees to
PL 84‐99 or Urban Project Levee (UPL) standards. In DRMS, levees protecting urban centers
were selected for UPL upgrades and PL 84‐99 upgrades for all other areas. The higher the
relative ratio of total inundation repair costs to upgraded levee costs for a particular Delta island
the higher the rating for this criterion.

Economics Appendix ‐ Delta Islands
2. Life Safety Risk
Life safety risk is based entirely on Delta island population data obtained from the DRMS
Economic Consequences Technical Memorandum (ECTM). Delta islands that have higher
populations were considered to have a greater potential for life safely issues and thus a higher
rating for this criterion.
3. Significance of Statewide Importance
A measure’s significance of statewide importance was determined qualitatively by using the
findings contained in contained in the ECTM. If a Delta island contained an asset that would
impact the region or state during and after a flood event, then that island was rated with a
“Yes”, otherwise the island was rated with a “NO.” The categories of statewide significance
include: deepwater ship channels, electric transmission lines, highways, natural gas
transmission, Mokelumne Aqueduct, oil and gas wells, railroads, wastewater facilities, eight
western islands, and legacy communities.
For criteria 1 and 2, each Delta island was assigned a rating of high, medium, or low. For criterion 3,
each island was given a rating of Yes or No. The location measures that were assigned a “high” rating
are generally populated areas with relatively higher economic values and therefore are likely to be
included in the final array of measures as a more comprehensive, whole island levee improvement. The
measures that were assigned a “medium” rating are generally somewhat populated with more limited
economic values and therefore are likely to be included in the final array of measures as a more limited
structural or non‐structural solution. The measures that were assigned a “low” rating are sparsely
populated areas with limited to no infrastructure/economic value and were therefore dropped from
further considerations. This qualitative assessment was based on existing data from the DRMS and is
summarized below in Table 1 and Figure 2. The green, yellow, and red areas in Figure 2 represent
islands that were assigned a high, medium, and low ranking respectively.

2.2

Analysis Phase

The three Delta Islands with the highest ratio of total asset repair costs to total construction costs (from
DRMS data) and not included in a current Corps study were considered for further screening level
benefit‐cost analysis; the three islands include: Bethel Island, Walnut Grove, the City of Isleton (on
Brannon‐Andrus Island). Based on suggestions from the local sponsor and its high population, a fourth
island, Discovery Bay, was also considered for further analysis; these islands are highlighted in Figure 3.
The main analytical tool used to perform the economic analysis in the analysis phase was the Hydrologic
Engineering Center’s Flood Damage Analysis (HEC‐FDA) software (version 1.2.5). This program uses
engineering data (hydrologic, hydraulic, and geotechnical) and economic data (structure/content
inventory and depth‐percent damage curves) to model flooding risk management problems and
potential solutions in the study area. Through integration of the engineering and economic
relationships HEC‐FDA computes expected annual damages (EAD) and performance statistics. EAD is the
metric used to describe the consequences of flooding on an annual basis considering a full range of
flood events – from high frequency/small events to low frequency/large events over a long time horizon.
The following two sections describe the economic and engineering data that was used the HEC‐FDA
analysis.
2.2.1
2.2.1.1

Economic Data
Structure and Contents Inventory and Valuation

Structure values were based on overall average values that were developed for the Lower San Joaquin
River Feasibility Study (LSJRFS). Each residential structure’s value was assumed to be equal to the
average LSJRFS residential structure value. Residential content value was assumed to be equal to 50
percent of the structure value. Non‐residential structure values were estimated by multiplying the
Marshall and Swift calculator valuation per square foot value by the average LSJRFS non‐residential
structure square footage value for each business classification. Non‐residential content values were
taken from an expert elicitation that was performed to develop content values and content depth‐
percent damage curves for specific occupancy types for the 2008 American River Watershed, Folsom
Dam Raise and Modification Economic Reevaluation Report (ERR). Although the values and curves were
developed specifically for structures in the American River Watershed study area, the results of the
expert elicitation were extended to the Delta study area in light of its proximity to Sacramento and the
similarity of its structure types/construction types to those in Sacramento.
The number of structures for the study area was determined by Sacramento (Walnut Grove, Isleton) and
Contra Costa (Bethel Island, Discovery Bay) county level GIS parcel data. Structure type (e.g.,
commercial, industrial, public and residential) was determined by GIS attribute codes and cursory checks
using Google Earth. Automobiles were also included in the analysis and it was assumed one automobile
would be subjected to flooding per residential structure; automobile values were determined for
average used cars ($7,988) based on information from the U.S. Department of Transportation, Bureau of
Transportation.

2.2.1.2

Depth‐Percent Damage Curves

The depth of flooding is the primary factor in determining potential damages to structures, contents,
and automobiles. Depth‐percent damage functions were used in the HEC‐FDA models to estimate the
percent of value lost for these categories. Residential depth‐damage curves (structures and contents)
were taken from Economic Guidance Memorandum (EGM) 01‐03, Generic Depth‐Damage Relationships,
Non‐residential structure curves were based on revised Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) Flood Insurance Administration (FIA) curves. Non‐residential content depth‐percent damage
curves for were taken from expert elicitation that were completed for previously mentioned American
River studies. The depth‐percent damage functions for automobiles were based on averages from
curves developed by the Institute for Water Resources (IWR) and provided in EGM 09‐04, Generic
Depth‐Damage Relationships for Vehicles.

2.2.1.3

Economic Uncertainty

In HEC‐FDA, there are three areas of economic uncertainty that were considered for this study;
valuation (structure and contents), depth damage curves (structure and contents), and foundation
height. Values for structure valuation uncertainty were taken the 2012 Napa LRR Economic Appendix;
content value uncertainties were based on data from expert elicitation from the previously mentioned
American River Study. Residential structure and content depth‐percent damage curves are normally
distributed and uncertainty is measured as standard deviations of percent damages. Non‐residential
structure and content depth‐percent damage curves are triangularly distributed and include a minimum,
most likely, and maximum percent damage by depth of flooding. The uncertainty value for residential
foundation height was assumed to be 0.5 feet; which is typical for SPK studies.

2.2.2

2.2.2.1

Engineering Data

Hydrologic and Hydraulic Analysis

The hydrologic and hydraulic data that was input into HEC‐FDA include: floodplain data, stage‐
probability relationships, and period of record length (a hydrologic uncertainty measure). Floodplain
data includes depths of flooding associated with the 50%, 20%, 10%, 4%, 2%, 1%, 0.5%, and 0.2% annual
chance exceedance (ACE) events; the floodplain data along with stage‐probability curves were provided
by SPK’s Hydraulic Analysis Section. The data used for stage, frequency, and uncertainty event analysis
originated from the 1992 Hydrology Office Report of the Sacramento‐San Joaquin Delta Special Study by
the Sacramento District (1992 Office Report). The 1992 Office Report was selected as the source for the
hydraulic data and determined to be sufficient for this analysis as it is contains the most recent
comprehensive hydrologic and hydraulic analysis of the Delta. To model the consequences of a flood
event a simplified inundation model for analysis in the form of a constant water surface elevation, or
stage, across the entire island was assumed. The stage values were taken from the 1992 Office Report.
Table 2 shows the 1992 Office Report chart that was applied to each of the four islands along with the
15

Economics Appendix ‐ Delta Islands
corresponding stage for each ACE. The uncertainty associated with the data will be evaluated using the
appropriate period of record which is also listed the Table 2. See Appendix C‐ Engineering (Flood Risk
Management) for a more detailed analysis and discussion on Delta: risk, hydrology and hydraulics.

Geotechnical Analysis

Levee fragility curve data was provided by SPK’s Geotechnical Branch; a levee fragility curve shows the
probabilities of failure at different water surface elevations against a levee. Fragility curves are a main
component of the economic modeling and in determining the economic damages of flood events. For
this analysis, fragility curves were developed for Bethel Island, Walnut Grove and Isleton using
information contained in the DRMS Levee Vulnerability Technical Memorandum. Please see Appendix
C‐ Engineering (Flood Risk Management) for additional geotechnical information.

Benefit Cost Analysis

Values listed in this section are based on an October 2012 price level. Annualized benefits and costs
were computed using a 50‐year period of analysis and a federal water resource discount rate of 3.750%
as this was the current rate during the development of the flood risk management (FRM) and
multipurpose economic analysis.
2.3.1

Without Project Analysis

The future without project condition assumed that the capital features of DWR’s Bay Delta Conservation
Plan (BDCP) will be in place. Solutions under consideration by the BDCP include a dual water
conveyance system, which would create options that would move water through the Delta’s interior or
around the Delta through an isolated conveyance facility (tunnel). As such, any potential flood damages
to existing Delta water conveyance features are not included in the without project analysis as the BDCP
conveyance features will provide a means to convey water through or around the Delta. In addition,
there are no structural FRM measures to protect existing Delta water conveyance features considered in
the with‐project analysis. See the Main Report for a more detailed discussion regarding the future
without project condition.
Structure counts for the four main building categories are listed by island in Table 3a, and represent
those structures falling within the 500‐year floodplain. Without project EAD by major damage area and
population at risk (2010 census) are reported in Tables 3b and 4 respectively.

Annual Exceedance Probability

Annual exceedance probability (AEP) is a statistic used to describe the chance of flooding in any given
year within a designated area. AEP is computed in HEC‐FDA using engineering data; AEPs for the four
islands are reported in Table 5a.

Assurance

Assurance, describes the likelihood of a stream/river being able to pass a specific flow event, for
example the 100‐year flow. The assurance statistics provide relevant information to decision makers in
that it helps describe both how well the flood system currently performs and how well the system could
potentially perform under various with‐project scenarios.
The assurance statistics for each island under the without‐project condition are listed in Table 5b.
Taking Bethel Island for example, the information indicates there is a 66% chance of passing the 10%
flow event and 60% chance of passing the 1% flow event.

With Project Analysis

For this screening level analysis, there were no floodplains or other engineering data developed for
with‐project conditions. To develop estimates for with‐project damages, two scenarios were
considered; 1) Zero with‐project damages (or best case scenario), the Corps project would yield no
residual damages, and 2) 25 percent remaining damages (or a typical case scenario); the Corps project
would eliminate 75 percent of without‐project damages. The zero with‐project damages scenario is the
highest level of flood risk management (FRM) performance any Corps project could expect to yield;
whereas, the 25 percent remaining with‐project damages are more in line with the FRM performance of
a typical Corps project. The with‐project EADs for both scenarios are reported in Tables 6 and 7.

FRM Costs

Cost estimates for each island and measure were provided by the SPK’s Cost Engineering Section. Total
and annual FRM construction costs are shown in Table 10. All costs are annualized based on the fiscal
year 2013 federal water resource discount rate of 3.75 percent. The costs reported in Table 10 do not
include interest during construction. See Appendix E ‐ Cost Engineering for additional measure
descriptions and cost information.

net benefits and BCRs for each island and alternative under both with‐project scenarios are shown in
Table 11. All island alternatives have negative net benefit; also, there is no island alternative that has a
BCR above unity; the highest valued BCR is 0.76 for the Isleton Alternative A under the Zero Percent

As there was no overlap in the geographic footprints of the ER and FRM measures, opportunities do not
exist to simply combine measures into multi‐purpose measures. However, opportunities may exist to
incorporate smaller scale ER measures in some of the higher ranking FRM areas. Of the highest ranking
FRM areas, the two best candidates for multi‐purpose measures were found to be Bethel Island and
Walnut Grove. The opportunity to include ecosystem restoration into these FRM areas was largely
based on land use; portions of the island were used solely for agriculture and could contribute to ER
objectives if reconnected to the waterways. In order to determine if it was warranted to further pursue
these measures, an economic analysis was first completed on the FRM elements, as described below.
3.1

Multipurpose Economic Analysis

There were two multipurpose measures considered for further screening level analysis: 1) Bethel Island
Measure A (see Figure 3) and 2) Walnut Grove Measure B (see Figure 4). Both of these measures would
restore sustainable ecosystem functions in the Delta while improving FRM for developed areas. A
benefit‐cost analysis was performed to determine if a multipurpose measure could be economically
feasible based on FRM specific benefits and FRM separable costs. If a multipurpose measure’s FRM
benefits are less than the FRM separable costs, then that multipurpose measure will not be
economically justified regardless of the level ecosystem restoration benefits. Under USACE policy,
ecosystem restoration benefits cannot be used to justify FRM separable costs.
Table 12 contains the FRM separable costs for the two multipurpose measures; the costs in this table
only include FRM separable costs and do not include joint costs. FRM separable costs are the costs that
are required only for the FRM benefits of the measure, whereas joint costs are required for both FRM
and ecosystem restoration benefits. In Figure 3, the FRM separable costs of the Bethel Island Measure A
are the costs to construct levee feature BI_A_2 (orange line) while the joint costs are the costs to
construct setback levee feature BI_A_1 (or green line). In Figure 4, the FRM separable costs of Walnut
Grove Measure B are the costs to construct levee features WG_B_1 (red line), WG_B_3 (orange line) and
WG_B_4 (yellow line), whereas the joint costs are the costs to construct setback levee feature WG_B_2
(blue line).

Multipurpose Objective Net Benefits

The FRM specific net benefits and BCRs of the two multipurpose measures are shown in Table 15. As a
best‐case scenario, the FRM benefits were assumed to be equal to the total without‐project FRM
damages (i.e., a zero percent remaining damages with‐project scenario). The two measures would have
negative net benefits and BCRs below unity even under that best‐case scenario. The highest BCR is 0.62
for Bethel Island Measure A under the zero percent remaining damages with‐project scenario. Since
each multipurpose measure has a FRM negative net benefit, which indicates FRM specific benefits are
less than the FRM separable costs, these multipurpose measures cannot be economically justified as
ecosystem restoration benefits and costs are added.

3.3 Multipurpose Summary
FRM and multipurpose alternatives were found to be economically infeasible, therefore structural FRM
alternatives were not evaluated further. However, there may still be non‐structural measures to reduce
risk within the study area as further described within the main report.

C-1. General
C-1.1. Format and Organization. This document and the associated plates and
attachments comprises the Engineering Appendix to the Delta Islands and Levees
Ecosystem Restoration Final Feasibility Report/Environmental Impact Statement. This
document has been formatted following ER 1110-2-1150 Appendix C - CONTENT OF
ENGINEERING APPENDIX TO FEASIBILITY REPORT. Several sections of ER 11102-1150 Appendix C are not applicable to this Ecosystem Restoration Study and are
thus not addressed, though the headings are still listed; many other sections demand
only brief explanation, non-applicable sub-sections are omitted without comment. The
sections most relevant to this Study are C-2 Hydrology and Hydraulics, C-4
Geotechnical, C-6 Civil Design, C-8. Electrical and Mechanical Requirements, C-10
Construction Procedures and Water Control Plan, and C-19 Cost Engineering; plates
and attachments are contained following a references section at the end of this
Appendix.
C-1.2. Study Area.
C-1.2.1 The Delta. The Delta (Figure C-1-1) is part of the largest estuary on the West
Coast of the United States; is home to hundreds of species of fish, birds, mammals
and reptiles; and is considered an ecosystem of national significance. Agricultural land
irrigated by Delta water contributes billions of dollars in production for the Nation. Two
deep water ports in the Delta serve as important marine terminals for dry bulk cargo
vessels transporting agricultural products through the Delta’s deep draft navigation
channels to world markets. Delta levees protect thousands of acres of orchards, farms,
and vineyards as well as critical infrastructure including state and interstate highways,
major rail lines, natural gas fields, gas and fuel pipelines, water conveyance
infrastructure, drinking water pipelines, and numerous towns, businesses and homes.
The Delta is a web of channels and reclaimed islands at the confluence of the
Sacramento, San Joaquin, Cosumnes, Mokelumne, and Calaveras Rivers. Forty
percent of California’s land area is contained within the watersheds of these rivers.
The Delta covers about 738,000 acres and is interlaced with hundreds of miles of
waterways. Much of the land is below sea level and protected by a network of 1,100
miles of levees which have been constructed over the past 150 years to manage the
flow of water through the Delta. The land behind the levees is predominantly
agricultural (corn, wheat, vineyards, cattle) and waterways provide recreational outlets
for nearby urban areas and essential habitat for fish and wildlife, including federally
listed species under the Endangered Species Act. The Delta is also the largest single
source of California’s water supply, providing 25 million Californians with drinking
water and irrigating millions of acres of farmland in the Central Valley. In addition,
more than 500,000 people live within the Delta and rely upon it for water, recreation,
and livelihood. The majority of that population is in the greater Sacramento and
C-1

Delta Islands and Levees Ecosystem Restoration Feasibility Report Appendix C – Engineering
September 2018

Stockton areas and is the focus of other USACE Flood Risk Management studies,
though there are communities within the Delta. Several Delta towns, known as “legacy
communities,” are listed in the national registry of historic places.

Figure C-1-1. Study Area and Selected Plan Area

Delta Islands and Levees Ecosystem Restoration Feasibility Report Appendix C – Engineering

Historically, the Delta was defined by tidal wetlands, primarily comprised of peat soils.
The Swamp and Overflow Land Act of 1850 transferred ownership of all federally
owned swamp and overflow land, including Delta marshes, from the Federal
Government to private parties agreeing to drain the land and turn it to productive,
presumably agricultural, use. This Act began the reclamation of wetlands in the Delta
through the construction of levees and drainage channels, typically by the new land
owners. The majority of levees in the Delta are still privately owned and maintained.
Nearly three fourths of the Delta is now in agriculture.
C-1.2.2 Restoration Site (“Big Break”). Figure C-1-2 shows the restoration area, the
eastern portion of a submerged Delta island referred to as Big Break and the
neighboring Dutch Slough. A description of how this site was selected can be found in
Chapter 3 of the main report.

Figure C-1-2. Big Break and Dutch Slough
Dredging along Dutch Slough between 1904 and 1910 connected Dutch Slough,
Sandmound Slough, Taylor Slough and Piper Slough. The building of levees along the
southern shore of Dutch Slough is largely undocumented in the available literature, but
inferences can be made. Levees were built along the mouth of Marsh Creek, which
forms the eastern boundary of the Big Break Regional Shoreline, as early as 1859, but
the unleveed land south of Jersey Island was flooded by Marsh Creek in 1876
(Thompson 1957). The1910 Jersey Island USGS 7.5’ topographic map shows levees
along the southern shore of Dutch Slough. Therefore, it can be surmised that they were
constructed between 1876 and 1910, and probably between 1904 and 1910 when
Dutch Slough was being dredged. A clamshell dredge was likely used as they had come
into widespread use during that time.
Agriculture was originally pursued at Big Break, though little is known about crops
grown; however, asparagus is reported to have been grown there (East Bay Regional
Park District 2014). According to a letter report prepared by Ward Hill for the East Bay
Regional Park District, the property known as Big Break flooded in 1921 (Little Break).
The levees broke again in 1928, flooding a 2.5 square mile area, which was never
reclaimed, effectively ending any agricultural pursuits.

Delta Islands and Levees Ecosystem Restoration Feasibility Report Appendix C – Engineering

Howard Lauritzen acquired a 40 acre parcel of remaining uplands and the flooded area
near Oakley in the 1930s through a trade with Pittsburg Steel. During the 1930s and
1940s, Lauritzen used this area to dismantle Navy pontoons and target barges as part
of a scrap metal business. As many as 30 to 40 hulls are still present within the open
water of the park area and along the San Joaquin River shoreline (Hill 2000).
C-1.3. Project Purpose. The goal the Selected Plan is to
1. create emergent marsh habitat through placement of coarse-grained dredged
material and aquatic plantings on placed dredged material mounds,
2. create riparian habitat on the remnant levee north of the eastern portion of Big
Break by eradication of invasive species and plantings,
3. construct 1. and 2. such that there is connectivity between riparian and emergent
marsh habitats, enhancing the function of both habitat types,
4. construct 1. such that low tide access/egress for fish is maintained.
A maximum area of approximately 340 acres of open water habitat would be restored to
intertidal marsh habitat, with approximately 90 acres planted with aquatic vegetation,
and the remaining 250 acres would be shallow water habitat for aquatic fauna species;
33 of the approximately 50 acre remnant levee along the northern edge of Big Break
would be restored.
C-2. Hydrology and Hydraulics.
The study area is within the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta watershed. The
contributing drainage area to the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta encompasses
approximately 40,000 square miles. The main contributors of the drainage area are the
Sacramento River (25,200 square miles), San Joaquin River (13,500 square miles), and
the Mokelumne River (1,200 square miles). Runoff within the study area is highly
influenced by upstream reservoir regulation.
Maximum stages within the Delta result from runoff from storms of different origins
which do not have the same annual exceedance frequency at all locations, and from
tides of varying magnitudes which seldom reach their maximum stages concurrently
with the peak flows. In some years the annual maximum stage at all locations occurs
during the same storm event. However, in other years, the peak stages in the northern
part of the Delta occur during a different time period than those in the southern part of
the Delta and vice versa. The differences are caused by the geographical distribution of
the contributing drainage basin, antecedent conditions such as snowpack and soil
moisture, and the fluctuation of the storm tracks over California. If the flood runoff is
from the Sacramento River basin, the stages will be higher in the northern part of the

C-4

Delta Islands and Levees Ecosystem Restoration Feasibility Report Appendix C – Engineering
September 2018

Delta. If the main flood runoff is from the San Joaquin River, then the stages will be
higher in the southern part of the Delta.

ER 1110-2-8160(4)(d) Ecosystem Restoration and Regulatory Permitting Actions states
that “Ecosystem restoration projects, Civil Works compensatory mitigation projects, or
regulatory permitting activities that are referenced to tidal or non-tidal datums shall be
defined to a current NSRS [National Spatial Reference System], MLLW, or MHW [Mean
High Water] datum, as appropriate to local, state, and federal requirements.” Due to the
availability of National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
bathymetry charts for the Big Break area that are relative to MLLW, MLLW was chosen
for the project datum.
C-2.1.1.2. Big Break Parameter Characterization. Attachment HH-A contains the
analysis for the determination of tidal and NAVD88 datums for Big Break. Table C-2-2
shows the MLLW, MHHW, and Local Mean Sea Level (LMSL) datums at three locations
relative to the NAVD88 geodetic datum; these water levels were obtained using the
NOAA vertical datum software and reflect the average over the 1983 to 2001 tidal
C-5

Delta Islands and Levees Ecosystem Restoration Feasibility Report Appendix C – Engineering

epoch. The water level used for design, for construction initiating in 2022, is estimated
to be 0.02 foot higher than the 1992 midpoint epoch elevation based on historical sea
level rise rates (some previous water level analyses predated current sea level rise
guidance). This difference is far below the scale of other project uncertainties and is
concluded to be negligible.

in Big Break can be portrayed as -3 to -4 ft MLLW or -1 to -2 ft NAVD88 (based on
Table C-2-2).
C-2.1.3. Parameter Design Assumptions for Big Break. Table C-2-3 shows a matrix
of datums and the sediment bed elevations at Big Break relative to one another based
on Table C-2-2 to two significant digits; the data in Table C-2-2 are at a level of
precision beyond many of the other information or parameters available for Feasibility
Level Design, 0.1 ft measurements in feet were deemed appropriate for design
calculations.

C-2.1.4. Water Velocity Data at Big Break. Depth averaged hydrodynamic data from
June 2009 was supplied by the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) so
that a screening assessment of placed dredged material stability could be performed.
The June 2009 time frame appears representative for screening purposes of typical
conditions at Big Break based on a 720 day evaluation of Dutch Slough gauge velocity
data. Heat plots for maximum depth averaged velocities for the restoration area are
shown in Figures C-2-2 (flood tide) and C-2-3 (ebb tide).
Geotechnical properties of dredged material are discussed in Section C-4 Geotechnical,
and the stability screening analysis utilizing data in Figures C-2-2 and 3 is shown in C-6
Civil Design.

that included a wind rose for Antioch California, about 5 miles from the restoration site.

Figure C-2-4. Annualized wind rose for Antioch, CA
Analysis of Figure C-2-4 shows that the prevailing wind direction and direction of
highest winds is the northwest. If applied to the restoration site at Big Break (see Figure
C-6-2 for the final proposed footprint, northwesterly winds have virtually no fetch in the
restoration area due to Jersey Island and the remnant Big Break levee. Due to this lack
of fetch, wind driven water velocities are concluded to be negligible for feasibility level
design and tidal velocities will be used in mound stability screening assessments. Wind
induced waves and water velocities will be considered during final design in the
Preconstruction Engineering and Design phase.
C-2.2 Sea Level Rise. Attachment HH-A is a technical memorandum documenting a
sea level rise assessment. ER 1100-2-8162 was adhered to for low, medium, and high
C-10

Delta Islands and Levees Ecosystem Restoration Feasibility Report Appendix C – Engineering

rates of sea level change. The computed relative sea level change (SLC) at the project
site based on ER 1100-2-8162 and San Francisco gauge data are computed as 0.66
feet, 2.08 feet, and 6.59 feet as low, medium, and high, respectively for the year 2122;
although the San Francisco gauge is 50 miles from the project site and subsidence is a
concern in the Delta at large, subsidence of the long-inundated Big Break area is
concluded to contribute negligibly to this analysis when scaled with other project
uncertainties. Subsidence in the delta is highly variable and depends soil conditions and
exposure. The highest rates of subsidence occur within the interior of dry islands. That
majority of the subsidence is due to the oxidation of peat soils and does not reflect
inundated areas like Big Break island. A search of readily available information did not
find any source of estimates for ground subsidence of submerged channels or islands
that are not subject to the oxidation. However, considering that the underlying soils
within Big Break Island are inundated, it is probably negligible and the regional rate is a
reasonable approximation for the ecosystem restoration site. Use of the current
estimates are considered to have extremely low study risk. The PDT thus recommended
the study proceed to PED without expending additional time and study funds to evaluate
this assumption in further detail. Based on this, water levels at Big Break Island for year
2122 (100 year life cycle for the project) are shown in Table C-2-4.”

The emergent marsh habitat constructed in the Selected Plan is anticipated to be
sustainable and resilient to sea level rise. Emergent marsh habitat accrues sediment
through lowering flow velocities; as sea level and thus Delta water levels slowly rise,
vegetation should adjust to the new water levels and continue to recruit sediments over
time, raising the marsh level, and so on. This provides the project with a continuum of
adaptive capacity so that there’s no threshold that affects performance. C-4
Geotechnical details 1 foot of sand mound placement to account for miscellaneous
losses of sand mound area/volume, including sea level rise. If 1. unforeseen changes
in SLR rates beyond current policy-determined high rate estimates and/or 2. accretion
rates occurred such that accretion did not outpace or match relative changes in water
surface elevation, then the zone currently attributed to Marsh Wren habitat would slowly
transition to shallow water habitat for other species.
C-2.3 Climate Change Impacts on Inland Hydrology. Attachment HH-B is a technical
memorandum containing a policy compliant Inland Hydrology analysis. Inland
hydrology is not concluded to affect ecosystem restoration feasibility level designs.
C-2.4 Water Quality. Section C-9 Hazardous and Toxic Chemicals discusses water
quality issues associated with contaminants in dredged material or placement site
sediments, Section C-10 Construction Procedures and Water Control Plan discusses
water quality issues connected with resuspended dredged material or placement site

C-11

Delta Islands and Levees Ecosystem Restoration Feasibility Report Appendix C – Engineering
September 2018

sediments. Thus, only water quality with respect to salinity will be discussed in this
section.
The Selected Plan involves the transplant of sandy material (see Section C-4
Geotechnical) in the Stockton Deepwater Ship Channel from north of the western
peninsula of Jersey Island to the Big Break area south of that peninsula. Both sites in
the freshwater are part of the Delta. Dredged material placement at Big Break should
have no effect on salinity (or hydraulics or hydrology) of the Delta at large.

C-2.5 Water Surface Elevation Effects of Proposed Project.
Plates CV-1 (flood tide) and CV-2 (ebb tide), which are attached at the end of this
Memorandum, show the depth averaged velocity data from Figures C-2-2 and C-3-3
overlain on the proposed restoration footprint (see Section C-6 Civil Design). Most of
the proposed project will have no hydraulic impact on stage and velocity because it's not
active flow conveyance area due to the position of old remnant levees.
A portion of the project would be placed within the flow conveyance area where existing
velocities are less than 1 foot per second. Within this region the proposed berms and
vegetation will slow down the water resulting in a minimal increase in the velocity
elsewhere because the obstructed flow will seek a path of least resistance (the
remaining flow conveyance area) or take a different flow path through the upstream
sloughs to the San Joaquin River.
Impacts on the overall conveyance area of delta outflows is extremely small and
impacts to stage and flow are probably not measurable. Based on hydrodynamic
modeling performed for the Sacramento-San Joaquin Feasibility Study (USACE 2002),
flood stages at the site are impacted by backwater from ocean tides combined with the
total net outflow of floodwaters from the Sacramento and San Joaquin River systems.
According to the model results, the peak net outflow of the Delta System for a 1% ACE
event is approximately 920,000 cfs. Of this total net outflow, the existing condition peak
outflow from Dutch Slough for the 1% ACE event is only 14,000cfs. As described above,
the proposed project would only impact a small portion of the total conveyance are of
Dutch slough so the potential impact is even smaller than the flow comparison indicates.
The impacts to flow conveyance area would be less for larger floods because water
depths are greater and the proposed sand mounds will become less of a percentage of
the total conveyance area.
Analysis of available gauge and flow data and hydrodynamic modeling results suggests
that it is highly unlikely the proposed Ecosystem Restoration (see C-4 Geotechnical and
C-6 Civil Design for material and design specifics) to have a measurable increase in
stage in the Big Break area. Following the SMART Planning process and the tenants of
Risk-Based Decision Making, the risk of adverse impacts to the floodplain and the

C-12

Delta Islands and Levees Ecosystem Restoration Feasibility Report Appendix C – Engineering
September 2018

omission of detailed hydrodynamic modeling of the with-project condition is deemed to
be low by the Project Delivery Team (PDT); this risk has been added to the Project’s
Risk Register. Should more detailed study in Preconstruction Engineering and Design
suggest a necessity for detailed hydrodynamic modeling, that modeling can be
accomplished in that phase of the project.

C-3. Surveying, Mapping, and Other Geospatial Data Requirements
Bathymetry data for this project was obtained from NOAA charts as described in C2.1.2. Tidal Datum information was obtained from several sources as detailed in
Attachment HH-A Sea Level Rise Technical Memorandum. Civil Design and Cost
Engineering siting and other distance calculations were made using Google Earth Pro v.
7.1.5.1557.
C-4. Geotechnical
C-4.1 Regional Setting
C-4.1.1 Geology. The Delta and Suisun Marsh lie within California’s Central Valley,
which is approximately 465 miles long and 40 to 60 miles wide. The valley is bounded
by the Sierra Nevada on the east and the Coast Ranges on the west. Paleogeographic
reconstructions of this region indicate that Miocene sedimentation was similar to a
modern fore-arc basin (a sea floor depression between a subduction zone and an
associated volcanic arc), shedding arkosic (granular quartz and feldspar or mica), and
volcanoclastic sediments westward from the continent. In the mid-Pliocene Epoch, a
shift in plate tectonics triggered uplift of the Coast Ranges, which gradually closed the
southern marine outlet to the basin. By the late Pliocene, sub-aerial conditions prevailed
throughout the valley, resulting from marine regression (i.e., when the oceans were
regressing seaward over land) and sedimentation from the west. During Pleistocene
Epoch, the valley separated from the Pacific Ocean and developed internal drainage,
the modern outlet being the Carquinez Strait, through which the Sacramento and San
Joaquin Rivers flow to the San Francisco Bay (Lettis and Unruh 1991).
The historical Delta evolved at the inland margin of the San Francisco Bay Estuary as
two overlapping geomorphic units. The Sacramento River Delta comprises about 30%
of the total area and was influenced by the interaction of rising sea level and river floods
that created channels, natural levees, and marsh plains. During large river flood events,
silts and sands were deposited adjacent to the river channel, forming natural levees
above the marsh plain. In contrast, the larger San Joaquin River Delta—located in the
central and southern portions of the Delta and having relatively small flood flows and
low sediment supply—formed as an extensive, unleveed freshwater tidal marsh
dominated by tidal flows and organic soil (peat and muck) accretion (Atwater and
Belknap 1980). Because the San Joaquin River Delta had less well defined levees,
sediments were deposited more uniformly across the floodplain during high water,
creating an extensive tule marsh with many small branching tributary channels. As a
C-13

Delta Islands and Levees Ecosystem Restoration Feasibility Report Appendix C – Engineering
September 2018

result of the differential amounts of inorganic sediment supply, the peats and mucks of
the San Joaquin River Delta grade northward into peaty mud and then into mud as it
approaches the natural levees and flood basins of the Sacramento River Delta (Atwater
and Belknap 1980).
Soils formed in the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta (Delta) as the result of geologic
processes over approximately the past 7,000 years. These processes produced
landward accumulation of sediment behind the bedrock barrier at the Carquinez Strait,
forming marshlands comprising approximately 100 islands that were surrounded by
hundreds of miles of channels (Weir 1950). Generally, mineral soils formed near the
channels during flood conditions and organic soils formed on marsh island interiors as
plant residues accumulated faster than they could decompose. Prior to the mid‐1800s,
the Delta was a vast marsh and floodplain, under which peat soils developed to a
thickness of up to 30 feet in many areas (Weir 1950), with a thickness of approximately
55 feet in the vicinity of Sherman Island. The tidal portion of the Delta consisted of
backwater areas, tidal sloughs, and a network of channels that supported highly
productive freshwater tidal marsh and other wetland habitats (CALFED Bay‐Delta
Program 2000).
C-4.1.2 Seismicity. The California Coast Ranges physiographic province lies along the
complex boundary between two tectonic plates: the North American Plate and the
Pacific Plate. The geologic and tectonic conditions in the Delta and Suisun Marsh have
been, and continue to be, controlled primarily by the interaction of these two massive
blocks of the Earth’s crust. Under the current tectonic regime, the Pacific Plate moves
northwestward relative to the North American Plate at a rate of about 1.57 inches (40
millimeters) per year (Working Group on California Earthquake Probabilities 2003).
Although relative motion between these two plates is predominantly lateral (strike-slip),
an increase in convergent motion along the plate boundary within the past few million
years has resulted in the formation of mountain ranges and structural valleys of the
Coast Ranges province.
The San Andreas Fault system dominates the seismicity of the region, and it comprises
several major faults including the San Andreas, Hayward–Rodgers Creek, Calaveras,
Concord–Green Valley, and Greenville faults. In addition to these major faults, many
other named and unnamed regional faults accommodate relative motion between the
plates and relieve compression stresses that also act along the plate boundary.
The Delta and Suisun Marsh are in the eastern portion of the greater San Francisco Bay
region, one of the most seismically active areas in the United States. Since 1800,
several earthquakes with magnitudes greater than 6.5 have occurred in the immediate
San Francisco Bay Area, including the 1868 magnitude 6.8 earthquake on the Hayward
Fault, the 1906 magnitude 7.9 San Francisco earthquake on the San Andreas Fault,
and the more recent 1989 magnitude 6.9 Loma Prieta earthquake that occurred in the
Santa Cruz Mountains.

C-4.2 Big Break Site Description.
The flooded Delta Island referred to as Big Break is shown in Figure C-4-1.

Figure C-4-1. Outline of the breached Delta Island now known as Big Break
EDAW et al. (2005) is a thorough baseline report prepared for the California Department
of Water Resources (DWR) for submittal to the California Bay Delta Authority. This
baseline report detailed the potential for ecosystem restoration at Franks Track, Big
Break, and Lower Sherman Lake.
For the remnant levees selected for riparian planting in this Study, EDAW et al. (2005)
states the following (making reference to American Association of State Highway and
Transportation Officials soil classification):
“The levees and larger islands are classified as “Fc,” Cluvaquents, very poorly
drained, loamy, mineral soils in sloughs and river channels. The tidal slough
and low areas of the Lauritzen Site are “Pd,” Piper sand. These soils formed
in windblown material that had encroached into the northwestern part of the
Delta. They are very poorly drained and are saturated within 20 to 40 inches
all year and within 20 inches for as much as 4 months per year. These soils

C-15

Delta Islands and Levees Ecosystem Restoration Feasibility Report Appendix C – Engineering
September 2018

are used primarily for dryland or irrigated pasture. In the early 1900s, before
the levee failed, asparagus was farmed at Big Break.”
Direct sediment data for the dredged material placement area is not known; however,
data is available for soils in the area and land use for agricultural purposes is available,
EDAW et al. (2005) states:
“Known soils in Big Break consist of fluvaquents; Rindge muck, partially
drained, 0–2% slopes; marcuse clay, strongly alkali; and delhi sand, 2–9%
slopes...The soils of Big Break are those of the Delta Plain, which was once
a freshwater marsh. These soils formed in the accumulated remains of tules,
reeds, and other aquatic plants with thin layers of silty mineral matter. The
organic content increases with depth. The surface of these soils lie at or
below sea level to about 15 feet above sea level. Most wetland soils at Big
Break are classified as “Rd,” Rindge Muck. Rindge soils are deep, black,
organic material and have been primarily used for irrigated pasture, field
corn, and asparagus.”
For feasibility level design purposes, sediment at Big Break is assumed to be similar in
character to muck-type with low strength and high compressibility. Design assumptions
for settlement of placed sandy dredged material are detailed in Section C-4.3.4.
Thorough physical and chemical characterization of Big Break sediments planned for
dredged material placement are to be performed during Preconstruction Engineering
and Design to inform final designs, plans, and specifications.
C-4.3 Dredging Material for Ecosystem Restoration
4.3.1. Background. The Selected Plan is to use approximately 100,000 cubic yards
(cy) per year of dredged material (subject to natural variation in availability) from the
Stockton Deepwater Ship Channel. The dredged material used for Ecosystem
Restoration would most likely otherwise be placed in the Scour Pond, McCormack Pit,
and Bradford Island dredged material placement sites as part of an ongoing Operations
and Maintenance Project/Authority. The Selected Plan will use 10 years of ~100,000 cy
placements at Big Break to construct emergent marsh habitat. Figure C-4-2 shows the
Big Break Area, the aforementioned dredged material placement sites, and the station
markers on the Stockton Deepwater Ship Channel.

Figure C-4-2. Dredged Material Placement Sites near Big Break and Stockton
Deepwater Ship Channel Station IDs
C-4.3.2. Physical Characterization of Dredged Material. Because dredged material
is to be diverted from regular placement sites used for the Operations and Maintenance
project for the Stockton Deepwater Ship Channel, physical characterization data and
estimated dredging volumes are available dating back as far as 1994. Pre-dredging
physical and chemical characterization are performed prior to dredging and placement
each year.
Table C-4-1 shows station intervals for pre-dredging estimated volumes and associated
grain size distribution data for nearby Big Break from 2009 to 2016. With the exception
of 2011 (no data for reaches that are high volume in other years), all years in Table
C-4-1 indicate over 100,000 cy of over 90% sandy material available in each year. The
high clay measurement in 2011 is at the downstream edge of that reach; this is an
example of material that may not be utilized for use in Ecosystem Restoration
placement in any one year if encountered, depending on the controls and other
engineering considerations that are identified following year-to-year pre-dredging
characterizations.
Similar to any physically unsuitable materials, were pre-dredging characterization to
identify reaches where sediment is not chemically suitable for open water placement,
those sediments would not be utilized for Ecosystem Restoration at Big Break. Such
sediments would be handled according to the standard procedures of the maintenance
dredging project.

C-4.3.3. Design for Restoration Using Dredged Material.
Initial Designs. Initial iterations of this Feasibility Study investigated reclamation of
dredged material previously placed upland and/or dredged material for sites upstream
of Station 860+00; dredged material from either of these sources was anticipated to be
finer-grained than materials in Table C-4-1. The fine grained nature of these potential
restoration materials led to initial restoration placement designs that were necessarily
large, continuous swaths so that fine material could be confined and settle out without
excessive losses. Initial volumetric estimates were based on 100,000 cy per year of
available dredged material based in part on the NOI data in Table C-4-1.
Grain Size and Volumetric Assumptions for Feasibility Level Design. Analysis of
past dredging data, including those contained in Table C-4-1, suggested that dredged
material from approximately reach 300+00 to 860+00; sediments in these reaches are
almost entirely sand. Based on some silt content in the sediments and the natural
sorting that would be expected from riverine sediment transport, the dredged material
used for ecosystem restoration is assumed for design purposes to be very fine sand
with coarse silt. The coarse grained nature of these sediments that have settled freely
in water is similar enough to the nature of hydraulically placed dredged material that it is
assumed for design purposes that the volume of in-site dredged material is equal to the
volume of material placed at Big Break (i.e. no shrinkage, compression, or bulking).
NOI dredging volumes are generally greater than the volume actually dredged in order
to be conservative from a permitting perspective. NOI volumes were thus chosen as a
probable maximum volume of available dredged material per year and used in design,
constructability, cost, and real estate analyses herein (see sections C-6 Civil Design, C8 Electrical and Mechanical Requirements, Construction Procedures and Water Control
Plan, and C-19 Cost Engineering). Table C-4-2 contains pay quantities (volumes) for
dredging from approximately stations 300+00 to 860+00 ranging from 0 cy in 2012 and
2014 to 135,646 cy in 2016 and averaging to 64,970 cy over the 10 year period shown
(including zero values); these pay quantities and the probable maximum volume of
available dredged material in Table C-4-1 bound a range of volumes that could be
expected in any year, with averaged pay quantities representing the most probable
volumes. Adjustments for variable dredged material volumes in future years or other
adaptations to restoration construction would be handled during the Preconstruction
Engineering and Design phase each year. While this Ecosystem Restoration Project is
proposed for 10 years of dredged material placement, dredging and placement each of
those 10 years is treated herein as an individual phase of construction with an
associated PED phase preceding construction in that calendar/fiscal year. Procurement
strategies relating to construction years and O&M dredging contracts are discussed in
Section C-19 Cost Engineering.

C-4.3.4. Dredged Material Placement Design. Dredged material with the grain size
properties assumed in Table C-4-3 is far more easily used to construct landforms
(whether above or below water) of various designs due to the near immediate settling of
the particles and the angle of repose of mineral coarse-grained sediment. In order to
maximize the surface area of emergent marsh habitat created by dredged material,
mounds of sand that stabilize at a natural, gradual angle of repose during hydraulic
placement were decided upon for design, as mounds are the most efficient geometry in
terms of surface area to volume and require no confinement to construct. A raised
outflow manifold with baffle plate will be utilized to reduce the horizontal spreading of
dredged material during placement so that mounds are constructed as symmetrically
(and thus efficiently) as practicable.
The Engineer Research and Development Center’s (ERDC) Environmental Laboratory
(EL) has performed support to dredged material management and sediment
remediation operations that involve the aquatic placement of sand for engineered
subaqueous structures (dredged material placement, capping). ERDC-EL was
consulted for design assumptions for the nature of very fine sand mounds hydraulically
placed with a baffle plate. Very fine sand is assumed to settle to a 1 on 20 slope below
the local mean water line (LMWL, which is assumed to be 2 feet higher than MLLW, see
Section C-2.1.1 for datums) and to a 1 on 10 slope above the LMWL (Schroeder, pers.
comm).
As stated in Section C-4.2, there is some anecdotal information about the sediment
characteristics at Big Break but no engineering properties of the sediment are known.
Knowledge of the “losses” of placed dredged material for restoration purposes to the
compression of underlying sediments is essential to designing dredged material
mounds (as a greater volume of sand is necessary to construct a mound of a given
height above the sediment bed) and determining the overall restoration footprint for
1,000,000 cy of dredged material specified in the Selected Plan.
ERDC-EL was consulted for reasonable feasibility level design assumptions for the
settlement of the assumed highly organic and compressible existing sediments at Big
Break under the load of sand mounds. Angle of repose and sediment bed compression
assumptions were based on tidal parameters in Section C-2 Hydraulics and Hydrology:

C-21

Delta Islands and Levees Ecosystem Restoration Feasibility Report Appendix C – Engineering
September 2018

1. Below Mean Low Low Water: dredged material placed at this depth is assumed
to take on the “submerged” angle of repose of 1 on 20. Because this comprises
very thin layers at the skirt of the sand mound and it is constantly buoyant due to
inundation, no compression of underlying sediments is attributed to sand placed
below MLLW.
2. Between Mean Low Low Water and Local Mean Water Level: dredged material
placed at this depth is assumed to take on the “submerged” angle of repose of 1
on 20 since this elevation range is inundated most of the time. The increased
dredged material height and lack of continuous inundation led to an estimate of 1
ft of bed sediment compression beneath sand placed in this elevation range.
3. Between Local Mean Water Level and Mean High High Water Level: dredged
material placed at this depth is assumed to take on a semi-submerged angle of
repose of 1 on 10 since this elevation range is not inundated most of the time.
The increased dredged material height and short period of inundation led to an
estimate of 2 ft of bed sediment compression beneath sand placed in this
elevation range. This 2 ft of settlement would be in addition to the 1 ft of
settlement caused by the underlying sand layer between Mean Low Low Water
and Local Mean Water Level.
4. Above Mean High High Water: dredged material placed at this depth is assumed
to take on a semi-submerged angle of repose of 1 on 10 due to hydraulic
placement with a baffle plate. Dredged material placed at or above this elevation
is not expected to be inundated under normal tidal action. The relatively small
volume of dredged material placed above this elevation with respect to the
volumes beneath led to no increased assumptions in the settlement of underlying
bed sediments beyond the 3 ft resulting from Bullets 2. and 3. of this list.
Table C-4-4 lists these settlement assumptions and angle of repose assumptions (Paul
Schroeder, pers. comm.).
In addition to losses of placed dredged material by the compression of underlying
existing sediments at Big Break, other potential sand mound losses that could occur
include:


Wave wash erosion during storms,



Unpredicted consolidation in excess of assumed amounts, and,



Decreased mound area due to sea level rise.

Table C-4-4 also indicates 1 foot of additional mound height to account for losses due to
some combination of these factors based on judgement.
The bed level within the proposed Big Break restoration footprint varies from -3 to -4
feet MLLW; tides within Big Break range from 0 feet MLLW to +4 feet MLLW (See
Section C-2.1.1). Based on input from the Sacramento District Landscape Architecture
Section (see attachment CV-A, discussed in more detail in C-6 Civil Design) and
lessons learned at a similar nearby restoration site (England et al.1990), the proposed
sand mounds would be constructed with a target final elevation (i.e. after settling and
other losses) of +3 feet MLLW. Thus, at high tide sand mounds will be approximately 1
foot below the water surface level and at low tide the top of the vegetated sand mounds
would be exposed.
Figures C-4-3 and C-4-4 display the initial placement (black line) and final geometry
(red line, used for plantable area sizing calculations) of a sand mound placed on
existing bed elevations of MLLW -3 feet and -4 feet, respectively based upon the
assumptions listed in Table C-4-4. It is estimated that the sand mounds would require
on the order of 6 months for the majority of settlement to occur following construction
(Schroeder pers. comm.). Following the settlement period, aquatic vegetation would be
installed (see C-6 Civil Design and Attachment CV-A).

Details regarding the stability of the sand mounds outlined in this section under the
assumed controlling tidal current regime discussed in Section C-2 Hydrology and
Hydraulics and the siting of sand mounds are presented in Section C-6 Civil Design.
C-4.3.5. Sand Mound Volume Calculations. As stated in Table C-4-4, dredged
material placed at Big Break is assumes to be equal to the in-situ volume of material
dredged from the Stockton Deepwater Ship Channel. Placement volume calculations
for the initial geometries (prior to settling or other losses) indicated by Figures C-4-3 and
C-4-4 can be made by straightforward geometric formulas for truncated cones:
𝑉=

1
𝜋(𝑟12 + 𝑟1 𝑟2 + 𝑟22 )ℎ
3

where V is the volume, r1 is the lower radius (the larger radius for mounded material) of
a truncated cone, r2 is the upper radius of a truncated cone (the smaller radius for
mounded material), and h is the height of a truncated cone. Sand mound volumes were
calculated following Table C-4-4 using a 1 on 20 slope from the existing bed to LMWL
(a truncated cone) and a 1 on 10 slope above the LMWL (a normal cone, thus r 2 = 0).
A lateral area of interest for a truncated cone can be calculated similarly,
𝐿𝐴 = 𝜋(𝑟1 + 𝑟2 )√(𝑟1 − 𝑟2 )2 + ℎ2
where LA is the lateral area. Lateral area is of interest in estimating the plantable area
of sand mounds after settlement and in the calculation of ecosystem benefits; these
areas are discussed in Section C-6 Civil Design.
Table C-4-5 shows the parameters for sand mounds placed at bed elevations of -3 ft
and -4 ft (MLLW) and associated areas and volumes.

(ERGO) will be addressed through the Environmental Assessment in the main report, all

Quality Act.

C-6. Civil Design
C-6.1 Ecosystem Restoration Footprint
C-6.1.1 Initial Restoration Footprint. As noted in Section C-4.3.3, the initial project
siting was based on placement designs for dredged material with a significant finegrained fraction that were necessarily large, continuous swaths so that fine material
could be confined and settle out without excessive losses. Figure C-6-1 shows the
initial area designed for dredged material placement (in light blue) at Big Break.

C-6.1.2 Feasibility Level Design and Footprint Expansion. Further investigation of
the dredged material properties in the Stockton Deepwater Ship Channel north of Big
Break revealed that fine sand and coarse silt sediments were abundant in the dredging
reaches near Big Break, leading to the updated feasibility level designs for mounds of
dredged material shown in Figures C-4-3 and C-4-4. The high surface area to volume
ratio of sand mounds allowed for significantly more ecosystem restoration benefit area
to be designed for each assumed 100,000 cy dredging material placement season for
all seasons. The placement scheme that was settled upon involved the placement of 17
sand mounds at existing bed elevations of -3 ft MLLW with 280 ft diameter bases (see
Table C-4-4); while sand mounds placed in -4 ft MLLW have a greater base diameter,
fewer mounds are placed per 100,000 cy, thus 17 mounds with 280 ft diameter bases is
adequately representative and used for sizing.
A placement scheme was developed based on the hydrodynamic and wind data
presented in C-2 Hydrology and Hydraulics, the sand mound volume data in C-4
Geotechnical, and the initial design placement footprint in Figure C-6-1 to satisfy the
following goals:


Placement of sand mounds without toe overlap between mounds so that
channelization between the mounds is maintained to promote adequate
circulation to prevent water quality degradation due to poor circulation (informed
by lessons learned from Donlon Island (England et al. 1990)),



Adequate channelization for a kayak trail through the restoration area (to be sited
in Preconstruction Engineering and Design in coordination with the East Bay
Regional Park District),



Placement beginning on the western edge first due to lower currents so that
subsequent years of placement would have these established edge mounds as
breakwaters,



Placement beginning at the remnant levee and moving southward so that there is
no wind fetch between the remnant levee and newly placed mounds to promote
stability and thus vegetative establishment,

Following this placement progression, 1,000,000 cy is represented in Figure C-6-2.

Based on the sand mound placement in Figure C-6-2, the total aquatic Ecosystem
Restoration footprint is approximately 340 acres.
C-6.2 Sand Mound Stability Analyses.
This section evaluates the stability of sand mounds with respect to water-induced
erosion due to tidal forcing. Section C-2.1.5 contains the conclusion that that tidal
induced erosion is controlling over wind-driven water velocities for stability concerns,
thus stability with respect to water velocities only is evaluated in this section.
Assumptions and design for stability with respect to consolidation of the Big Break
sediment bed beneath sand mounds are discussed in Section C-4.3.4.
The stability calculations herein do not include considerations for extreme events
(seismic activity, medium or low probability higher flow events), 1 ft of sand mound
losses are assumed from multiple sources as noted in Table C-4-3. The primary
reasoning for this is approach is that 1. there is no life safety component to this
Ecosystem Restoration project and that 2. USACE 2002 indicates only a 0.2 ft to 1 ft
stage increase above mean tide for 10% and 1% ACE events, respectively, and 3. the
Big Break area is a sheltered embayment similar to the Donlon Island restoration site,
C-28

Delta Islands and Levees Ecosystem Restoration Feasibility Report Appendix C – Engineering
September 2018

and that nearby similar Donlon Island restoration site, constructed in the early 1990s,
has remained stable through multiple flood seasons including the 1997 flood that is the
largest on record. Should disruption of constructed sand mounds or riparian or aquatic
plantings occur during the construction or establishment period of the project, features
would be replaced through adaptive management and adaptive construction (see
Attachment CE-A). Following the establishment period for the project, any changes of
the site due to extreme events are considered a natural evolution of the emergent
marsh/riparian habitat.
C-6.2.1. Screening Analysis of Sand Stability. An analysis of sand mound stability at
the Big Break restoration area can be contextualized by a straightforward assessment
of the critical shear stress for incipient motion for coarse-grained material representative
of the expected dredged material characteristics. The Soulsby-Whitehouse
approximation calculates critical shear stress for coarse-grained sediments on level
beds. Although intended for bed sediments, the 1 on 20 final slope of placed sand
mounds (see Table C-4-3) is assumed to be reasonably close to a level bed so that the
Soulsby-Whitehouse approximation will yield results meaningful to screening analyses;
any inaccuracies in the application to a 1 on 20 sloping bed are assumed to be
overcome by the application of conservative parameter values in calculations.
A conservative d50 of 75 microns was chosen for critical shear stress evaluation using
the Soulsby-Whitehouse approximation; although d50 data is not readily available for
past dredging events, grain size distribution data in Table C-4-1 suggest a d50 greater
than 75 microns, the fine sand/silt cutoff. 75 microns will thus give a low end estimate
of the critical shear stress. Temperature was assumed to be 15 degrees C for the
critical shear stress calculation (this is conservative when 10 degrees C is used for
shear stresses calculated from hydrodynamic results in Section C-6.2.3 below). No
salinity was assumed.
Table C-6-1 lists the parameters and critical shear stress results from calculations using
the Soulsby-Whitehouse approximation.

water velocities on an ebb tide. Plates CV-1 and 2 are an overlay of the proposed sand
mound placements upon existing condition hydrodynamic modeling, not hydrodynamic
modeling of the restoration footprint with sand mounds present. The intention for
feasibility level design is an initial evaluation of stability to inform the need for controls
so that real estate requirements and a Class III cost estimate for authorization can be
generated; any more detailed modeling or design optimization will be performed during
Preconstruction Engineering and Design.
Analysis of Plate CV-1 shows that maximum water velocities on a flood tide between
0.75 and 1.00 feet per second near proposed sand mound locations at the western
edge of the placement area. Analysis of plate CV-2 shows that maximum water
velocities on an ebb tide range from 0.80 to about 1.10 feet per second near proposed
sand mound locations on the eastern edge of the placement area.
C-6.2.3. Induced Shear Stresses. The depth averaged maximum water velocities
noted in Section C-6.2.2 can be converted to shear stresses so that shear stress results
can be compared to the critical shear stress for sand mounds to inform design
decisions. The shear stress equation used contains a parameter z for a representative
depth above the sediment bed for the input velocity, U. In order to generate
conservative (i.e. high) induced shear stress estimates, a 1 meter (~3 foot) depth of
water was assumed based on -3 ft MLLW existing bed elevation. Using the 1 meter
depth of water assumption, a representative z value of 0.3 meters (~1 ft) was chosen.
Table C-6-2 shows the parameters used for shear stress calculations and the shear
stress results for three different depth averaged velocities.

Following the rationale for conservative critical shear stress assumptions in Section C6.2.1, conservative assumptions in Table C-6-2 include:

C-30

Delta Islands and Levees Ecosystem Restoration Feasibility Report Appendix C – Engineering
September 2018



Using 10 deg C: when coupled with use of 15 deg C used in critical shear stress
calculations, the lower temperature will induce greater shear due to denser
water,



Use of 100 mm for d50: while a larger representative particle size would give an
unconservative (i.e. higher) critical shear stress value, the larger particle size
represents increased roughness and thus an increased induced shear stress
based on depth average velocities.

C-6.2.3. Sediment Stability Conclusions. Table C-6-2 shows that a 1 ft/s depth
averaged velocity is near the critical shear stress for a 75 micron particle, and velocities
above 1 ft/s would very likely cause sand movement. While exceedance of the critical
shear stress for sand does not imply large scale erosion per se, the possibility of
movement in a screening level analysis was deemed sufficient to warrant velocity
reducing controls to endure sand stability until vegetation can be established on sand
mounds so that long term stability is probable.
C-6.3 Hay Bale Placement for Enhanced Sediment Stability.
Initial restoration designs included the use of hay bales for the confinement of dredged
material with a significant fine-grained fraction. While the confinement coarse-grained
dredged material of similar character to Table C-4-1 is not anticipated to be necessary,
hay bales can be utilized as velocity dissipation measures to reduce the water velocities
impacting mounds of dredged material prior to vegetative establishment. Hay bales are
assumed to persist underwater for about 2 years prior to disintegration (Koger, pers.
comm.), providing more than the expected time for vegetation to establish on dredged
material mounds; this vegetation is assumed to provide erosion resistance for the sand
mounds indefinitely.
Higher depth averaged water velocities would be expected for lower water levels at Big
Break during flood and ebb tides. 3 ft high hay bales should act as velocity dissipation
measures during the highest velocity periods at Big Break if placed on the eastern and
western edges of the restoration area.
Based on the dimensions in Figure C-6-2, a hay bale placement consisting of 1,800
linear feet along the western edge of the restoration area was designed for the first year
of construction. A second 1,800 linear foot placement was designed for the second
year of construction, thus providing a breakwater for the entire western edge of the
placement area and allowing establishment of vegetation for mounds placed in years 1
and 2; these mounds will then serve as breakwaters for mounds placed to the east in
subsequent years.
Similar logic is applied to hay bale placement on the eastern edge of the restoration
area for years 9 and 10. Velocities are predicted to be higher at the eastern edge of the
placement area based on Plate CV-2; however, there is a greater amount of remnant
levee protecting mounds on the eastern portion of the restoration area. Two
C-31

Delta Islands and Levees Ecosystem Restoration Feasibility Report Appendix C – Engineering
September 2018

placements of 1,800 linear feet were designed for years 9 and 10 for cost estimating
purposes. Due to the shorter distance to protect, the line of bales could be doubled up,
extended to the southwest, or used in some other configuration. Bale design will be
refined once more detailed velocity and bathymetry data are collected in
Preconstruction Engineering and Design. Excess hay bales could be utilized to form
parts of the kayak trail through the restoration area, if available.
C-6.4. Riparian and Aquatic Planting Designs.
Attachment CV-A is a technical memorandum prepared by the Sacramento District’s
Landscape Architecture group detailing the riparian planting design on the remnant
levees and the aquatic planting designs for placed mounds of dredged material. Some
brief details of those plantings are presented in this section. Section C-10 Construction
Methods and Water Control Plan discusses the construction methods for the designs in
Attachment CV-A.
C-6.4.1 Riparian Planting. Terrestrial riparian species will be planted on the
approximately 33 acres of the two remnant levee islands at 235 plants per acre and
protected and maintained for 3 years so that the roots will have achieved purchase.
Ground water is relatively close to the ground level, so survival is expected to be high
and will easily achieve a goal of 141 plants per acre, or 60% of all installed plants. The
ultimate goal is to promote root growth and enable the plants to achieve self-sufficiency
after 3 years.
The second goal for remnant levee restoration is the removal of invasive vegetation.
This vegetation will be eradicated and managed to ensure it does not return for the
duration of the 3-year establishment period. Eradication of invasives is necessary to
ensure the desirable planted grass and terrestrial vegetation establishes without
competition, effectively giving the desirable vegetation a head start and making the
return undesirable vegetation difficult. Native grass will be seeded to provide both
habitat and soil stabilization.
C-6.4.2 Aquatic Planting.
Based on data from Donlon Island, the ideal plantable area is from -2.5 to 1 ft LMWL.
Figures C-4-3 and 4 show the plantable areas on sand mounds for pre- and postsettlement profiles. This profile leads to a plantable area of about 0.5 acres per mound
using the plantable area and lateral area formula in Section C-4.3.5. Aquatic planting
was calculated based on 17 mounds per year, thus 9 acres of aquatic planting would be
performed per year once mounds of dredged material have settled.
Bulrush and cattails are two desirable prominent aquatic species that are expected to
colonize the mounds. However, since cattail is a dominate colonizer and bulrush is
slow to colonize, bulrush will be planted to give it a head start. Other aquatic species to
be planted are rushes, sedges and spike-rushes. Ten percent of the target plantable
area will be planted with bulrush spaced at 3 feet on center. Bullrush will be installed in

C-32

Delta Islands and Levees Ecosystem Restoration Feasibility Report Appendix C – Engineering
September 2018

the mid elevation of the aquatic planting elevation zone following the majority of mound
settlement (e.g. at MLLW +1.25’) and from there it will spread to lower and higher
elevations over time.
C-6.5 Project Footprint
Dredged material must be pumped from the maintenance dredging locations to the
restoration area via pipeline. Considerations for siting pipeline include


Minimizing pipeline length



Minimizing the potential for navigation impairment



Ease of maintenance, assembly, disassembly, and maintenance/repair.

Analysis of Figure C-2-1 led to the decision to create a key-in structure at the northern
side of the Jersey Island peninsula, directly south of about station 585+00. Floating
pipe from the dredging operation would attach to the ecosystem restoration project
pipeline at this key point. The ecosystem restoration pipeline would run southward from
the key-in structure, up and over the northern levee, across Jersey Island, and up and
over the southern levee. Once across the southern levee, floating pipe would be used
for dredged material placement in the Big Break restoration area using a floating barge
with a placement manifold and baffle plate. Figure C-6-3 shows the proposed pipe key
in location and layout across Jersey Island and into Big Break.

C-6.6. Access Road, Haul Road, Staging Area. Siting of the pipeline informed
choices of access and haul roads and staging area. Jersey Island Road is a county
road to the east of the placement area on Jersey Island and several farm roads are
available that could lead to possible staging areas north and east of the restoration
area. Since some ground/road improvements will be necessary to place pipeline across
Jersey Island, fully creating/improving an access/haul road across the island adjacent to
the pipeline path for use for the life of the construction operation would have cost
efficiency and minimize the project footprint (thus minimizing easements on Jersey
Island). The northern levee road is 25’ wide and gravel and could be used to link Jersey
Island Road to this haul/access road. A construction staging area at the terminus of this
road near the south levee is a logical site that takes advantage of the improved road
used for pipeline placement. Figure C-6-4 shows the proposed route to the project site

expanded restoration footprint remains on the same parcels as the initial design
footprint. Access along north levee road, the north-south haul/access road, and the
pipeline overland route would require easements from Ironhouse Sanitary District for
approximately one month per year for the assumed 10 years of placement, and floating
pipeline crossing Dutch Slough will require an easement from California State Lands
Commission for approximately 3 weeks per year for the assumed 10 years (see C-8
Electrical and Mechanical Requirements for placement duration calculations).

Dredged material placement at Big Break would require an easement for restoration in
perpetuity or a similar non-fee simple acquisition mechanism; the Real Estate Plan
contains further acquisition details. Section C-9 Hazardous and Toxic Materials details
the pre-acquisition sampling and characterization that will take place prior to acquisition.
C-36

Delta Islands and Levees Ecosystem Restoration Feasibility Report Appendix C – Engineering

C-6.8. Relocations. No facility/utility relocations are required as a result of this
Ecosystem Restoration project.
One east-west farm road and two levee roads will be obstructed by dredge pipeline
during placement operations; culvert-style pipe crossings capable of supporting heavy
farm equipment will be placed over the pipe to facilitate access to the western portion of
Jersey Island during placement if needed. The cost of these crossings has been
accounted for in the project cost estimate.
Floating dredge pipe will cross slough between the remnant levee islands and the south
shore of Jersey Island during placement operations; Taylor Slough (between Bethel and
Jersey Islands) offers an alternate navigation route from the San Joaquin River to
Franks Tract for pleasure craft drawing more than 3 ft. of water during placement
operations.

C-7. Structural Requirements.
There are no structural features of this Ecosystem Restoration project.

C-8. Electrical and Mechanical Requirements.
There are no permanent electrical or mechanical requirements for this Ecosystem
Restoration project. This section discusses the mechanical and electrical requirements
for construction.
C-8.1 Electrical Requirements.
C-8.1.1 Site Preparation and Improvements. No external electrical requirements are
anticipated for staging site preparation, haul road improvements, or overland pipeline
siting. All power requirements should be self-contained within the equipment for these
tasks (equipment is detailed in Section C-10 Construction Procedures and Water
Control Plan).
C-8.1.2 Dredging and Placement of Dredged Material. There are no land based
electrical requirements for dredging and dredged material placement operations; all
electrical needs for these operations are fulfilled by integrated diesel generators (i.e. the
dredge plant and booster pumps).
C-8.1.3 Riparian Planting on Remnant Levee Islands. No shore-based power will be
required for riparian planting or associated work on the remnant levee islands at the
north of the restoration area; however, irrigation pumps will require power intermittently
to operate automatically over extended periods during the 3 year establishment period
for riparian plantings. The details of the electrical design for the pumps will be left to

C-37

Delta Islands and Levees Ecosystem Restoration Feasibility Report Appendix C – Engineering
September 2018

Contractors competing for a service contract to execute irrigation through the
establishment period, though it is highly likely that battery based systems (perhaps with
solar components) will be specified due to boat-limited access to the islands and the
automatic nature of the irrigation needs.
C-8.1.4 Aquatic Planting on Mounded Dredged Material.
There are no electrical requirements for aquatic planting operations, these operations
will take place by small boat and plantings will be performed by hand.
C-8.2 Mechanical Requirements.
This section discusses the mechanical requirements for the non-standard construction
methods (i.e. other than typical loader, grader, blade construction equipment)
associated with this Ecosystem Restoration project. A more detailed discussion on
construction methods is contained in Section C-10 Construction Procedures and Water
Control Plan.
Mechanical requirements for the cutterhead dredge plant are covered by the O&M
dredging project. Pipeline and booster pump requirements above what would be
needed for O&M placement are the responsibility of the restoration project, as is end-ofpipe dredged material placement mechanical requirements. The Cost Engineering
Dredge Estimating Program (CEDEP) spreadsheet tool was provided by the USACE
Cost Engineering Directory of Expertise (Cost DX) and used to determine the number of
booster pumps necessary to transport sandy dredged material to the restoration site
based on siting information derived in C-6 Civil Design.
C-8.2.1 Dredge Pipeline. The maximum pipeline estimate for CEDEP input was based
on the dredged material availability data in Table C-4-1 and the Stockton Deepwater
Ship Channel station information in Figure C-2-2. A distance of 28,000 ft from station
860+00 to the proposed key-in site for the land based pipeline near station 580+00 data
was added to an overland pipe length of 3,100 ft to get a rough estimate of 31,100 ft for
CEDEP input.
C-8.2.2 Booster Pumps. The CEDEP main tab predicted the need for 3 booster
pumps for this length of pipe with a maximum pumping capacity over 44,000 ft before a
4th booster would be needed. Pipe length is not anticipated to be in excess of 44,000 ft
in any foreseeable scenario, thus 3 booster pumps were assumed for mechanical
requirements and cost engineering considerations.
C-8.2.3 Mechanical Support Equipment Requirements. Booster pumps require a
barge with spuds, a fuel barge, and a tender boat for operation through the dredging
operation. Pipeline placement is facilitated by tug and barge and loaders for transfer to
Jersey Island for overland pipeline placement. This equipment is all standard parts of a
dredging contractor’s inventory and will be included in the dredging placement contract.
The dredged material placement equipment will be on site only for the mobilization,

C-38

Delta Islands and Levees Ecosystem Restoration Feasibility Report Appendix C – Engineering
September 2018

dredging operation (from approximately station 400+00 to 860+00 only) and
demobilization; this equipment will not be present during approximately 11 months of
the year.

C-9. Hazardous and Toxic Materials.
C-9.1. Big Break Dredge Material Placement Site
C-9.1.1 Past Land Use. EDAW et al. (2005) is a thorough baseline report prepared for
the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) for submittal to the California Bay
Delta Authority that includes past land use information and soil information surrounding
Big Break. EDAW et al. (2005) states that the flooded island that is now Big Break was
likely used for dryland or irrigated pasture purposes and asparagus cultivation prior to
flooding in 1928. This land use information would not suggest legacy contaminants
associated with past activities:


the island was flooded prior to the wide use of environmentally persistent
chlorinated pesticides (e.g. DDT),



any gasoline, diesel, or oil tanks that were inundated by the 1928 flooding of the
island would be expected to have released or leached these materials over the
90+ years between flooding and proposed project implementation.

C-9.1.2 Records Search. The potential presence of hazardous or toxic materials from
a reported site, spill, or release from a permitted facility was investigated using the
California State Resources Control Board’s GeoTracker (website). Figure C-9-1 shows
the results of a GeoTracker search for the Selected Plan restoration area. One Leaking
Underground Storage Tank (LUST) cleanup site was found at the nearby Big Break
Marina. That cleanup was initiated in 1992 and closed in 1997 with a No Further Action
Closure letter as shown in Figure C-9-2.

No other releases or sites that could potentially impact the restoration project area are
known to California Department of Toxic Substances Control or the California State
Resources Control Board.

C-40

Delta Islands and Levees Ecosystem Restoration Feasibility Report Appendix C – Engineering
September 2018

C-9.1.3 Pre-Acquisition Sediment Sampling.
The sediments in the area of Big Break proposed for dredged material placement will be
thoroughly chemically characterized prior to real estate acquisition in Preconstruction
Engineering and Design. This characterization is the most direct and exhaustive means
of ensuring land with excessive hazardous and toxic materials is not acquired by the
Government’s non-Federal Sponsor(s).
C-9.2. Water Quality/Contaminant Transport
There are Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) Basin Plan Amendments for organic
enrichment and dissolved oxygen for portions of the San Joaquin Deep Water Ship
Channel based on the current 303d Clean Water Act list for the Delta; however, the
Selected Plan location is outside of impaired areas. There is also a TMDL for methyl
mercury in the Delta, which includes wetland and open water sources in the restoration
project area. Total mercury loads and potential methyl mercury loads are required to
comply with the TMDL allocations. A TMDL consistency evaluation will be conducted
prior to dredge material placement at Big Break.
C-9.2.1. Mercury at Big Break. EDAW et al. (2005) states “At the Big Break site,
methyl mercury concentrations were noticeably lower than most of the surrounding
central and western Delta sites…Methyl mercury potential was also low relative to other
sites in the central and western Delta ...”
C-9.2.2 Dredged Material Characterization. Material to potentially be dredged is
physically and chemically characterized prior to each dredging event. Should
contaminant concentrations be detected that are unsuitable for open water placement,
those materials would not be piped to Big Break and would instead be placed upland
following the standard procedures of the O&M dredging project.
C-9.2.3 Water Quality Conclusions. Mercury and other heavy metal contamination
is generally associated with fine silts and clay-sized particles; these particle sizes are
not significantly present in past dredged material as show in Table C-4-1. Data from
EDAW et al. (2005) does not suggest high mercury concentration in bed sediments at
Big Break. This information coupled with the rejection of any material to be dredged
that is unsuitable for open water placement suggests that mercury and methyl
mercury production are likely not water quality concerns for this restoration project.
Nonetheless, any contaminant releases from placed dredged material or
resuspended bed sediments will be addressed and controlled as part of the Clean
Water Act Section 401 Certification for in water work.

C-10 Construction Procedures and Water Control Plan.
C-10.1. Ecosystem Restoration Construction.
This section briefly describes the construction procedures for each phase of the
Selected Plan. Complete details for each operation are contained in the MII Cost
Estimate files and the CEDEP spreadsheet tool, see Section C-19 Cost Engineering.
C-10.1.1 Access/Haul Road and Staging Area Improvement.
Construction of the north-south access/haul road across Jersey Island and the staging
area at the terminus of that road near the southern levee is expected to follow standard
procedures for road improvements and staging area construction. Required equipment
for this task is assumed to be


14.6' loader/backhoe



self-propelled 12 ton, single drum vibratory roller



4,000 gal water truck



12' blade articulated grader



8 gravel trucks running 8 hrs/day



support crew of 6

Multiple gravel sources were sited 30 miles from the staging area.
C-10.1.2 Hay Bale Acquisition, Staging, Placement. A Hay Bale source was
assumed to be sited at 30 miles from project site. 1,800 linear feet (LF) of bales are
assumed to be placed prior to construction in years 1, 2, 9, and 10. Bales for one
season’s placement (1,800 LF of 3’ x 3’ x 5’ bales) are assumed to be deliverable by 4
semi-trucks in one day. Bales will be offloaded and staged at the Jersey Island staging
area near the southern levee road (see Figure C-6-4). Bales will be lifted over levee to
floating 7.5 x 14 ft barges by 60 ton, 141 ft. truck-mounted boom crane. The boom
crane is assumed to have an oiler truck and crew with work truck for support. Floating
barges moved by two shallow draft pushboats (300 HP inboard with pushknees and a
pilot house) will ferry hay bales (estimated 8 to a barge) to a loader with bale
attachment mounted on two 7.5 x 14 ft barges (calculated to draw between 1.5 and 2 ft)
with spud accessories. One pushboat will bring a barge loaded with bales while the
other returns to the staging area with an empty barge and re-loads. A 1,800 LF bale
placement operation is estimated to be executable in one week. Any anchoring needs
for the hay bales will be determined following detailed site characterization during
Preconstruction Engineering and Design.

C-42

Delta Islands and Levees Ecosystem Restoration Feasibility Report Appendix C – Engineering
September 2018

C-10.1.3 Dredged Material Placement. Dredging within reaches of interest on the
Stockton Deepwater Ship Channel can occur anytime between September and end of
November based on current fish windows. Exact placement dates are unknown from
year to year, bale placement and other staging will be scheduled each year once
dredging schedules are available. Note that C-20 Schedule for Design and
Construction assumes the latest possible schedule (with dredged material placement
concluding at the end of November) to illustrate the latest possible dates each season
for the various construction activities (this would lead to minimal, and thus conservative,
schedule float for finish-start activities).
The Notice of Intent (NOI) to Dredge documents (also used to compile Table C-4-1)
consistently state that cutterhead dredging operations along the Stockton Deepwater
Ship Channel average between 300 and 600 cy/hr production and operate 24 hours per
day with approximately 18 hours of 450 cy/hr effective production per day. CEDEP
requires an average pipeline length for production and other cost estimating purposes.
Based on the ~30,000 ft maximum pipeline estimate (see Section C-8.2.1), an average
pipeline length of 15,000 ft was input into CEDEP. CEDEP calculated an effective
production of 455 cy/hr for this average pipeline length, virtually identical to the NOI
average of 450 cy/hr. This estimate was thus carried in CEDEP to determine fuel
usages, equipment usages, and eventually dredging and placement costs.
The CEDEP spreadsheet tool estimated a 10 person crew, one tender tug (150 + 25
HP) and one fuel barge would be necessary for pipeline mobilization, transport to site,
and pipeline offloading based on a Bay Area point of origin and 31,100 ft pipeline
length. This pipe mobilization is estimated to take one 12 hour day plus transit time.
Demobilization of the pipeline and booster pumps will follow the same process as
mobilization.
Pipe assembly is estimated to take approximately a week prior to the dredging
operation and a week after for disassembly. Based on production rates, sediment type,
average pipeline length, roughly 15 days of dredging is estimated, putting the total
estimated dredging operation at 25 days (output as 0.82 months in CEDEP). The
CEDEP tool estimated 3 booster pumps to be necessary to move dredged material,
along with a tender boat and fuel barge for booster pump support (detailed in C-8
Electrical and Mechanical Requirements).
The end of pipe placement of dredged material is assumed to take place from a floating
barge (assumed two connected 7.5 x 14 ft barges) with spud attachments, with raised
outflow pipe (able to place up to +6 ft MLLW, see figures C-4-3 and 4) and baffle plate
to decrease outflow energy and facilitate low momentum sand mound placement. The
placement barge will need to be repositioned approximately 300-350 ft once a sand
mound is completed based on sand mound geometry assumptions. Production
calculations put this repositioning at a rate of about once per day, varying based on
production and bed elevation. A shallow draft inboard pushboat with pilot house will be
used to reposition the placement barge in a timely fashion so that the dredging

C-43

Delta Islands and Levees Ecosystem Restoration Feasibility Report Appendix C – Engineering
September 2018

operation is not interrupted and excessive dredged material is not lost during
movement.
This placement method is planned for 10 seasons. Actual placement volumes and
durations will vary year to year based on the availability of dredged material, with the
actual number of season based on completion of the restoration acreage. Pre-dredging
bathymetry surveys will allow for preconstruction engineering and design each season
to optimize design and placement for the material available.
C-10.1.4 Riparian Planting. Riparian planting on the remnant levee islands is
assumed to take place in the first construction year following cessation of dredged
material placement activities (see C-20 Schedule for Design and Construction).
Riparian planting and associated site preparation, mowing and spraying, and invasive
species eradication is to take place over 33 acres of the two islands. Construction
procedures are anticipated to follow those for routine landscape architecture work and
involve tractor mounted flails/mowers, tractors for discing and seeding, man-portable
hedging equipment and manual labor; the notable exception to standard procedures is
that equipment and crews will have to be barge delivered to the remnant levee islands.
A maximum of 2 tractors will be staged on the site (transported in by barge, with likely
landing zone siting on the remnant slough on the north side of the islands). The total
duration for riparian planting is estimated at approximately 8 calendar months. The
estimated establishment period following construction is 3 years. Attachment CV-A is a
technical memorandum that includes riparian plant design. Specific tasks are listed
below with brief descriptions in sequential order:


Establishment of staging, implementation of SWPPP and erosion and sediment
control BMPs, establishment of BMPs for heavy equipment offloading, fueling,
operation, and general site prep.



Eradication of exotic/invasive species on the remnant levee islands.
Approximately a five week operation involving a tractor and flail, 8-person power
hedging crew.



Soil prep and grass seeding next operation, involves use of tractor (ideally same
one used for eradication operations once sufficiently cleaned/treated) for discing
and later seeing, estimated to be a 5 week operation.



Irrigation installation, including pump and battery installation on the two islands, 6
crew is estimated to accomplish this in 17 days.



Installation of woody plants involves a 3-person crew that will collect and
transport seeds to the site over 27 days. An 8-person crew will install cages and
plants on the two islands for 51 days.

C-44

Delta Islands and Levees Ecosystem Restoration Feasibility Report Appendix C – Engineering
September 2018



Mowing and Spraying operations will be conducted 4 times per year (with the
exception of 3 times in the first year of construction) for the 3 year establishment
period. A tractor and spraying crews must be barged to islands for each event,
assumed to use shallow draft pushboats with a pilot house. Each spraying and
mowing event is estimated to take 17 days to complete.

C-10.1.5 Aquatic Planting. Aquatic planting on placed mounds of sandy dredged
material entails planting approximately 4,300 plants over 9 acres per year for 10 years.
This effort is estimated to use


a 6-person crew for staging and seed acquisition over 2 days using a small
workboat



a 4-person crew for plantings using 2 workboats over 12 days.

Plantings will either be installed directly from workboats or by an individual in waders. A
dedicated safety team member will be present during aquatic planting operations.
C-10.2 Water Control Plan
C-10.2.1 Jersey Island Work. For the first year of construction, overland pipeline
placement, access/haul road improvement, and staging area construction activities will
all employ BMPs and sediment and erosion controls as part of a Stormwater Pollution
Prevention Plan. The entirety of ground disturbing activities on Jersey Island are on
land surrounded by levees, thus runoff to a waterbody is not anticipated to be a
significant concern.
Activities on Jersey Island for construction years 2 through 10 will not consist of new
ground disturbing activities, though pipeline assembly over the access/haul road, road
and staging area maintenance, and staging of a boom crane and hay bale transport
trucks will be necessary in some years. The Construction General permit obtained in
year 1 will likely be kept through the entirety of construction with BMPs employed and
maintained as needed.
C-10.2.2 Hay Bale and Dredged Material Placement. Hay bale placement and
dredged material placement are both in water work activities from a permitting
perspective. Site specific requirements for these activities will be addressed through
the Clean Water Act Section 401 Certification process. The sediment bed at the Big
Break restoration site will be physically and chemically characterized in Preconstruction
Engineering and Design. Dredged material is physically and chemically characterized
every year prior to dredging as part of the O&M dredging project.
In addition to serving as breakwaters to allow vegetation establishment on sand
mounds, hay bales can also act as controls during dredged material placement. Silt
curtains have also been budgeted in the project cost estimate as a contingency control
in case finer-grained material is unexpectedly encountered and proposed for placement
C-45

Delta Islands and Levees Ecosystem Restoration Feasibility Report Appendix C – Engineering
September 2018

for restoration. Note that settling/turbidity controls would not generally be expected for a
low energy, shallow water placement of material with the grain size characteristics in
Table C-4-1.
C-10.2.3 Remnant Levee Riparian Planting. Riparian planting on the remnant levee
islands does not involve in-water work. A Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan will be
necessary for riparian planting activities, including


Best Management Practices (BMPs) to prevent irrigation water and herbicide
runoff from the island into Big Break,



BMPs associated with heavy equipment maintenance and fueling,



BMPs associated with construction crews near a receiving water,



BMPs associated with sediment disturbance (staging area, discing) and mowing
near a receiving water.

These BMPs will be identified by the planting contractor(s) as part of the National
Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Construction General permitting
process. BMPs will likely be maintained through the 3 year establishment period for
riparian plantings as needed/required by the Construction General permit.
C-10.2.4 Aquatic Plantings. Aquatic plantings on mounds of sandy dredged material
do not involve excavation or placement of soil/sediment and would thus not be expected
to require water controls. It is possible that because this activity is part of the overall
Ecosystem Restoration project, coverage under the overall project 401 permit may
occur. Regardless, best management practices will be employed to minimize disruption
of the environment during aquatic placement activities.

This information is provided in the main body of the report. Mitigation is not authorized
for Ecosystem Restoration projects.

C-14. Reservoir Clearing
Reservoir clearing is not a relevant aspect of this Ecosystem Restoration study.

C-15. Operation and Maintenance
Operation and maintenance requirements for Ecosystem Restoration projects are to be
minimal by design. This Ecosystem Restoration project is expected to have a minimal
$5k per year Operation, Maintenance, Repair, Replacement, and Rehabilitation
(OMRR&R) cost based on judgment. This cost will be borne 100% by the non-Federal
Sponsor for 10 years following termination of monitoring and adaptive management;
because there is no structural component to this Ecosystem Restoration project,
OMRR&R responsibilities end after this 10 year period.

C-16. Access Roads
Please see C-6 Civil Design Section C-6.6 for a discussion of access roads.

C-17. Corrosion Mitigation
There are no permanent project features that would require corrosion mitigation.
Coatings and/or cathodic protection will be included in the design for temporary project
features (e.g. irrigation systems) as required for materials which are installed in water or
soil.

C-18. Project Security
This Ecosystem Restoration project is not anticipated to require a security plan.

C-19. Cost Estimates
C-19.1. Approach. In developing the feasibility level cost estimates for the Selected
Plan, the Cost Engineering team utilized a construction methodology incorporating the
estimating software MII 4.3 (MCASES Version 4.5.51209) and generated costs at a
Class 3 level. Project costs were based on the CEDEP spreadsheet tool and generation

C-47

Delta Islands and Levees Ecosystem Restoration Feasibility Report Appendix C – Engineering
September 2018

of crews and equipment necessary for the construction or the Selected Plan within MII;
Section C-6 Civil Design and Section C-10 Construction Procedures and Water Control
Plan discuss the bulk of these project aspects that are integrated into MII.
C-19.2. Cost Uncertainties. There are inherent uncertainties in the quantities at the
feasibility level of design as the result of lacking detailed design, plans or specifications.
These discrepancies are reflected in the contingency acquired through the Abbreviated
Cost Risk Analysis (ACRA).
An initial Abbreviated Cost Risk Analysis (ACRA) was performed for the project since
Class 4 estimates were well below $40 million. The risk analysis process involved
dividing project costs into typical risk elements and placing them into a Risk Register,
then identifying the risks/concerns relative to those risk elements, and then justifying the
likelihood of the risk occurring and the impact if the risk occurs. A Risk Matrix utilizing
weighted likelihood/impacts is used to establish the cost contingency for each risk
element (work feature) for use in alternatives comparisons. Risk analysis results are
intended to provide project leadership with contingency information in order to support
decision making and risk management as the project progresses from planning through
implementation. To fully recognize its benefits; cost and schedule risk analysis should
be considered as an ongoing process conducted concurrent to; and iteratively with;
other important project processes such as scope and execution plan development,
resource planning, procurement planning, budgeting and scheduling.
An abbreviated cost risk analysis was held 29 October 2014 with the project manager
and PDT members that was led by SPK Cost Engineering. The meeting primarily
focused on risk factor identification through discussions based on risks prevalent to
dredging placement operations and ecosystem restoration projects. The meeting
encompassed risk factor assessment and quantification which resulted in revisions to
the estimate. Project risks were identified and documented leading to the development
of a risk register spreadsheet. Following the analysis the draft risk register was
forwarded to the PDT for review.
The qualitative impacts of each risk element on costs and schedule were analyzed
using a combination of professional judgment, empirical data and analytical aptitude.
Risks not immediately agreed upon by the PDT were discussed at length and agreed
upon in the form of inputs into the probability density functions. Quantification involved
multiple project team disciplines and responsibilities. The resulting product model
reflects the risk register parameters as developed by the team.
Contingency is an amount added to an estimate and/or schedule allowing for items,
conditions or events for which the occurrence or impact is uncertain. It is probable these
uncertainties will result in the additional costs being incurred or additional time being
required. Based on ACRA results, the contingency for the Tentatively Selected Plan
was calculated to be 17%.

C-48

Delta Islands and Levees Ecosystem Restoration Feasibility Report Appendix C – Engineering
September 2018

Subsequent to the 29 October 2014 ACRA meeting and contingency calculation, the
project was put on hold. The project resumed at the beginning of FY18. The nature of
the Selected Plan did not change following the project pause, though the restoration
footprint was expanded and dredging placement methodologies changed slightly. An
ACRA update meeting was held on 19 April 2018 to verify that the previously identified
risks, project impacts, and calculated contingency remained applicable to the project
after feasibility level design. . Following this meeting, some risk category
documentation was updated, with additional emphasis given to dredged material
availability/uncertainty and impacts to the pumping operation. A second update meeting
was held 09 May 2018 to further address dredged material availability concerns. The
result of these updated ACRA meetings was an increased overall contingency value of
27.4% for use in Class 3 (10-60% quality of project definition) cost estimates.
C-19.3. Total Project Schedule. Section C-19.8 describes the project schedule
assumptions in detail; PED for the first year of construction is assumed, with optimal
funding, to occur in FY 20 with construction commencing FY 21. Construction is
assumed to take 10 years with a 5 year monitoring period thereafter. These
assumptions are reflected in the total project cost summary (TPCS).
C-19.4. Review. The feasibility level cost estimates and Abbreviated Cost-Schedule
Risk Analysis underwent District Quality Control by the Engineering Support Branch
Chief at the Sacramento District, and a District Quality Control certificate was signed by
the Cost Engineering Section Chief, Technical Lead, and Engineering Support Branch
Chief. Following DQC, cost engineering and other project documentation was provided
to the Cost Dx in Dr. Checks as part of the Agency Technical Review Process.
Comment responses were deemed adequate; a Cost Certification was signed by the
Cost Dx 07 June 2018. The Cost Certification is included as a cover sheet to the TPCS
sheets as part of Attachment CE-B (see Section C-19.6).
C-19.5. Key Assumptions
a. CEDEP estimates are based on pipeline and production assumptions detailed in
Section C-8 Electrical and Mechanical Requirements.
b. Haul and Distances – Gravel and hay bale sourcing were sited to be 30 miles
from the project staging area. Worker commute distances were assumed to be 1
hour (~30 miles) one way for some tasks, and 30 minutes (~15 miles) one way
for others. MII files and the Air Quality analysis in the main report detail these
assumptions. The uncertainty in these estimated distances could affect costs.
c. Real Estate – Real Estate Costs reflect the fair market value of the parcels
shown in Section C-6.7 and the Real Estate Plan. There is uncertainty in the
value of subaqueous land, conservative assumptions were made using dry land
comparables by the SPK Real Estate Division.

d. Quantity Uncertainty – Dredged material volumes suitable for restoration
placement will vary from year to year. Some years may have more dredged
material available and placement beyond 100,000 cy may be possible should
funding/authorization allow. In other years, 100,000 cy of dredged material may
not be available, increasing costs due to an increased number of mobilizations
and associated permitting and monitoring activities.
e. Project Schedule – 1 years of initial PED is assumed, beginning in FY20
following (optimal) authorization in FY19. Limited PED would be performed prior
to the following FY’s construction for construction years 2 thought 10 (see C-20
Schedule for Design and Construction for details).
f. The dredged material placement for ecosystem restoration involves the pumping
of sandy material into a shallow open water area. This activity is most accurately
estimated by use of the 17 Account (Beach Replenishment), even though it could
be classified as a 06 Account activity. No beach nourishment is to be performed
and no authority other than Ecosystem Restoration is to be used on this project.
g. Planning, Engineering & Design Costs – A Planning, Engineering, and Design
(30 Account) percentage of 10% was used in lieu of the usual 27.5% assumption.
This reduced percentage is based on the fact that this project is ecological, thus
reduced costs for engineering and design are expected relative to conventional
construction projects. The 30 Account estimate accounts for approximately 8
Full Time Equivalent staff members for each year of design/procurement
activities which is consistent with the anticipated team composition.
h. Construction Management – A Construction Management (31 Account)
percentage of 10% was used in lieu of the usual 14.5% assumption. This
reduced percentage is based on the fact that this project is ecological in nature,
thus reduced costs are expected relative to conventional construction projects.
The 31 Account estimate accounts for approximately 10 Full Time Equivalent
staff members for each year of construction activities which is consistent with the
anticipated team composition.

C-19.6. Monitoring and Adaptive Management Costs. Monitoring and adaptive
management costs were adapted from existing tasks within MII when possible, and
otherwise estimated externally from MII using straightforward labor, crew, and
equipment assumptions and then imported into MII as lump sum items. Attachment CEA is a table detailing the monitoring and adaptive management tasks for each
restoration physical action, the costs, and the assumed year(s) of implementation (in the
case of adaptive management). These costs are entered individually inside TPCS
spreadsheet cells with cell comments identifying them.
C-19.7. Total Project Cost Summary. Total Project Cost Summary (TPCS) sheets for
the 10 years of restoration construction and the subsequent 5 years of monitoring and
adaptive management are contained in Attachment CE-B; a TPCS sheet was generated
for each of these years, thus there are 15 annual TPCS sheets and one rollup sheet for
the entire project. One midpoint for Real Estate acquisition was input for Construction
Year 1. Midpoints for the 06 Fish and Wildlife Facilities, 17 Beach Replenishment, 18
Cultural Resources, 30 Planning Engineering and Design cost accounts and the
Construction Midpoint were entered for each construction year. Table C-19-1
summarizes the first and fully funded costs for each year of construction, monitoring,
and adaptive management and the total project cost.

As noted in Section C-15 Operation and Maintenance, a minimal OMRR&R annual cost
is estimated to be $5,000 per year for 10 years, with no OMRR&R cost thereafter.

C-20. Schedule for Design and Construction
Section C-10 Constructability and Water Control Plan details project construction
elements and C-19.8 details assumptions regarding PED timing and cost account and
construction midpoints. The construction schedule for 10 years of ecosystem
restoration and 5 years of subsequent monitoring and adaptive management is shown
in Attachment CE-C.

C-21. Special Studies
As stated in C-4 Geotechnical and C-9 Hazardous and Toxic substances, thorough
physical and chemical characterization of dredged material and bed sediment at the
restoration site are planned. Baseline water quality, water stage and velocity data will
be gathered in the first year of Preconstruction Engineering and Design and monitoring
will continue through the 15th year of the project (see Attachment CE-A). No special
studies beyond this work are anticipated to be necessary for this Ecosystem Restoration
project.

C-23. Data Management.
In accordance with South Pacific Division policy, this project utilized ProjectWise
software for both engineering data management and data management for other
disciplines. During the feasibility study, electronic data was compiled and maintained in
project folders for each discipline involved on the server. This data is backed up
regularly by USACE’s data manager (ACE-IT). Project information will be available for
the next phase of the project.

C-24. Use of Metric System Measurements.
In accordance with SMART Planning Principles, British Units were predominantly used
on this project due to the substantial existing body of available work on the watershed
that utilized British Units. Surveys and existing GIS and modeling work have been
performed using British Units, conversion of these to metric units would be prohibitively
time consuming and costly. It is anticipated that future chemical and sediment
characterization work will utilize SI units (e.g. mg/L, mg/kg, kg/m 3).

INTRODUCTION

This document outlines the feasibility level monitoring and adaptive management plan
(MAMP) for the Delta Islands and Levees Feasibility Study (Delta Study) in Contra Costa County,
California. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), in ongoing cooperation with the nonFederal study sponsor, the California Department of Water Resources (DWR), has developed this plan
to describe monitoring and adaptive management activities proposed for the Delta Study, assign costs,
and estimate duration. Monitoring and adaptive management addresses sources of uncertainty, steers
project implementation and maintenance to ensure that the intended project benefits are attained, and
documents project effects for communication to participants and stakeholders.

1.1

Authorization for Adaptive Management for the Delta Study

This MAMP is prepared following the 19 Oct 2017 Implementation Guidance for Section 1161
of the Water Resources Development Act of 2016 (WRDA 2016), Completion of Ecosystem
Restoration Projects. Following the Implementation Guidance, this MAMP will list the physical
actions to be carried out; contextualize those actions with their functions and ecological outputs;
describe the success criteria for the actions; list the means, methods, and frequencies of monitoring for
success; list adaptive management measures along with the triggers for implementation of each
measure; and establish costs for implementation of the MAMP.
Concurrence by the non-Federal sponsor and cost-shared funding would be needed to
implement adaptive management. Any changes to the adaptive management plan in the approved
feasibility report must be coordinated with HQUSACE. Significant changes to the project required to
achieve ecological success which cannot be appropriately addressed through operational changes or
through the approved adaptive management plan may need to be examined under other authorities,
such as Section 216 of the River and Harbor and Flood Control Act of 1970.
This plan would be authorized by any future Congressional authorization issued for the Delta
Study’s Chief’s Report.

1.2

Adaptive Management Team Structure

As part of the communication structure for implementation of adaptive management, an
Adaptive Management Planning Team will be established. This team will be led by a Senior Planner
or Senior Environmental Manager from USACE and may include a counterpart from DWR. Other
resources and expertise will be brought in as needed, and may include other representatives from
USACE, DWR, the East Bay Regional Parks District (EBRPD), the California Department of Fish and
Wildlife (CDFW), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), or National Marine Fisheries Service
(NMFS). This team is responsible for ensuring that monitoring data and assessments are properly used
in the adaptive management decision-making process. If this team determines that adaptive
management actions are needed, the team will coordinate a path forward with project planners and
project managers. The Adaptive Management Planning Team is also responsible for project
documentation, reporting, and external communication.

Background

The Delta Study was initiated by USACE in 2006 at the request of DWR, the non-Federal
sponsor for the study. USACE is the lead agency for the Feasibility Study and is also the lead under
NEPA. DWR is the lead agency under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
The Delta (Figure 1) is part of the largest estuary on the West Coast of the United States; is
home to hundreds of species of fish, birds, mammals and reptiles; and is considered an ecosystem of
national significance. Agricultural land irrigated by Delta water contributes billions of dollars in
production for the Nation. Two deep water ports in the Delta serve as important marine terminals for
vessels transporting products through the Delta’s deep draft navigation channels to world markets.
Delta levees protect thousands of acres of orchards, farms, and vineyards as well as critical
infrastructure including state and interstate highways, major rail lines, natural gas fields, gas and fuel
pipelines, water conveyance infrastructure, drinking water pipelines, and numerous towns, businesses
and homes.
The Delta is a web of channels and reclaimed islands at the confluence of the Sacramento, San
Joaquin, Cosumnes, Mokelumne, and Calaveras Rivers. Forty percent of California’s land area is
contained within the watersheds of these rivers. The Delta covers about 738,000 acres and is
interlaced with hundreds of miles of waterways. Much of the land is below sea level and protected by
a network of 1,100 miles of levees which have been constructed over the past 150 years to manage the
flow of water through the Delta. The land behind the levees is predominantly agricultural (corn,
wheat, vineyards, cattle) and waterways provide recreational outlets for nearby urban areas and
important habitat for fish and wildlife, including Federally listed species under the Endangered
Species Act. The Delta is also the largest single source of California’s water supply, providing 25
million Californians with drinking water and irrigating millions of acres of farmland in the Central
Valley. In addition, more than 500,000 people live within the Delta and rely upon it for water,
recreation, and livelihood. The majority of that population is in the greater Sacramento and Stockton
areas and is the focus of other USACE Flood Risk Management studies, though there are communities
within the Delta. Several Delta towns, known as “legacy communities,” are listed in the National
Register of Historic Places.
Historically, the Delta was defined by tidal wetlands, primarily comprised of peat soils. The
Swamp and Overflow Land Act of 1850 transferred ownership of all Federally owned swamp and
overflow land, including Delta marshes, from the Federal Government to private parties agreeing to
drain the land and turn it to productive, presumably agricultural, use. This Act began the reclamation
of wetlands in the Delta through the construction of levees and drainage channels, typically by the new
land owners. The majority of levees in the Delta are still privately owned and maintained. Nearly
three fourths of the Delta is now in agriculture.

1.4

Project Location

The original study area (Figure 1) included the entire Sacramento – San Joaquin Delta and
Suisun Marsh, comprising parts of Sacramento, San Joaquin, Solano, Contra Costa, Alameda, and
Yolo Counties, California. The plan formulation process focused the study area resulting in a final
array of alternatives that includes intertidal marsh restoration sites at Big Break, Franks Tract, and
Little Franks Tract. The selected plan would result in 340 acres of restored intertidal marsh habitat at
Big Break, created through the beneficial reuse of approximately one million cubic yards of dredged

material directly placed from yearly Operations and Maintenance dredging of the Stockton Deep
Water Ship Channel (DWSC). As a result, the final study area includes Big Break, Jersey Island, and
the adjacent portions of the Stockton DWSC. This area is located within Contra Costa County.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

2.1

Planning Objectives

The planning objectives, which are developed specifically for this study, are statements of the
study purpose. Planning objectives are more specific than the Federal and non-Federal objectives and
reflect the problems and opportunities in the Delta Study area; an objective is developed to address
each of the identified problems and opportunities. Planning objectives represent desired positive
changes in the future without-project conditions. The planning objectives for the Delta Study would
be attained within the period of analysis for the study, a 50-year timeframe beginning in 2020, pending
identification of Federal interest and inclusion in a selected plan. All of the objectives focus on
activity within the study area.
Goal 1 - Restore sustainable ecosystem functions in the Delta.


2.2

Ecosystem Restoration Objective 1—Increase area, connectivity, and diversity of
native tidal and non-tidal aquatic, riparian, and related habitats within the study area
during the period of analysis.

Conceptual Ecological Model (CEM) for Monitoring and Adaptive Management

As part of the planning process, SPK developed a conceptual ecological model to represent
current understanding of ecosystem structure and function in the study area (Figure 2). The CEM was
used in this MAMP to support the identification of success criteria and help select parameters for
monitoring. The model illustrates the effects of important natural and anthropogenic activities that
result in different ecological stressors on the system. The model has helped to identify hypothesized
effects of restoration actions on selected performance measures defined for broader physical,
chemical, and biological attributes of the system.

2.3

Project Description

The selected plan proposes approximately 340 acres of intertidal marsh restoration at Big
Break via direct placement of 1,000,000 cubic yards of material from annual O&M dredging over an
estimated 10-year period and is both the Selected Plan and the Environmentally Preferred Alternative.
Dredged material would come from O&M activities in the San Francisco Bay to Stockton DWSC
between approximately station points 400+00 and 850+00 (Figure 3). Dredged material would be
directly pumped to the restoration site, rather than typical land-based dredged material placement sites.
Approximately 340 acres of open water habitat would be restored to intertidal marsh habitat, with
approximately 90 acres planted with aquatic vegetation. The remaining 245 acres would be
underwater channels and shallow habitat for aquatic fauna species. In addition, the 50 acre remnant
levee along the northern edge of Big Break would be treated for invasive plant species and would be
planted with native riparian species.

The proposed action includes the redirection of the hydraulic pumping pipeline from the
Stockton DWSC to Big Break, including the placement of the pipeline across approximately 0.5 mile
of Jersey Island. The proposed action additionally includes the placement of dredged material into Big
Break, vegetation installation at the restoration area, associated long-term maintenance actions, and
monitoring and adaptive management. Placement would occur over an estimated ten year period in
the timeframe of August 1 to November 30, consistent with current and anticipated avoidance work
windows for Delta smelt and salmonids as established in the Biological Opinions for the Stockton
DWSC dredging. The dredging operations are expected to be conducted 24 hours per day, 7 days per
week. It is estimated that approximately 100,000 cubic yards of material would be available in a given
year, which would result in the creation of approximately 17 sand mounds per year. Placement at Big
Break under the Delta Study is estimated to occur over approximately 15 days per work year.
Dredged material would be pumped from the dredging vessel directly to Big Break. Materials
would be pumped to the proposed project areas through a floating 18 inch double wall high density
plastic extrusion (HDPE) pipe. The piping system would be placed along the shoreline of the Stockton
DWSC in the San Joaquin River. The pipeline would be submerged and anchored to the bottom to
avoid navigation hazards. A floating diesel repeater pump station would be positioned approximately
every 5,000 feet as necessary to aid slurry flow; pump(s) would be installed on a floating platform
with stakes to secure its position. Work boats would install and maintain the floating pipeline. An
additional work boat and crew would tender the position of the outfall slurry pipe during pumping
operations to ensure correct placement of materials.
The pipeline would access Big Break from the DWSC via a land-based crossing at Jersey
Island. There is one dirt farm road running north/south on Jersey Island; the pipeline would be placed
adjacent to the road above ground. Prior to installation of the pipeline, the dirt road would be
improved for vehicular access and hauling. Gravel would be placed on the road at a width of 25 feet.
After the haul road is improved, the pipe would be installed by placing 60-foot segments of pipe and
welding the segments together. The pipeline would take 1 day to install each construction season and
1 day to remove. The removal process would be the same as the installation process. A 12 person
work crew could complete this task in a 12 hour work day.
The pipeline would cross one farm road running east/west, in addition to two levee roads on
the north and south shore of the island. Above-ground, culvert-style crossings would be installed at
these intersections in order to avoid impacts to the farm fields. The proposed crossing location is
shown on Figure 3-14 above. The Jersey Island crossing is not anticipated to need a booster pump on
the island; however, a floating booster pump station would likely be installed adjacent to the north
shore of Jersey Island.
In addition, a 1-acre staging area would be used each year on Jersey Island. The staging area
would be located on the south shore of Jersey Island at the end of the haul road and pipeline crossing.
The staging area would be improved, as needed, by placing gravel for vehicular use.

Material Placement
The hydraulic slurry would be discharged at the restoration sites at an assumed average rate of
450 cubic yards per hour or 8,100 cubic yards per day. Placement of the material will occur using
baffle plates to dispel the energy and direct the sediment downwart to create quasi-symmetrical sand
mounds. Analysis of over 10 years of grain size distribution data for the 400+00 to 850+00 dredging
reaches shows the material to be virtually completely fine sand. Since this sand will be falling in a
hydraulic slurry, the sand is assumed to settle to a 1 on 20 slope below the mean tide level (MTL,
which is 2 feet higher than the mean lower low water [MLLW] level) and to a 1 on 10 slope above the
MTL. This placement process is similar enough to sand depositing in the navigation channel that no
bulking of the placed dredged material is assumed and no consolidation of the placed material is
assumed (i.e. one cubic yard taken from the channel is equal in volume to one cubic yard of a placed
sand mound).
Sand mounds would be placed so that the mound toes do not overlap, leaving channels of
varying sizes between the mounds. The intent is to ensure that the channel centerlines are never
shallower than the existing condition (-3 to -4 feet MLLW). The goal of this placement plan is to
create a diverse habitat that provides value to both shallow water aquatic fauna that require varying
depths of soft bottom habitat, as well as terrestrial marsh species such as shore birds. In addition,
based on lessons learned from Donlon Island, this design is intended to provide sufficient flow through
the site to maintain water quality. A larger channel will be identified through the restoration site in the
preconstruction engineering and design phase to provide a kayak trail to minimize the loss of
recreational opportunities in the restoration footprint.
The bed material at Big Break is former agricultural land that was prone to subsidence upon
drying, thus the material is assumed to be highly compressible. Table 3-19 lists assumptions that are
thought to be reasonable but conservative for the compression of Big Break bed materials beneath
hydraulically placed sand.

In addition to “losses” of placed dredged material by the compression of underlying sediments
(as a greater volume of sand is necessary to construct a mound of a given height above the sediment
bed), other potential losses that could occur include:


Wave wash erosion during storms;



Unpredicted consolidation in excess of assumed amounts; and,



Ineffective elevations due to sea level rise (SLR).

Table 3-19 also indicates a contingency amount of 1 foot of additional mound height losses due
to some combination of these factors. Figures 3-16a and 3-16b display the initial placement (black
line) and final geometry (red line, used for plantable area sizing calculations) of a sand mound placed
at -3 feet MLLW and -4 feet MLLW, respectively. It is estimated that the sand mounds would require
approximately 10 months for settlement following construction. Following the settlement period,
aquatic vegetation would be installed, as described below.

Figure 3. Initial and Final Assumed Sand Mound Geometry at -3 feet MLLW

Figure 4. Initial and Final Assumed Sand Mound Geometry at -4 feet MLLW

Sacrificial straw bales will be placed to provide barriers to the predominant flow paths to allow
for sediment settling and sand mound stability. Straw bales are anticipated to persist 1 to 2 years,
giving sufficient time for vegetative establishment, after which vegetation is assumed to provide
adequate erosion resistance. Sacrificial straw bales would be used to aid in compliance with water
quality requirements. Straw bale lines are not anticipated to be fully enclosing; however, should
enclosure become a possibility, the top of the sacrificial straw bale line would be set at mean low tide
level to allow fish an opportunity to escape the work area. If unanticipated quantities of fine-grained
material are present in dredged sediments, turbidity curtains can be used in combination with
sacrificial straw bales and would float slightly above the bottom allowing aquatic species to escape
entrapment.
The bed level within the proposed footprint varies from -3 to -4 feet MLLW; mean tides within
Big Break range from 0 feet MLLW to +4 feet MLLW. As a result, bed depths in the restoration area
range from 3 feet during a mean lower low water tide to 8 feet during a mean higher high water tide.

The proposed sand mounds would be constructed with a target elevation of +3 feet MLLW. Thus at
high tide, sand mounds will be approximately 1 foot below the water surface level; and at low tide, the
top of the vegetated sand mounds would be exposed.
Construction of the sand mounds would require approximately six workers. Approximately 12
employee trips per day of 20 miles each way would be typical for access to and from the site.
Equipment anticipated for construction includes three generators/motors, one lift pump, and two work
boats.
Plantings
Plantings would be installed during two separate periods: the aquatic vegetation would be
installed in the spring and the terrestrial vegetation would be installed in the fall. Following planting
is the initial establishment period, which starts when all the plants have been installed and accepted.
The establishment period would be for three continuous years. Seed collection would occur in the
spring or summer. The seeds would then be propagated in a nursery for approximately 1 year prior to
installation. Table 3-20 identifies species generally conductive to the project region.

Riparian Planting
Prior to construction, the existing remnant levee would be treated to remove existing invasive
vegetation. Invasive vegetation would be removed using a gas-powered hedger. The cuttings would
be raked-up using pitchforks, and the cuttings would be chipped. The chips would be spread over the
ground as mulch. The exposed residue rootstock would be treated with three treatments of herbicide,
spaced one month apart. The herbicide would be approved for use near water bodies. This treatment is
necessary to ensure the desirable planted grass and terrestrial vegetation would establish without
competition. This would give the desirable vegetation a head start, and make it harder for the
undesirable vegetation to return. Native grass would be seeded following initial invasive removal to
provide both habitat and soil stabilization while the remnant levee is being monitored to ensure that
the invasive treatment is successful. Invasive treatment of the remnant levee is anticipated to occur the
summer before the first dredged placement occurs.
Terrestrial riparian species would be planted in the fall of the first construction season on the
remnant levee at 235 plants per acre, protected and maintained for 3 years until their roots have

established. Ground water is relatively close to the ground level, so survival is expected to be high
and would easily achieve a goal of 141 plants per acre, or 60% of all installed plants. The ultimate
goal is to promote root growth and enable the plants to achieve self-sufficiency by the end of the 3
year establishment period. The plantings are considered self-sufficient when a plant is developed and
adapted sufficiently to its setting and is able to sustain itself in its current environment without
artificial or human support.
Terrestrial riparian planting would be installed by a crew of up to eight workers for 12 hour
work days. Equipment needs for riparian planting, establishment, and monitoring is estimated to
include a boat, a truck, a hedger, a tractor, and a weed whacker.
Aquatic Planting
Following dredged material placement and the 10-month settlement period, vegetation would
be installed on the sand mounds annually. Based on experience from the nearby Donlan Island
restoration project, the plantable zone on the placed sand mounds is assumed to be from -2.5 to + 1
feet MTL (or, -0.5 to +3 MLLW). Desirable aquatic vegetation would be planted to pioneer a source
for colonization before undesirable exotic vegetation could develop. The plant material may be
nursery grown or collected from nearby sources and directly planted at the site. For the purposes of
this analysis, it is assumed that the plant material would be nursery grown.
Bulrush (Schoenoplectus spp.) and cattail (Typha spp.) are two desirable prominent aquatic
species that are expected to colonize the mounds. Other aquatic species to be planted are rushes,
sedges and spike rushes. However, since cattail is a dominate colonizer and bulrush is slow to
colonize, bulrush will be planted to give it a head start. Ten percent of the target area would be
planted with bulrush spaced at 3 feet on center, which averages out to approximately 45 plants per
acre, with natural recruitment assumed over time. Bulrush will be installed in the mid elevation of the
aquatic planting elevation zone.
Aquatic plant installation would be conducted using a crew of approximately 4 workers.
Equipment needs are estimated to require 2 boats and a truck for approximately 11 days of work
(standard daylight work hours) each planting year.

3.0

MONITORING AND ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT PLAN

This section will describe the monitoring, assessment, and decision making processes that form
the basis of adaptive management. This section will establish conceptual habitat restoration proposals,
performance standards, and outline adaptive management measures and costs. Conceptual habitat
restoration proposals are based on the project goals and objectives described above. Success criteria
include specific feature(s) to be monitored to determine project performance. Success criteria are
established below for each habitat type, and monitoring would be conducted with the intent of meeting
those standards. Adaptive management measures are actions identified to address potential
mechanisms for failure of project features meeting performance criteria. Triggers for implementation
of adaptive management measures are established below for each habitat type.
Monitoring must be closely integrated with all other adaptive management components
because it is the key to the evaluation, validation, and learning components of adaptive management.
Over the 3 year site establishment period, improvements in field and analytic techniques may lead to
changes in the monitoring methodology. Furthermore, unrealistic expectations or inaccurate
assumptions can lead to the establishment of inappropriate monitoring objectives. It is possible that a
decision to modify success criteria might be reached based on results after several years of monitoring.
In the future, once a determination has been made that specific success criteria have been met,
associated monitoring tasks would cease. Similarly, it could be determined that a monitoring task is
not returning useful information, and therefore not worth the expense of continuation. When possible,
specific monitoring and large scale information needs should be integrated with existing monitoring
efforts that are underway in the Delta. During the PED phase the PDT will explore opportunities to
collaborate with existing monitoring networks to achieve the monitoring objectives associated with
this project.
Monitoring for ecological success and adaptive management for the project would be initiated
upon completion of each construction season and would continue until ecological success is achieved,
as defined by the success criteria established below. This monitoring plan includes the minimum
monitoring actions to evaluate success and to determine adaptive management needs. Although the
law allows for up to ten years of cost-shared implementation of the monitoring plan, ten years of
monitoring may not be required. Once ecological success has been documented by the District
Engineer in consultation with the Federal and State resource agencies, and a determination has been
made by the Division Engineer that ecological success has been achieved, which may occur in less
than ten years post-construction, no further monitoring would be performed. If success cannot be
determined within that ten-year period of monitoring, any additional monitoring would be a nonFederal responsibility. This plan estimated monitoring costs for a period of 15 years, in some cases,
because the monitoring accounts for the 10 year construction period and a 5 year post-construction
monitoring period. A timeline displaying the construction and monitoring assumptions is shown in
Table 3 below.

Following successful establishment of project features, the project would be maintained by the
non-Federal sponsor as required by the Operation, Maintenance, Repair, Replacement, and
Rehabilitation (OMRR&R) manual. As specified by Section 1161 of WRDA 2016, the requirement
for operation and maintenance of the nonstructural and nonmechnical elements of the project by the
non-Federal sponsor will cease ten years after ecological success has been determined.
Ecosystem restoration would occur through restoration of Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta
(Delta) native tidal and non-tidal aquatic, riparian, and related habitats via increased area, connectivity,
and diversity at Big Break. There are three physical actions being undertaken in order to achieve
project objectives:


Dredged material placement;



Riparian planting; and,



Aquatic planting.

The following discussion outlines key components of a monitoring plan that will support the
Delta Study. The plan identifies success criteria, along with desired outcomes and monitoring designs
in relation to specific project goals and objectives associated with these three physical actions.

3.1

Dredged Material Placement

3.1.1

Objectives and Implementation Strategy

Dredged material consisting predominately of fine sand will be placed in mounds on
approximately 340 acres within Big Break. Placement of approximately 100,000 cubic yards would
occur per construction season, creating about 13 to 17 sand mounds over about 15 days of dredging
during the period from August 1 to November 30. This process is estimated to occur over 10
construction seasons, for an estimated total of 1 million cubic yards of dredged material.
The primary objective of dredged material placement in Big Break is to increase ground
surface elevations that historically subsided to a more natural condition, allowing for the restoration of
tidal marsh habitat. Functions that would result from creation of the sand mounds would include
improving fish habitat, restoring vegetated marsh habitat, restoring habitat for shore birds, and
promoting fine sediment accretion.
The settling period for the sand mounds is anticipated to be approximately 10 months
following placement of dredged material. This settling period is intended to account for settling
following placement and any associated changes in elevation. Following the 10 month settling period,
aquatic vegetation would be installed on the sand mounds.

3.1.2

Success Criteria

Monitoring of sand mounds would focus on the physical characteristics of the overall intertidal
marsh habitat. The sand mounds would be considered successful if the following criteria are met: (1)
Monitoring and Adaptive Management Plan
Delta Islands and Levees Feasibility Study

17

September 2018

at least 75% of baseline acreages at each target depth interval are present and (2) at least 25% of the
total acreage of channels established are passable by fish at a target elevation of -3 feet MLLW. The
channels would be defined by any portion of the marsh that has depths in the range of -4 feet to -2 feet
MLLW, with a target elevation of -3 feet MLLW. Any marsh footprint with an elevation greater than
-2 feet MLLW would be considered part of the sand mounds.

3.1.3

Monitoring Strategy

Physical monitoring of the sand mounds would occur annually, with additional monitoring
occurring after any major storms or high water events, as needed. Physical monitoring would involve
a survey crew assessing the site by boat or canoe, and measuring depths and elevation levels using a
depth finder. Annual monitoring would occur in conjunction with the annual vegetation monitoring,
as well as in conjunction with dredged material placement in the following year. If significant issues
are noted in the annual monitoring, plans for placement would be adjusted on a year-by-year basis to
apply lessons learned and maximize the potential for success.
Success would be determined once the marsh habitat has met the physical success criteria
described above for three consecutive years. If the triggers described below are met, then the adaptive
management measures described below would be applied to ensure that the physical characteristics of
the habitat are successful.
Water quality monitoring would also occur during construction and post construction. Water
quality monitoring results would not play into the success criteria, but rather would be used as an
adaptive management trigger. Water quality monitoring would occur by installing remote sondes with
transmitters at established sites in and around the restoration area on buoys. The sondes would take
hourly readings of water quality parameters, such as temperature and dissolved oxygen, to ensure that
the restoration site has sufficient water circulation. Other parameters would be added, as needed, for
the purposes of water quality compliance under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act. The data
collected by the sondes would be assessed by USACE environmental engineers, in comparison with
water quality conditions at a nearby reference site, to ensure monitoring compliance or the need for
additional measures. The reference site would be determined prior to initiation of construction and
would have a similar water quality condition to the estimated future intertidal marsh restoration site.

3.1.4

Adaptive Management Strategy

If monitoring results show that the sand mounds are not meeting the success criteria
established above, then adaptive management would be implemented in order to ensure that the habitat
restoration is successful. The following subsections identify triggers that would indicate the need to
implement adaptive management measures and the measures that would be implemented accordingly
to ensure long term success.
Adaptive Management Triggers


Desired Outcome: Channels exist to reduce potential stranding of fish and increase water
circulation through the restoration site.

Monitoring and Adaptive Management Plan
Delta Islands and Levees Feasibility Study

18

September 2018

Trigger: Elevation depth shallower than -2 feet MLLW for 75% of planned channel areas or
channel cutoff areas are observed.


Desired Outcome: Ensure that water quality remains stable or improved from reference site
conditions and that the restoration site has sufficient water circulation.
Trigger: Water quality parameters are lower than 90% of the reference site conditions.
Adaptive Management Measures

If the triggers established above occur, the following measures would be implemented for the
sand mounds in order to adaptively manage the site for success.
If the elevation depth is suboptimal, then the following measures would be implemented, as
needed:

3.2



First, USACE would analyze nearby meteorology, gages, and velocity trends to determine if
there are potential background causes of the elevation changes. This analysis would not be
part of annual monitoring, but would be the first step in the adaptive management process if
sand mound triggers for adaptive management are met.



If data shows that there is a velocity issue causing excessive movement of the sand mounds,
then additional straw bales could be placed in flow paths to redirect flows and improve
circulation.



If necessary, restoration area could be reshaped through additional excavation to redirect
channel flows or additional sediment placement in order to reestablish successful elevation
levels. Excavation would involve using a high-pressure pump and pipe/hose to push sediment
around. It would not be possible to remove sediment from the site, but rather to reshape the
sediment into a more desirable form.



If some channels are determined to be unsuccessful and cannot be rehabilitated for success,
some channel features could be abandoned and filled during the next placement season to
establish the target elevation for more functional habitat.

Riparian Planting

3.2.1

Objectives and Implementation Strategy

A combination of Sandbar willow (Salix exigua), Arroyo willow (Salix lasiolepis), Black
willow (Salix gooddingii), White alder (Alnus rhombifolia), Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii),
Box elder (Acer negundo), and Button willow (Cephalanthus occidentalis) would be planted along
approximately 6,000 feet of Big Break’s remnant northern levee, of which approximately 50 acres
remains above water (i.e. a terrestrial environment). Terrestrial planting is anticipated to occur during
the first year of the project.

Monitoring and Adaptive Management Plan
Delta Islands and Levees Feasibility Study

19

September 2018

The objective for planting riparian vegetation along the remnant levee is to eradicate the
existing invasive vegetation on the remnant levee to ensure that it does not out-compete the new native
vegetation associated with the restoration project.
The riparian restoration site may require fencing to protect establishing habitats from
recreation, wildlife, and other potential damages. The site would be irrigated during the initial
establishment period (approximately 3 years), and would be watered as needed until the riparian
vegetation is established and self-sustaining.

3.2.2

Success Criteria

Monitoring of riparian habitat would focus on the percent cover of native species versus nonnative species. The riparian habitat would be considered successful when the percent cover of nonnative species has remained less than 10% of the total vegetation on the remnant levee for three
consecutive years.
3.2.3

Monitoring Strategy

The following monitoring procedures will provide the information necessary to evaluate the
success of riparian habitat restoration. Vegetation sampling will occur annually for the duration of the
monitoring period. Sampling will occur during spring months, at the peak of growing season.
Monitoring would involve a one day drone flyover of the habitat and a biologist assessment of the
resulting video. In addition, during boat surveys of the sand mounds, a visual assessment of the
perimeter of the remnant levee would occur to supplement the assessment. Monitoring will estimate
percent cover of native and non-native plant species
General observations, such as fitness and health of plantings, native plant species recruitment,
and signs of drought stress would be noted during the surveys. Additionally, potential soil erosion,
flood damage, vandalism and intrusion, trampling, and pest problems would be qualitatively
identified. A visual check of irrigation infrastructure and fencing would also be conducted. A general
inventory of any wildlife species observed and detected using the restoration site would be
documented. Nesting sites and other signs of wildlife use of the newly created habitat would be
recorded.
Monitoring reports documenting the restoration effort would be prepared following the first
monitoring period and would continue annually until the site has met the success criteria. Monitoring
reports would include photos, the timing of the completion of the restoration, what materials were used
in the restoration, and plantings (if specified). Monitoring reports would also include
recommendations for additional adaptive management measures, if necessary. Following the
monitoring period, any subsequent monitoring activities would be the responsibility of the local
maintaining agency, and would focus primarily on general and biological inspections for the purposes
of fire management and habitat evaluation.

3.2.4

Adaptive Management Strategy

If the habitat is not meeting the success criteria established above, then adaptive management
would be implemented in order to ensure success. The following subsections identify triggers that

Monitoring and Adaptive Management Plan
Delta Islands and Levees Feasibility Study

20

September 2018

would indicate the need to implement adaptive management measures and the measures that would be
implemented accordingly.
Adaptive Management Triggers


Desired Outcome: Increase percent cover of native riparian habitat.
Triggers: If 50% cover of native riparian habitat is not achieved within 3 years, or 75% cover
of native riparian habitat is not achieved within 5 years.



Desired Outcome: Decrease percent cover of non-native invasive species that outcompete
natives.
Trigger: If non-native percent cover is greater than 20% during the monitoring period.
Adaptive Management Measures

If the triggers established above occur, the following measures would be implemented for
riparian habitat in order to adaptively manage the site for success.

3.3



Replanting may be needed if triggers for native vegetative cover are being met. Monitoring
results should be used to assess the underlying cause of inadequate cover, which may require
that additional adaptive management actions be implemented to support successful replanting.
Adaptive management actions could include targeted revegetation, such as replanting varieties
of species that are exhibiting the greatest growth and survival, or planting at elevations that are
exhibiting the greatest growth and survival.



Nonnative species management may be needed if monitoring results show that the triggers for
nonnative species present are met, or if nonnative species are impacting the survival of native
species. Adaptive management measures may include adjustments to nonnative control
methods, such as plant removal, grading of site to remove nonnative roots, or mowing and
selective removal of non-native species at optimal times for native growth.



Irrigation and/or supplemental water may be needed if vegetation is not meeting success
criteria, or if species are exhibiting signs of water stress. Assessment of monitoring results may
show that drought conditions are causing poor establishment or die off of planted vegetation.
Adaptive management actions would include supplemental water to support achievement of
percent cover criteria and structural diversity.



Plant protection may be needed if triggers for native vegetative cover are being met. If
monitoring results show that plantings are failing due to predation or trampling, then adaptive
management actions would include plant cages or protective fencing that could be installed to
protect plantings.

Aquatic Planting

Monitoring and Adaptive Management Plan
Delta Islands and Levees Feasibility Study

21

September 2018

3.3.1

Objectives and Implementation Strategy

Bulrush (Schoenoplectus spp.) would be planted on the sand mounds following their
establishment period. Cattail (Typha spp.) is expected to colonize the mounds through natural
recruitment. Other aquatic species to be planted are rushes, sedges and spike rushes. Aquatic
vegetation would be propagated from local sourced and planted as plugs into the sand mounds.
Plantings would occur each year for about 10 years.
The primary objectives for installing aquatic plantings is to aid with native marsh vegetation
recruitment, to create more stable and resilient sand mounds, and to promote sustainability through
enhanced sediment accretion. Vegetated intertidal marsh habitat would improve water quality,
provide more beneficial restored shallow water habitat for juvenile and adult fish species, and would
provide nesting habitat for shore birds. In addition to providing refugia for native species, the aquatic
vegetation would provide a valuable food source for both native fish and native avian species.

3.3.2

Success Criteria

Monitoring of aquatic vegetation would focus on: (1) the percent cover of native aquatic plant
species; (2) presence of nutrient sources in fine sediment layers; and (3) water quality levels
throughout the restoration area. The aquatic vegetation would be considered successful if the
following criteria are met: (1) 70% average vegetative cover on sand mound plantable acreage; (2)
less than 10% average vegetative cover on sand mount plantable acreage is non-native invasive
vegetation; and (3) water quality monitoring levels remain within 90% of reference site levels.

3.3.3

Monitoring Strategy

The following monitoring procedures will provide the information necessary to evaluate the
success of aquatic vegetation. Vegetation sampling will occur annually for the duration of the
monitoring period. Sampling will occur during spring months, at the peak of growing season, and will
consist of either boat or canoe-based visual surveys or snorkel surveys. In addition, monitoring would
include a one day drone flyover of the habitat and a biologist assessment of the resulting video.
Monitoring will measure percent cover of native plant species, and will also document if there is
presence of non-native aquatic vegetation. Photograph stations are also important for documenting
vegetation conditions. All photograph stations will be documented via Global Positioning System
(GPS) coordinates to maintain consistency throughout the establishment and monitoring periods.
General observations, such as fitness and health of plantings, native plant species recruitment,
and signs of drought stress would be noted during the surveys. Additionally, potential soil erosion,
flood damage, vandalism and intrusion, and pest problems would be qualitatively identified. A general
inventory of any wildlife species observed and detected using the restoration site would be
documented. Nesting sites and other signs of wildlife use of the newly created habitat would be
recorded.
Water quality monitoring could also provide insights into the success of the aquatic vegetation.
Water quality monitoring was described above in Section 3.1.3. No additional monitoring would
occur beyond what was proposed for the sand mounds above; however, the results of that monitoring

Monitoring and Adaptive Management Plan
Delta Islands and Levees Feasibility Study

22

September 2018

could be used to assess the need for adaptive management measures to ensure aquatic vegetation
success as well.
Monitoring reports documenting the restoration effort would be prepared following the first
monitoring period and would continue annually until the site has met the success criteria. Monitoring
reports would include photos, the timing of the completion of the restoration, what materials were used
in the restoration, and plantings (if specified). Monitoring reports would also document the results of
the percent cover measurements, the proportional abundance of different habitat types, and the
estimated natural recruitment versus planted habitats. Monitoring reports would also include
recommendations for additional adaptive management measures, if necessary. Following the
monitoring period, any subsequent monitoring activities would be the responsibility of the non-Federal
sponsor.

3.3.4

Adaptive Management Strategy

If the habitat is not meeting the success criteria established above, then adaptive management
would be implemented in order to ensure success. The following subsections identify triggers that
would indicate the need to implement adaptive management measures and the measures that would be
implemented accordingly.
Adaptive Management Triggers


Desired Outcome: Increase percent cover of native aquatic vegetation.
Triggers: If 50% cover of native aquatic habitat is not achieved within 3 years, or 60% cover of
native aquatic habitat is not achieved within 5 years.



Desired Outcome: Ensure that water quality remains stable or improved from reference site
conditions.
Trigger: Water quality parameters are lower than 90% of reference site.



Desired Outcome: Decrease percent cover of non-native invasive species that outcompete
natives.
Trigger: If non-native percent cover is greater than 20% during the monitoring period.
Adaptive Management Measures

If the triggers established above occur, the following measures would be implemented for
aquatic vegetation in order to adaptively manage the site for success.


Replanting may be needed if triggers for vegetative cover are being met. Monitoring results
should be used to assess the underlying cause of inadequate cover, which may require that
additional adaptive management actions be implemented to support successful replanting.
Adaptive management actions could include targeted revegetation, such as replanting varieties
of species that are exhibiting the greatest growth and survival, or planting at elevations that are
exhibiting the greatest growth and survival.

3.4



Nonnative species management may be needed if monitoring results show that the triggers for
nonnative species present are met, or if nonnative species are impacting the survival of native
species. Adaptive management measures may include adjustments to nonnative control
methods.



Additional adaptive management that could be applied to ensure success for aquatic vegetation
includes the water quality adaptive management measures listed in Section 3.1.4 above. If
water quality monitoring is meeting the triggers above, and aquatic vegetative cover is also not
meeting success criteria, there could be the need for adjustments to the sand mound formations
in order to ensure both water quality success and vegetative cover success.

Plan Formulation Evolution

APPENDIX E. PLAN FORMULATION EVOLUTION

Changes to Selected Plan after the Draft Report
This appendix summarizes and explains major changes that were made to the Tentatively
Selected Plan (TSP) following review of the draft Feasibility Report/Environmental Impact
Statement (FR/EIS).
The draft FR/EIS, released for public review in April 2014, made a tentative
recommendation for plan selection (Figure 1) which included the restoration of 89.5 acres of
intertidal marsh at Big Break and Little Frank’s Tract for an estimated cost of $21.9 million. A
primary restoration feature of the TSP was subsidence reversal in order to reestablish intertidal
marsh elevations. Subsidence reversal was to be accomplished by two methods: (1) direct
placement of dredged material from the Stockton Deep Water Ship Channel during annual
maintenance dredging activities over a period of five years, and (2), pumping previously dredged
material stockpiled at nearby locations.
Subsequent to release of the draft FR/EIS, the document underwent a number of reviews,
to include policy, legal, and technical reviews. Designs, construction assumptions, and costs
were revised and refined through this review process. Ultimately, costs for pumping previously
dredged material increased dramatically based on refined construction assumptions. For this
reason, additional options for the use of dredged material placed directly from annual
maintenance dredging activities were sought. An additional “direct placement” increment was
evaluated which included an additional five years of direct placement of dredged material from
the Stockton Deep Water Ship Channel during annual maintenance dredging activities for an
additional five years (construction years six through ten).
Based on updated costs and outputs, a revised plan (Figure 2) was identified at USACE’s
internal Agency Decision Milestone (ADM), which at the time included the restoration of
roughly 84 acres of intertidal marsh at Big Break for an estimated cost of $23.7 million. The
revised plan does not include pumping previously dredged stockpiled material due to the high
costs of moving the material; therefore restoration at Little Frank’s Tract is not included, as
stockpiled material was to be used for this area. Consistent with the draft FR/EIS description,
subsidence reversal to reestablish intertidal marsh elevations is the primary restoration feature of
the revised plan. Subsidence reversal is to be accomplished by direct placement of dredged
material from the Stockton Deep Water Ship Channel during annual maintenance dredging
activities over a period of ten years.

Feasibility Level Design
After concurrence on the revised plan during the ADM, the design of the recommended
plan was developed in greater detail, consistent with USACE policy. Two factors were of
particular importance throughout this process. First, additional data and information regarding
the composition of dredged material to be used in the recommended plan indicate the material
will be predominantly fine sand, rather than silt as previously assumed. As a sandy material will
form into mounds when placed via hydraulic dredging, the design of the recommended plan
changed to incorporate varying topography and channels and improve constructability. Second,
building off of the change in the sediment composition, designs of the recommended plan were
refined using a more diverse, multi-species, ecosystem approach, which ultimately decreased the
initial overall design elevations. Both of these changes incorporated the lessons learned from the
Donlon Island restoration project, which focused on a need to provide more water circulation
through the site, and allowed for an improvement in aquatic habitat quality in addition to an
increase in marsh wren habitat. These two factors would apply to all final alternatives under
consideration in this study; therefore, previous evaluations and comparisons of alternatives were
not revisited because plan selection would not change.
These refined design characteristics resulted in an increase in the size of the restoration
area to 340 acres due to the varying topography, increased channels, and decrease in design
elevations, with the estimated total cost decreasing to $22.3 million; and the annual cost per acre
decreasing from $274,000 to $66,000. Figures 3 and 4 show the revised Recommended Plan
based on feasibility level design.

HABITAT EVALUATION PROCEDURE
COST EFFECTIVENESS/INCREMENTAL COST ANALYSIS

White Paper
Revised Habitat Evaluation Procedures Outputs for the
Delta Islands and Levees Feasibility Study Selected Plan
Background
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) initiated the Delta Study in 2006 at the
request of the California Department of Water Resources (DWR), the non-Federal sponsor for
the study. USACE and the DWR have identified a Federal interest in conducting an ecosystem
restoration project to reverse subsidence and restore lost intertidal marsh habitat. The restoration
work would involve placing dredged material into open water habitat over an estimated 10 year
period and installing marsh vegetation. This proposal provides a unique opportunity to restore
intertidal marsh, habitat which is now greatly reduced in this ecosystem of national significance.
The proposed alternatives link the proposed ecosystem restoration actions to historic and
ongoing USACE navigation projects, providing a cost effective mechanism to implement
otherwise costly subsidence reversal. This results in restoration of habitat for multiple Federally
listed species, notably salmonids and Delta smelt. The restored habitat would also benefit the
millions of migratory fowl on the Pacific Flyway as they travel through the Delta.
Changes to the Selected Plan
A recommendation for plan selection was made by identifying the plan that reasonably
maximizes environmental outputs relative to costs while meeting planning objectives and
avoiding planning constraints. In May 2017 at the Agency Decision Milestone, the Tentatively
Selected Plan presented to the vertical chain, involved a proposed 84 acres of intertidal marsh
restoration over 10 years of direct placement of dredged material. Following approval at the
milestone meeting, USACE initiated feasibility level design, in order to develop a greater level
of detail for the recommended plan, as described in Appendix C of the Feasibility
Report/Environmental Impact Statement (FS/EIS).
Two factors were of particular importance during design refinement.


Additional data and information regarding the composition of dredged material to be
used in the recommended plan indicates that the material will be sand, rather than silt
as previously assumed. As a sandy material will form into mounds when placed via
hydraulic dredging, the design of the recommended plan changed to incorporate the
varying topography and interwoven channels.



Building off of the change of substrate, designs of the recommended plan were
refined using a more diverse, multi-species, ecosystem approach, which ultimately
decreased the initial overall target elevations with a goal of providing habitat benefits
to Federally listed fish species such as juvenile salmonids and Delta smelt. The
channels will provide foraging habitat for fish species, in addition to spawning habitat
for Delta smelt. Aquatic vegetation would provide a food source for fish species, as
well as nesting habitat for marsh wren and foraging habitat for other migratory fowl.
Additionally, this change in target elevation incorporated the lessons learned from

Donlon Island, which focused on a need to provide more water circulation through
the site, and allowed for an improvement in aquatic habitat quality in addition to an
increase in acreage of marsh wren habitat for the purpose of benefits calculation.
These two factors described above would apply to all alternatives under consideration in
this study; therefore, previous plan formulation evaluations and comparisons of alternatives were
not revisited.
These refined design characteristics resulted in an increase in the size of the restoration
area from 84 acres to 340 acres due to the varying topography, interwoven channels, and
decrease in target elevations, with the estimated total cost decreasing from $23M to $22.3M; and
the annual cost per acre decreasing from $274,000 to $66,000. The revised project description
is described in detail in Section 3.9 of the FR/EIS. Additional information is included in Chapter
8 of the FR/EIS. The purpose of this White Paper is to communicate the updated Habitat
Evaluation Procedures (HEP) analysis in order to communicate the benefits of the refined
Selected Plan.
Habitat Evaluation Procedures (HEP) Update
The purpose of the HEP is to provide a quantitative basis for identifying the habitat
values which would be created by the construction of the proposed alternatives. The quantitative
outcomes can then be used for decisions to select the most appropriate alternative plan. Initially,
the HEP was applied to all of the final array of alternatives, and then the tentatively selected plan
was chosen based on the most cost effective alternative. Design refinements have since
occurred, as described above, that impact the benefits communicated in the initial HEP analysis.
As a result, this updated HEP is intended to communicate the change in benefits on the Selected
Plan.
The Habitat Suitability Models: Marsh Wren (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 1987) was
used to assess outputs of each alternative during plan formulation. The marsh wren requires
emergent herbaceous vegetation, typically cattails and bulrushes for nesting and cover in water
greater than 15 centimeters. The intertidal marsh habitat being proposed would meet typical
marsh wren requirements and is a scarce habitat type within the Delta. This model was selected
because it is an approved bluebook model that has been used in other projects in the area, is
focused on the target habitat type, and has been coordinated with the USFWS. USACE planning
guidelines require habitat suitability models which are certified through the USACE Ecosystem
Restoration Planning Center of Expertise (Eco-PCX). The Marsh Wren model meets these
guidelines in addition to providing measureable outputs to compare alternatives. The Eco-PCX
confirmed that the model meets the approved guidelines.
Although the Marsh Wren model provided an appropriate indicator of relative ecosystem
outputs for comparison of alternative sites, the Marsh Wren is not the only target species for
intertidal marsh restoration. Marsh wrens require dense stands of emergent herbaceous
vegetation, typically cattails (Typha spp.), and bulrushes (Schoenoplectus spp.) for nesting and
cover. They prefer emergent vegetation in relatively deeper water; depths greater than 15

centimeters deep is considered optimum. The habitat variables established in the marsh wren
HSI model are:
•

Variable 1 – Growth form of emergent hydrophytes;

•

Variable 2 – Canopy cover of emergent herbaceous vegetation;

•

Variable 3 – Mean water depth; and,

•

Variable 4 – Canopy cover of woody vegetation.

These habitat variables were assessed for the future condition of the selected plan by
applying lessons learned from the Donlon Island reference site and through the expected future
condition documented through the targets and success criteria identified in Appendix M of the
FR/EIS, the Monitoring and Adaptive Management Plan.
The product of quantity (acres) versus quality (HSI) is comparable to "habitat value".
This formula is expressed as a Habitat Unit (HU). The Average Annual Habitat Units (AAHUs)
over the period of analysis can then be calculated and used to determine mitigation needs. Since
it is not possible to empirically determine habitat quality and quantity for future years, future HSI
values were projected. Four Target Years (TY) were projected over the period of analysis:


TY0 is the baseline condition prior to restoration.



TY1 through TY10 encompasses the estimated 10 year construction period, with aquatic
plant installation beginning in TY2 and ending in TY11.



TY13 represents the estimated end of the monitoring period, when established vegetation
is anticipated to have met the success criteria based on the lessons learned at Donlon
Island. This monitoring estimate is established in the Monitoring and Adaptive
Management Plan, Appendix M of the FR/EIS.



TY50 is 50 years following implementation, and is considered the end of the period of
analysis.

The assumptions included in Table 1 for each variable are as follows:


Variable 1: Preconstruction condition in TY 0 is unvegetated open water habitat, so no
emergent hydrophytes are present. Donlon Island monitoring reports show that cattails
began to repopulate within 1 year. Therefore, emergent hydrophytes would be present in
limited quantities beginning in TY 1, with planting of additional emergent hydrophytes
beginning in TY 2.



Variable 2: Preconstruction condition in TY 0 is unvegetated open water habitat, so there
is no canopy cover in the baseline condition. Each construction season would result in an
estimated 9 acres of dredged material at elevations suitable for planting. Donlon Island
monitoring reports show that cattails began to repopulate within 1 year. Therefore, an
estimated acreage based on the results displayed in the Donlon Island monitoring reports
was developed in limited quantities beginning in TY 1 in order to calculate the canopy
cover. Beginning in TY 2, vegetation would be installed on 10% of the newly plantable
area (0.9 acre) each year for the duration of the construction period. In addition, it is
anticipated that natural recruitment would occur and would be aided by the additional
plantings each year. An estimated acreage for annual natural recruitment was developed
based on the results of monitoring at Donlon Island. The planted acreage combined with
the estimated natural recruitment was compared to the overall acreage of the restoration
site in each TY in order to develop the annual canopy cover.



Variable 3: Baseline condition in the restoration site is a range of 3 to 4 feet mean tide
level (MTL), which averaged to mean water depth of 103.6 centimeters (cm). Each year
of dredged placement would raise the mean water depth slightly throughout the
construction period. The change in mean water depth was estimated consistent with the
proposed dredged material placement plan.



Variable 4: Baseline condition is unvegetated open water habitat, so no woody
vegetation is present. The proposed restoration site would not support growth of woody
vegetation, therefore, none would remain present over the period of analysis.

Table 1 shows the results of the initial HEP analysis, with a total value of 125.8 Habitat Units
(HUs) for the proposed restoration project. This data was calculated using the ECO-PCX
certified marsh wren spreadsheet (Attachment 1). The data in Table 1 was then inputted into the
ECO-PCX certified Institute for Water Resources (IWR) Planning Suite Version 2.0.9.1 to
annualize the data and determine the average annual habitat units (AAHUs). The annualizer
determined that over the period of analysis, the proposed restoration site would provide
approximately 111.44 AAHUs. The outputs are shown in Figure 1 below.

Figure 1. Annual Outputs for Proposed Delta Study Restoration.
Conclusion
This updated HEP analysis shows the updated HSI calculations, HUs, and AAHUs for
the Delta Study selected plan and supersedes the results of the 2014 HEP Report, which is
attached. The 2014 HEP Report’s results are still applicable to the study as they are the basis for
the Cost Effectiveness/Incremental Cost Analysis that was used for plan formulation and
selection.
These updated results, as presented in this White Paper, are reflective of the analysis
associated with feasibility level design for the selected plan. Should any of the assumptions in
the selected plan change, then these calculations would also require further updating.
The proposed restoration would provide a total of 125.8 HUs, and 111.44 AAHUs based
on the marsh wren model for evaluating intertidal marsh habitat.

This application of Habitat Evaluation Procedures (HEP) is intended to quantify the anticipated
benefits to fish and wildlife resources that would occur with the creation of intertidal marsh
ecosystem restoration proposed in the Delta Islands and Levees Feasibility Study (Delta Study).
Project Description:
Corps of Engineers‐Sacramento District (Corps) and the Central Valley Flood Protection Board
(CVFPB) are considering restoration of intertidal marsh habitat using dredged material at Big
Break and Little Frank’s Tract. The ecosystem restoration measures that were retained through
all screenings include: restore intertidal habitat with subsidence reversal at Big Break, Frank’s
Tract, and Little Frank’s Tract. Detailed descriptions and final increments of these measures
follow.
Prior to levee construction in the 1800’s, Big Break, Frank’s Tract, and Little Frank’s Tract were
comprised of intertidal marsh. Levees were constructed to drain the lands for agricultural use,
resulting in subsidence of the land surface. Levee failure occurred in the early to mid 1900’s and
these areas were not reclaimed; however, enough subsidence had already occurred that these
open water expanses now function ecologically as lakes, providing no value to native species.
The primary action required to restore habitat value to native species at Big Break, Frank’s Tract,
and Little Frank’s Tract is subsidence reversal. Similar restoration actions were undertaken by
USACE in the 1990’s at nearby Venice Cut and Donlon Island. This restoration has
demonstrated that subsidence reversal to restore land surface to intertidal elevations, along with
minimal plantings, can result in successful restoration of intertidal marsh with 80% vegetation
coverage within 2 years. Measures considered at Big Break, Frank’s Tract, and Little Frank’s
Tract are based on the success of these reference sites.
Subsidence Reversal
While target elevations are consistent between the sites, current elevations vary from site to site,
resulting in differing requirements for volume of material per acre. Intertidal marsh restoration at
Big Break (1,064 acres of marsh with an additional 15% of open water) would require 12.7
million cubic yards of material, or 9,400 cubic yards of material per acre. Intertidal marsh
restoration at Frank’s Tracts (2,470 acres of marsh with an additional 15% of open water) would
require 42.6 million cubic yards of material, or 17,200 cubic yards of material per acre. Intertidal
marsh restoration at Little Frank’s Tracts (273 acres of marsh with an additional 15% of open
water) would require 4.6 million cubic yards of material, or 16,800 cubic yards of material per
acre.
Increments were developed for each site based on availability and proximity of fill material, as
this is the primary driver in restoring ecological function and the primary driver of cost. Based
on monitoring results from the Donlon Island and Venice Cut reference sites, it is expected that

placement of fill material to the appropriate elevations, followed by plantings of bulrush will be
the only required actions to restore intertidal marsh. As elevations are relatively constant within
each site, calculations were made to determine the volume of fill needed per acre at each site.
Volumes of available material were matched to the most efficient potential site. Potential sources
of material include:
• Direct placement from Operations and Maintenance dredging of the Stockton Deep
Water Ship Channel – assumes normal hydraulic dredging operations with suspended
material directly placed into the restoration area(s) via pipeline and contained in an
enclosed area surrounded by either existing high ground (remnant levees) or
sacrificial hay bales and silt curtains to allow suspended material to settle and water
to filter through the silt curtains prior to exiting the site back into the waterways;
• Pumping previously dredged material from nearby stockpiles – utilize previously
dredged material in nearby stockpiles by creating a slurry that can be pumped into the
restoration area(s) via pipeline and contained in an enclosed area surrounded by either
existing high ground (remnant levees) or sacrificial hay bales and silt curtains to
allow suspended material to settle and water to filter through the silt curtains prior to
exiting the site back into the waterways; and
• Trucking and/or barging material from borrow sites within a 30 mile radius – truck
and/or barge material from borrow sites within a 30 mile radius and place material
into the restoration area(s) either directly from trucks (where possible) or via
excavators on barges into an enclosed area surrounded by either existing high ground
(remnant levees) or sacrificial hay bales and silt curtains to allow suspended material
to settle and water to filter through the silt curtains prior to exiting the site back into
the waterways.
Vegetation
Dredged material will be transported to the site as described above and placed to bring the
substrate to a target elevation of 4.5 feet mean sea level. This area will be conducive to aquatic
vegetation and anchored to the adjacent existing levee. The planting design includes planting
bulrush (Typha sp.) over the area and will be suitable to develop intertidal marsh habitat.
Plantings will be installed at 3 feet o.c. over 10% of the intertidal marsh area. The plant material
may be nursery grown, or collected from nearby sources and directly planted at the site.
Increments
Increments of restoration at each site were developed based on an acre grid system. Available fill
material calculations were used to determine the size of increments, i.e., how many grid cells
each increment included. Locations of increments are general within each site and are based on
proximity to fill material, proximity to remnant levees for improved constructability, and
connectivity to existing habitat. Measures considered at Big Break, Frank’s Tract, and Little
Frank’s Tract are based on the success of these reference sites.

HEP Overview:
The HEP is a methodology developed by the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) and other State
and Federal resource agencies which can be used to document the quality and quantity of
available habitat for selected fish and wildlife species. The HEP provides information for two
general types of habitat comparisons: (1) the relative value of different areas at the same point in
time; and (2) the relative value of the same areas at future points in time. By combining the two
types of comparisons, the impacts of the proposed or anticipated land-use and or water-use
changes on habitat can be quantified. In a similar manner, any compensation needs (in terms of
acreage) for the project can also be quantified, provided a mitigation plan has been developed for
specific mitigation sites.
A HEP application is based on the assumption that the value of a habitat for a selected species or
the value of a community can be described in a model which produces a Habitat Suitability Index
(HSI). This HSI value (from 0.0 to 1.0) is multiplied by the area of available habitat to obtain
Habitat Units (HUs). The HU and Average Annual Habitat Units (AAHUs) over the life of the
project are then used in the comparison described above. The reliability of a HEP application and
the significance of HUs are directly dependent on the ability of the user to assign a well-defined
and accurate HSI to the selected evaluation elements or communities. In addition, a user must be
able to measure the areas of each distinct habitat being utilized by fish and wildlife species
within the project area. Both the HSIs and the habitat acreages must also be reasonably estimable
at various future points in time. The HEP Team, comprised of Corps, DWR, and Service, staff,
determined that the HEP criteria could be met, or at least reasonably approximated, for the Delta
Study. Thus HEP was considered an appropriate analytical tool to assess the proposed restoration
project.
General HEP Assumptions:
Some general assumptions are necessary to use HEP and HSI Models in the impact assessment.
Use of HEP:
• The HEP is the preferred method to evaluate the impacts of the proposed project on fish
and/or wildlife resources.
• The HEP is a suitable methodology for quantifying project-induced impacts on fish and
wildlife habitats.
• Quality and quantity of fish and wildlife habitat can generally be numerically described
using the indices derived from the HSI models and associated habitat units.
• The HEP assessment is applicable to the habitat types being evaluated.
Use of HSI Models
• The HSI models are hypotheses based on available data.
• The HSI models are conceptual models and may not measure all ecological factors that
affect the quality of a given cover-type for the evaluation species (e.g. vulnerability to
predation). In some cases, assumptions may need to be made by the HEP Team and
incorporated into the analysis to account for loss of those factors not reflected by the
model.

Methodology:
This HEP application will be used to quantify the value of the ecosystem restoration of intertidal
marsh habitat proposed in the Delta Study.
A site visit to Big Break, Little Frank’s Tract, Frank’s Tract, and Donlon Island was attended by
Department of Water Resources (Ted Frink), Service (Brian Hansen), NMFS (Mike Hendrick
and Julie Wolford), and Corps (Brad Johnson and Brian Luke) on November 13, 2013. The HEP
team considered the proposed design, Donlon Island restoration site, a previous HEP for the
Bethel Island Levee Improvement Project, and Corps approved models in selecting the
appropriate HSI for the proposed intertidal marsh restoration.
The marsh wren HSI model was selected for use in projects with intertidal marsh habitats. Marsh
wrens require dense stands of emergent herbaceous vegetation, typically cattails and bulrushes
(Typha spp.) for nesting and cover. They prefer emergent vegetation in relatively deeper water, >
15 centimeters deep is considered optimum.
Model assumptions were developed as the basis for the assessment. The assumption regarding
existing and future without-project conditions is that little to no intertidal marsh habitat is or will
be present at the sites; therefore, AAHUs without-project are projected at 0.
The future with-project assumption is that elevations are restored to support a robust intertidal
marsh habitat shown in Table 1. Given these assumptions, long-term losses and gains in HUs can
be estimated for each future scenario over the life of the project, and then expressed as AAHU
gains (Table 2). A HSI value was calculated for each variable at year 1, 2, 25, and 50. A higher
numerical rating is indicative of a higher suitability for the evaluated element. The HSI, when
multiplied by the area of the habitat, yields HUs, a measure of the quality and quantity of the
habitat. Four habitat variables are used in this model to characterize the suitability of a wetland
for supplying cover and reproductive needs of marsh wrens.

Variable 1 – Growth form of emergent hydrophytes – Vegetation will be cattails and
bulrushes;
Variable 2 – Canopy cover of emergent herbaceous vegetation – Based on data collected
from restoration efforts at Donlon and Venice Cut Islands, canopy cover of emergent
herbaceous vegetation would quickly increase to 80% within 2 years from construction;
Variable 3 – Mean water depth – Mean water depth would exceed 15 centimeters; and
Variable 4 – Canopy cover of woody vegetation – The target design elevations would be
too low to support woody riparian vegetation.

Results and Discussion:
Table 2 shows the net change in AAHU’s for intertidal marsh habitat that could be created
resulting from the Delta Study. The three restoration areas are divided into increments based on
amount of available fill material. The large value in AAHU’s for acres created can be explained
by the quick establishment of intertidal marsh habitat (80% in 2 years) demonstrated in the
restoration completed at Donlon Island and Venice Cut.

Cost Effectiveness and Incremental Cost Analysis
Delta Islands and Levees Feasibility Study
February 2014
Introduction
Ecosystem restoration is one of the primary missions of the Corps of Engineers Civil
Works program. The Corps objective in ecosystem restoration planning is to contribute to
national ecosystem restoration (NER). Contributions to NER are increases in the net quantity
and/or quality of desired ecosystem resources. Measurement of NER is based on changes in
ecological resource quality and a function of improvement in habitat quality and/or quantity and
expressed quantitatively in physical units or indexes (but not monetary units). These net changes
are measured in the planning area and in the rest of the nation. Thus, single purpose ecosystem
restoration plans shall be formulated and evaluated in terms of their net contributions to increases
in ecosystem value (NER outputs) expressed in non-monetary units (habitat units).
For ecosystem restoration projects, a plan that reasonably maximizes ecosystem
restoration benefits compared to costs, consistent with the Federal objective, shall be selected.
The selected plan must be shown to be a cost effective plan for achieving the desired level of
output and economically justified (determined to be worth its investment cost). This plan shall be
identified as the NER Plan. This formulation, evaluation, and selection process is described
below.
A Cost Effectiveness and Incremental Cost Analysis (CE/ICA) analysis was conducted
using benefit and cost inputs using the certified IWR-Planning Suite software version 2.0.6.0
(IWR-PLAN).
Restoration Measures
The plan formulation process is described in detail in Section 3 of the Integrated Report.
That section describes the evaluation and screening of ecosystem measures and ultimately
included or excluded from the array of plans being considered. The ecosystem restoration
measures that were retained through all screenings include: restore intertidal habitat with
subsidence reversal at Big Break, Frank’s Tract, and Little Frank’s Tract.
The primary action required to restore habitat value to native species at Big Break,
Frank’s Tract, and Little Frank’s Tract is subsidence reversal. Similar restoration actions were
undertaken by USACE in the 1990’s at nearby Venice Cut and Donlon Island. This restoration
has demonstrated that subsidence reversal to restore land surface to intertidal elevations, along
with minimal plantings, can result in successful restoration of intertidal marsh with 80%
vegetation coverage within 2 years. Measures considered at Big Break, Frank’s Tract, and Little
Frank’s Tract are based on the success of these reference sites.

Subsidence Reversal
Studies conducted on reference sites at Donlon and Venice Cut Islands indicate that
optimum marsh wren habitat (i.e., where vegetative cover is greater than 75%) is found at
elevations ranging from approximately 2.8 to 4.8 feet. Therefore, using a conservative approach
for estimating quantity of fill, a target elevation of 4.5 feet was used to estimate fill quantities.
While target elevations are consistent between the sites, current elevations vary from site
to site, resulting in differing requirements for volume of material per acre. Intertidal marsh
restoration at Big Break (1,064 acres of marsh with an additional 15% of open water) would
require 12.7 million cubic yards of material, or 9,400 cubic yards of material per acre. Intertidal
marsh restoration at Frank’s Tracts (2,470 acres of marsh with an additional 15% of open water)
would require 42.6 million cubic yards of material, or 17,200 cubic yards of material per acre.
Intertidal marsh restoration at Little Frank’s Tracts (273 acres of marsh with an additional 15%
of open water) would require 4.6 million cubic yards of material, or 16,800 cubic yards of
material per acre.
Increments were developed for each site based on availability and proximity of fill
material, as this is the primary driver in restoring ecological function and the primary driver of
cost. Based on monitoring results from the Donlon Island and Venice Cut reference sites, it is
expected that placement of fill material to the appropriate elevations, followed by minimal
plantings of rushes will be the only required actions to restore intertidal marsh. As elevations are
relatively constant within each site, calculations were made to determine the volume of fill
needed per acre at each site. Volumes of available material were matched to the most efficient
potential site. Potential sources of material include:
• Direct placement from Operations and Maintenance dredging of the Stockton Deep
Water Ship Channel – assumes normal hydraulic dredging operations with suspended
material directly placed into the restoration area(s) via pipeline and contained in an
enclosed area surrounded by either existing high ground (remnant levees) or sacrificial
hay bales and silt curtains to allow suspended material to settle and water to filter through
the silt curtains prior to exiting the site back into the waterways;
• Pumping previously dredged material from nearby stockpiles – utilize previously dredged
material in nearby stockpiles by creating a slurry that can be pumped into the restoration
area(s) via pipeline and contained in an enclosed area surrounded by either existing high
ground (remnant levees) or sacrificial hay bales and silt curtains to allow suspended
material to settle and water to filter through the silt curtains prior to exiting the site back
into the waterways; and
• Trucking and/or barging material from borrow sites within a 30 mile radius – truck
and/or barge material from borrow sites within a 30 mile radius and place material into
the restoration area(s) either directly from trucks (where possible) or via excavators on
barges into an enclosed area surrounded by either existing high ground (remnant levees)
or sacrificial hay bales and silt curtains to allow suspended material to settle and water to
filter through the silt curtains prior to exiting the site back into the waterways.

Vegetation
Dredged material will be transported to the site as described above and placed to bring
the substrate to a target elevation of 4.5 feet mean sea level. This area will be conducive to
aquatic vegetation and anchored to the adjacent existing levee. The planting design includes
planting bulrush (Typha sp.) over the area and will be suitable to develop intertidal marsh
habitat. Plantings will be installed at 3 feet on center over 10% of the intertidal marsh area. The
plant material may be nursery grown, or collected from nearby sources and directly planted at the
site. It is anticipated that cattails will self-propagate on site. Additionally, 25 acres of the
adjacent existing levee will be treated to remove invasive non-native species, such as Himalayan
blackberry, pampas grass, pepper weed, etc. Records and reports will be required to document
what was done and how the site and plants progressed.
The restoration measures analyzed for the CE/ICA would restore intertidal habitat with
subsidence reversal at Big Break, Little Frank’s Tract, and Frank’s Tract.
Cost Effectiveness and Incremental Cost Analysis
A CE/ICA analysis was conducted using benefit and cost inputs with the IWR-PLAN.
The various separable element features were evaluated and compared, and recombined by the
software as discussed within this section.
The CE/ICA is an evaluation tool which considers and identifies the relationship between
changes in cost and changes in quantified, but not monetized, habitat benefits. The evaluation is
used to identify the most cost-effective alternative plans to reach various levels of restoration
output and to provide information about whether increasing levels of restoration are worth the
successively added costs. The CE/ICA is a planning tool to help identify cost-effective plans
which provide the highest habitat output relative to cost.
Functionally, the CE/ICA provides a framework for combining individual measures into
alternative plans. The software expedites this effort of testing each combination of measures and
tabulating the resulting costs and environmental benefits.
Cost Effectiveness Analysis
When there is no monetary measure of benefits but project outcomes can be described
and quantified in some dimension, cost effectiveness analysis can be used to assist on the
decision making process. Cost effectiveness analysis seeks to answer the question: given an
adequately described objective, what is the least-costly way of attaining the objective? A plan is
considered cost effective if it provides a given level of output for the least cost. Cost
effectiveness analysis was used to identify the least cost solution for each level of environmental
output being considered.
The cost effectiveness analysis is the first step in the CE/ICA, and compares the Average
Annual Habitat Units (AAHUs) potentially achieved by each alternative to the cost of each
alternative to generate a “cost per AAHU.” This cost provides a means to compare the cost-

effectiveness of each plan. The three criteria used for identifying non-cost effective plans or
combinations include (1) the same level of output could be produced by another plan at less cost;
(2) a larger output level could be produced at the same cost; or (3) a larger output level could be
produced at less cost. Cost-effectiveness is one of the criteria by which all plans are judged and
plays a role in the selection of the National Ecosystem Restoration (NER) Plan. Non-cost
effective combinations of plans are dropped from further consideration.
Incremental Cost Analysis
Incremental cost analysis compares the additional costs to the additional outputs of an
alternative. It is a tool that can assist in the plan formulation and evaluation process. The analysis
consists of examining increments of plans or project features to determine their incremental costs
and incremental benefits. Increments of plans continue to be added and evaluated as long as the
incremental benefits exceed the incremental costs. When the incremental costs exceed the
incremental benefits, no further increments are added. Incremental analysis helps to identify and
display variations in costs among different increments of restoration measures and alternative
plans. Incremental analysis helps decision makers determine the most desirable level of output
relative to costs and other decision criteria.
The incremental cost analysis portion of the CE/ICA compares the incremental costs for
each additional unit of output from one cost effective plan to the next to identify “best buy”
plans. The first step in developing “best buy” plans is to determine the incremental cost per unit.
The plan with the lowest incremental cost per unit over the No Action Alternative is the first
incremental best buy plan. Plans that have a higher incremental cost per unit for a lower level of
output are eliminated. The next step is to recalculate the incremental cost per unit for the
remaining plans. This process is reiterated until the lowest incremental cost per unit for the next
level of output is determined. The intent of the incremental analysis is to identify successively
larger plans with the smallest incremental cost per unit of incremental output.
Selection Considerations
For ecosystem restoration, the recommended plan should be the justified alternative and
scale having the maximum excess of monetary and non-monetary beneficial effects over
monetary and nonmonetary costs. This plan occurs where the incremental beneficial effects just
equal the incremental costs, or alternatively stated, where the extra environmental value is just
worth the extra costs. A plan that reasonably maximizes ecosystem restoration benefits compared
to costs, consistent with the Federal objective, is identified as the National Ecosystem
Restoration (NER) Plan. The selected plan should be cost effective and justified in achieving the
desired level of output. Thus, the NER plan is selected from the suite of cost effective plans
identified in the CE/ICA. While the NER Plan is not required to be a best buy plan, this is often
the case. The results of the CE/ICA do not provide a discrete decision, but rather they offer tools
to help inform a decision.

Costs
The construction methodologies used to generate the cost estimate follow standard
industry practices for standard wet and dry earthwork conditions. Earthwork crews were
developed in MCACES MII with production quantities pulled from the Cost Engineering Section
ProdQuant.xls spreadsheet. The dry earthwork techniques rely primarily on heavy earthmoving
equipment including: Dozers, scrapers and hydraulic excavators while the wet earthwork
techniques rely on barge mounted cranes with a low draft. Pumping costs were generated from
an MCACES MII model refined with bid information from multiple contractor proposals for
similar work in the immediate area. Pumping techniques require pipes to be laid over land and
secured to the river channel bottom as needed to maintain the most direct, cost efficient and low
environmental and local impact. The material source sites placing at Big Break are assumed to
be dependent on the McCormick dredge material storage site pumping operation in order to
create cost savings by utilizing McCormick's infrastructure following completion of its pumping
operation. The outflow of the pipe is considered mobile and would be repositioned regularly in
order to spread materials throughout the site. Some leveling of deposited material may be
required. Normal O&M dredging costs were excluded from this analysis, only the additional
pumping needed for restoration was considered. A summary of construction costs are included in
Table 1.
Table 1: Costs of Increments/Measures (Sept 2013 Price Level)

Increments
The inputs into the IWR-PLAN included seven increments, or solutions as identified in
the model, for Big Break, three increments for Frank’s Tract, and two increments for Little
Frank’s Tract (Table 2). Increments of restoration at each site were developed based on an acre
grid system. Available fill material calculations were used to determine the size of increments,
i.e., how many grid cells each increment included. It should be noted that the first increments at

each site are relatively small, with a large increment for the remainder of the site. This sizing is
a product of available fill material. The smaller increments were developed based on available
material that could be transported to the site without major modifications (i.e., construction of a
bridge, multiple transfers between trucks and barges, etc.). The larger increment includes the
remainder of each site for which a more efficient source of available material could not be
identified. Locations of increments are general within each site and are based on proximity to
fill material, proximity to remnant levees for improved constructability, and connectivity to
existing habitat.

CE/ICA Model Implementation
The restoration increments that were developed based on source material, material
distribution method, and location were entered in the IWR model as solutions. The model inputs
include two relationship dependencies. Big Break increments 3, 4, 5, and 6 all depend on
increment 2, pumping from McCormick Pit. Source material for the dependent increments will
first be pumped to McCormick Pit and then pumped from McCormick Pit to the restoration site.
The second relationship dependency is Frank’s Tract increment 2, which is dependent on
increment 1, pumping from Roberts Island 2. Source material from increment 2 (Roberts Island
1) will first be pumped to Roberts Island 2 and then pumped from Roberts Island 2 to the
restoration site.

Results
This comparison between increments was made using IWR-PLAN to conduct cost
effectiveness and incremental cost analysis based on costs (dollars) and outputs (marsh wren
AAHU). Incremental costs per unit of output were used to identify major breakpoints in cost
efficiency among the alternatives. These outputs are shown in Tables 3 and 4, and Figures 1 and
2:
The model run resulted in a total of 536 cost effective plans. Of these cost effective plans,
12 plans were identified as best buy plans including the no action plan. Table 3 presents the cost,
benefits, and incremental cost for each of the 12 best buy plans.
Outputs increase as alternatives progress (1-12); however, these outputs are achieved at
increasingly higher incremental costs. Breaks in incremental cost are found at Alternatives 2, 6,
8, and 12; therefore, these alternatives were identified as the most logical candidates for plan
selection. The incremental cost per AAHU for Alternative 2 is about $4,800 which is associated
with maintenance dredging and is the least expensive means of obtaining material. The increase
in cost per AAHU of Alternative 3-6 ranges from about $15,000 to $17,700. The increase
reflects the use of stockpiles dredged material. Alternatives 7 and 8 are in the next increment
break of about $30,000 per AAHU. This increase is due to the having to pump a longer distance
and pumping across the Sacramento River from the Rio Vista Pit for Alternative 7, and for
pumping a relatively small amount of material from Augusto Pit for Alternative 8. The
incremental break at Alternative 9 of about $43,500 is due to the increase in distance to pump
from Roberts Island 1 and 2 to the Frank’s Tract site. The three final alternatives have the largest
cost per AAHU. Even though the AAHU output is substantially higher, the cost of having to
truck or barge the needed material ranges from about $56,000 to $103,000 per AAHU.

Subject: Biological Opinion on the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta Islands and
Levees Feasibility Study
Dear Mr. Ziminske:
This is in response to your October 12, 2017, letter requesting formal consultation with the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) on the Corps of Engineers' (Corps) Sacramento-San Joaquin
River Delta Islands and Levees Feasibility Study (Delta Study). The Delta Study is a Federal
project, with the Corps as the lead Federal agency and the State of California Department of
Water Resources as the non-Federal sponsor. At issue are the effects of the proposed project on
the federally listed as threatened Delta smelt (Hypomesus transpaci.ficus) and giant garter snake
(Thamnophis gigas), and Delta smelt critical habitat. Your request was received on October 20,
2017. This response is provided under the authority of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as
amended (16.U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) (Act).
The Federal action on which we are consulting is the Delta Study, an intertidal marsh restoration
project located in an area of the western Delta known as Big Break, between the western end of
Jersey Island and the town of Oakley, in Contra Costa County, California. Big Break was
historically intertidal marsh that was diked and drained for farming. The perimeter levees have
long since been breached, but the site remains open water due to subsidence that occurred during
its past agricultural use. The Delta Study proposes to use dredged material from maintenance of
the section of the Stockton Deepwater Ship Channel (DWSC) nearest to the site to raise
elevations of the site to a level suitable for marsh vegetation establishment. The findings in this
consultation are based on the Biological Assessment (BA) included with your letter, discussions
and communications with Corps staff, and other information in our files.

BIOLOGICAL OPINION
Description of the Action

The project area is located in the western Delta in a portion of Big Break. Most of the project
area is a former, diked island, with subsided elevations such that it is currently shallow open
water habitat except for a terrestrial part comprised of a remnant levee. The activities covered by
this consultation include the placement of dredged material to create the surface elevations of the
restored area, the construction of pipeline facilities to transport the dredged material from the
dredge site to the placement site, plantings, non-native plant removal, monitoring, and- to the
extent warranted by monitoring - adaptive management actions that may be needed to optimize
environmental benefits.
The total quantity of dredged material placed for this project is estimated to be 1 million cubic
yards (cy). The spatial extent of the project would be 340 acres, of which about 250 acres would

Mr. Mark Ziminske

4

be unvegetated underwater channels and shallow water habitat (i.e., shallower than existing) and
approximately 90 acres would be planted with aquatic vegetation. In addition, a 50-acre remnant
levee along the northern edge of Big Break would be treated as necessary to remove invasive
species and planted with native riparian species.
The source of the material for the restoration is Operation and Maintenance (O&M) dredging of
the DWSC roughly between station points 400+00 and 850+00. O&M dredging is not covered
by this consultation, but is an ongoing Corps activity already covered by a prior consultation
(July 31, 2017; Service file number 08FBDT00-2017-F-0098). With the proposed project, as
O&M dredging in this section is occurring, the material would be pumped directly to the
proposed restoration site rather than transporting it to usual land-based placement sites. The
amount of material in any given year cannot be exactly predicted because it depends on
variations in shoaling that are affected by weather and inflow. For the purpose of illustration,
this description uses the anticipated average 100,000 cy volume to describe activities in a given
year; however, the actual amount of dredged material and the associated restoration may vary
from this amount. In general, 100,000 cy would be the minimum quantity of dredging that
would initiate an O&M operation in a year, however, it could be much more than that if a wetter
water year were to occur that brought more sediment into the DWSC. In that event, the dredging
and associated restoration activities would be scaled up to ensure that dredging was sufficient to
restore the authorized depth. This would involve a longer period of dredging for that year, but
which would create more restored habitat. The estimated time for restoration activities to take
place is 13 years (10 years placement and monitoring plus 3 years post-completion
monitoring/adaptive management) but could be somewhat longer or shorter depending on the
frequency of O&M and amount of O&M material. Project construction is estimated to begin in
the fall of 2020.
This description is subject to verification and refinement as a result of additional study to be
done at the Corps' Preconstruction Engineering and Design (PED) phase of project planning,
which will take place after this biological opinion is issued.
Facilities: A hydraulic suction dredge would be used with a pipeline to transport material from
the dredging site to the placement site at Big Break. On the San Joaquin River, the pipeline
would be floating. As the ship channel is being dredged, this floating pipeline would be used to
transfer materials to the placement site. There would be floating diesel repeater pump stations
positioned about every 5,000 feet to aid slurry flow. Work boats would be needed to install,
maintain, and remove the floating pipeline, and tender the position of the outfall slurry pipe to
ensure correct placement of materials.

A section of the pipeline would be land-based, crossing Jersey Island. It would be installed
adjacent to a north-south farm road. Before installation, the farm road would be improved with a
layer of gravel to allow vehicular access. The pipeline would take 1 day to install and 1 day to
remove each season. There would be a 1-acre staging area at the south end of this land-based
section of the pipeline. The pipeline would then continue south, where it would be submerged
for the 600-foot distance crossing of Dutch Slough. The pipeline would be placed on the ground
of the remnant levee, before entering the placement area at Big Break, where it would be floating
agam.

Mr. Mark Ziminske

Material Placement: Material placement would be simultaneous with the dredging period,
which is estimated to average 15 days per year over a 10-year period, depending on the material
volume. Regardless of variations in volume, all placement would be done entirely within the
August 1 to November 30 time frame of each year. Dredging would be relatively continuous,
with about 18 hours per day considered operational. The dredged material, in the form of a
hydraulic slurry, would be pumped directly from the dredging vessel into the pipeline. The
material would be released into shallow open water in Big Break to form a series of circular sand
mounds, each roughly 300 feet in diameter, assuming the materials settle at a slope of about 1 on
20 below mean tide, and 1 on 10 above mean tide. The mounds would be placed so that the toes
do not overlap, leaving channels between the mounds that are initially the same as existing
conditions, but which are expected to become shallower in the future as they accrete sediment.
The positioning of the mounds would be such that some larger channels would be formed to
allow for kayak recreation after the site is restored. The target elevation of the top of the sand
mounds would be +3 feet Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW), grading to the bed level at the toe
of the mound, which would be -3 to -4 feet MLLW. The upper portion of the mound will be
initially 1 to 3 feet higher than the target elevations for restoration to allow for losses of height
due to several factors: compression of the underlying material, wave wash loss during storms,
and sea level rise. At high tide, the mounds would be at least 1 foot below the water surface (i.e.,
Mean Higher High Water is +4 feet above MLLW). An estimated 6,000 cy would be placed per
mound, or about 17 mounds for each 100,000 cy of dredged material, with each mound
encompassing about 1.6 acres after settlement.
Several sets of straw bale lines would be placed around the placement area before dredged
material placement as a barrier to the predominant flow paths to allow for sediment settling and
initial mound stability. These straw bale lines are not anticipated to be fully enclosing so as to
permit fish movement and water exchange. If initial monitoring reveals that enclosure is needed,
the top of the straw bale lines would be set at mean low tide to allow fish an opportunity to
escape the work area. These bales are anticipated to persist for 1-2 years, allowing sufficient
time for vegetative establishment, after which the vegetation is assumed to provide adequate
resistance. At this time, it is believed the bale lines would be installed on the western and eastern
edges of the restoration area south of the remnant levee, with a total extent of about 3,600 feet
for each bale line. The exact form of the bale lines will be determined during the PED phase.
Aquatic marsh vegetation plantings would be installed on the mounds in the spring following
each season of material placement. There may be terrestrial riparian vegetation plantings made
on the existing remnant levee section of the project area in the fall of the first season of
construction. The most recent examination of the remnant levee indicates at least a margin of
marsh vegetation, and that the existing terrestrial vegetation could be native species. During
PED, the remnant levee would be inspected for the extent of invasive vegetation and ground
surface elevations surveyed to verify the need and suitability for terrestrial plantings. If
plantings are warranted, invasive vegetation on the remnant levee would be removed with a
hedger, and the remaining rootstocks treated with herbicide, once a month for 3 months. The
levee would be seeded with native grasses following invasive treatment and monitored to
determine if treatment was successful. Assuming treatment success, riparian species would be
planted in the fall, maintained for a 3-year establishment period via watering, caging, or other

Mr. Mark Ziminske

needed methods, and monitored. Initial densities would be 235 plants/acre, with 60% survival to
the end of the 3-year period. This terrestrial planting would be native woody riparian species as
described in the monitoring plan. The site would be fenced as needed to protect establishing
habitat, and irrigated, for the 3 years. If the PED inspection reveals that the remnant levee does
not have invasive species or enough to warrant action, or that the elevations are too low to
support riparian plantings, then the terrestrial vegetation planting and associated monitoring
elements of this project will be deleted.
Aquatic planting would be installed following an estimated 10-month settlement period after
each season of dredged material placement has concluded. Existing Big Break sediments will be
characterized by testing to predict physical behavior of placed sediment under loading of the
mound, and further testing will be done during the PED phase. This will be done to verify the
settlement and spread of the mounds. The placement and settlement period may be subject to
further adjustment as warranted by the first year of monitoring, to balance the needs to plant after
sufficient settlement, but before the surface is substantially colonized by non-native vegetation.
Based on the prior similar restoration project using dredged material at Donlan Island, the
plantable zone on the sand mounds is assumed to be -0.5 to +3 feet MLLW (Corps and Service
1990). Vegetative elevation may vary with location and, therefore, will be verified during the
PED phase by examination of natural marshes in the immediate project vicinity or by other
means. The purpose of the planting is to establish desirable native aquatic vegetation before
undesirable exotic vegetation can develop. Plant material could be nursery grown or collected
from nearby sources and transplanted to the site but, for the purpose of this analysis, nursery
grown stock is assumed. The dominant planted species would be common tule (Schoenoplectus
acutus occidentalis). Other aquatic species to be planted would include various native sedge and
rush species (e.g., Cyperus eragrostis; Juncus ejfuseus; Juncus balticus; Eleocharis
rnacrostachya.). Cattail (Typha spp.) would not be planted, but is expected to colonize by
natural recruitment. Since cattail often dominates, bulrush will be planted to give this species a
head start. Ten percent of the target area would be planted with tule spaced at 3 feet on center, or
about 100 plants for each mound, assuming a ~0.53 acre plantable area. The tules would be
installed at the mid-elevation of the aquatic planting elevation zone. It would take about 11 days
of work to install plants for each 100,000 cy of placed dredged material.
Monitoring and Adaptive Management

Monitoring and adaptive management would include both physical and biological elements. The
following is a summary of the most current information from a draft monitoring and adaptive
management plan as well as any further elements to be included to comply with a Term and
Condition of this biological opinion. The plan will include necessary specifics such as success
criteria, triggers for adaptive management action, example scenarios on the use of monitoring,
implementation of actions, and reporting (report elements, report schedule). Reporting will at
least include as-built topography and plantings for the current year, comparison of as-builts from
the prior year with the current year for topography and plantings, summary information on water
quality, quantities of listed species habitat effects compared to the allowable take as defined in
this biological opinion, any adaptive management actions taken during that monitoring year, as
well as any adaptive management actions recommended for the subsequent year. This

Mr. Mark Ziminske

monitoring will continue until success criteria are met for 3 years, or longer if these criteria are
not met and adaptive management action is required. A final plan that includes all necessary
elements described here will be submitted to and approved by the Service prior to the onset
project implementation as a Term and Condition of this biological opinion.
Physical/Water QuaUty Monitoring
Physical monitoring of the sand mounds would occur at least annually, with additional
monitoring occurring after major storms or high water events. Physical monitoring would be
done by ground surveys or other appropriate methods in conjunction with annual vegetation
monitoring, as well as dredged material placement the following year. It would include mound
heights for the current year's material as well as the previously placed year. Water quality
monitoring would be done by installing remote sondes in and around the restoration site. These
sondes would take hourly readings of parameters such as temperature and dissolved oxygen to
ensure that the restoration site is maintaining suitable water circulation. Turbidity and oxygen
will also be measured during dredged material placement, at least initially. The need for
consideration of action will be determined by developing quantifiable success criteria and
triggers for possible action for topography and water quality, such as by stating allowable
differences from expected topography in the case of elevation, or comparison of water quality
parameters to a reference site.
Such monitoring can be used to verify the extent of settlement and suitable elevation locations
for the plantings, assess any erosive losses due to wave wash or tidal currents, and detect
significant movement of material from the mounds into the channels between the mounds.
Adaptive management measures could include modest excavation of the channels, adjustment in
the position of plantings, or adjustment in the height and quantity of material for future mounds,
or the timing of planting, based on any monitored differences in the settlement and compression
of sediment on existing mounds. The physical monitoring can also be used to adjust the dredged
material placement quantities and elevations in future years based on information in prior years.

If a trigger condition for water quality occurs, the Corps would commence an evaluation of the
cause of this condition by evaluating available history on meteorology, flows, and velocity
trends. As deemed appropriate, the Corps may conduct additional on-site measurements.
Example corrective measures may include placement of additional straw bales, or limited
reshaping of sediment surface to restore adequate elevations. This reshaping would be done with
a high-pressure pump and hose to excavate and move material around as needed. If it is
determined that some channels are unsuccessful and cannot be rehabilitated, these could be
abandoned and filled during the next dredged material placement season. While not expected, if
prolonged or extensive turbidity plumes occur during construction of the first few mounds, silt
curtains or fences may be used to contain this turbidity while the material settles.
Biological Monitoring
Riparian Vegetation (remnant levee): Maintenance activities as part of the riparian plant
establishment process would begin after all installation is complete and would continue through
the duration of the 3-year establishment period. Watering and weeding would ensure that

Mr. Mark Ziminske

8

individual plants are kept moist and free from competition. Mowing would ensure that the site
and plants are accessible while minimizing undesirable seedhead development and potential fire
danger. Spraying would reduce undesirable herbaceous competition, allowing the native grasses
a greater opportunity to establish. Any herbicides used would be in compliance with water
quality standards.
During the establishment period, all riparian plants would be surveyed in the fall before they lose
their leaves. All dead terrestrial plants would be identified and replaced that same fall for the
first two years of establishment. Based on historical data, it is expected that mortality would be
below 20% for each of the first two years. Replacement plants would be with the same species
that it is replacing, using the same size container as was originally planted, unless it is
determined that another species would be more appropriate to the site. Where it becomes evident
a particular species is not conducive to the site, a different species would be substituted to ensure
success.
A riparian plant survival survey would be performed at the end of each establishment year and a
report would be prepared. Information to be included in reporting would include the monthly
maintenance records, plant survey totals, and observations and recommendations of how to
improve the site. As-builts would be prepared and kept current of what was planted, how much
was planted, and where it was planted.
Riparian plantings would be monitored for the percent cover of invasive plant species versus
native plant species. Success would be based on maintaining dominance of native cover, and
non-native species cover below a maximum allowable percentage for three years. Corrective
measures would include an assessment of the monitoring results to identify cause(s). Adaptive
management measures may include: replanting, additional non-native control actions involving
physical removal or herbicide, supplemental irrigation, or caging or staking of individual plants.
Aquatic Vegetation (mounds): The restoration objective for the mounds is to have natural
recruitment and plantings create a surface which would be diverse, resilient, and sustainable.
The planted areas are expected to be able to resist erosion, while being capable of accreting
sediment. Habitat benefits provided by the planted areas include food production, shelter,
nesting, and foraging functions for both aquatic and water-associated wildlife. Success criteria
and triggers for potential adaptive management action will be based on the percent vegetative
cover of the plantable area, the maximum allowable percent non-native vegetative coverage in
that plantable area, and water quality parameters. Though not yet included in the draft plan,
potential non-native submerged or floating vegetation below the emergent plant zone will also be
monitored in compliance with a Term and Condition of this biological opinion.

A monitoring and adaptive management plan has been prepared for the proposed action and will
address challenges in meeting restoration success (i.e., lack of vegetative growth, increased
turbidity, etc.). If a condition is observed or measured that may merit action, corrective
measures would first involve an assessment of the monitoring results to identify cause(s), and a
decision made whether or not to enact a measure, or to merely continue to monitor. Potential
measures include but are not be limited to: replanting, additional non-native control actions, and
physical adjustment to sand mound formations. In addition to the stated success criteria, the first

Mr. Mark Ziminske

9

year of dredged material placement and associated physical and biological monitoring is
expected to inform implementation in the following years. This may include adjustments in the
dredged material placed to form each mound, the spacing of mounds, the area of mounds, or
additional fill on or between existing mounds.
For both riparian and aquatic vegetation, monitoring would involve sampling during the peak of
the growing season, and would also include collecting a drone image which would be evaluated
to estimate percent cover by native and non-native species. A general survey would be done by
boat, during which general observations would be made of plant fitness/health, native species
recruitment, drought stress, and other qualitative factors. Irrigation and fencing would also be
checked. A general inventory of wildlife would be done. Annual monitoring reports would be
submitted to the Service with any recommended adaptive management measures.

Food Web: Sampling of various metrics of the presence of food organisms produced in restored
marsh is not yet proposed in the draft plan but will be included in the final monitoring plan in
compliance with a Term and Condition of this biological opinion. The purpose of this
monitoring is to assess how the restored marsh from this project compares to reference sites such
as nearby unrestored areas or other functioning marsh areas. Typical parameters involve
plankton (zooplankton, phytoplankton, chlorophyll a), and invertebrates within the benthos and
on plant or sediment surfaces. Specifics are not available at this time.
Fish: Fish monitoring is not yet proposed in the draft plan, nor required by this biological
opinion. If fish monitoring is included in the final plan, it will be with a non-intrusive method
such as by visual observation or sonar that does not result in take of delta smelt.

Long Term Maintenance
Completed functional portions of the restoration site will be turned over to the non-Federal
sponsor for oversight. Prior to being turned over, the Corps will prepare an Operation
Maintenance Repair Replacement and Rehabilitation (OMRRR) manual that describes
maintenance requirements. Because the goal of the project is to create self-sustaining habitat,
significant maintenance needs are not expected. The types of activities within an OMRRR
manual for this project would be minimal, such as signs, containment barriers, or other protective
measures. There would be a periodic inspection of these areas on an annual or biannual basis to
monitor them for any severe adverse effects. The East Bay Regional Park District will manage
public recreational use of the site consistent with their resource protection mandate.

Conservation Measures
General Measure
•

A monitoring and adaptive management plan would be implemented throughout
construction and three years following completion, so that adjustments can be made to
optimize environmental benefits and minimize unanticipated impacts.

Mr. Mark Ziminske

Delta Smelt Measures
•
•

•

All in-water work will be completed between August 1 and November 30.
A qualified biologist would provide environmental awareness training to contractors and
construction crews regarding listed fish species known to potentially occur near
construction sites.
Lines of hay bales installed for the purpose of limiting the effect of current or wave
erosion would not be fully enclosing, and would be set at an elevation that allows for
total submergence during high tide levels.

Giant Garter Snake Measures
•
•
•

•

•
•
•
•

Land-based construction would be initiated during the giant garter snake active period
(May 1 through October 1).
Contractors and construction personnel will participate in Service-approved worker
environmental awareness training by a qualified biologist.
A giant garter snake survey will be conducted 24 hours prior to the onset of work in
potential habitat (i.e., the footprints of levee roads to be improved, placement of the
pipeline on land, and removal of vegetation on the remnant levee). If there is an
interruption of work longer than two weeks, the area will be resurveyed again no later
than 24 hours before the resumption of work.
If a giant garter snake is found in the work area, work will be stopped and remain stopped
until the snake leaves the work area. Construction staff must notify appropriate Corps
environmental personnel immediately.
No worker is to handle or otherwise move or harass a giant garter snake.
Report any snake sightings and any incidental take to the Service immediately, by
telephone at (916) 930-5604.
Equipment or materials and the immediate ground surface in staging areas will be
inspected for snakes before each day of use.
Vehicles will be limited to a speed of not more than 15 mph on access roads.

Action Area

The action area is defined in 50 CFR § 402.02, as "all areas to be affected directly or indirectly
by the Federal action and not merely the immediate area involved in the action." For the
purposes of the effects assessment, the action area includes all areas where any activity
associated with the project may occur, including construction, adaptive management, and
monitoring as noted in the project description, as well as areas which are affected by these
activities. This includes the activities of pipeline construction, dredged material placement,
planting, staging activities, operation of equipment and vehicles, sampling for monitoring, and
any additional construction deemed a necessary adaptive management measure as determined by
consideration of the monitoring results. The areas where these activities occur are the initial
dredged material placement locations, areas where dredged material may subsequently move
through settlement, wave erosion, and/or tidal flows, terrestrial and aquatic footprints of the
pipeline at any time during the placement period, access roads and staging areas, any part of the
remnant levee of Big Break which would be subject to non-native removal and replanting, the

Mr. Mark Ziminske

11

aquatic area of Big Break including placement of both dredged material and straw bales, and any
nearby aquatic area that may be affected in terms of turbidity or other water quality parameters,
during placement (i.e., generally within~ 100 feet of the outermost perimeter of disturbance).
Analytical Framework for the Jeopardy Determination
Section 7(a)(2) of the Act requires that Federal agencies ensure that any action they authorize,
fund or carry out, is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence oflisted species.
"Jeopardize the continued existence of... " means to engage in an action that would reasonably be
expected, either directly or indirectly, to appreciably reduce the likelihood of both the survival
and recovery of a listed species in the wild by reducing reproduction, numbers, or distribution of
that species (50 CFR § 402.02).
The jeopardy analysis in this biological opinion considers the effects of the proposed Federal
action and any cumulative effects on the rangewide survival and recovery of the listed species
being consulted on. There are four components of this analysis for each species: (1) the Status
of the Species, which evaluates the species' range-wide condition, the factors responsible for that
condition, and its survival and recovery needs; (2) the Environmental Baseline, which evaluates
the condition of species in the action area, the factors responsible for that condition, and the
relationship of the action area to the survival and recovery of the species; (3) the Effects of the
Action, which determines the direct and indirect impacts of the proposed Federal action and the
effects of any interrelated or interdependent activities on the species; and (4) Cumulative Effects,
which evaluates the effects of future, non-Federal activities in the action area on the species.
Analytical Framework for the Adverse Modification Determination
Section 7(a)(2) of the Act requires that Federal agencies ensure that any action they authorize,
fund or carry out, is not likely to modify designated critical habitat. A final rule revising the
regulatory definition of "destruction or adverse modification" was published on February 11,
2016 (81 FR 7214), and became effective March 14, 2016. The revised definition states:
"Destruction or adverse modification means a direct or indirect alteration that
appreciably diminishes the value of critical habitat for the conservation of a listed
species. Such alterations may include, but are not limited to, those that alter the
physical or biological features essential to the conservation of a species or that
preclude or significantly delay development of such features."
The destruction or adverse modification analysis in this biological opinion relies on four
components: (1) the Status of Critical Habitat, which evaluates the range-wide condition of
critical habitat for the delta smelt in terms of primary constituent elements (PCEs), that provide
for the conservation of the listed species, the factors responsible for that condition, and the
intended value of the critical habitat overall for the conservation/recovery of the species; (2) the
Environmental Baseline, which analyzes the condition of the critical habitat in the action area,
the factors responsible for that condition, and the value of the critical habitat in the action area
for the conservation/recover of the species; (3) the Effects of the Action, which determines the
direct and indirect impacts of the proposed Federal action and the effects of any interrelated or

Mr. Mark Ziminske

12

interdependent activities on the PCEs and how those impacts are likely to influence the
conservation value of the affected critical habitat units and; (4) Cumulative Effects, which
evaluates the effects on the PCEs of future non-Federal activities that are reasonably certain to
occur in the action area and how those impacts are likely to influence the conservation value of
the affected critical habitat units.
For purposes of the adverse modification determination, the Service evaluates if the effects of the
proposed Federal action together with cumulative effects are likely to impair or preclude the
capacity of delta smelt critical habitat in the action area to serve its intended function, to an
extent that it appreciably diminishes the range-wide value of that critical habit for conservation
of the species. The key to making this finding is understanding the value of the critical habitat in
the action area for the conservation/recovery of the listed species based on the Environmental
Baseline analysis.
Status of the Delta Smelt

Legal Status
The Service proposed to list the delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) as threatened with
proposed critical habitat on October 3, 1991 (Service 1991). The Service listed the delta smelt as
threatened on March 5, 1993 (Service 1993), and designated critical habitat for the species on
December 19, 1994 (Service 1994). The delta smelt was one of eight fish species addressed in
the Recovery Plan for the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Native Fishes (Service 1996), and a
revision addressing delta smelt is currently underway. A 5-year status review of the delta smelt
was completed on March 31, 2004 (Service 2004). The 2004 review concluded that delta smelt
remained a threatened species. A subsequent 5-year status review recommended uplisting delta
smelt from threatened to endangered (Service 2010a). A 12-month finding on a petition to
reclassify the delta smelt as an endangered species was completed on April 7, 2010 (Service
201 Ob). After reviewing all available scientific and commercial information, the Service
determined that re-classifying the delta smelt from a threatened to an endangered species was
warranted but precluded by other higher priority listing actions (Service 2010c). The Service
annually reviews the status and uplisting recommendation for delta smelt during its Candidate
Notice of Review (CNOR) process. Each year, the CNOR has recommended the uplisting from
threatened to endangered. Electronic copies of these documents are available at
http://ecos.fws.gov/docs/five_year_review/doc3570.pdf and http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR2013-l 1-22/pdf/2013-27391.pdf (Service 2010a; Service 2010b; Service 2012b).

Description and Life Cycle
The delta smelt is a small fish of the family Osmeridae. It is endemic to the San Francisco BayDelta where it primarily occupies open-water habitats in Suisun Bay and marsh and the
Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. The delta smelt is primarily an annual species, meaning that it
completes its life cycle in one year which typically occurs from April to the following April plus
or minus one or two months. In captivity delta smelt can survive to spawn at two years of age
(Lindberg et al. 2013), but this appears to be rare in the wild (Bennett 2005). Very few
individuals reach lengths over 3.5 inches (90 millimeters [mm]).

Population Numbers
The 2017 CDFW Fall Midwater Trawl (FMWT) Index was 2, the lowest on record. The CDFW
Spring Kodiak Trawl (SKT) monitors the adult spawning stock of delta smelt and serves as an
indication for the relative number and distribution of spawners in the system. Last year the 2017
SKT Abundance Index was 3.8, the third lowest on record. The 2018 SKT Abundance index
was 2.1, the second lowest on record. All CDFW relative abundance indices show a declining
trend following the extreme drought conditions in 2013-2015 and are discussed further below.
In 2016, the Service began calculating an absolute abundance estimate utilizing January and
February SKT catch data. The data for each of the previous years was used to calculate a range
of estimated adult spawner abundance for that year. 1 This calculation was modified in 2017 and
resulting ranges and point estimates are shown in Table 3.
The 2018 absolute abundance estimate is the second lowest following 2016. The January
through February 2016 point estimates were the lowest since the SKT survey began in 2002 and
suggested delta smelt experienced increased mortality during the extreme drought conditions
occurring during 2013-2015. While the estimate increased slightly in 2017, it has fallen again in
2018. The continued low parental stock of delta smelt relative to historical numbers suggest the
population will continue to be vulnerable to stochastic events and operational changes that may
occur in response until successive years of increased population growth results in a substantial
increase in abundance.
In addition to these abundance estimates, the CDFW conducts four fish surveys from which it
develops indices of delta smelt's relative abundance. Each survey has variable and unquantified
capture efficiency, and in each, the frequency of zero catches of delta smelt is very high, largely
due to the species' rarity (e.g., Latour 2016; Polansky et al. 2017). The [summer] Townet
Survey (TNS) is the longest running indicator of delta smelt relative abundance; it has been
conducted since 1959. Although this survey was designed to index the relative abundance of
metamorphosing juvenile striped bass (Marone saxatilis) {Turner and Chadwick 1972), delta
smelt have been collected incidentally; most of the delta smelt captured are age-0 and about 2040 mm in length (Miller 2000). The FMWT is the second longest running indicator of delta
smelt relative abundance; it has been conducted since 1967. This survey was also designed to
index the relative abundance of age-0 striped bass (Stevens 1977), but as with the TNS, delta
smelt are collected incidentally (Stevens and Miller 1983). Most of the delta smelt captured by
the FMWT are age-0 "subadults" and are about 50-70 mm in length (Sweetnam 1999). The 20mm Survey is the third longest running indicator of delta smelt relative abundance; it has been
conducted since 1995. This survey was designed to monitor the distribution oflate larval or
metamorphosing juvenile delta smelt to assess their distribution and risk of entrainment into the
large water export diversions of the CVP and State Water Project (SWP) (Dege and Brown
2004). As its name suggests, most of the delta smelt collected by the 20-mm Survey are about
I The Service completed a revised adult delta smelt abundance estimation procedure based on CDFW's SKT data for January
and February (see Table 3). This procedure has been updated from that used in 2016. While these estimates likely represent a
minimum population size due to the method reliance on survey data, this is our current best estimate of the annual population
size. The actual delta smelt spawner population during January and February of any given year likely fell within the upper and
lower confidence interval for that year identified in the final column above.

10-30 tntn in length, with a peak catch of fish just under 20 mm (Kimmerer 2008). The newest
indicator of delta smelt relative abundance is the SKT Survey, which has been conducted since
2002. This survey was designed to monitor the distribution of pre-spawn and spawning adult
delta smelt to assess their distribution and risk of entraintnent. l'v1ost of the delta smelt captured
in the SKT are 60-80 mm in length (Bennett 2005).
The TNS and Fl'v1WT abundance indices for delta smelt have documented the species' long-term
decline, while the newer 20-mm and SKT abundance indices have generally confirmed the recent
portions of the trends implied by the older surveys (Figures 7 and 8). During the period of
record, juvenile delta smelt relative abundance has declined from peak levels observed during the
latter 1970s (Figure 2), while subadult relative abundance was at its highest in 1970, and
similarly high in 1980 (Figure 3). Juvenile and subadult abundance indices both declined rapidly
during the early 1980s, increased somewhat during the 1990s, and then collapsed in the early

15

variation than their 20-mm and SKT analogs, but overall, the trends in both sets of indices are
similar. During the past decade, each index has frequently reached new record low levels. The
TNS index was 0.0 in 2015 and 2016, and the 2015 FMWT index and subsequent 2016 SKT
index were record lows (about one half of one percent of the relative abundance recorded in
1970-1971).
The abundance of adult delta smelt may have exceeded twenty million in 1980-1981 (Rose et al.
2013b ). This may sound like a large number - and it is compared to the contemporary estimates
listed in Table 4. However, decades of monitoring by CDFW has shown that the delta smelt has
usually not been very abundant when compared to other pelagic (meaning offshore-oriented or
open-water) fishes (Figure 4). In the TNS, delta smelt catches have usually been lower than age0 striped bass, and in recent years, also lower than gobies and threadfin shad. In the FMWT,
delta smelt catches have been persistently lower than at least five other species. Research and
monitoring in shallower habitats like Suisun Marsh (Moyle et al. 1986; Matern et al. 2002),
Delta beaches (Nobriga et al. 2005), and small tidal marshes in the upper estuary (Gewant and
Bollens 2012) have reported even lower relative abundances of delta smelt. In each of the
studies cited, the catches of delta smelt represented less than one percent of the total fish catch
and there were usually more than a dozen more abundant fish species.

The long-term rarity of the delta smelt has had a consequence for understanding the reasons for
their population decline, which generates uncertainty about how resource managers should
intervene. Some pelagic fishes have shown long-term relationships between Delta inflow, Delta
outflow and their abundance or survival (Stevens and Miller 1983; Jassby et al. 1995; Kimmerer

2002b; Kimmerer et al. 2009). There does seem to be some difference in the likelihood of
whether the delta smelt population will increase or decrease in abundance from one year to the
next based on hydrology (Figure 5), but there has never been any predictable relationship linking
freshwater flow conditions to the relative abundance of delta smelt (Stevens and Miller 1983;
Jassby et al. 1995; Kimmerer 2002b; Kimmerer et al. 2009). Recently, several teams of
researchers have built several varieties of conceptual (Interagency Ecological Program [IEP]
2015) and mathematical (Thomson et al. 2010; Maunder and Deriso 2011; Miller et al. 2012;
Rose et al. 2013a) life cycle models for the delta smelt that attempt to describe the reasons the
population has declined. Some of these models have been able to recreate the trend observed in
abundance indices very well (Figure 6), but they have all done so using different approaches and
different variables to do so. Collectively, these modeling efforts have been helpful in that they
generally support water temperature and changes in the estuary's food web as 'universally
supported' factors affecting delta smelt. However, they have also come to very different
conclusions about the conservation value of more readily manageable factors like water project
operations.

Figure 5. Frequencies of delta smelt population increases or decreases (red colored portions of each
bar occurring below zero) based on the CDFW's FMWT Survey, 1967-2015. A population increase
reflects an increase in relative abundance over the prior year's index and a population decrease
reflects a decrease in relative abundance compared to the prior year's index. The Service
performed bootstrap resampling on each year's catch per tow to generate a mean catch per tow
with 95 percent confidence intervals. This resulted in four possible outcomes: (1) a statistically
significant increase in relative abundance from one year to the next in which the confidence
intervals of the two years did not overlap ("Up"; solid blue bar segments), (2) a statistically non-

significant increase in relative abundance from one year to the next in which the confidence
intervals of the two years overlapped ("Maybe Up"; lighter blue bar segments), (3) a statistically

intervals of the two years did not overlap ("Down"; solid red bar segments), or (4) a statistically

intervals of the two years overlapped ("Maybe Down"; lighter red bar segments). The counts in
each of the four categories were combined by Sacramento Valley WY types except that belownormal years were not plotted. The frequencies of population decline were converted into a
negative number so that population increases would count up from the zero line on the y-axis and
population decreases would count down from the zero line.

Habitat and Distribution

Because the delta smelt only lives in part of one comprehensively monitored estuary, its general
distribution is well understood (Moyle et al. 1992; Bennett 2005; Hobbs et al. 2006, 2007;
Feyrer et al. 2007; Nobriga et al. 2008; Kimmerer et al. 2009; Merz et al. 2011; Murphy and
Hamilton 2013; Sommer and Mejia 2013). There are both location-based (e.g., Sacramento
River around Decker Island) and conditions-based (low-salinity zone) habitats that delta smelt
permanently occupy. There are habitats that delta smelt occupy seasonally (e.g., for spawning),
and there are habitats that delta smelt occupy transiently, which we define here as occasional
seasonal use. These include distribution extremes from which delta smelt are not collected every
year or even in most years.
Most delta smelt complete their entire life cycle within or immediately upstream of the estuary's
low-salinity zone. The low-salinity zone is frequently defined as waters with a salinity range of
about 0.5 to 6 parts per thousand (ppt) (Kimmerer 2004). The 0.5 to 6 ppt and similar salinity
ranges reported by different authors were chosen based on analyses of historical peaks in
phytoplankton and zooplankton abundance, but recent physiological and molecular biological
research has indicated that the salinities that typify the low-salinity zone are also optimal for
delta smelt (Komoroske et al. 2016). The low-salinity zone is a dynamic habitat with size and
location that respond rapidly to changes in tidal and river flows. By local convention the
location of the low-salinity zone is described as "X2" in terms of the distance from the 2 ppt
isohaline to the Golden Gate Bridge. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently
finished a comprehensive set of maps that show how the low-salinity zone changes in size and
shape when freshwater flows change the location ofX2 2 . The low-salinity zone expands and
moves downstream when river flows into the estuary are high, placing low-salinity water over a
larger and more diverse set of nominal habitat types than occurs under low flow conditions.
During periods of low outflow, the low-salinity zone contracts and moves upstream. Due to its
historical importance as a fish nursery habitat, there is a long research history into the physics
and biology of the San Francisco Estuary's low-salinity zone (Kimmerer 2004).
The ecological function of the low-salinity zone also varies depending mainly on freshwater flow
(Jassby et al. 1995; Kimmerer 2002a; Kimmerer 2004). Low outflow can decrease the capacity
of the low-salinity zone and adjacent habitats to support the production of delta smelt by
reducing habitat diversity and concentrating the fish with their predators and competitors
(Service 1993, 1994). During the past four decades, the low-salinity zone ecosystem has
undergone substantial changes in turbidity (Schoellhamer 2011) and food web function (Winder
and Jassby 2011) that cannot be undone solely by increasing Delta outflow. These habitat
changes, which extend into parts of the Delta where water is fresher than 0.5 ppt, have also
decreased the ability of the low-salinity zone and adjacent habitats to support the production of
delta smelt (Thomson et al. 2010; Rose et al. 2013b; IEP 2015).
Delta smelt have been observed as far west as San Francisco Bay, as far north as Knights
Landing on the Sacramento River, as far east as Woodbridge on the Mokelumne River and
2

Stockton on the Calaveras River, and as far south as Mossdale on the San Joaquin River. This
distribution represents a range of salinity from essentially zero ppt up to about 20 ppt, which
represents a salinity range well beyond definitions of the low salinity zone or mixing zone near a
salinity of2 ppt emphasized in the critical habitat rule (Service 1994). It is also well beyond the
geographic extent of the critical habitat rule (described below). However, most delta smelt that
have been collected in the extensively surveyed San Francisco Estuary have been collected from
locations within the bounds defined in the critical habitat rule. In addition, all habitats known to
be occupied year-around by delta smelt occur within the bounds defined in the critical habitat
rule.
Delta smelt permanently occupy the Cache Slough 'Complex', including Liberty Island and the
adjacent reach of the Sacramento Deepwater Shipping Channel (Sommer and Mejia 2013),
Cache Slough to its confluence with the Sacramento River and the Sacramento River from that
confluence downstream to Chipps Island, Honker Bay, and the eastern part of Montezuma
Slough (Figure 7). The reasons delta smelt are believed to permanently occupy this part of the
estuary are the year-round presence of fresh- to low-salinity water that is comparatively turbid
and of a tolerable water temperature. These appropriate water quality conditions overlap an
underwater landscape featuring variation in depth, tidal current velocities, edge habitats, and
food production (Sweetnam 1999; Nobriga et al. 2008; Feyrer et al. 2011; Murphy and Hamilton
2013; Hammock et al. 2015; Bever et al. 2016). Field observations are increasingly supported
by laboratory research that explains how delta smelt respond physiologically to variation in
salinity, turbidity, water temperature, and other aspects of their habitat that can vary with
changes in climate, freshwater flow and estuarine bathymetry (Hasenbein et al. 2014; 2016;
Komoroske et al. 2014; 2016).
Each year, the distribution of delta smelt seasonally expands when adults disperse in response to
winter flow increases that also coincide with seasonal increases in turbidity and decreases in
water temperature (Figure 12). The annual range expansion of adult delta smelt extends up the
Sacramento River to about Garcia Bend in the Pocket neighborhood of Sacramento, up the San
Joaquin River from Antioch to areas near Stockton, up the lower Mokelumne River system, and
west throughout Suisun Bay and Suisun Marsh. Some delta smelt seasonally and transiently
occupy Old and Middle river in the south Delta each year, but face a high risk of entrainment
when they do (Grimaldo et al. 2009).
The distribution of delta smelt occasionally expands beyond this area (Figure 6). For instance,
during high outflow winters, adult delta smelt also disperse west into San Pablo Bay and up into
the Napa River (Hobbs et al. 2007). Similarly, delta smelt have occasionally been reported from
the Sacramento River north of Garcia Bend up to Knights Landing (e.g., Merz et al. 2011;
Vincik and Julienne 2012).
The expanded adult distribution initially affects the distribution of the next generation because
delta smelt eggs are adhesive and not believed to be highly mobile once they are spawned. The
distribution oflarvae reflects a combination of where spawning occurred and freshwater flow
conditions when the eggs hatched. Variation in Delta outflow affects the spatial distribution of
the delta smelt population for most of its life. The ecological condition of the estuary's lowsalinity zone has historically been indexed using a statistic called X2, a local name for the

Mr. Mark Ziminske

21

geographic location of2 ppt salinity near the bottom of the water column (Jassby et al. 1995).
During spring, larval delta smelt have centers of distribution in freshwater, typically 20-40 km
upstream ofX2 (Dege and Brown 2004). By July, as water temperatures in the Delta reach
annual peaks, post-larval and juvenile delta smelt have centers of distribution very close to X2
(Dege and Brown 2004), but the fish are broadly distributed around that peak (Sweetnam 1999;
Nobriga et al. 2008). During the fall, subadult delta smelt still have a center of distribution near
X2 (Sommer et al. 2011), and remain broadly distributed around that peak (Feyrer et al. 2007;
2011). During the winter, maturing adult delta smelt disperse in connection with winter storms
following the spread of turbid freshwater (Grimaldo et al. 2009; Sommer et al. 2011 ; Murphy
and Hamilton 2013). Recent analyses suggest that after an initial dispersal in December, the

adult delta smelt population does not respond strongly to variation in Delta outflow during
January to May (Polansky et al. 2017), though some individuals continue to move around in
response to flow changes associated with storms (Polansky, unpublished analysis of Early
Warning Survey data set).

Mr. Mark Ziminske

Food

At all life stages, numerous small planktonic crustaceans, especially a group called calanoid
copepods, make up most of the delta smelt diet (Nobriga 2002; Slater and Baxter 2014). Small
crustaceans are ubiquitously distributed throughout the estuary, but which prey species are
present at particular times and locations has changed dramatically over time (Winder and Jassby
2011; Kratina et al. 2014). This has likely affected delta smelt feeding success, particularly
during Central California's warm summers.
Reproductive Strategy

The reproductive behavior of delta smelt is only known from captive specimens spawned in
artificial environments and most of the information has never been published. Spawning likely
occurs mainly at night with several males attending a female that broadcasts her eggs onto
bottom substrate (Bennett 2005). Although preferred spawning substrate is unknown, spawning
habits of delta smelt's closest relative, the surf smelt (Hypomesus pretiosus), as well as
unpublished experimental trials, suggest that sand may be the preferred substrate (Bennett 2005).
Hatching success peaks at temperatures of 15-16°C (59-61°F) and decreases at cooler and
warmer temperatures. Hatching success nears zero percent as water temperatures exceed 20°C
(68°F) (Bennett 2005). Water temperatures suitable for spawning occur most frequently during
the months of March-May, but ripe female delta smelt have been observed as early as January
and larvae have been collected as late as July. Delta smelt spawn in the estuary and have one
spawning season for each generation, which makes the timing and duration of the spawning
season important every year. As stated above, delta smelt are believed to spawn on sandy
substrates in fresh and possibly low-salinity water (Bennett 2005). Therefore, freshwater flow
affects how much of the estuary is available for delta smelt to spawn (Hobbs et al. 2007).
Delta smelt can start spawning when water temperatures reach about 10°C (50°F) and can
continue until temperatures reach about 20°C (Bennett 2005). The ideal spawning condition
occurs when water temperatures remain cool throughout the spring (e.g., March-May). Few
delta smelt:::; 55 mm in length are sexually mature and 50% of delta smelt reach sexual maturity
at 60 to 65 mm in length (Rose et al. 2013b). Thus, if water temperatures rise much above 10°C
in the winter, the "spawning season" can start before most individuals are mature enough to
actually spawn. If temperatures continue to warm rapidly toward 20°C in early spring, that can
end the spawning season with only a small fraction of ' adult' fish having had an opportunity to
spawn. Delta smelt were initially believed to spawn only once before dying (Moyle et al. 1992).
It has since been confirmed that like many other ecologically similar forage fishes (Winemiller
and Rose 1992), individual delta smelt can spawn more than once if water temperatures remain
suitable for a sufficient length of time, and if the adults find enough food to support the
production of another batch of eggs (Lindberg et al. 2013; Kurobe et al. 2016). As a result, the
longer water temperatures remain cool, the more fish have time to mature and the more times
individual fish can spawn.
Although adult delta smelt can spawn more than once, mortality is high during the spawning
season and most adults die by May (Polansky et al. 2017). The egg stage averages about 10 days
before the embryos hatch into larvae. The larval stage averages about 30 days. Metamorphosing

Mr. Mark Ziminske

"post-larvae" appear in monitoring surveys from April into July of most years. By July, most
delta smelt have reached the juvenile life stage. Delta smelt collected during the fall are called
"subadults", a stage which lasts until winter when fish disperse toward spawning habitats. This
winter dispersal usually precedes sexual maturity (Sommer et al. 2011).
Recovery and Management
Following Moyle et al. (1992), the Service (1993) indicated that SWP and CVP exports were the
primary factors contributing to the decline of delta smelt due to entrainment of larvae and
juveniles and the effects of low flow on the location and function of the estuary mixing zone
(now called the low-salinity zone). In addition, prolonged drought during 1987-1992, in-Delta
water diversions, reduction in food supplies by nonindigenous aquatic species, specifically
overbite clam and nonnative copepods, and toxicity due to agricultural and industrial chemicals
were also factors considered to be threatening the delta smelt. In the 2008 Service biological
opinion on the CVP and SWP operations (2018 Service BiOP), the Service's Reasonable and
Prudent Alternative required protection of delta smelt from entrainment in December through
June and augmentation of Delta outflow during the fall of Wet or Above-Normal years as
classified by the State of California (Service 2008). The expansion of entrainment protection for
delta smelt in the 2008 Service BiOp was in response to large increases in juvenile and adult
salvage in the early 2000s (Kimmerer 2008). The fall X2 requirement was in response to
increased fall exports that had resulted in greatly reduced variability in Delta outflow during the
fall months (Feyrer et al. 2011).
Consistent with the 2008 Service BiOp, the Service's (2010c) recommendation to uplist delta
smelt from threatened to endangered included reservoir operations and water diversions
upstream of the estuary as mechanisms interacting with exports to restrict the low-salinity zone
and concentrate delta smelt with competing fish species. In addition, Brazilian waterweed
(Egeria densa) and increasing water transparency were considered new detrimental habitat
changes. Predation was considered a low-level threat linked to increasing waterweed abundance
and increasing water transparency. Additional threats considered potentially significant by the
Service in 2010 were entrainment into power plant diversions, contaminants, and reproductive
problems that can stem from small population sizes. Conservation recommendations included:
establish Delta outflows proportionate to unimpaired flows to set outflow targets as fractions of
runoff in the Central Valley watersheds; minimize reverse flows in Old and Middle river; and,
establish a genetic management plan with the goals of minimizing the loss of genetic diversity
and limiting risk of extinction caused by unpredictable catastrophic events. The Service (2012b)
added climate change to the list of threats to the delta smelt.
Continued protection of the delta smelt from excessive entrainment, improving the estuary's
flow regime, suppression of nonnative species, increasing zooplankton abundance, and
improving water quality are among the actions needed to recover the delta smelt.
Climate Change
Climate projections for the San Francisco Bay-Delta and its watershed indicate that temperature
and precipitation changes will diminish snowpack in the Sierra-Nevada, changing the timing and

Mr. Mark Ziminske

24

availability of natural water supplies (Knowles and Cayan 2002; Dettinger 2005). Warming may
result in more precipitation falling as rain which will mean less water stored in spring
snowpacks. This would increase the frequency of rain-on-snow events and increase winter
runoff with an associated decrease in runoff for the remainder of the year (Hayhoe et al. 2004).
Overall, these and other storm track changes may lead to increased frequency of flood and
drought cycles during the 21st century (Dettinger et al. 2015). Thus far, the 21st century has been
substantially drier than the 20th century (Figure 8) to which the frequency of WY type
classifications are compared.
Sea level rise is also anticipated as a consequence of a warming global climate and if it is not
mitigated, sea level rise will likely influence saltwater intrusion into the Bay-Delta. Salinity
within the northern San Francisco Bay is projected to rise by 4.5 ppt by the end of the century
(Cloem et al. 2011 ). Elevated salinity could push X2 further eastward in the estuary if outflows
are not increased to compensate. Fall X2 mean values are projected to increase by about 7 km to
the area near the City of Antioch approximately 90 km from the Golden Gate Bridge by 2100
(Brown et al. 2013). This projected change in the location ofX2 in the fall is expected to
decrease suitable physical habitat if current levees and channel structures are maintained.

Central California's warm summers are already a source of energetic stress for delta smelt and
warm springs already severely compress the duration of their spawning season (Rose et al.
2013a,b). Central California's climate is anticipated to get warmer (Dettinger 2005). We expect
Warmer estuary temperatures to present a significant conservation challenge for delta smelt.
Mean annual water temperatures within the Delta are expected to increase steadily during the
second half of this century (Cloern et al. 2011). Warmer water temperatures could further
reduce delta smelts pawning opportunities, decrease juvenile growth during the warmest months,
an increase mortality via several food web pathways including: increased vulnerability to
predators, increased vulnerability to toxins, and decreased capacity for delta smelt to successfully
compete in an estuary that is energetically more optimal for warm-water tolerant fishes.
Recent research into the ecological effects of warming water temperatures suggests that delta
smelt, depending on location, may be forced to spawn an average of ten to twenty-five days
earlier in the season (Brown et al. 2013). The number of high mortality days (cumulative
number of days of daily average water temperature >25°C (77°F) is expected to increase (Brown
et al. 2013). The number of physiologically stressful days (cumulative number of days of daily
average water temperature >20°C (68°F) is expected to be stable or decrease partly because
many stressful days will become high mortality days. Thus, current modeling indicates that delta
smelt will likely face a shorter maturation window and reduced habitat availability due to
increased water temperatures. A shorter maturation window will likely have effects on
reproduction (Brown et al. 2013). Growth rates have been shown to slow as water temperatures
increase above 20°C (68°F), requiring delta smelt to consume more food to reach growth rates
that are normal at lower water temperatures (Rose et al. 2013a). Delta smelt are smaller, on
average, than in the past (Sweetnam 1999; Bennett 2005) and expected temperature increases
due to climate change will likely slow growth rates further.
In summary, the delta smelt is currently at the southern limit of the inland distribution of the
family Osmeridae along the Pacific coast of North America. Thus, increased temperatures
associated with climate change may present a significant conservation challenge if they result in
a Bay-Delta that is outside of the delta smelt's competitive limits. For the time being however,
water temperatures are cool enough in the delta smelt's range for the species to complete its life
cycle.
Summary of the Status ofDelta Smelt

The relative abundance of delta smelt has reached very low numbers for a small forage fish in an
ecosystem the size of the San Francisco Estuary. The extremely low recent relative abundance
reflects decades of habitat change and marginalization by non-native species that prey on and
out-compete delta smelt. The anticipated effects of climate change on the San Francisco Estuary
and watershed such as warmer water temperatures, greater salinity intrusion, lower snowpack
contribution to spring outflows from the Delta, and the potential for frequent extreme drought,
which has been experienced for the 21st century thus far (Figure 10) indicate challenges to delta
smelt survival will increase. A rebound in relative abundance during the very wet and cool
conditions during 2011 indicated that delta smelt retained some population resilience (IEP 2015).

Mr. Mark Ziminske

26

However, since 2012, declines to record low population estimates have been broadly associated
with the remarkably dry hydrology occurring from 2012 to 2016.
Status ofDelta Smelt Critical Habitat
The Service designated critical habitat for delta smelt on December 19, 1994 (Service 1994).
The geographic area encompassed by the designation includes all water and all submerged lands
below ordinary high water and the entire water column bounded by and contained in Suisun Bay
(including the contiguous Grizzly and Honker Bays); the length of Goodyear, Suisun, Cutoff,
First Mallard (Spring Branch), and Montezuma sloughs; and the existing contiguous waters
contained within the legal Delta (as defined in section 12220 of the California Water Code). The
Primary Constituent Elements (PCEs) are physical habitat (PCE #1), water (PCE #2), river flow
(PCE #3), and salinity (PCE #4).
Status of the Giant Garter Snake

The Service published a proposal to list the GGS as an endangered species on December 27,
1991 (56 FR 67046). Critical habitat has not been designated for this species. The Service
reevaluated the status of the GGS before adopting the final rule, and it was listed as a threatened
species on October 20, 1993 (58 FR 54053). A Recovery Plan was proposed for the GGS on
July 2, 1999 (Service 1999), which was later revised (Service 2015) and recently finalized
(Service 2017). In the Recovery Plan for the species, the recovery strategy focuses on protecting
existing occupied habitat, identifying and protecting areas for restoring habitat, and providing
connectivity between populations (Service 2017). A 5-year review was conducted in 2006 where
no change of status was recommended (Service 2006). An additional 5-year review was
conducted in 2012 where no change of status was recommended (Service 2012). According to
Halstead et al. (2015), habitat quality plays a central role in the population ecology of this
species, depending on factors like refuge and prey availability, vegetation type and density, and
scouring floods. Please refer to the 2017 Recovery Plan for the species' description, habitat
preference, and life history.
Habitat Loss
Historical records suggest that the GGS inhabited freshwater marshes, streams, and wetlands
along with their adjacent associated upland habitats throughout the length of the Sacramento and
San Joaquin valleys in Central California. Today only about 5 percent of its historical
wetland/upland habitat acreage remains. Nine populations were recognized in the Revised Draft
Recovery Plan following an update of the thirteen populations described in the original listing.
This change is based on recent surveys, which indicate that two populations were extirpated, and
on genetic research, which lead to the grouping together of some of the previously described
populations.
The loss and subsequent fragmentation of habitat is the primary threat to the GGS throughout the
Central Valley of California. Habitat loss has occurred from urban expansion, agricultural
conversion, and flood control. Habitat fragmentation has ultimately resulted in the GGS being
extirpated from the southern one-third of its range in the San Joaquin Valley.

Mr. Mark Ziminske

27

Other Threats
In addition to large landscape level habitat conversion, the Sacramento/ San Joaquin Delta
populations of the GOS are subject to a number of other existing and potential threats which
include roads and vehicular traffic, climate change, and predation by non-native species. The
recovery strategy is primarily focused on protecting existing, occupied habitat and identifying
and protecting areas for habitat restoration, enhancement, or creation including areas that are
needed to provide connectivity between populations. This strategy ultimately supports the
recovery goal of establishing and protecting self-sustaining populations of the GOS throughout
the full ecological, geographical, and genetic range of the species.
Climate change has been linked to increases in the frequency and intensity of weather events,
such as heat waves, droughts, and storms (Lenihan et al. 2003; California Climate Action Team
2006; IPCC 2007). Extreme events, in tum may cause mass mortality of individuals (by
affecting habitat or ecosystem characteristics, for example) and significantly contribute to
determining which species will remain or occur in natural habitats (Whitfield et al. 2007). As
California's average temperature and precipitation change, species ranges tied to climate
dependent habitats are moving northward and upward, but in the future, range contractions are
more likely than simple northward or upslope shifts (Loarie et al. 2008, 2009). Research has
already revealed correlations between climate warming and declines in amphibians and reptiles
in different parts of the world (Whitfield et al. 2007; McMenamin et al. 2008; Mitchell et al.
2008; Huey et al. 2010).
The GOS is considered a semi-aquatic species and due to its habitat preferences, giant garter
snake is subject to the detrimental effects of floods and drought. This is likely to be exacerbated
with the increase in frequency and intensity of flood and drought events due to climate change.
GOS may be displaced during a flood, buried by debris, exposed to predators, and subject to
drowning when burrows and over-wintering sites become inundated with water. GOS are not
known to occupy the area within the Sutter Bypass which is flooded regularly (Wylie et al.
2005); although snakes are known to occupy the Yolo Bypass during the active season when
flooding is unlikely (E. Hansen 2009). GOS appear to survive at least some inundation of their
burrows. Wylie observed GOS emerging from burrows after a period of inundation (G. Wylie,
U.S. Geological Survey, personal communication).
Because of the GGS's dependence upon permanent wetlands, water availability will play a
significant role in its survival and recovery. In a state where much of the wetland habitat is
maintained by managed water regimes, the lack of sufficient water supply may preclude
consistent and timely delivery of water to sustain suitable habitat for GOS. Drought conditions
place additional strains on the water allocation system. Where populations currently persist on
only marginal habitat, emergent drought or higher temperature conditions are likely to result in
high rates of mortality in the short term with the effects oflow fecundity and survivorship
persisting after the drought has ceased (McMenamin et al. 2008; Mitchell et al. 2008). It is
unknown how quickly GOS populations may rebound after severe climatic conditions,
particularly since these conditions might further exacerbate the impact from existing threats to
GOS, such as habitat loss and fragmentation, and small, isolated populations. GOS as a species

has survived recorded historic droughts, but presumably under conditions where fewer
cumulative threats existed.
Environmental Baseline in the Action Area

Delta Smelt
The action area of the proposed project includes tidal waterways of the Delta that are wholly
within critical habitat for the species. Delta smelt is an estuarine fish species whose distribution
is entirely within the Sacramento San Joaquin Delta, but it moves within this area seasonally,
migrating east and upstream in the winter and early spring months, with spawning occurring
during April through mid-May. Larval smelt move west in the spring and summer and rear in
the low salinity zone. Shallow open subtidal waters within this low salinity zone have
characteristic higher turbidity and food organism density needed for the successful rearing and
growth of delta smelt. Big Break, the focus of the action area, is one such shallow open water
area that occupies a position in the Delta that is used or potentially used at all times of the year
by delta smelt. It is located roughly in the center of the low salinity zone, near major open
waters of Suisun Bay immediately to the west, and is along the mainstem San Joaquin River
close to its confluence with the Sacramento River. This low salinity zone is known to vary in
position and extent depending on water year type and water management, however, Big Break is
regularly within that zone under most conditions and as such is considered delta smelt habitat
year round. The BA did not discuss threat factors specific to Big Break, however, this location
has a reputation as a bass fishery (black bass and striped bass) and for the presence of Brazilian
waterweed. Bass can prey on delta smelt, and Brazilian waterweed can have an indirect adverse
effect on delta smelt by reducing turbidity. Hence, while Big Break is critical habitat for delta
smelt, it is not considered the best quality habitat.
With the exception of 2015, an extremely dry and warm year with very low abundance and
limited distribution of smelt, delta smelt have been detected at sampling stations in the general
vicinity of the project area in most years (i.e., adult smelt in the Spring Kodiak Trawl Surveys
and larval smelt in the Fall Midwater Trawl Surveys, conducted by the California Department of
Fish and Wildlife). Although the species may sometimes by absent from particular stations
nearest to Big Break, the distribution of smelt in the sampling area when considering all stations
indicates that delta smelt occur throughout the year in the action area. Because of the presence
of the PCEs needed for delta smelt, the location of the project area within critical habitat, and
consistency of presence in sampling, we conclude that delta smelt are present in the action area.
Giant Garter Snake
The project is located in the western Delta. The population status of GGS in and around the
project area is largely unknown. A large portion of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta area has
not been comprehensively surveyed for GGS, primarily because the majority ofland is privately
owned and sightings within the last 10 years have been random and sporadic.
Most information on the status of the snake comes from work on agricultural and managed
refuge lands in the Sacramento Valley, however, the snake apparently is capable of long distance

Mr. Mark Ziminske

29

dispersal to the Delta and may be reproducing there. Ideal aquatic habitat for giant garter snake
includes, among other factors, absence of large predatory fish and absence of recurrent flooding
(or where flooding is probable, the nearby presence of upland refugia), features not characteristic
of the immediate vicinity of Big Break. It is nevertheless believed that historical Delta wetlands
were suitable for giant garter snakes and that they historically occupied the Delta. The recovery
plan designated a Delta Basin unit, which includes the action area for this project, as one of nine
recovery units for the species
A few snakes have been documented more recently on lands near major waterways in the
western Delta including: the Sacramento River (Sherman Island); Frank's Tract (Webb Island);
Twitchell, Jersey and Bradford Islands; and the San Joaquin River (Little Venice Island). In the
Little Venice Island sighting in 1996, several snakes were seen, including one which moved into
riprap. The Jersey Island record, nearest to the project area and most recent (2017), involved
seven snakes basking on riprap shoreline seen on two consecutive days, and collection of ten
snake skin sheds in the vicinity. Recent photographs of the remnant levee in the project area
indicate the presence of both marsh and upland vegetation, and aerial images show what appears
may be some non-tidal water within the remnant levee, so that all habitat components sufficient
to support the snake may be present in that location. The distribution of the snake and range of
habitat types in which it has been observed, including records near the project area, lead us to
conclude that the snake is present in the project area.
Effects of the Proposed Action
Delta smelt
For the purposes of this consultation, Shallow Water Habitat (SWH)- that habitat which is
assumed to be used by delta smelt and for which direct effects may occur - is bounded by an
upper limit at Mean High Water (MHW), and a lower limit 3 meters below MLLW. Under
current conditions and without the project, the entirety of the 340 acres of Big Break is within
this SWH zone, and is considered usable by delta smelt. With the project, with dredged material
placement and planting, these depths would be reduced; about 90 acres would become vegetated,
and the remainder (250 acre) would be initially unvegetated and shallower. Additionally, the
mounds would be overfilled to allow for settling and spreading, so that approximately 20% of the
mound would be above MHW and a small amount above MHHW. This would settle, with a
small portion, perhaps a few percent of the area, remaining above MHW. Over time, accretion
of organic matter and sediment could increase the proportion above MHW. Delta smelt typically
use open, subtidal waters. Therefore, elevating the surface and allowing for vegetation on a
portion of that surface would incrementally reduce the aerial extent and change the quality of
SWH that may be occupied by delta smelt. However, this SWH and the region as a whole has
limited diversity and productivity due to the historic loss of tidal marshes, past subsidence, and
uniform depth. As explained further below, we expect the proposed project to result in a net
benefit to delta smelt and other fish species, offsetting any losses in SWH.
Temporary effects on delta smelt could occur during actions in SWH, during placement of
dredged material placement and submerged section of pipeline, and if adjustment to the mound
elevation is needed by adaptive management. Any delta smelt present would likely at least be

Mr. Mark Ziminske

30

displaced during the placement activities, which involves a point of release and initial creation of
sand mounds, each about 1.6 acre in area. Delta smelt could be injured or killed by the falling
sediment, although this effect would be very localized.
Noise would be created by the pumps and generators associated with dredged material
placement, and by the sound of material moving through the pipeline. As noted in the
supplemental smelt analysis provided by the Corps (see Consultation History), this noise would
not be at a level or frequency that could cause injury to any fish. Because dredging and dredged
material placement could occur at night, light associated with these activities may modestly
affect fish including delta smelt, perhaps attracting them towards the release point of dredged
material. Both noise and light effects, if they occur, would be very limited in spatial extent at
any one time (~2 acres). The duration of temporary effects during initial construction would
total 150 days in 15+ day increments over about 10 years. The effect of adaptive management
actions cannot be easily quantified, but probably would be on the order of 2-5 acres of surface
reshaping of recently created mound habitat during the first 3-5 years of construction. Beyond
then, it is assumed that any adjustments in mound creation will have been made so that the
remainder of the project can be constructed with minimal further need for physical disturbance
from adaptive management.
Over time, the restored area with its mix of vegetated and unvegetated shallower waters and
channels will provide a greater diversity of habitat depths, velocities, and vegetative cover, than
is currently present in Big Break. This would provide additional edge habitat that could be used
by smelt as spawning habitat or current refuge. The marsh vegetation, while not the traditional
habitat type for smelt, would produce plant material in the form of vascular plants as well as
attached algae and surface invertebrates. The organic matter from senescence of marsh
vegetation and the food organisms are all subject to transport by tidal flows into the surrounding
waters, where they would contribute to the food base for delta smelt and other fishes. Turbidity,
a factor required by delta smelt, could be locally reduced by marsh vegetation attenuating windbased resuspension or trapping some of these sediments on the marsh plain. Predators on small
fish (including smelt) such as larger fish and wading birds, may concentrate in and around the
restored marsh and channels and result in some loss of delta smelt. Non-native plants may
accumulate, which could affect turbidity and water quality.
Over the course of construction, implementing the monitoring and adaptive management plan
and any needed corrective measures or adjustments in design would serve to minimize
unanticipated project impacts and maximize benefits. However, these corrective measures could
themselves have temporary impacts, such as may occur if there were a need to recontour the
mounds or channels, or remove or retreat vegetation. Based on the results demonstrating the
successful use of dredged material for restoration at Donlan and Venice Cut Islands (Corps and
Service 1990) we believe the likelihood of such success at Big Break is at least as high, if not
better, because it is not surrounded by remnant levees that might limit tidal circulation. Overall,
we conclude that any adverse effects on delta smelt would be temporary and limited in area,
while the longer term net effect of the restoration on delta smelt would be beneficial.

Mr. Mark Ziminske

Delta smelt critical habitat
The project is entirely located within designated critical habitat for delta smelt. There would be
temporary adverse effects of turbidity on PCE #2 (Water), during dredged material placement.
There would be permanent modification of PCE #1 (Physical Habitat), due to the depths being
shallower with the placed dredged material, and portions of these surfaces planted with or
becoming colonized by emergent marsh vegetation. Initially, each dredged material mound
would have a portion of the surface above MHW, which would reduce the critical habitat. This
material would settle within 10 months such that the surface is returned to being entirely or
almost entirely below MHW. Over the long term, the surface is expected to accrete sediment
and organic matter, which could again reduce the proportion below MHW. The project is not
expected to have any adverse effect on PCE #3 (river flow) or PCE #4 (salinity).
Giant garter snake
Snakes could be harassed, injured, or killed, during construction of the project or implementation
of adaptive management measures that involve further construction or disturbance. Basking
snakes may be encountered by vehicles traveling on access roads. Snakes may be affected in the
areas of ground disturbance, namely, the surfacing of the access road and placement of the
pipeline across Jersey Island, and any non-native treatment/removal and replanting of the
remnant levee. Resting snakes may hide beneath or in crevices of construction equipment or
materials in staging areas. Implementing the proposed conservation measures, involving
checking staging area equipment and materials, limiting road vehicle speed, and checking
construction areas, should serve to minimize these effects.
The dredged material placement and plantings will create marsh in the tidal waters of Big
Break. These would contain some, but not all, of the habitat characteristics typical of giant
garter snake habitat studied in the Central Valley, although little is known about its habits in the
Delta. The marsh would start in small amounts, much less than an acre per mound initially, with
no upland habitat component of the type believed to be required by snakes (i.e., above MHHW),
and separated from other mounds by several hundred feet of tidal open water. The nearest
upland, the remnant levee, would also be separated from the marsh by 600 feet of open water,
and is vegetated in a manner that may limit basking areas there. Over a longer period of time
(years), the restored shallow water habitat mounds and spaces between them may accrete enough
sediment to allow additional marsh vegetation to grow together into a larger block of marsh,
which would be more likely to harbor giant garter snakes. By then, however, all potential
construction and adaptive management actions would have been completed, and the effect on
any giant garter snakes present would be beneficial by providing additional marsh habitat.

Cumulative Effects
Cumulative effects include the effects of future State, Tribal, local, or private actions that are
reasonably certain to occur in the action area considered in this biological opinion. The Dutch
Slough Tidal Restoration Project is another tidal restoration on 1, 178 acres immediately adjacent

Mr. Mark Ziminske

32

to and southeast of the action area, involving creating a large area of tidal marsh and channel
complex favored by native Delta species. Taken together, the proposed project and the Dutch
Slough project would amplify the types of net benefits of tidal restoration described above.
Conclusion

After reviewing the current status of delta smelt and giant garter snake, the environmental
baseline for the action area, the effects of the proposed action, and the cumulative effects, it is
the Service's biological opinion that the proposed Delta Study is not likely to jeopardize the
continued existence of these species. This conclusion is based on: (1) implementation of the
conservation measures to minimize adverse effects on listed species during construction and
adaptive management; (2) the effects of construction, in each year, are expected to be limited in
area and duration; and (3) the project will result in more diverse and more productive wetland
and channel habitat that will enhance the food web in the vicinity, including food organisms used
by delta smelt and other pelagic fish species.
INCIDENTAL TAKE STATEMENT

Section 9 of the Act and Federal regulation pursuant to section 4(d) of the Act prohibit the take
of endangered and threatened species, respectively, without special exemption. Take is defined
as harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture or collect, or to attempt to engage
in any such conduct. Harass is defined by the Service as an intentional or negligent act or
omission which creates the likelihood of injury to a listed species by annoying it to such an
extent as to significantly disrupt normal behavioral patterns which include, but are not limited to,
breeding, feeding or sheltering. Harm is defined by the Service to include significant habitat
modification or degradation that results in death or injury to listed species by significantly
impairing essential behavioral patterns including breeding, feeding, or sheltering. Incidental take
is defined as take that is incidental to, and not the purpose of, the carrying out of an otherwise
lawful activity. Under the terms of section 7(b)(4) and section 7(o)(2), taking incidental to and
not intended as part of the agency action is not considered to be prohibited taking under the Act,
provided that such taking is in compliance with the terms and conditions of this Incidental Take
Statement.
The measures described below are non-discretionary, and must be undertaken by the Corps so
that they become binding conditions of any grant or permit issued to the applicant, as
appropriate, for the exemption in section 7(o)(2) to apply. The Corps has a continuing duty to
regulate the activity covered by this incidental take statement. If the Corps (1) fails to assume
and implement the terms and conditions or (2) fails to require an applicant to adhere to the terms
and conditions of the incidental take statement through enforceable terms that are added to any
permit or grant document related to the Delta Study, the protective coverage of section 7(o)(2)
may lapse. In order to monitor the impact of incidental take, the Corps must report the progress
of the action and its impact on the species to the Service as specified in the incidental take
statement [50 CFR §402.14(i)(3)].

Mr. Mark Ziminske

Amount or Extent of Take

Delta Smelt
The Service expects that incidental take of delta smelt will be difficult to detect or quantify for
the following reasons: the small size of adults and larvae, the difficulty of detecting delta smelt
in their turbid aquatic habitat, very low densities of delta smelt, and the low likelihood of finding
dead or impaired specimens. Due to the difficulty in quantifying the number of delta smelt that
will be taken as a result of the proposed action, the number of acres of affected habitat becomes a
surrogate for the species that will be taken. The expected footprint of each dredged material
mound is a 300-foot diameter circle (1.6 acres). The pipeline outfall would be moved, then the
process and effect would be repeated for the next mound. Over the 10-year construction period,
there would be a total of 340 acres of restoration. Each year, there would also be a temporary
disturbance buffer around each set of mounds which could have elevated levels of turbidity or
associated factors, that might temporarily affect any delta smelt present. Our best professional
opinion is that this disturbance buffer would be no more than 15% of the restored area in a given
year, or about 5 acres per year. Adaptive management actions may result in some additional
disturbance and take of smelt, including localized recontouring of surfaces with machinery, or
replanting. The extent of these adaptive management actions cannot be precisely estimated; in
this case - we assume it to total more than 10% of the area ofrestoration (34 acres) over the 13year construction and monitoring period.
Therefore for the purposes of this opinion, we estimate the level of take of delta smelt associated
with all construction and management activities will be in the form of harm, harass, or kill of all
those delta smelt present in 425 acres of temporary disturbance (<1 acre for the submerged
pipeline including disturbance buffer; 340 acres of dredged material placement for restoration;
up to 50 acres for disturbance buffer around those areas of restoration; and 34 acres of
subsequent adaptive management within the 340 acres of restoration). Low fish mortality is
anticipated because of the current low abundance of smelt, the limited spatial extent of
placement at any one time, and the proposed work window.
There could be a small increment of incidental injury or death of delta smelt during the various
sampling activities for monitoring, and the placement of the submerged section of pipeline. Our
best judgment is that the level of take in the form of harm, harass, or kill from these other
associated activities would be no more than two (2) adult or larval delta smelt.
Delta Smelt Critical Habitat
There would be 340 acres of permanent change in PCE #1 (physical habitat; 340 acres of
uniform subtidal open water made shallow so it forms 340 acres of marsh and channels). The
amount of shallow water habitat, as defined by MHW, will be initially reduced due to overfilling,
but this would return as the material settles. It would remain shallower than existing, but the
area would be the same due to settlement, and the restored marsh is expected to increase the
quality of the critical habitat. Over a longer period of time, the area may accrete sediment and
organic matter, so an increasing proportion of the site is above MHW. The site is nevertheless
expected to remain some form of tidal habitat with minimal uplands (i.e., above MHHW).

Mr. Mark Ziminske

34

Giant Garter Snake
The Service anticipates that incidental take of the snake will be difficult to detect or quantify for
the following reasons: snakes are cryptically colored, secretive, and known to be sensitive to
human activities. Snakes may avoid detection by retreating to burrows, soil crevices, vegetation,
and other cover. Individual snakes are difficult to detect unless they are observed undisturbed at
a distance. Most close-range observations represent chance encounters that are difficult to
predict. For the proposed project, we expect incidental take to be associated with (1) harassment,
through disturbance associated with project actions; or (2) injury or death, due to direct contact
with construction equipment or vehicles. It is not possible to make an accurate estimate of the
number of snakes that will be harassed during construction activities, including in staging areas
and roads carrying vehicular traffic. In instances when take is difficult to detect, the Service may
estimate take in numbers of species per acre of habitat lost or degraded as a result of the action as
a surrogate measure for quantifying individuals. We estimate the area of suitable upland snake
habitat to be temporarily or permanently impacted to be 56 acres (up to 50 acres remnant levee
non-native removal/replanting, 4.91 acres access road improvement, 0.09 acre pipeline
placement across remnant levee, 1 acre staging area creation). Due to the difficulty in
determining the number of snakes that will be taken in the form of harm and harass, the Service
is quantifying take as 56 acres of suitable upland habitat that will be temporarily or permanently
impacted by construction, adaptive management, or monitoring activities. Although there have
been snake records near the action area, densities are believed to be low. Moreover, the
proposed conservation measures of worker training and equipment inspection should reduce the
potential for take. Based on these factors and our best judgment, the Service expects the level of
take in the form of harm, harass, or kill to be no more than one (1) giant garter snake killed or
injured by contact with construction equipment or motor vehicles during all project activities.
Effect of the Take

In the accompanying biological opinion, the Service determined that the level of anticipated take
is not likely to result in jeopardy to the delta smelt or giant garter snake.
Reasonable and Prudent Measure

1. The Corps shall minimize the impact of take of delta smelt and giant garter snake.
Terms and Conditions

In order to be exempt from the prohibitions of section 9 of the Act, the Corps must comply with,
or ensure compliance with, the following terms and conditions, which implement the reasonable
and prudent measures described above and outline required reporting/monitoring requirements.
These Terms and Conditions are nondiscretionary.
The following Terms and Conditions implement the Reasonable and Prudent Measures:

Mr. Mark Ziminske

35

1. The Corps must prepare and submit to the Service for approval, a final Monitoring and Adaptive
Management Plan. This plan will describe methods, sampling frequencies, and reporting
schedule. Elements of this final plan will at least include: topography, water quality, vegetation,
other food web measures (water column plankton; invertebrates on/in benthos and plant
surfaces), monitoring of subtidal areas for non-natives (e.g., Brazilian waterweed, water
hyacinth), quantities of listed species habitat affected, and adaptive management process. Plan
reporting will cover each of the plan elements, and will describe any adaptive management
actions taken during the monitoring year as well as adaptive management actions proposed for
the following year. This plan must be approved by the Service in writing, prior to the onset of
construction.
2. The Corps shall not use aquatic herbicides to control invasive aquatic species in the study area,
and shall only use mechanical removal methods where such control is deemed necessary.
3. The Corps shall not plant any invasive or non-native species.
Reporting Requirements
In order to monitor whether the amount or extent of incidental take anticipated from
implementation of the project is approached or exceeded, the Corps shall adhere to the following
monitoring requirements. Should this anticipated amount or extent of incidental take be
exceeded, the Corps must reinitiate formal consultation as per 50 CFR 402.16.
1. The Service must be notified within one (1) working day of the finding of any injured or dead
listed species or any unanticipated damage to its habitat associated with the proposed project.
Notification will be made to the Assistant Field Supervisor of the Endangered Species Program
at the Bay Delta Fish and Wildlife Office at (916) 930-5604, and must include the date, time, and
precise location of the individual/incident clearly indicated on a U.S. Geological Survey 7.5
minute quadrangle or other maps at a finer scale, as requested by the Service, and any other
pertinent information. When an injured or dead individual of the listed species is found, the
Corps (during construction) or the local sponsor (during maintenance) shall follow the steps
outlined in the Disposition of Individuals Taken section below.
2. The Corps will document, monitor, and report the actual amount of take of listed species and
listed species habitat for project construction in an annual monitoring report to be submitted
within 240 days of completion of each year's dredged placement activities. This document will
include a summary table of construction monitoring to verify that the monitoring extent and
frequency are consistent with that proposed, the sightings of any listed species, and the current
year and cumulative areas of disturbance of listed species habitat.
Disposition ofIndividuals Taken
Injured listed species must be cared for by a licensed veterinarian or other qualified person(s),
such as the Service-approved biologist. Dead individuals must be sealed in a resealable plastic
bag containing a paper with the date and time when the animal was found, the location where it
was found, and the name of the person who found it, and the bag containing the specimen must

Mr. Mark Ziminske

36

be frozen in a freezer located in a secure site, until instructions are received from the Service
regarding the disposition of the dead specimen. The Service contact persons are the Assistant
Field Supervisor of the Endangered Species Program at the Bay Delta Fish and Wildlife Office at
(916) 930-5604; and the Resident Agent-in-Charge of the Service's Office of Law Enforcement,
5622 Price Way, McClellan, California 95562, at (916) 569-8444.

CONSERVATION RECOMMENDATIONS
Section 7(a)(l) of the Act directs Federal agencies to utilize their authorities to further the
purposes of the Act by carrying out conservation programs for the benefit of endangered and
threatened species. Conservation recommendations are discretionary agency activities to
minimize or avoid adverse effects of a proposed action on listed species or critical habitat, to
help implement recovery plans, or to develop information. The Service recommends the
following actions:
1. Develop and implement restoration measures in areas designated in the Delta Fishes Recovery
Plan (Service 1996) and the Giant Garter Snake Recovery Plan (Service 201 7).

REINITIATION-CLOSING STATEMENT
This concludes formal consultation on the Delta Study. As provided in 50 CFR §402.16,
reinitiation of formal consultation is required where discretionary Federal agency involvement or
control over the action has been retained (or is authorized by law) and if: (1) the amount or
extent of incidental take is exceeded; (2) new information reveals effects of the agency action
that may affect listed species or critical habitat in a manner or to an extent not considered in this
opinion; (3) the agency action is subsequently modified in a manner that causes an effect to the
listed species or critical habitat not considered in this opinion; (4) a new species is listed or
critical habitat designated that may be affected by the action; or (5) the status of the delta smelt
changes. In instances where the amount or extent of incidental take is exceeded, any additional
take will not be exempt from the prohibitions of section 9 of the Act, pending reinitiation.

Delta Islands and Levees Feasibility Study
I.

Introduction

This appendix evaluates compliance of the recommended plan, Alternative 3, with the
Guidelines established under the Federal Pollution Control Act (Clean Water Act) Amendments
of 1972 (Public Law 92-500), as amended by the Clean Water Act of 1977 (Public Law 95-217),
legislation collectively referred to as the Clean Water Act. The Clean Water Act sets national
goals and policies to eliminate the discharge of water pollutants into navigable waters. Any
discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S. (WOUS) by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers (Corps) requires a written evaluation that demonstrates that a proposed action
complies with the guidelines published at 40 CFR Part 230. These guidelines, referred to as the
Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines or “Guidelines,” are the substantive criteria used in evaluating
discharges of dredged or fill material under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.
Fundamental to the Guidelines is the precept that “dredged or fill material should not be
discharged into the aquatic ecosystem, unless it can be demonstrated such a discharge would not
have an unacceptable adverse impact either individually or in combination with known and/or
probable impacts of other activities affecting the ecosystems of concern.”
The procedures for documenting compliance with the Guidelines include the following:


Examining practicable alternatives to the proposed discharge that might have fewer
adverse environmental impacts, including not discharging into a water of the U.S. or
discharging into an alternative aquatic site.



Evaluating the potential short- and long-term effects, including cumulative effects, of
a proposed discharge of dredged or fill material on the physical, chemical, and
biological components of the aquatic environment.



Identifying appropriate and practicable measures to mitigate the unavoidable adverse
environmental impacts of the proposed discharge.



Making and documenting the Findings of Compliance required by §230.12 of the
Guidelines.

This Clean Water Act, Section 404(b)(1) evaluation of compliance with the Guidelines is
not intended to be a “stand alone” document; it relies heavily on information provided in the
integrated feasibility report and Environmental Impact Statement (FR/EIS) to which it is
attached.
II.

Project Description
A. Project Purpose

Under the Selected Plan, the Corps of Engineers, Sacramento District (Corps), and the
State of California, Department of Water Resources (DWR) propose to restore 340 acres of

intertidal marsh habitat using dredged material at Big Break in the Sacramento-San Joaquin
Delta (Delta). This restoration of open water habitat would be converted to a combination of
freshwater intertidal marsh habitat and shallow water habitat via the direct placement of dredged
material. Placement of dredged material would create a variable topography that at times would
be submerged below the tidal level and at other times might be exposed vegetated marsh.
The remaining ecosystems in the Delta no longer maintain the functions and richness that
historically defined the pre-channelized system. The measures of ecological health continue to
decline without preventive or restorative actions. The Delta Islands and Levees Feasibility Study
(Delta Study) analyzes the feasibility of restoring intertidal habitat by subsidence reversal in the
flooded area of Big Break.
B. Location
The project area is located approximately 2 miles east of the city of Antioch in the west
central portion of the Delta (Figure 1). The area’s approximate boundaries are the San Joaquin
River and Threemile Slough on the north, Sacramento River and Sherman Lake on the west,
south edge of Big Break and Dutch Slough on the south, and east edge of Big Break on the east.
Big Break comprises of approximately 1,600 acres of subsided island that is now shallow open
water habitat. The project area include parts of Big Break and Jersey Island (see Figure 2 and 3):
the immediate project area where the 340 acre restoration project would be occurring is located
in the northern direction of Big Break, meeting the southern end of Jersey Island.
C. General Description
An initial array of 12 alternatives (including the No-Action Alternative) was developed
by the Corps and DWR during the alternatives formulation process. The alternatives represented
varying combinations of measures. Alternatives were initially developed based on the Corps’
federal planning objectives for water resource projects, specific planning objectives developed
for the feasibility study, and opportunities and constraints for implementing flood risk
management activities. After formulation and refinement of the project alternatives, alternatives
were ranked and screened based on NER benefits and implementation costs. Chapter 3 of the
FR/EIS addresses in greater detail the alternative formulation process.
The Delta Islands and Levees Feasibility Study plan formulation process resulted in two
action alternatives in the final array:


Alternative 2. This alternative includes using approximately 500,000 cubic yards (cy) of
dredged material over a five year period to create approximately 160 acres of intertidal
marsh habitat (see Figure 3). Of the approximately 160 acres, approximately 45 acres
would be planted with aquatic vegetation, and the remaining 112 acres would be shallow
water habitat for aquatic fauna species. Dredged material would come from O&M
activities in the San Francisco Bay to Stockton DWSC between approximately station
points 400+00 and 850+00. Dredged material would be directly pumped to the
restoration site, rather than typical land-based dredged material placement sites. A

chemical and granular composition analysis of the materials would be conducted in
advance of placement.


Alternative 3 includes using approximately 1 million cubic yards (cy) of dredged material
over a 10 year period to create approximately 340 acres of intertidal marsh habitat. Of
the approximately 340 acres, approximately 95 acres would be planted with riparian and
aquatic vegetation, and the remaining 245 acres would be shallow water habitat for
aquatic fauna species with the placement of dredge material. The O&M dredging,
material placement, and plantings would all be conducted consistent with the description
for Alternative 2, above, except that it would occur over a 10 year period rather than a 5
year period. Alternative 3 is the Recommended Plan and is also the Environmentally
Preferred Alternative.
D. Background

The Delta was named an Ecosystem of National Significance through the Environment
Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act in 2011. It is a critical link in the Pacific
Flyway, a major north-south route of travel for migratory birds in America, and is protected
through the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918. Natural resource specialists agree that the
remaining ecosystems in the Delta no longer maintain the functions and richness that defined the
pre-channelized system, and that the measures of ecological health would continue to decline
without preventive action. Not only is it certain that these natural systems would not recover
their defining attributes under current conditions, it is unlikely that even the current, degraded
ecological conditions can be sustained into the future. For example, delta smelt, key indicators
of ecosystem health continue to decline in number throughout the watershed. Another example is
the decline in populations of salmonids; commercially, recreationally, and culturally important
fish species in the Delta.
There are numerous contributors to the ecological decline of Delta species and habitats,
each of which has the capability to produce adverse impacts independently and/or in
combination with other stressors. For example, pesticides, channelization, exotic and non-native
invasive species, water supply diversions, agricultural and urban runoff, and wastewater
discharges have all been identified as contributors of adverse impacts to the ecological health of
the Delta ecosystem. Specifically, channelization of rivers and streams through the construction
of levees has resulted in the widespread loss of tidal marsh, shaded riverine aquatic habitat, and
the disconnection of floodplains from waterways. If this loss of Delta habitats and disconnection
from floodplains continues, the current substantial declines in the Delta’s fisheries could result in
the extinction of culturally and economically critical species. Many of the defining
characteristics of the pre-channelized ecosystem (spatial extent, habitat heterogeneity, and
dynamic storage) have either been lost or substantially altered as a result of land use and water
management practices during the past 100 years in California. Nearly 95 percent of the historic
wetland habitat in the Delta has been converted to agricultural and urban uses (The Bay Institute
1998).
E. Authority and Purpose

The Corps ensures that the project complies with the Clean Water Act, including Sections
404, 401, and 402. Placement of fill within jurisdictional wetlands and WOUS States is required
for the project. A Section 401 State Water Quality Certification for activities associated with
implementation of the proposed project is required as a condition of Section 404, and the Corps
would submit a 401 certification application to the Central Valley Regional Water Quality
Control Board (CVWQCB) prior to construction. The project would also require an NPDES
permit, through the development of a SWPPP because the project would disturb more than 1 acre
of project area.
The purpose of the Delta Study is to determine if there is a Federal interest in providing
Flood Risk Management (FRM) and Ecosystem Restoration (ER) improvements in the Delta.
Since each multipurpose measure has a FRM negative net benefit, which indicates FRM specific
benefits are less than the FRM separable costs, these multipurpose measures cannot be
economically justified as ecosystem restoration benefits and costs are added. For this reason,
FRM measures have not been pursued.
A recommendation for plan selection was made by identifying the plan that reasonably
maximizes environmental outputs relative to costs while meeting planning objectives and
avoiding planning constraints. As all alternatives are cost effective, every alternative achieves
the greatest number of outputs for a given cost; therefore, incremental costs per output were used
to identify the NER Plan.
The O&M dredging actions are analyzed in the ‘Sacramento River - San Francisco Bay to
Stockton, California (John F. Baldwin and Stockton Ship Channels), Deep Water Ship Channel
Maintenance Dredging and Bank Protection Project, California 10-Year Draft Programmatic
Biological Assessment’. The process of transporting the dredge materials from the ship to the
project sites is analyzed in the Delta Islands and Levees FS/EIS.
III.

Final Array of Alternatives
A. Guidelines

Section 230.10 of the Guidelines dictates that, except as provided under §404(b)(2), “no
discharge of dredged or fill material shall be permitted if there is a practicable alternative to the
proposed discharge which would have less adverse impact on the aquatic ecosystem, so long as
the alternative does not have significant adverse environmental considerations.” While the
NEPA process, through the EIS, extensively examines alternatives and discloses all of their
environmental impacts, the 404(b)(1) Analysis focuses on the impacts of alternatives to the
aquatic ecosystem. The Guidelines require choosing for implementation the practicable
alternative that has the least damage to the aquatic ecosystem, assuming that this alternative has
no significant adverse environmental impacts to other components of the environment, such as
endangered species that occupy upland habitat. A “practicable alternative” is defined as
“available and capable of being done after taking into consideration cost, existing technology,
and logistics in light of overall project purposes.”

The Guidelines also require that “where the activity associated with a discharge which is
proposed for a special aquatic site does not require access or proximity to or siting within the
special aquatic site in question to fulfill its basic purpose (i.e., is not “water dependent”),
practicable alternatives that do not involve special aquatic sites are presumed to be available,
unless clearly demonstrated otherwise.” The basic purpose of this project—ecosystem
restoration in the California Delta at Big Break—is water dependent, since the project purpose
cannot be fulfilled outside of open water in the Delta.
B. Practical Alternative
The Guidelines further specify that where a discharge is proposed for a special aquatic
site, all practicable alternatives to the proposed discharge that do not involve a discharge into a
special aquatic site are presumed to have less adverse impact on the aquatic ecosystem, unless
otherwise clearly demonstrated. The placement of dredge material at Big Break is the special
aquatic site type in the project area. Section III, parts E and F describe the proposed activities for
each reach.
For the purpose of a 404(b) (1) alternatives analysis, practicable alternatives include:


Offsite alternatives—i.e., discharges of dredged or fill material at other locations in
WOUS



On-site alternatives—these include project designs that do not involve a discharge of
dredged or fill material into WOUS as well as project designs that have different
impacts to WOUS

C. Off-Site Alternatives
The location of this project was selected based upon the need to restore emergent marsh
habitat using dredged material within a sunken Delta Island. Other sunken Delta Islands that
were considered includes Frank’s Tract and Little Frank’s Tract. Out of these three alternatives,
Big Break has the shallowest open water condition, and is the closest site to the Stockton DWSC,
making it the most cost effective and practicable restoration option.
D. On-Site Alternatives
The two construction alternatives analyzed in detail through the NEPA process would
each accomplish the identified project purpose. However, they would accomplish the project
purpose to varying extents, with varying levels of benefits and varying adverse impacts to the
aquatic ecosystem.
The following is a summary of project elements for each alternative. In general, the two
alternatives are the same, however, Alternative 3 entails the greatest amount of intertidal marsh
habitat restoration (340 acres) and Alternative 2 a lesser amount (160 acres). These alternatives
are described in greater detail in Chapter 3 of the FR/EIS.

Alternative 2. The size of the potential placement site would be 160 acres. The dredge
materials would be placed within the functional floodplain inside the open water area. The
potential placement area is a sunken island comprised of peat soils. Native floating aquatic
species include duckweed (Lemna spp.), water-meal (Wolffia spp.), and algae. Large expanses of
the open water habitat within the study area are dominated by the invasive nonnative species
water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes). Submerged aquatic vegetation within the open water
habitat in the study area is dominated by the nonnative species Egeria (Egeria densa). Placement
would occur over a five year period in the timeframe of August 1 to November 30, consistent
with current and anticipated avoidance work windows for Delta smelt and salmonids.
Alternative 3. The size of the potential placement site would be 340 acres. The dredge
materials would be placed within the functional floodplain inside the open water area. The
potential placement area is a sunken island comprised of peat soils. The proposed placement site
is devoid of terrestrial vegetation. Native floating aquatic species include duckweed (Lemna
spp.), water-meal (Wolffia spp.), and algae. Large expanses of the open-water habitat within the
study area are dominated by the invasive nonnative species water hyacinth (Eichhornia
crassipes). Submerged aquatic vegetation within the open water habitat in the study area is
dominated by the nonnative species Egeria (Egeria densa). Placement would occur over a ten
year period in the timeframe of August 1 to November 30, consistent with current and
anticipated avoidance work windows for Delta smelt and salmonids.
E. General Description and Quantity of Dredged or Fill Material
Analysis of over 10 years of grain size distribution data for the 400+00 to 850+00
dredging reaches shows the material to be virtually completely fine sand which annually
accumulates within the Stockton Deep Water Ship Channel. Maintenance operations remove the
materials to maintain deep draft commercial ship passage. The dredged material would be tested
prior to placement for chemicals such as mercury, ammonia, arsenic, and lead. If the material
does not pass the chemical tests then it would not be used for restoration and would be disposed
of in accordance with current O&M dredging practices.
F.

Description of the Proposed Discharge Site(s)

Big Break was historically tidal marsh before levees were constructed to reclaim the land
for agriculture. Big Break’s lands then became submerged when the levees failed. Before land
reclamation for agriculture and flood control activities around the turn of the 20th century, the
Delta supported a complex network of rivers and sloughs with in-channel islands and vast
expanses of tidal marsh. Much of the vegetation of the Delta (approximately 380,000 acres;
1,538 square kilometers) was dominated by tidal marshes (Atwater 1980; Institute 1998). By
1930, island reclamation was complete, and by 1980, only about 16,000 acres (65 square
kilometers) of marshes remained (Atwater 1980; The Bay Institute 1998). Today, these areas of
former tidal marshes consist primarily of channelized waterways surrounding highly productive
row-cropped agricultural islands that are protected from flooding by over 1,300 miles (2,093
kilometers) of levees. Approximately 95 percent of the historic tidal marsh habitat in the Delta
has been lost (The Bay Institute 1998).

Big Break is currently characterized by vast expanses of open water habitat. Although
Big Break has been flooded for a number of years, it has not accumulated enough sediment to
support the reestablishment and expansion of tidal marsh vegetation. Big Break is subject to
daily tidal fluctuations and is at a sufficient distance from the Bay that the tidal waters inundating
this area have minimal salinity levels. A remnant levee runs along the northern border of the
area. Riparian scrub vegetation dominated by arroyo willow (Salix lasiolepis) and Himalayan
blackberry (Rubus armeniacus) grows along the upper portions of this levee, but the lower
elevations of the remnant levee support a low cover of tidal marsh vegetation. Common plant
species occupying the tidal marsh include cattails (Typha spp.), sedges (Cyperaceae spp.), and
California bulrush (Schoenoplectus californicus).
G. Timing and Duration of Discharge
The construction activities that would affect WOUS would occur over approximately 2
weeks per year during the timeframe from August 1 to November 30, depending on the annual
dredging schedule. Under Alternative 2 this would occur for 5 years. Under Alternative 3 this
would occur for 10 years.
H. Description of Disposal Method
The disposal method would be the same for both alternatives. The only difference
between the alternatives is the duration and acreages being used for dredge placement, as
described above.
A pipeline hydraulic suction dredge would be used to acquire material under the existing
Stockton O&M Dredging Project. Dredging rates vary depending on the type of material being
dredged, but production rates of 300 to 600 cubic yards per operational hour are typical. It is
estimated that approximately 100,000 cubic yards of material would be available to the Delta
Study each year.
Dredged material would be pumped from the dredge directly to Big Break. Materials
would be pumped to the proposed project areas through a floating 18 inch double wall high
density plastic extrusion (HDPE) pipe. The piping system would be placed along the shoreline
of the Stockton DWSC in the San Joaquin River. The pipeline would be submerged and
anchored to the bottom when necessary to avoid navigation hazards. A floating diesel repeater
pump station would be positioned every 3 miles as necessary to aid slurry flow; pump(s) would
be installed on a floating platform with stakes to secure its position. Work boats would install
and maintain the floating pipeline. An additional work boat and crew would tender the position
of the outfall slurry pipe during pumping operations to ensure correct placement of materials.
The pipeline would likely access Big Break from the DWSC via a land-based crossing at
Jersey Island. There is one dirt farm road running north/south on Jersey Island; the pipeline
would be placed adjacent to the road above ground. The pipeline would cross one farm road
running east/west, in addition to two levee roads on the north and south shore of the island.
Culvert-style crossings would be installed at these intersections in order to avoid impacts to the
farm fields. The proposed crossing location is shown on Figure 2 below. The Jersey Island

crossing is not anticipated to need a booster pump on the island; however, a floating booster
pump station would likely be installed adjacent to the north shore of Jersey Island.
The pipe would be above water at the time of release. A baffle-plate on the end of the pipe
would cause the material to spray out and would dissipate energy and help to direct the material
downward. The hydraulic slurry would be discharged at the restoration sites at an assumed
average rate of 450 cubic yards per hour or 8,100 cubic yards per day. Since this sand would be
falling in a hydraulic slurry, it is assumed to settle to a 1 on 20 slope below the mean tide level
(MTL, which is 2 feet higher than the mean lower low water [MLLW] level) and to a 1 on 10
slope above the MTL. This placement process is similar enough to sand depositing in the
navigation channel that no bulking of the placed dredged material is assumed and no
consolidation of the placed material is assumed (i.e. one cubic yard taken from the channel is
equal in volume to one cubic yard of a placed sand mound).

Sand mounds would be placed so that the mound toes do not overlap, leaving channels of
varying sizes between the mounds. The intent is to ensure that the channel centerlines are never
shallower than the existing condition (-3 to -4 feet MLLW). The goal of this placement plan is
to create a diverse habitat that provides value to both shallow water aquatic fauna that require
varying depths of soft bottom habitat, as well as terrestrial marsh species such as shore birds. In
addition, based on lessons learned from Donlon Island, this design is intended to provide
sufficient flow through the site to maintain water quality.
The bed material at Big Break is former agricultural land that was prone to subsidence
upon drying, thus the material is assumed to be highly compressible. Table 3-19 lists
assumptions that are thought to be reasonable but conservative for the compression of Big Break
bed materials beneath hydraulically placed sand.

In addition to “losses” of placed dredged material by the compression of underlying
sediments (as a greater volume of sand is necessary to construct a mound of a given height above
the sediment bed), other potential losses that could occur include:




Wave wash erosion during storms;
Unpredicted consolidation in excess of assumed amounts; and,
Ineffective elevations due to sea level rise (SLR).

Table 3-19 also indicates a contingency amount of 1 foot of additional mound height
losses due to some combination of these factors. Figures 4 and 5 display the initial placement
(black line) and final geometry (red line, used for plantable area sizing calculations) of a sand
mound placed at -3 feet MLLW and -4 feet MLLW, respectively. It is estimated that the sand
mounds would require approximately 10 months for settlement following construction.
Following the settlement period, aquatic vegetation would be planted
The bed level within the proposed footprint varies from -3 to -4 feet MLLW; mean tides
within Big Break range from 0 feet MLLW to +4 feet MLLW. As a result, bed depths in the
restoration area range from 3 feet during a mean lower low water tide to 8 feet during a mean
higher high water tide. The proposed sand mounds would be constructed with a target elevation
of +3 feet MLLW. Thus at high tide, sand mounds would be approximately 1 foot below the
water surface level; and at low tide, the top of the vegetated sand mounds would be exposed.
IV. Factual Determinations (Section 230.11)
A. Physical Substrate Determinations (consider items in Section 230.11 and 230.20
Substrate)
(1) Substrate Elevation and Slope. The current bottom of channel elevations
average -2.44 ft for Big Break. Alternative 2 and 3 finish grade elevations for the marsh
restoration islands was calculated at an elevation between -3.0ft to -4.0ft relative to mean
water level.
(2) Sediment Type. Soils and sediment type for both Alternatives 2 and 3 are
composed primarily of sand.
(3) Dredged/ Fill Material Movement:
a) Fill: Alternatives 2 and 3 involve permanently filling open water habitat
in order to restore the area to its historic marsh condition. Some migration
of fill material is expected, due to wave wash action and flows through the
marsh habitat. It should be noted that this is not expected to increase
turbidity outside of the restoration site itself, and primarily would aid the
restoration in natural development of channels and marsh habitat. Figure
3 displays a conceptual future appearance of the site after the movement of
the material.
(4) Physical Effects on Benthos (burial, changes in sediment type, etc.).
a) Fill: There would be a temporary effect on benthic organisms in the
placement footprint due to burying of the existing benthos, but other
similar projects in the area have shown that the benthic organisms should
repopulate very quickly, likely within a year (i.e., prior to the next season
of construction). Additionally, there would be gaps between the rows of
mounds that wouldn’t be impacted by placement due to the progression of
the placement. As a result, the impact would not be significant because it

would be limited to the newly placed material annually and would be
expected to recover prior to the next construction season.
(5) Turbidity
a) Fill: There would be a short term effect on turbidity during the placement
of dredged materials in Big Break annually. However, since grain
analysis of the sediment has shown that it primarily consists of fine sand
rather than silt, it is anticipated that the material would settle fairly quickly
and would not result in a significant impact on turbidity. Additionally, as
noted above, it is not anticipated that there would be any turbidity plume
that would migrate off site.
(6) Actions Taken to Minimize Impacts. Sacrificial straw bales would be placed
to provide barriers to the predominant flow paths to allow for sediment settling and sand
mound stability. Straw bales are anticipated to persist 1 to 2 years, giving sufficient time
for vegetative establishment, after which vegetation is assumed to provide adequate
erosion resistance. Sacrificial straw bales would be used to aid in compliance with water
quality requirements. Straw bale lines are not anticipated to be fully enclosing; however,
should enclosure become a possibility, the top of the sacrificial straw bale line would be
set at mean low tide level to allow fish an opportunity to escape the work area. If
unanticipated quantities of fine-grained material are present in dredged sediments,
turbidity curtains can be used in combination with sacrificial straw bales and would float
slightly above the bottom allowing aquatic species to escape entrapment.
B. Water Circulation, Fluctuation, and Salinity Determinations
(1) Consider effects on (for both Alternatives 2 and 3):
a) Salinity. No significant effect.
b) Water Chemistry (pH, etc.). No significant effect.
c) Clarity. No significant effect.
d) Color. No significant effect.
e) Odor. No significant effect.
f) Taste. No significant effect.
g) Dissolved Gas Level. No significant effect.
h) Nutrients. No significant effect.
i) Eutrophication. No significant effect.
j) Others as Appropriate. No significant effect.
(2) Current Patterns and Circulation (for both Alternatives 2 and 3). No
significant effect.
(3) Normal Water level Fluctuations (for both Alternatives 2 and 3): No
significant effect.
(4) Salinity Gradients (for both Alternatives 2 and 3): No significant effect.

(5) Actions That Will Be Taken to Minimize Impacts (for both Alternatives 2 and
3). Since disturbance throughout the project is greater than 1 acre, the contractor would
be required to file and adhere to a Stormwater Pollution Protection Plan and a National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permit. Additionally, the BMPs discussed above
to reduce turbidity would also aid with other water quality impacts. Water quality
monitoring would occur during both the construction and monitoring periods.
C. Suspended Particulate/ Turbidity Determinations
(1) Expected Changes in Suspended Particulates and Turbidity Levels in Vicinity
of Disposal Site (for both Alternatives 2 and 3). There would be a temporary increase in
turbidity on site during placement of dredged material, but it is anticipated that the sand
would settle out fairly quickly and that there would not be a long-term significant
increase in suspended particulates in the project area.
(2) Effects, Degree, and Duration on Chemical and Physical Properties of the
Water Column (for both Alternatives 2 and 3):
a) Light Penetration. Beneficial effect. The existing condition at Big Break
is primarily open water with little-to-no vegetation. As a result, the water
temperature is increased by excessive light penetration, making the area
more suitable for invasive fish species rather than native fish species. The
restoration of marsh habitat and installation of aquatic vegetation would
create shaded areas that would reduce the water temperature and allow for
more diverse species to use the area.
b) Dissolved Oxygen. No significant effect.
c) Toxic Metals and Organics. No significant effect. Dredge material from
the deep water ship channels is collected and tested prior to removal. The
Corps maintains records of all materials currently held in dry land
stockpile sites. A chemical analysis of the existing project site channel
bottom would be conducted prior to the filling with existing dredge
materials. The project site channel bottom samples would serve as the
baseline by which fill materials chemical analysis must be at or below the
existing baseline threshold. Existing samples from sites surrounding the
project areas indicate that the dry land stockpile dredge materials would
meet baseline thresholds. Future dredge materials from O&M activities
would be measured against the baseline thresholds. Materials not meeting
the baseline would be stockpiled and not used as fill.
d) Pathogens. Not applicable.

e) Aesthetics. Beneficial effect. The restoration of native intertidal marsh
habitat would create a more aesthetically pleasing visual character of the
area than the current degraded condition of the sunken island.
f) Others as Appropriate. No significant adverse effects to the chemical and
physical properties of the water column are anticipated.
(3) Effects on Biota (for both Alternatives 2 and 3): By restoring historic
intertidal marsh habitat, both alternatives would create a more diverse and
functional biota. The proposed marsh habitat would provide shade, cover, and a
food source for most juvenile native fish species, as well as Delta smelt. The
habitat would provide nesting habitat for avian marsh species. Photosynthesis
processes would be more productive in the area due to the increase in vegetative
cover. Impacts from both alternatives would be beneficial to the biota in the
project area.
(4) Actions Taken to Minimize Impacts (for both Alternatives 2 and 3). See
previous description of BMPs and work plans.
D. Contaminant Determinations. The proposed project Alternatives 2 and 3 would not
add contaminants the river channel system. The dredged material would be tested prior to
dredging consistent with current practices on the O&M dredging project. Any material
containing contaminants would not be used for restoration and would instead be disposed of by
the O&M dredging project consistent with current practices.
E. Aquatic Ecosystem and Organism Determinations
(1) Effects on Plankton. The proposed project Alternatives 2 and 3 would have
no affect on plankton communities.
(2) Effects on Benthos. There would be a temporary effect on benthic organisms
in the placement footprint due to burying of the existing benthos, but the postconstruction monitoring report for Donlon Island, the project’s test site, indicates that
historically the benthic organisms should repopulate very quickly, likely within a year
(i.e., prior to the next season of construction) (USACE and USFWS 1990). Additionally,
there would be gaps between the rows of mounds that wouldn’t be impacted by
placement due to the progression of the placement. As a result, the impact would not be
significant because it would be limited to the newly placed material annually and would
be expected to recover prior to the next construction season.
(3) Effects on Nekton. By restoring historic intertidal marsh habitat, both
alternatives would create a more diverse and functional habitat for fish species. The
proposed marsh habitat would provide shade, cover, and a food source for most juvenile
native fish species, as well as Delta smelt.

(4) Effects on aquatic Food Web. The proposed project Alternatives 2 and 3
would have long term beneficial impacts to the aquatic food web, by creating vegetated
marsh habitat that would act as a food source for most nekton and other native species.
(5) Effects on Special Aquatic Sites.
a) Sanctuaries and Refuges. None exist in the project area.
b) Wetlands. None exist in the project area.
c) Mud Flats. None exist in the project area.
d) Vegetated Shallows. None exist in the project area.
e) Coral Reefs. None exist in the project area.
f) Riffle and Pool Complexes. None exist in the project area.
(6) Threatened and Endangered Species.
a) Alternatives 3 and 2 are could potentially have short term effects on
special status fish species during the placement of dredged material.
However, long term the proposed restoration site would have beneficial
effects on migrating adult and juvenile winter or spring run Chinook
salmon, steelhead, green sturgeon, and Delta smelt and their critical
habitat. Restriction of all work activities to the proposed construction
footprints and work calendar (August 1 through November 30). The
adherence to all turbidity, sediment, and chemistry control as dictated in
the In Water Work Plan would further minimize the potential for projectrelated increases in turbidity and suspended sediment in the Big Break
project area. Implementation of a spill prevention control and
countermeasure plan and slurry spill/pipe breach contingency plan is
anticipated to minimize the potential for toxic or hazardous spills or
discharges into the project area. Based on the location and duration of
tender boat activities and other noise-generating activities, potential noise
and vibration impacts on fish are expected to be negligible.
b) Alternatives 2 and 3 are likely to result in beneficial modification of the
Primary Constituent Elements (PCE) of critical habitat of on winter or
spring run Chinook salmon, steelhead, green sturgeon, and Delta smelt.
There would be a direct physical modification of sub-aquatic vegetation
within the designated critical habitat of these species below the high water
mark. Temporary and permanent increases of submerged aquatic
vegetation would be result from both alternatives within the permanent
and temporary footprints of the project below the OHWM. The majority of
existing sub-aquatic plant species within the project area open water
habitat is dominated by the nonnative species Egeria (Egeria densa). This
introduced species is prevalent in the Delta, and it is currently targeted for
abatement by the California Department of Boating and Waterways
(DBW). The project would eradicate up to 160 acres (Alternative 2) and
340 acres (Alternative 3) of Egeria while provide long term primary
productivity for aquatic species.

(7) Other Wildlife. The proposed project action would have no significant
adverse effect on wildlife because the construction window is limited to two weeks per
year for the duration of construction. Any wildlife using the remnant levee or Jersey
Island near the restoration site is anticipated to be capable of relocating during
construction. Any displaced wildlife would be expected to return to the area after the
temporary construction period has ended annually. Following the completion of the
restoration site, the project would provide long term benefits to wildlife species, by
creating shallow water habitat through the channels in Big Break and creating riparian
habitat along the remnant levee. These restoration activities would provide more diversity
to the area such as creating more nesting habitat for avian marsh species and creating
more spawning zones for fish.
(8) Actions to Minimize Impacts. Preconstruction surveys would occur on Jersey
Island to ensure that there are no wildlife species nesting in the staging area or along the
pipeline crossing. If species are present, coordination with the appropriate resource
agencies would occur and avoidance and minimization measures would be developed.
F. Proposed Disposal Site Determinations
(1) Mixing Zone Determination (for both 2 and 3). The project is not anticipated
to increase salinity levels within the Big Break area. The project would not alter
the current X2 salinity demarcation line.
(2) Determination of Compliance with Applicable Water Quality Standards (for
both Alternatives 2 and 3). No water quality or effluent standards would be
violated during proposed project action. All project actions would be performed
with strict adherence to the In Water Work Plan developed with Federal and State
agency partners.
(3) Potential Effects on Human Use Characteristics (for both Alternatives 2 and
3). The proposed project would not have any significant adverse effects to
municipal and private water supply, recreational and commercial fisheries, or
water-related recreation. Any displacement of recreational activities would be
temporary. The project is anticipated to increase long term recreational
experiences and opportunities by increasing the habitat quality.
G. Determination of Cumulative Effects on the Aquatic Ecosystem
The potential cumulative impacts from implementation of the Recommended Plan
(Alternative 3) considered with other relevant actions in the general vicinity of the Delta Islands
and Levees FR/EIS, have been assessed and are discussed in Section 5.11 of the FR/EIS. Nearly
all potentially significant impacts from Alternatives 2 and 3 could be reduced to less than
significant levels by mitigation measures specified in this EIS. The alternatives would not have
any significant cumulative effects on the aquatic ecosystem. Implementation of the either the
Recommended Plan (Alternative 3) or Alternative 2 would provide sub-aquatic primary

productivity and terrestrial refugia for migratory species which results in ecosystem restoration
benefits to the Delta.
H. Determination of Secondary Effects on the Aquatic Ecosystem
Secondary effects (or impacts) are “effects on an aquatic ecosystem that are associated
with a discharge of dredged or fill materials, but do not result from the actual placement of the
dredged or fill material” (40 CFR 230.11(h) (1)). Therefore, secondary effects are limited to
other actions in the aquatic environment that are indirectly related to implementation of the
action, such as erosion or downstream sedimentation, or compensatory mitigation.
Implementation of Alternative 2 or the Recommended Plan (Alternative 3) could result in
the potential secondary impacts such as an increase in contaminants from construction vehicles
and equipment. These actions could result in additional adverse impacts to water quality,
accretion patterns, aquatic and other wildlife habitat, recreation, aesthetics and air quality. To
help minimize impacts associated with the placement of fill material outside the proposed project
area, Corps construction contracts require that the contractor delineate the project boundaries,
and install proper BMP’s within the project area such as turbidity and silt curtains. Additionally,
the contractor would be required to adhere to the details of an In Water Work Plan which
prevents or reduces adverse impacts to water quality from turbidity or chemical spills.
V. Findings of Compliance or Non-Compliance with the Restrictions on Discharge
A. Adaptation of the Section 404(b) (1) Guidelines to this Evaluation: No significant
adaptations of the guidelines were made relative to this evaluation of the Recommended Plan
(Alternative 3) or Alternative 2.
B. Evaluation of Availability of Practicable Alternatives to the Proposed Discharge Site
Which Would Have Less Impact on the Aquatic Ecosystem:
Alternatives 2 and 3 create would permanently impact WOUS by conversion of open
water habitat to intertidal marsh habitat, however the restored intertidal marsh would have a
higher value habitat than the existing open water habitat. The total project area for Alternative 3
is 340 acres compared to Alternative 2, which is 160 acres. Therefore, Alternative 3 would
convert more open water to intertidal marsh based upon the additional 180 acres of proposed
work. Both alternatives would have the same annual effects during construction. Alternative 2
does not provide the range and extents of ecosystem benefits and study objectives as Alternative
3. No alternative exists that does not involve discharge of fill materials into WOUS.
The Recommended Plan (Alternative 3) meets the Corps’ 404(b)(1) permit criteria of the
least environmentally damaging practical alternative (LEDPA). The 404(b)(1) guidelines, §
230.3 Definitions (q) define practicable as ‘a means available and capable of being done after
taking into consideration cost, existing technology, and logistics in light of overall project
purposes’. Alternative 3 is the most reasonably efficient contribution to the California Delta
ecosystem, restoring 340 acres of intertidal marsh habitat. Millions of Federal dollars have been
spent in recent decades to study the Delta; yet very little restoration has occurred. This plan

would allow progress to be made toward significant, cost-effective ecosystem restoration, while
beneficially using dredged material from USACE projects. The project creates several benefits:


Creates 340 acres of long term high value habitat producing primary productivity
benefiting migratory avian and aquatic species, and threatened and endangered
species.



Reduces future stockpiled dredge material inventory and creates additional
storage space for future O&M actions.



Increases recreation opportunities in an area with evident recreation by creating
higher value habitat which attracts avian and aquatic species.

Appropriate conservation measures and BMP’s to minimize potential adverse impacts of
the discharge on WOUS and associated aquatic systems would be implemented. The proposed
disposal sites for the discharge of dredge materials would meet construction and In Water Work
Plan specifications and guidelines and comply with the requirements of practicable conditions
and measures to minimize pollution or adverse effects to the aquatic ecosystem. No mitigation
should be necessary (other than air quality). The project is designed to avoid affects to other
habitat types and therefore no additional mitigation is necessary. Additionally, the Corps would
not mitigate for the open water area that is filled because the habitat affected by the project is
being converted to higher value habitat.
C. Compliance with Applicable State Water Quality Standards, and; Compliance with
Applicable Toxic Effluent Standard or Prohibition Under Section 307 of the Clean Water Act:
State water quality standards would not be violated. Alternatives 2 and 3 would not violate the
Toxic Effluent Standards of Section 307 of the Clean Water Act. A Section 401 Water Quality
Certification would be sought prior to initiation of construction.
D. Compliance with Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973: The Corps has initiated
consultation with USFWS and NMFS under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C.
1536[c]) for potential effects to listed species and their critical habitats for Alternative 3. All
terms and conditions of a subsequent Biological Opinion from the USFWS would be fully
implemented, as appropriate.
E. Compliance with Specified Protection Measures for Marine Sanctuaries Designated
by the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972: Not applicable to both
Alternatives 2 and 3.
F. Compliance with Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899; 33 U.S.C. 403, et seq. The Rivers
and Harbors Act of 1899, Section 10. Alternative 2 or 3 would not result in unauthorized
obstruction or alteration of any navigable water of the U.S. Both alternatives would require
work In Water Work Plans which require that no project action may interfere with river
commerce or alter the navigable shipping lane. The dredge pipeline would be along the edge of
the Stockton Deep Water Ship Channel and would not impede the flow of shipping traffic.

G. Evaluation of Extent of Degradation of the Waters of the United States: The
placement of fill materials would not result in significant adverse effects on human health and
welfare, including municipal and private water supplies, recreational and commercial fishing,
fish, shellfish, wildlife, and special aquatic sites. The life stages of aquatic species and other
wildlife would not be adversely affected. No significant adverse or long term effects on aquatic
ecosystem diversity, productivity and stability, recreational, aesthetic, and economic values
would occur.
(1) Significant Adverse Effects on Human Health and Welfare (Alternatives 2 and
3).
a)
b)
c)
d)

Municipal and Private Water Supplies. No significant effect.
Recreation and Commercial Fisheries. No significant effect.
Plankton. No significant effect.
Fish. Temporary construction-related disturbance would occur, but by
restoring historic intertidal marsh habitat, both alternatives would
create a more diverse and functional habitat for fish species. The
proposed marsh habitat would provide shade, cover, and a food source
for most juvenile native fish species, as well as Delta smelt.
e) Shellfish. No significant effect.
f) Wildlife. Temporary construction-related disturbance could occur, but
long-term restoration would provide beneficial habitat for wildlife
species, most notably avian marsh species.
g) Special Aquatic Sites. No significant effect.

(2) Significant Adverse Effects on Life Stages of Aquatic Life and Other Wildlife
Dependent on Aquatic Ecosystems. Temporary construction-related disturbance, with long term
benefits for aquatic ecosystems for both Alternatives 2 and 3.
(3) Significant Adverse Effects on Aquatic Ecosystem Diversity, Productivity,
and Stability. During construction there would be temporary disturbance to the aquatic
ecosystem, but no significant adverse effects. Marsh restoration would result in long term
beneficial effects to the aquatic ecosystem by creating diversity and a more productive habitat in
the project area.
(4) Significant Adverse Effects on Recreational, Esthetic, and Economic Values.
Temporary effects would occur during construction, primarily due to the pipeline across Dutch
Slough between Jersey Island and the restoration area. Long-term benefits would occur to
aesthetics in the area. Additionally, the restoration area should provide recreational benefits
through increase wildlife viewing opportunities.

DELTA ISLANDS AND LEVEES
REAL ESTATE PLAN
1. Introduction
This Real Estate Plan, prepared in accordance with ER 405-1-12, Sections 12-16, supports
the revised Delta Islands and Levees Feasibility Study. The purpose of the revised study is to
determine the Federal interest in providing Ecosystem Restoration (ER) improvements to the
Sacramento – San Joaquin Rivers Delta (Delta) in Northern California.
The purpose of this Real Estate Plan is to define and describe the minimum real property
interests needed to construct the project’s Recommended Plan. This Plan includes restoring
habitat value in the Delta to native species through subsidence reversal and subsequent
restoration of intertidal habitat in the flooded Big Break region and is to be used for planning
purposes only. Modifications to the Recommended Plan may occur during the project’s
Preconstruction, Engineering and Design (PED) phase which could require adjustments to
the real property rights needed, the scope of the acquisition area(s), and estimates of the real
property acquisition and administrative costs.
Non Federal Sponsor
The USACE initiated the Feasibility Study at the request of the California Department of
Water Resources (DWR), the non-Federal sponsor for the study. The USACE and DWR
discussed various acquisition options with the main land owner in the study area, East Bay
Regional Park District to provide their lands for the project. However, East Bay Regional
Park District cannot convey fee title or a permanent easement due to legal restrictions
(California Pub. Resources Code, §§ 5540, 5540.5.) They indicated that they were interested
in becoming a second non-federal sponsor, along with DWR. That will require a modified
Project Partnership Agreement after project authorization to limit East Bay Regional Park
District's responsibilities to those associated with the provision of some of the land for the
project
2. Project Authority
The study is authorized by the Flood Control Act of 1936, Pub. L. 74-738 and the Water
Supply, Reliability, and Environmental Improvement Act, Pub. L. 108-361 (2004) as
modified by the Water Resources Development Act of 2007, Pub. L. 110-114. Detailed
information regarding the project authority, including interim studies and reports is contained
in Chapter 2 of the Feasibility Report.
3. Project Description
This project will help a declining but critical Delta ecosystem by restoring and maintaining
aquatic and riparian habitats in an area called Big Break, near Jersey Island in the western
Delta, where erosion and subsidence have caused the loss of fast lands and marshes to
3

shallow open water. Restored intertidal marshes at Big Break will provide habitat for native
plants and wildlife, including species designated as endangered, threatened and specialstatus by federal and state resource agencies, and will marginally improve floodplain
functions and Delta water quality.

The project will use dredged materials produced by maintenance dredging of the nearby
Stockton Ship Channel and conveyed as a slurry through a temporary floating pipeline to
form a base on which new marsh habitat can form. The project will place approximately
100,000 cubic yards of material within the target area during each annual dredging cycle;
over its ten-year construction period a total of 1,000,000 cubic yards of dredged will be
placed at Big Break, creating about 340 acres of new marshlands. Vegetation will be planted
incrementally during each dredged material placement cycle, so that marsh grasses and
aquatic plants will take root as of the first year of dredged material placement.
4. Description of Lands, Easements, Rights-Of-Way, Relocations, and Disposal Areas
(LERRDs) required for project construction
The District’s Cadastral Section identified four property parcels within which real estate
rights will need to be acquired to construct the project: two tracts of shallow open water
apparently owned in fee by the East Bay Regional Park District, where the project’s 340
acres of new intertidal marsh would be created, and two nearby parcels of marsh and fast
lands on Jersey Island owned in fee by the Ironhouse Sanitary District, a sewage treatment
and water purification agency serving Oakley and Bethel Island. On Jersey Island the project
will need to acquire a 10-year right to run a temporary pipeline alongside an agricultural
ditch, a 10-year right to create and use a one-acre temporary construction and laydown yard
at the south end of this pipeline for storage of project equipment and materials during each
annual dredging cycle (a period of about two months each year), and a 10-year right of
vehicular use of existing unpaved private roads on Jersey Island for delivery of materials and
construction equipment (also for about two months each year); as shown in the Cadastral
Map and Tract Register ( Exhibit B)
a) Accordingly the Non-Federal Sponsor East Bay Regional Park District will provide the
following real property interests of the submerged lands at Big Break:
i.

EBRPD will provide through agreement/MOU 340 acres of submerged lands for
real property use within the project’s proposed footprint,

ii.

A lease executed by the NFS may also be required from the State Lands
Commission pending their investigation on their jurisdiction in the proposed
project area. To summarize, the lease application may include:
Standard Application for Lease of State Lands
Project information (Scope of work, technical data, timeline, map, etc.)
SAP (Sample & Analysis Plan)
SAR (Sample & Analysis Report)
DMMO authorization letter to dredge

Recent photos (approx. 5 or 6 photos taken within the past 6 months)

b) The Non-Federal Sponsor will need to obtain the following real property interests from
the Iron house Sanitary District:
c)
i.
A ten-year .70 acre pipeline easement for placement and operation of a temporary
18”diameter dredged material pipeline across Jersey Island, on a run of about
1,000 linear feet, to remain in place for the ten-year construction phase of the
project, or until all dredged material is conveyed to the restoration site*; and
*(The sections of pipeline that will cross the levee maintenance roads on
the north and south levees of Jersey Island will be covered with dirt to
avoid obstructing vehicle passage and will be removed at the conclusion
of the two-month construction cycle each year.)
ii.

A ten-year easement over a rectangle of land approximately 1.00 acre in size at
the south side of Jersey Island adjacent to the point the temporary pipeline crosses
over the island’s south-side levee, for construction of a fenced equipment and
materials staging yard to use for approximately two months each year during the
Project’s ten-year period of construction; and

iii.

A ten-year, vehicular easement or right of entry over approximately 5.20 acres of
existing unpaved levee roads and an agricultural access lane bisecting Jersey
Island adjacent to the proposed pipeline location, for use by construction vehicles
and equipment belonging to the project’s contractor and by vehicles belonging to
the Corps and the non-federal sponsor, primarily during each year’s two-month
dredging cycle.

No structures presently exist within the project footprint that would require relocation during
project construction.
Upon execution of a Project Partnership Agreement (PPA) the Sacramento District
Engineering Branch will prepare final designs for project construction. The tract register and
tract maps will reflect any final modifications to project designs for staging areas, access
requirements, and restoration features and a take letter will be provided to the Non-Federal
Sponsor for acquisition of the appropriate real property rights and interests.

5. LERRDs Owned by the Non-Federal Sponsor
The East Bay Regional Parks District owns 340 acres of fee title lands in the proposed
project area. The District would be obligated to contribute to the partnership all LERRD in its
possession that may be required for project construction and maintenance.
The Park District was created by the California Legislature in 1934 to acquire, hold, and
protect open space and park lands. The District’s enabling statute allows the District’s
Board of Directors to “dedicate” lands for park and open space purposes in perpetuity.
Once dedicated, the District is prohibited from any sale or other conveyance of those
lands without a vote of the public. (California Pub. Resources Code, §§ 5540.)
Consistent with the Park District’s mission, the vast majority of the Park District's
120,000+ acres, including the lands at Big Break, are protected as parks and open space
through this dedication process. While there are some narrow exceptions to the
prohibition on conveyance for public agency partnerships, the Park District's policy and
practice for nearly 85 years has been to not convey any property interest over
dedicated parklands. Because the land at Big Break has been dedicated as permanent
park and open space, any conveyance of a property interest in that land would be
legally constrained, and would be contrary to District’s core mission and policy.

While conveyance of fee title is not a legal option for the Park District, they are
interested in working with the Corps to allow this project to proceed on Park District
lands. The Park District is interested in exploring the option which would involve the
Park District entering into a three party agreement with the Army Corps and
Department of Water Resources to become a second non-federal sponsor of the
restoration project.

6. Crediting for LERRDs
For purposes of crediting the Sponsor must provide a credit appraisal of the real property
it contributes or obtains in performance of its obligations under the PPA.
The Sponsor’s credit appraisal must conform to Uniform Appraisal Standards (USPAP)
and must be prepared by a certified appraiser who is approved as a qualified appraiser by the
USACE Sacramento District Appraisal Branch.
7. Standard Federal Estates
Temporary Work Area Easement
A temporary easement and right-of-way in, on, over and across portions of Jersey Island for a
period not to exceed 10 years after the execution of the construction contract, for use by the
State of California, its representatives, agents, and contractors as a (borrow area) (work area),
including the right to borrow and/or deposit fill, spoil and waste material thereon) (move,
store and remove equipment and supplies, and erect and remove temporary structures on the
land and to perform any other work necessary and incident to the construction of the Delta
Project, together with the right to trim, cut, fell and remove there from all trees, underbrush,
obstructions, and any other vegetation, structures, or obstacles within the limits of the rightof-way; reserving however, to the landowners, their heirs and assigns, all such rights and
privileges as may be used without interfering with or abridging the rights and easement
hereby acquired; subject, however, to existing easements for public roads and highways,
public utilities, railroads and pipelines.
Temporary Well and Pipeline Easement
A temporary and assignable easement in, on, over and across portions of Jersey Island for a
period not to exceed 10 years to locate, construct, operate, maintain, repair, replace, and/or
remove pipeline(s) and appurtenances thereto; subject, however, to existing easements for
public roads and highways, public utilities, railroads and pipelines.
Non Standard Estates
Lease
The California State Land Commission may require a lease executed by the NFS for work on
their jurisdictional lands prior to solicitation of a construction contract. The Commission is
currently investigating the area to determine where and if a lease is required. The following
items may be required to complete a lease.

No federally-owned lands are available or needed for this project.
10. Application of Navigational Servitude to the LERRDs Requirement
Use of the Navigational Servitude is not needed for this project. Contractors will have to
obtain approvals from the Coast Guard and with the Sacramento District’s Regulatory
Branch for placement of temporary floating pipelines during dredging operations to ensure
proper marking and signaling within navigable waterways.

12. Anticipated Increased Flooding and Impacts

Real Estate Plan

20 June 2018

Hydraulic modeling and analysis show that the new intertidal marsh lands to be created by
the project would not increase flooding risks and instead would tend to reduce the velocity of
water flowing through the Big Break area.
13. Cost Estimate for Necessary Real Property Rights
A preliminary estimate of the costs of acquiring LERRDs necessary to support the project’s
Tentatively Selected Plan was prepared to assist in the calculation of a cost-benefit analysis
for the purpose of quantifying the federal interest in the proposed Delta Islands project.
The cost estimate meets the intent of Real Estate Policy Guidance Letter (PGL) No. 31, Real
Estate Support to Civil Works Planning Paradigm (3x3x3), which requires a less formal
estimation of the cost of acquiring real property rights when these costs are expected to
represent a small component of overall project costs. The PGL directs that “For projects in
which the value of real estate (lands, improvements, and severance damages) are not
expected to exceed ten percent of total project costs (total cost to implement project), a cost
estimate (or rough order of magnitude) will be acceptable for purposes of the feasibility
phase.”
The table on the following page estimates the direct and administrative costs associated with
acquiring real property interests necessary to construct, operate and maintain the proposed
project. This estimate was prepared on March 16, 2018.
If the project’s selected plan receives headquarters endorsement at the scheduled Agency
Decision Milestone (ADM) meeting, real property acquisition costs will be updated
thereafter to reflect current price levels.

14. Relocation Assistance Benefits
Not Applicable. Project area consists of shallow open water and open marsh or agricultural
lands; no relocations will be necessary.

15. Mineral / Timber Activity
A prior grantor, Porter Estate Company Oakley Ranch, Inc., retains a perpetual right to enter
the subsurface of the project’s 340 acre marsh restoration area (at Parcel Nos. 037-191-004
and 037-191-029) below a depth of 250 feet from the surface “. . . to mine, excavate, drill,
whip stock, explore, text, collect, produce and distribute” any oil, petroleum, natural gas,
hydrocarbons or other minerals found therein. But the mineral deed holder retains no right of
surface entry, nor any right to enter within 250 feet of the surface.
Because no interference with the project would arise in the event the mineral rights holder
were to exercise its subterranean rights, no subordination of its real property interest is
needed.
No timber is present within the project footprint.

11

Delta Islands and Levees Feasibility Study
16. Non-Federal Sponsor’s Ability to Acquire

Real Estate Plan

20 June 2018

The non-Federal sponsor possesses experienced real estate staff members capable of drafting
real property instruments and professionally managing the acquisition of the real interests
needed for the Delta Islands project. As an agency of the State of California the non-Federal
sponsor also possesses condemnation authority.

17. Zoning Anticipated in Lieu of Acquisition
There is not an application or enactment of new zoning ordinances proposed in lieu of, or
to facilitate, acquisition in connection with the project nor are such actions anticipated.

18. Acquisition Schedule
The non-Federal sponsor will be directed to begin real property acquisition for the Project
only after a PPA is fully executed. A risk letter will be sent from the Corps to the State of
California alerting the State, as non-Federal Sponsor, to the risks associated with purchasing
project lands or obtaining easements, servitudes or rights-of-way in advance of the execution
of a PPA. The project’s proposed period of construction extends through ten annual
dredging cycles, with an anticipated placement of 100,000 cubic yards of dredged material
within the project area each year. Thus the construction phase of the project is expected to
extend to ten or more years.

19. Description of Facility and Utility Relocations

Real Estate Plan

20 June 2018

No facility or utility relocations will be required for project construction.
20. Hazardous, Toxic, and Radiological Waste (HTRW)
Naturally Occurring Hazards
None are anticipated
Hazards from Agricultural Practices
None are anticipated.
Hazards from Historical Mercury Mining
None are anticipated
Borrow Materials
Historic chemical and granular test results of dredged materials from the Stockton Ship
Channel at existing placement sites indicate that the dredged materials are chemically cleaner
than the existing baseline sampling from the project area footprint. Future materials from
dredging operations would be sampled prior to operations and maintenance dredging.
Materials meeting baseline criteria would be utilized for marsh habitat creation. Materials
not meeting baseline criteria would be conveyed to alternative disposal sites.
Project construction activities are not expected to disturb existing HTRW sources that could
lead to contamination of environmental resources. Therefore the tentatively selected plan is
not expected to create any measurable HTRW effects.
21. Attitude of Landowners
Letters have been sent to the East Bay Regional Park District and to the Ironhouse Sanitary
District to introduce the project and to request cooperation in providing necessary real
property rights for project construction and operation. Two recent meetings have occurred
with the land owners and the East Bay Regional Park District has indicated that they are
interested in being a second non-federal sponsor and are not only supportive of the project
but have joined us to participate as a sponsor.
In February 2013 when the project included flood risk features that were subsequently
eliminated, two scoping meetings were held to educate the public about the study efforts and
to request comments, in accordance with NEPA and CEQA. Results of these outreach efforts

14

were favorable. Numerous agencies, organizations, and individuals, including the U.S.
Bureau of Reclamation, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA Fisheries), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, California
Department of Fish and Wildlife, Sacramento County, San Joaquin County, Contra Costa
County, Yolo County, Alameda County, Solano County, various levee maintenance agencies,
local landowners and residents expressed support for marshland creation and habitat
restoration in the area of the project site.

THE SECRETARY OF THE ARMY

1. I submit for transmission to Congress my interim report on Delta Islands and Levees,
California. It is accompanied by the report of the district and division engineers. The general
authority for flood control investigations in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta is under the Flood
Control Act of 1936, Public Law (P.L.) 74-738), Sections 2 and 6 and amended by the Flood
Control Act of 1938, P.L. 75-761. Further studies of the river system were requested in the
resolution of the House Committee on Public Works adopted May 8, 1964 requesting review of
“the report on the Sacramento-San Joaquin Basin Streams, California, published as House
Document No. 367, 81st Congress, 1st Session, and other reports, with a view to determining
whether any modifications of the recommendations contained therein are advisable at this
time….” Conference Report 108-357, which accompanied the Energy and Water Development
Appropriations Act of 2004, P.L. 108-137, provided further Congressional intent and funding for
the Delta Islands and Levees feasibility study. Conference Report 108-357 stated, “The
conferees have provided $1,100,000 for the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, California, study
including…$500,000 to initiate and complete a reconnaissance study to prioritize and evaluate
environmental restoration, flood protection and related purposes for the Delta Islands and
Levees.”
2. The reporting officers recommend a plan authorizing restoration of 340 acres of intertidal
marsh at Big Break, located in Contra Costa County. Big Break is a historic marsh area that was
formerly converted to farmland, but has been inundated since a levee break in 1928. Because of
past subsidence, Big Break has remained as unvegetated open water for the past 90 years. The
recommended plan would use approximately one million cubic yards of clean dredged material
from annual maintenance of the nearby Stockton Deep Water Ship Channel over an
approximately 10-year period to restore approximately 340 acres of Big Break to intertidal marsh
elevations. Native marsh vegetation would be restored through planting and natural
colonization. The recommended plan is supported by the primary non-federal sponsor, the
California Department of Water Resources (DWR). The proposed restoration area is owned and
managed by the East Bay Regional Park District (District), which also supports the
recommended plan and will be a second sponsor for the purpose of providing lands that the
District currently owns.

_______________

1 This report contains the proposed recommendation of the Chief of Engineers. The recommendation is
subject to change to reflect Washington-level review and comments from federal and state agencies.

SUBJECT: Delta Islands and Levees, California

3. The Delta Islands and Levees Feasibility Study investigated ecosystem restoration and flood
risk management problems and opportunities throughout the Delta. Flood risks in the major
urban areas on the periphery of the Delta are being addressed by other current Corps projects and
studies. No economically-justified structural flood risk management measures were identified
for the small communities and agricultural areas within the Delta. Non-structural flood risk
management measures are being implemented under existing State programs and could be
implemented under existing Corps authorities. Consequently, no additional authorization for
flood risk management is currently recommended. The feasibility report addresses ecosystem
restoration in only a portion of the authorized study area, therefore it is identified as an interim
report.
4. The recommended plan is the National Ecosystem Restoration (NER) plan. It would restore
340 acres of intertidal marsh habitat in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, an ecosystem of
national significance where only 5% of the historic marsh remains. Prior to levee construction,
the Delta was comprised almost entirely of tidal marsh. After levees were constructed, the land
subsided and compacted as it was drained and farmed. Delta lands are now as much as 20 feet
below sea level, which typically makes marsh restoration prohibitively expensive. For that
reason, restoration of tidal marsh has been very limited in the central Delta, where the most
subsidence has occurred and tidal marsh was historically most prevalent. The recommended
plan would beneficially use maintenance-dredged material from an ongoing federal navigation
project to provide cost-effective subsidence reversal. The restored tidal marsh would provide
habitat for multiple federally-listed species, notably salmonids and Delta smelt. The restored
habitat would also benefit many species of migratory birds as they travel through the Delta on
the Pacific Flyway.
5. Based on October 2018 price levels, the estimated total project first cost is $25,041,000. The
federal share of the estimated first cost is currently estimated at $16,277,000. The non-federal
cost of the estimated first cost is $8,764,000. DWR would be responsible for the operation,
maintenance, repair, replacement, and rehabilitation (OMRR&R) of the project after
construction, currently estimated at $5,000 per year.
6. Based on a 2.75-percent interest rate and a 50-year period of analysis, the total equivalent
average annual costs of the project are estimated to be $1,235,000, including OMRR&R.
Ecosystem restoration benefits for the recommended plan include generating an estimated 111.44
average annual habitat units and restoring approximately 340 acres of intertidal marsh habitat.
7. The goals and objectives included in the Environmental Operating Principles and Campaign
Plan of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have been integrated into the Delta Islands and Levees
feasibility study process. The recommended plan has been designed to avoid or minimize
environmental impacts while maximizing the ecosystem benefits.
8. In accordance with the Corps guidance on review of decision documents, all technical,
engineering and scientific work underwent an open, dynamic and rigorous review process to
ensure technical quality. This included District Quality Control (DQC), Agency Technical
Review (ATR), an Independent External Peer Review (IEPR) (Type I), and a Corps

SUBJECT: Delta Islands and Levees, California

Headquarters policy and legal review. All concerns from these reviews have been addressed and
incorporated into the final report. The Final IEPR Report was issued in August 2014. A total of
15 comments were provided, three of which were identified as having high significance. The
IEPR comments focused on the inclusion of the Bay Delta Conservation Plan/Delta Plan as part
of the future without project conditions, the criteria used to eliminate FRM measures, and the
sufficiency of the hydraulic/geotechnical analyses and modeling that was used to assess
environmental impacts. The IEPR panel comments and recommendations for resolution were
concurred with and have been incorporated into the FR/EIS.
9. Washington level review indicated that the project recommended by the reporting officers is
technically sound, environmentally and socially acceptable, and economically justified. The plan
complies with all essential elements of the 1983 U.S. Water Resources Council’s Economic and
Environmental Principles and Guidelines for Water and Land Related Resources Implementation
Studies. The recommended plan complies with other administrative and legislative policies and
guidelines. Also, the views of interested parties, including federal, state and local agencies have
been considered.
10. I concur with the findings, conclusions, and recommendations of the reporting officers.
I recommend that the recommended plan for ecosystem restoration in the Sacramento-San
Joaquin Delta, California be authorized at an estimated first cost of $25,041,000 with such
modifications thereof as in the discretion of the Chief of Engineers may be advisable. My
recommendation is subject to cost sharing, financing, and other applicable requirements of
federal and state laws and policies including Section 103 of the Water Resources Development
Act (WRDA) of 1986, as amended (33 U.S.C. 2213). Accordingly, the non-federal sponsors
must agree to comply with applicable federal laws and policies, including but not limited to:
a. Provide 35 percent of total ecosystem restoration costs as further specified below:
1. Provide 35 percent of design costs in accordance with the terms of a design agreement
entered into prior to commencement of design work for the project;
2. Provide all lands, easements, and rights-of-way, including those required for
relocations, the borrowing of material, and the disposal of dredged or excavated material;
perform or ensure the performance of all relocations; and construct all improvements required on
lands, easements, and rights-of-way to enable the disposal of dredged or excavated material all as
determined by the Government to be required or to be necessary for the construction, operation,
and maintenance of the project;
3. Provide, during construction, any additional funds necessary to make its total
contribution equal to 35 percent of total project costs;
b. Prevent obstructions or encroachments on the project (including prescribing and enforcing
regulations to prevent such obstructions or encroachments) such as any new developments on
project lands, easements, and rights-of-way or the addition of facilities which might reduce the
outputs produced by the ecosystem restoration features, hinder operation and maintenance of the
project, or interfere with the project’s proper function;

3

DAEN
SUBJECT: Delta Islands and Levees, California

c. Shall not use the ecosystem restoration features or lands, easements, and rights-of-way
required for such features as a wetlands bank or mitigation credit for any other project;
d. For so long as the project remains authorized, operate, maintain, repair, rehabilitate, and
replace the project, or functional portions of the project, including any mitigation features, at no
cost to the federal government, in a manner compatible with the project’s authorized purposes
and in accordance with applicable federal and state laws and regulations and any specific
directions prescribed by the federal government;
e. Hold and save the United States free from all damages arising from the construction,
operation, maintenance, repair, rehabilitation, and replacement of the project and any
betterments, except for damages due to the fault or negligence of the United States or its
contractors;
f. Perform, or ensure performance of, any investigations for hazardous substances that are
determined necessary to identify the existence and extent of any hazardous substances regulated
under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act
(CERCLA), Public Law 96-510, as amended (42 U.S.C. 9601-9675), that may exist in, on, or
under lands, easements, or rights-of-way that the federal government determines to be required
for construction, operation, and maintenance of the project. However, for lands that the federal
government determines to be subject to the navigation servitude, only the federal government
shall perform such investigations unless the federal government provides the non-federal
sponsors with prior specific written direction, in which case the non-federal sponsors shall
perform such investigations in accordance with such written direction;
g. Assume, as between the federal government and the non-federal sponsors, complete
financial responsibility for all necessary cleanup and response costs of any hazardous substances
regulated under CERCLA that are located in, on, or under lands, easements, or rights-of-way that
the federal government determines to be required for construction, operation, and maintenance of
the project;
h. Agree, as between the federal government and the non-federal sponsors, that the
non-federal sponsors shall be considered the operator of the project for the purpose of CERCLA
liability, and to the maximum extent practicable, operate, maintain, repair, rehabilitate, and
replace the project in a manner that will not cause liability to arise under CERCLA; and
11. The recommendation contained herein reflects the information available at this time and
current Departmental policies governing formulation of individual projects. It does not reflect
program and budgeting priorities inherent in the formulation of a national Civil Works
construction program nor the perspective of higher review levels within the Executive Branch.
Consequently, the recommendation may be modified before it is transmitted to the Congress as
a proposal for authorization and implementation funding. However, prior to transmittal to

DRAFT
RECORD OF DECISION
DELTA ISLANDS AND LEVEES,
SACRAMENTO – SAN JOAQUIN RIVER DELTA, CALIFORNIA
ECOSYSTEM RESTORATION
The final interim integrated feasibility report and joint environmental impact statement
(final integrated report), dated [add date], and the report of the Chief of Engineers, dated [add
date] for the Delta Islands and Levees Feasibility Study addresses ecosystem restoration in the
California Delta. Based on these reports, the reviews of other Federal, State, and local agencies,
Native American Tribes, input from the public, and the review by my staff, I find the plan
recommended by the Chief of Engineers to be technically feasible, economically justified, cost
effective, in accordance with environmental statutes, and in the public interest. Public review of
the draft FR/EIS was completed on June 2, 2014. All comments submitted during the public
comment period were responded to in the Final FR/EIS. A 30-day waiting period and state and
agency review of the Final FR/EIS was completed on {add DATE SAR PERIOD ENDED}.
The integrated report, incorporated herin by reference, evaluated the restoration of
intertidal marsh to create important habitat for sensitive and threatened species, including the
delta smelt. The plan recommended for implementation is the Recommended Plan and
Environmentally Preferred Alternative – Alternative 3, and includes:


Restoration of up to 340 acres of intertidal marsh habitat by reversing the effects of
subsidence at Big Break through the placement of up to 1 million cubic yards of dredged
material;



Approximately 90 acres would be planted with aquatic vegetation; and,



Approximatley 250 acres would be shallow water habitat for fish species

The recommended plan would implement the associated monitoring and adaptive
management plan. Structural flood risk management measures were considered in this study but
were ultimately screened out due to a less than favorable benefit cost ratio, resulting in a single
purpose ecosystem restoration study.
In addition to the recommended plan described above, two additional alternatives were
evaluatied in the impact assessment: a “no action” plan, and Alternative 2, which includes
creation of 160 acres of intertidal marsh habitat at Big Break placed over 5 years. Several other
structural and non-structural alternatives were considered but were eliminated due to greater cost
relative to benefits, adverse environmental effects, and/or inconsistency with policy.
All practicable means to avoid or minimize adverse environmental effects were analyzed
and incorporated into the recommended plan. Key environmental factors, which are coordinated
with the appropriate resource agencies, include water quality compliance during the placement of
1

dredged material, and potential impacts to listed fish species during construction. These impacts
would be short term during construction, with long term benefits to fish species and water quality
from successful restoration. Best Management Practices (BMPs) would be implemented during
construction to limit these impacts, including water quality control measures such as sacrificial
straw bales and turbidity curtains, if necessary, in order to limit the area where increased
turbidity would occur. By using the BMPs to limit the area of impact, it also reduces the
possibility of significant cumulative impacts from turbidity. There would be long term beneficial
cumulative effects from implementing the Delta Study, in combination with other restoration
efforts going on in the Delta. There would be no mitigation associated with this action; however,
in accordance with Corps policy for ecosystem restoration projects, post-construction
monitoring would be required to ensure that the restoration meets the established success criteria
in the monitoring and adaptive management plan. The plan estimates 5 years of postconstruction monitoring for each segment of restoration, for a total of 15 years of monitoring,
due to the 10 year construction period. This proposed monitoring period is to account for the
need to adaptively construct the project and apply any lessons learned throughout the 10 year
construction timeframe. Monitoring will cease when the restoration has met the established
success criteria, which could occur less than 5 years following the final construction year.
In accordance with section 7 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended, the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) issued a Biological Opinion on June 14, 2018. Both
USFWS and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) determined that the project will
enhance critical habitat for sensitive species. All terms and conditions resulting from these
consultations shall be implemented in order to minimize take of threatened and endangered
species. A final Coordination Act Report was received from USFWS on June 26, 2018, with
recommendations for conservation measures to be included in the recommended plan under the
Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act of 1934. The Corps will consider these recommendations
and implement them, as appropriate, during final design of the restoration project.
The National Marine Fisheries Service concurred with the Corps’ determination that
temporary impacts during construction of the recommended plan may affect, but are not likely to
affect listed fish species, and long term the recommended plan is likely to provide benefits to
juvenile salmonids and sturgeon. A concurrence letter was received from NMFS on June 15,
2018. In addition, the NMFS concurrence letter identified that the recommended plan would
result in no adverse effects to essential fish habitat under the Magnusson-Stevens Fisheries
Management Act.
In accordance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966
(NHPA), as amended, the Corps determined that the recommended plan will not adversely affect
historic properties. A concurrence letter was received from the State Historic Preservation
Officer (SHPO) on May 29, 2014. During the preconstruction engineering and design phase of
the project, the Jersey Island pipeline and haul route footprint will be inventoried and evaluated
for historic properties. If any additional effects are identified, consultation would be reinitiated
under Section 106 of the NHPA, as appropriate.

2

In accordance with the guidelines for specification of disposal sites for dredged or fill
material under section 404(b)(1) of the Clean Water Act, the Corps determined that the
recommended plan is the least environmentally damaging practicable alternative. A water
quality certification pursuant to section 401 of the Clean Water Act will be obtained from the
California Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) during the preconstruction engineering and design phase. In a letter dated July 03, 2018, the RWQCB stated
that they support implementation of the recommended plan. The Corps confirmed that the
recommended plan is consistent with the RWQCB requirements and committed to developing
and implementing appropriate BMPs in coordination with the RWQCB, including the
preparation of a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan during the pre-construction engineering
and design phase.
In addition with the above discussed potential effects and BMPs to avoid or minimize
adverse effects, the Corps will coordinate with the East Bay Regional Park District (EBRPD) to
ensure that recreational boaters are aware of the construction activities in Big Break. As
necessary, safety boats and flaggers would be used to provide detours to boaters if routes are
blocked by the pipeline. Due to the reduction in recreational boating acreage, the Corps will
incorporate a “kayak trail” into the restoration area as part of the preconstruction design process.
Technical, environmental, and economic criteria used in the formulation of alternative
plans were those specified in the Water Resource Council’s 1983 Economic and Environmental
Principles and Guidelines for Water and Related Land Resource Implementation Studies. All
applicable laws, executive orders, regulations and local government plans were considered in the
evaluation of alternatives. Based on review of these evaluations, I find the ecosystem restoration
benefits of the recommended plan outweigh the costs of any adverse effects. This Record of
Decision completes the National Environmental Policy Act process.

Type of Statement: Final Environmental Impact Statement
Lead Federal Agency: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Sacramento District
Lead State Agency: California Department of Water Resources
Proposed Action: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and the California Department
of Water Resources (DWR) propose to restore approximately 340 acres of intertidal marsh
habitat in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta (Delta). The restoration work would involve
placing dredged material into the shallow open water of a flooded Delta island and planting
aquatic vegetation over an estimated 10-year period to create 340 acres of intertidal marsh in an
area now lost to land subsidence.
Abstract: USACE initiated the Delta Study in 2006 at the request of the DWR, the non-Federal
sponsor for the study. USACE is the lead agency for the Feasibility Study and is also the lead
under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). This report: (1) identifies flood risk
management and ecosystem restoration problems and opportunities in the Delta; (2) develops
and evaluates measures to solve identified problems; (3) formulates and compares alternatives
for ecosystem restoration; and (4) identifies a Recommended Plan (RP) for implementation. A
draft of this FR/EIS was concurrently released for public review, internal policy review, Agency
Technical Review (ATR), and Independent External Peer Review (IEPR). The present report
has been updated based on comments received during these reviews and finalized to present the
RP for eventual authorization.
The RP is the most reasonably efficient contribution to the Delta, restoring 340 acres of intertidal
marsh habitat in the Delta at a cost of $25M. The RP provides a unique opportunity to restore
intertidal marsh, habitat which is now greatly reduced in this ecosystem of national significance.
The RP links the proposed ecosystem restoration actions to historic and ongoing USACE
navigation projects, providing a cost effective mechanism to implement otherwise costly
subsidence reversal goals. This action would restore habitat for multiple Federally listed species,
notably salmonids and Delta smelt. The restored habitat would also benefit millions of
migratory fowl on the Pacific Flyway as they travel through the Delta.
Public Review and Comment: The public review period for the final FR/EIS will begin on
September 21, 2018 and close on October 21, 2018. Questions and comments may be sent to:

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This report: (1) identifies flood risk management and ecosystem restoration problems
and opportunities in the Sacramento – San Joaquin River Delta (Delta); (2) develops and
evaluates measures to solve identified problems; (3) formulates and compares alternatives for
ecosystem restoration; and (4) identifies a Recommended Plan (RP) for implementation that is an
efficient and cost effective method of disposing of dredged material. This integrated Feasibility
Report/Environmental Impact Statement (FR/EIS) describes the planning process followed to
identify the Federal interest in the RP and serves as the environmental compliance document
under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). This final FR/EIS was revised in
response to public review, internal policy review, Agency Technical Review (ATR), and
Independent External Peer Review (IEPR), and has been finalized to present the recommended
plan for eventual authorization.

Background
USACE initiated the Delta Islands and Levees Feasibility Study (Delta Study) in 2006 at
the request of the California Department of Water Resources (DWR), the non-Federal sponsor
for the study. USACE is the lead agency for the Feasibility Study and is also the lead under
NEPA. DWR, the lead agency under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), will
initiate the CEQA process upon Federal authorization for the design and construction of a
project. Numerous other agencies, organizations, and individuals have participated in the study
including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), National Marine Fisheries Service
(NMFS), and the East Bay Regional Park District.
The Delta (Figure ES-1) is part of the largest estuary on the West Coast of the United
States and is home to hundreds of species of fish, birds, mammals and reptiles. The Delta is
considered an ecosystem of national significance. Farm land irrigated by Delta water contributes
billions of dollars in agricultural production to the Nation. Two deep water ports in the Delta
serve as important marine terminals for vessels transporting bulk agricultural and industrial
cargos through the Delta’s deep draft navigation channels to world markets. Delta levees
protect thousands of acres of orchards, farms, and vineyards as well as critical infrastructure
including state and interstate highways, major rail lines, natural gas fields, gas and fuel pipelines,
water conveyance infrastructure, drinking water pipelines, and numerous towns, businesses and
homes.

Final Report

The Delta is a web of channels and reclaimed islands at the confluence of the
Sacramento, San Joaquin, Cosumnes, Mokelumne, and Calaveras Rivers. Forty percent of
California’s land area lies within the watersheds of these five rivers. The Delta consists of about
738,000 acres of agricultural and developed lands, wetlands and tidal marshes segregated into 80
tracts and islands by 1,100 miles of levees and a labyrinth of navigation channels, rivers,
tributaries, streams, sloughs, waterways and shallow open water expanses. The land protected
by these levees is predominantly agricultural (corn, wheat, vineyards, stone fruit, cattle) and
waterways provide recreational outlets for nearby urban areas and important habitat for fish and
wildlife, including Federally listed species under the Endangered Species Act. The Delta is also
the largest single source of California’s water, providing 25 million Californians with drinking
water and irrigating millions of acres of farmland in the Central Valley. In addition, more than
500,000 people live within the Delta and rely upon it for water, recreation, and livelihood. The
majority of that population is in the greater Sacramento and Stockton areas and is the focus of
other USACE Flood Risk Management studies; however, there are communities within the
Delta. Several Delta towns, known as “legacy communities,” are listed in the National Registry
of Historic Places.
Historically, the Delta was defined by tidal wetlands, primarily comprised of peat soils.
The Swamp and Overflow Land Act of 1850 transferred ownership of all Federally owned
swamp and overflow land, including Delta marshes, from the Federal Government to private
parties agreeing to drain the land and turn it to productive, presumably agricultural, use. Passage
of this Act stimulated the reclamation of wetlands in the Delta through the construction of levees
and drainage channels, typically by the new land owners. The majority of levees in the Delta are
still privately owned and maintained. As a consequence of these reclamation efforts, nearly 95
percent of the Delta’s historic wetland habitat has been converted to agricultural and urban uses.

Consideration of Alternative Plans
During the feasibility study, the Federal planning process for development of water
resource projects was followed to identify a RP for implementation. Following the identification
of ecosystem restoration and flood related problems and opportunities, specific planning
objectives and planning constraints were identified. Various management measures were then
identified to maximize the planning objectives and minimize the planning constraints.
Management measures were screened based on how well they met the study objectives and their
cost effectiveness. After initial screening, several categories of measures were dropped from
further consideration, including structural flood risk management measures, since no Federal
interest in such measures could be identified. The retained management measures were
combined to form alternative plans, each focused on restoration of intertidal marsh habitat.
Alternative plans were then compared through cost effectiveness and incremental cost analyses
based on costs and outputs.

Final Report

Recommended Plan
The recommended National Environmental Restoration (NER) plan (Alternative 3) is the
most reasonably efficient contribution to the California Delta, an ecosystem of national
significance, restoring 340 acres of intertidal marsh habitat in the Delta at a cost of $25 million.
The RP (Figure ES-2) provides a unique opportunity to restore intertidal marsh, a habitat which
is now greatly reduced in this ecosystem of national significance. Prior to levee construction in
the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Delta consisted almost solely of tidal marsh. As levees
were constructed and marsh bottoms pumped dry for agricultural production, floodplains were
disconnected from the waterways and land began to subside and compact as it was farmed and
developed for human use. Delta lands are now as much as 20 feet below sea level. This is too
low for tidal marsh habitat formation without the incorporation of subsidence reversal strategies
(importing of fill material), but the volume of material typically needed is cost prohibitive. For
this reason, restoration of tidal marsh has been very limited throughout the central Delta in
particular, where subsidence is most extensive and also where tidal marsh was historically most
prevalent. The RP gets over this barrier by linking the proposed ecosystem restoration actions to
historic and ongoing USACE navigation projects. This provides a cost effective source of
imported fill putting restoration of habitat for multiple Federally listed species, notably
salmonids and Delta smelt, within economic reach. The restored habitat would also benefit the
millions of migratory fowl on the Pacific Flyway as they travel through the Delta, which is part
of the largest estuary on the West Coast.
The national significance of the Delta has been demonstrated many times through
decades of Federal authorizations and partnerships. The CALFED Bay-Delta Program, which
was formulated in answer to the water crises of the 1990s, is a unique collaboration among 25
State and Federal agencies to improve California’s water supply and the ecological health of the
Bay-Delta. The San Francisco Estuary Partnership is a coalition of resource agencies, nonprofits, citizens, and scientists working to protect, restore, and enhance water quality and fish and
wildlife habitat in the Bay-Delta. Most recently, the 2009 California Bay-Delta Memorandum of
Understanding Among Federal Agencies named the Bay-Delta “among the most important
estuary ecosystems in the Nation” and committed the Federal agencies to work in partnership
with the State and stakeholders to carry out the vision of “a healthy and sustainable Bay-Delta
ecosystem that provides for a high-quality, reliable, and sustainable long-term water supply for
California, and restores the environmental integrity and sustainability of the system.” The RP
recommends Federal action to restore 340 acres of nearly extirpated intertidal marsh habitat at a
cost of $25 million in this ecosystem of national significance.
The principle feature of the RP is the placement of 1,000,000 cubic yards of fill material
into Big Break from Operations and Maintenance dredging of the Stockton Deep Water Ship
Channel to restore tidal habitat elevations. A Monitoring and Adaptive Management Plan has
been developed and included in the final report. Monitoring and Adaptive Management costs are
included in project first costs.
In addition to the above, USACE recommends continued flood risk communication and
flood warning and preparedness planning efforts, as described in Chapter 3.

Environmental Effects
The effects to the environment have been considered throughout the study and
opportunities have been evaluated to provide environmental restoration, as described above. The
proposed alternatives, while providing long-term benefits to the Delta, would also have shortterm adverse effects on some resources. Various minimization measures have been considered
including construction timing, location of fill material placement, material source selection sites,
and avoidance of certain areas. A summary of impacts, minimization measures, and level of
impacts is provided in Table ES-1.
In all cases, the potential adverse environmental effects would be reduced to a less-thansignificant level through project design, construction practices, preconstruction surveys and
analysis, regulatory requirements, and best management practices. No compensatory mitigation
would be required for any of the alternatives. A National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System general construction permit would be required. A Storm Water Pollution Prevention
Plan and Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures Plan would be developed by the
contractor prior to construction.
The proposed footprint of the RP is currently open water habitat, which is a jurisdictional
Water of the U.S. under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. A Section 404(b)(1) analysis has
been conducted for the RP (Alternative 3) to analyze potential effects that could occur from the
placement of dredged materials in open water habitat (Appendix H). Potential adverse impacts
to vegetation communities and special status species have been greatly reduced through
construction design. Direct impacts to nesting birds and other sensitive species would be
avoided by implementing preconstruction surveys and scheduling of construction activities.
USACE has determined that the RP is likely to have adverse short-term effects to Delta smelt;
however, the project would provide long-term benefits to the smelt once the intertidal marsh
habitat is established. The RP is not likely to adversely affect listed salmonids, green sturgeon,
the giant garter snake and other special status species that may occur in the project area.
Coordination with USFWS and NMFS has been ongoing throughout the study. Biological
assessments were prepared for the listed terrestrial and aquatic species and submitted to USFWS
and NMFS to initiate formal consultation. A final Biological Opinion was received from the
USFWS on June 14, 2018, and a concurrence letter was received from NMFS on June 15, 2018.
Impacts to agricultural land would be minimized by avoiding active farm lands when
placing temporary pipelines. If any land is temporarily disturbed during construction, it would
be returned to agricultural production after construction. The RP is located in an estuary area
where urban populations are not present. Because of the lack of population in the area, the
project would have no adverse effect on socioeconomics, environmental justice, noise,
aesthetics, or public utilities and services. Because the RP proposes to create tidal marsh lands
and therefore does not contribute to occupancy, modification, or development of flood plains it
complies with Executive Order 11988, Flood Plain Management.

Areas of Controversy and Issues Raised by Agencies and the Public
Based on the comments received, USACE did not identify any major areas of
controversy; however, there were many comments expressing public concern about salinity and
water quality, and associated potential impacts on drinking water. The proposed restoration is
not anticipated to result in changes in the salinity content of the area. The project area is
primarily fresh water, and the dredged material is being acquired by a localized reach of the river
that has approximately the same salinity content as the restoration area.
Issues to be Resolved
There are no significant issues that need to be resolved from the public involvement
process. Some uncertainties that remain that would require additional consideration during
preconstruction design include:
•
•
•

Variability in the quantity of dredged material available in a given construction
season and associated adaptive management of construction;
Design considerations for a “kayak trail” through the restoration site; and,
Changes in the on-site conditions, such as changes in the active use of Jersey Island
for agriculture, or additional recruitment of non-native vegetation beyond the current
assumptions.

Estimated Cost and Cost Sharing

Final Report

CHAPTER 1 – INTRODUCTION
1.1

Purpose and Need

The purpose of the proposed study is to provide ecosystem restoration in the Sacramento
– San Joaquin River Delta (Delta). The communities and ecosystem within the Delta rely on an
existing levee network to contain flows in the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers. The 1,100
mile levee network is a mix of Federal and non-Federal levees, many of which do not meet
current U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE levee construction standards and could fail at
water levels well below top of levee. The levee network holds water back from flooding the
subsided islands/tracts during daily tidal fluctuations. Native habitat and natural river functions
in the study area have suffered extensive degradation over more than a century of levee
construction and conversion of the floodplain to agricultural and rural development, as well as
management of the system for municipal, industrial, and agricultural water supplies.
This report presents the findings of the Sacramento – San Joaquin Rivers Delta Islands
and Levees, California, Feasibility Study (Feasibility Study). The purpose of the Feasibility
Study is to determine whether a Federal interest 1 exists in providing Flood Risk Management
(FRM) and Ecosystem Restoration (ER) improvements to the Delta. ER was determined to be
the only Federal interest for the proposed project, as is discussed later in this report. This report
integrates plan formulation with documentation of environmental effects. This report will also
serve as an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), by providing documentation and analysis
required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, as amended.
0F

The report: (a) describes the flooding, ecosystem, and related water resource problems
and opportunities in the Delta; (b) expresses desired changes as planning objectives; and (c)
analyzes alternative plans to achieve these objectives. These alternative plans include a plan of
no action and various combinations of individual management measures 2. The economic, social,
and environmental effects of the alternative plans are described and a feasible plan is selected for
recommendation. The report also details the roles of USACE and the non-Federal sponsor
(California Department of Water Resources (DWR)) in implementing the Recommended Plan
(RP). The non-Federal sponsor is responsible for compliance with the California Environmental
Quality Act (CEQA). The report concludes with a recommendation for Congressional
authorization of the Recommended Plan, pending public review, policy reviews, and subsequent
revisions. Due to the limited scope of this study, this report will serve as an interim response to
the study authority, which is stated below.
1F

1

A project is said to be in the Federal interest if it is consistent with the mission of USACE and the project benefits
are in excess of the project costs.
2
A management measure is a feature or activity that can be implemented at a specific geographic site to address
one or more planning objectives.

Final Report

Study Authority

Authority for this investigation has roots in longstanding flood control laws. The
foundation for this investigation’s authority comes from the Flood Control Act of 1936 (Public
Law [P.L.] 74-738). Section 2 of this Act states:
“[T]hat, hereafter Federal investigations and improvements of river and other
waterways for flood control and allied purposes shall be under the jurisdiction of
and shall be prosecuted by the War Department under the direction of the
Secretary of War and supervision of the Chief of Engineers…”.
Section 6 of the 1936 Flood Control Act further states:
“The Secretary of War is hereby authorized and directed to cause preliminary
examinations and surveys for flood control at the following named
localities…Sacramento and San Joaquin River Valleys, California…Provided
further, That after the regular or formal reports made as authorized on any
examination, survey, project, or work under way or proposed are submitted to
Congress, no supplemental or additional report or estimate shall be made unless
authorized by law or by resolution of the Committee on Flood Control of the
House of Representative or the Committee on Commerce of the Senate.”
The Chief of Engineers completed a report based on the above authority. House
Document No. 367, 81st Congress, dated October 13, 1949, is a letter from the Secretary of the
Army on the Sacramento-San Joaquin Basin Streams, California, which states in part:
“A Letter from the Chief of Engineers, United States Army, Dated July 27, 1948,
submitting a report, together with accompanying papers and illustrations, on
preliminary examinations and surveys of Sacramento-San Joaquin River Basin
Streams, California. For Flood Control and allied purposes listed in the Report.
This investigation was authorized by the Flood Control Acts of June 22, 1936 and
June 28, 1938.”
Following this Report, Congress directed additional studies to be made of this region in
1964. As mentioned above, Section 6 of the 1936 Flood Control Act expressly permits
additional reports to be authorized by House Resolution. Consistent with that statutory
delegation a House Resolution, adopted May 8, 1964, authorized USACE to pursue further
reviews of the Agency’s report contained in House Document No. 367, referenced above.
Specifically the May 8, 1964 House Resolution states:
“Resolved by the Committee on Public Works of the House of Representatives,
United States, that the Board of Engineers for Rivers and Harbors is hereby
requested to review the report on the Sacramento-San Joaquin Basin Streams,
California, published as House Document No. 367, 81st Congress, 1st Session, and
other reports, with a view to determining whether any modifications of the

Final Report

recommendations contained therein are advisable at this time, with particular
reference to further coordinated development of the water resources in the San
Joaquin River Basin, California.”
Conference Report 108-357 accompanied the Energy and Water Development
Appropriations Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-137) and provided both further congressional direction and
funding relative to this study. Conference Report 108-357 states:
“The conferees have provided $1,100,000 for the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta,
California, study including $350,000 for a reconnaissance study to evaluate
environmental restoration, flood protection, recreation, and related purposes for
the California Bay-Delta Authority North Delta Improvements project, and
$500,000 to initiate and complete a reconnaissance study to prioritize and
evaluate environmental restoration, flood protection and related purposes for the
Delta Islands and Levees. The remaining funding is provided for the Delta
Special Study.”
About this time Congress also passed the CALFED Bay-Delta Authorization Act of 2004
(P.L. 108-361). Section 103(f)(3) of the Act specifically authorized USACE participation in the
CALFED Program. Accordingly, the Sacramento District conducted a reconnaissance level
study of the CALFED Levee Stability Program. USACE sent its report to Congress entitled
“CALFED Levee Stability Program, California” in May 2006, recommending that USACE
perform a feasibility study of Delta Islands and Levees to define a long-term strategy for Delta
levee system improvements.
Section 3015 of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 2007
amended Section 103(f)(3) of P.L. 108-361, which in part authorized this feasibility
report. Section 3015 modified the geographic scope of the authority, clarified project
justification requirements, clarified the definition of the levee design standard, and
increased the total authorized cost of the levee stability program. USACE issued
implementation guidance for Section 3015, WRDA 2007 on August 11, 2008.

1.3

Study Area

The study area (Figure 1-1) includes the entire Sacramento – San Joaquin River Delta and
Suisun Marsh, comprising parts of Sacramento, San Joaquin, Solano, Contra Costa, Alameda,
and Yolo Counties, California. The area extends south from the City of Sacramento to the cities
of Stockton and Tracy, and west from approximately Interstate Highway 5 to and including
Suisun Bay, an eastward extension of the San Francisco Bay. The Delta consists of about
738,000 acres of agricultural and developed lands, wetlands and tidal marshes segregated into
some 80 tracts and islands by 1,100 miles of levees and a labyrinth of navigation channels,
rivers, tributaries, streams, sloughs, waterways and shallow open water expanses.

Study Sponsor and Participants

USACE initiated the Feasibility Study at the request of DWR, the non-Federal sponsor
for the study. USACE and DWR are the lead agencies in the Feasibility Study and share the cost
of the study equally (50% /50%), pursuant to the Feasibility Cost Sharing Agreement (FCSA)
executed by the parties on May 25, 2006, and subsequent amendments. The East Bay Regional
Parks District has also expressed their support in becoming a non-Federal sponsor as the landowning agency for the project. No cooperating agencies were formally identified under NEPA
regulations.
Numerous agencies, organizations, and individuals participated in the study including the
U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (USBR), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), National Marine
Fisheries Service (NMFS), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), East Bay Regional
Parks District (EBRPD), California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW), Sacramento
County, San Joaquin County, Contra Costa County, Yolo County, Alameda County, Solano
County, numerous levee maintaining agencies, local landowners and residents.

1.5

Existing Programs, Studies, and Projects

There are many ongoing water resources related programs, studies, and projects that
could affect flooding and ecosystem conditions in the study area. Those efforts that pertain
directly to this feasibility study are summarized below.

1.5.1

Programs

Bay Delta Conservation Plan (BDCP)/California WaterFix and California
EcoRestore
The BDCP was a part of California’s overall water management portfolio. It was being
developed as a 50-year habitat conservation plan with the goals of restoring the Delta ecosystem
and improving California water supply reliability. The BDCP proposed to address California’s
water supply reliability by building new water delivery infrastructure and operating the system to
improve the ecological health of the Delta. The BDCP also proposed to restore or protect
approximately 150,000 acres of habitat to address the Delta’s environmental challenges.
On April 30, 2015, the State announced that it would separate the BDCP’s conveyance
facility and habitat restoration measures into two separate efforts: California WaterFix and
California EcoRestore.

Delta Island and Levees Feasibility Study

Final Report

The California WaterFix focuses on the State Water Project water delivery system
infrastructure in the Central Valley and is part of California’s overall water management
portfolio. The Governor’s WaterFix planning effort is overseen by the California Natural
Resources Agency and DWR. California EcoRestore, the habitat restoration program, is
overseen by the California Natural Resources Agency and implemented under the California
Water Action Plan. California EcoRestore is an initiative implemented in coordination with
State and Federal agencies to advance the restoration of at least 30,000 acres of Sacramento-San
Joaquin Delta (Delta) habitat by 2020.
Concurrently, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) is working with
Federal, State and local agencies and Delta stakeholders to develop a 25-year, high-level
conservation framework for the Delta, Yolo Bypass and Suisun Marsh. The Delta Conservation
Framework will serve as the long-term continuation of the California EcoRestore program
focused on accelerating conservation actions by 2020. These efforts are a direct reflection of
public comments and fulfill the requirement of the 2009 Delta Reform Act to meet the co-equal
goals of water supply reliability and ecosystem restoration.
DWR and the USBR prepared a partially Recirculated Draft Environmental Impact
Report/Supplemental Draft Environmental Impact Statement (RDEIR/SDEIS) that addresses the
impacts of the California Water Fix. The RDEIR/SDEIS includes portions of the DEIR/DEIS
(for the BDCP) that were amended or supplemented in answer to public comments received, and
includes changes made to the impact analysis warranting another public review prior to
publication of final documents.
On July 21, 2017 DWR certified the California WaterFix Final EIR/EIS, which was
released the report on December 22, 2016. On January 23, 2018 DWR submitted a CEQA
Addendum to the Final EIR/EIS. The Final EIR/EIS describes the alternatives, discusses
potential environmental impacts, and identifies mitigation measures that would help avoid or
minimize impacts. The California Water Fix preferred alternative includes the construction and
operation of Delta intakes and tunnel conveyance facilities. It also provides responses to all
substantive comments received on the 2013 Draft EIR/EIS and 2015 RDEIR/SDEIS.
CALFED Bay-Delta Program (CALFED)
CALFED was established in May 1995 as a cooperative effort among the State and
Federal agencies that handle management and regulatory responsibilities in the Sacramento –
San Joaquin Delta. CALFED’s mission is to develop and implement a long-term comprehensive
plan that will restore ecological health and improve water management for beneficial uses of the
Bay-Delta. In July 2003, the State of California formalized the cooperative effort by creating the
CALFED Bay-Delta Authority, a State agency responsible for overseeing implementation of the
Bay-Delta Program. The State’s CALFED program was transitioned to the Delta Stewardship
Council under the 2009 Delta Reform Act (see below).

Final Report

Central Valley Flood Protection Plan (CVFPP)
In 2012, the California Central Valley Flood Protection Board adopted the CVFPP, a
comprehensive new framework for system-wide flood management and flood risk reduction in
the Sacramento and San Joaquin River Basins. California’s Central Valley Flood Protection Act
of 2008 requires the CVFPP to be updated every five years. The Central Valley Flood Protection
Board adopted the 2017 update to the CVFPP on August 25, 2017.
Central Valley Integrated Flood Management Study (CVIFMS)
USACE, in conjunction with DWR, jointly developed CVIFMS to define a long-range
program for the Sacramento and San Joaquin River Basins and the corresponding level of
Federal participation. The CVIFMS Watershed Plan, released in December 2016, identified
opportunities to reduce flood risk by improving the flood capacity of the system while restoring
and protecting floodplain and environmental features, including wetlands and other fish and
wildlife habitat.
Delta Stewardship Council – Delta Plan
The Delta Plan is a comprehensive, long-term management plan for the Delta. Required
by the 2009 Delta Reform Act (California Water Code Division 35), it creates new rules and
recommendations to further the state’s coequal goals for the Delta: improvement of statewide
water supply reliability, and protection and restoration of a vibrant and healthy Delta ecosystem,
all in a manner that preserves, protects and enhances the unique agricultural, cultural, and
recreational characteristics of the Delta. The Delta Plan became effective with legallyenforceable regulations on September 1, 2013, but is being amended in response to changes
(such as the State’s decision to modify BDCP into California WaterFix/EcoRestore) since its
adoption.
Sacramento River Bank Protection Program
This is a long-term joint program implemented by USACE and the California Central
Valley Flood Protection Board, as authorized by Section 203 of the Flood Control Act of 1960 to
enhance public safety by maintaining the integrity of the Sacramento River Flood Control
Project from erosion. It provides protection to existing levees of the Sacramento River Flood
Control Project through the implementation of bank protection, setback levees, or other features
that address the effects of erosion on the Flood Control System.

Studies

American River Common Features General Reevaluation Report
USACE, the Central Valley Flood Protection Board, and the Sacramento Area Flood
Control Agency conducted a comprehensive study to investigate further improvements to the
flood risk reduction system throughout the Sacramento region. The recommended plan, which
included levee improvements for the American River, Sacramento River south of the confluence
with the American River, Natomas East Main Drainage Canal, Arcade Creek, and Magpie Creek
and the widening of the Sacramento Weir and Bypass, was authorized by Congress in the Water
Resources Development Act of 2016 (WRDA 16) and is currently undergoing Preconstruction
Engineering and Design (PED). Now referred to as the American River Common Features
WRDA 16 project, USACE estimates that construction will begin in 2020. The Sacramento
Area Flood Control Agency is currently constructing the Arcade Creek levee improvements as
an early implementation local action during the summer of 2018.
Delta Long-Term Management Strategy
USACE, DWR, the California Bay-Delta Authority, the Delta Protection Commission
(DPC), the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB), and the Central Valley Regional
Water Quality Control Board (CVRWQCB) are developing a long-term management strategy for
sediment management in the Delta, including dredging and dredged material placement and
reuse.
Dutch Slough Tidal Marsh Restoration Project
The Dutch Slough Tidal Marsh Restoration area was formerly slated for urban
development, but will soon become 1,178 acres of critically needed habitat for fish and wildlife
in the Delta. This state project is located in the western Delta near Oakley. In an area where soil
types and lack of subsidence offer an opportunity to create a large area of tidal marsh and
complex intertidal channels favored by native Delta species. Shaded channels, native grasslands,
and riparian forests will be restored in the upland portions of the site. The restored habitats are
like those that historically dominated the Delta, and their restoration is considered a critical
action to increase numbers of native sensitive species and improve general ecological health of
the Delta. The public comment period for the Supplemental Environmental Impact Report (EIR)
was January 21, 2014 through March 07, 2014. The project is expected to begin construction in
spring 2018. The first phase of construction is anticipated to take two years with subsequent
plantings, and the second phase of construction will likely begin in 2020.

Final Report

Lower San Joaquin River Feasibility Study
USACE and its non-Federal sponsors, the San Joaquin Area Flood Control Agency and
the State of California Central Valley Flood Protection Board, propose to reduce flood risk along
the Lower San Joaquin River by improving and constructing levees along the San Joaquin River,
Calaveras River, Mosher Slough, and the Delta Front and by constructing and operating closure
structures. The Final Integrated FR/EIS/EIR was released for public review in January 2018 and
the Chief’s Report is undergoing review at USACE Headquarters.
Sacramento Deep Water Ship Channel (DWSC) Project
USACE and the Port of West Sacramento are conducting a study to investigate Federal
investment in providing for more efficient and safe commodity transport along the existing deep
draft navigation route extending from the Port of West Sacramento to New York Slough, thereby
affording the Port of West Sacramento improved access to San Francisco Bay Area harbors and
the Pacific Ocean. The deepening of the Sacramento DWSC from 30 to 35 feet was authorized
by Congress in 1986. A limited reevaluation study (now called a validation study) of the
authorized project by the USACE San Francisco District has been on hold since 2014 pending
increased economic demand for shipping.
San Francisco Bay to Stockton Navigation Improvement Project
USACE, the Port of Stockton, and Contra Costa County Water Agency are conducting a
study to evaluate the efficiency of the movement of goods along the existing deep draft
navigation route extending from the San Francisco Bay to the Port of Stockton. The project
includes the John F. Baldwin and Stockton Ship Channels, and will focus on the reach west of
Avon.
USGS Subsidence Research on Twitchell Island
DWR and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) constructed approximately 15 acres of
managed wetlands in 1997 to evaluate land surface elevation changes and carbon accretion due
to the accumulation and decay of plant materials. Ongoing research at this facility has shown
that land surface elevation increases 1.3 to 2.2 inches per year, while surrounding areas used for
agricultural purposes lost elevation due to subsidence. Decaying organic matter reverse
subsidence through utilization of appropriate land management practices. Research of this issue
is ongoing.
West Sacramento General Reevaluation Report
USACE, the Central Valley Flood Protection Board, and the West Sacramento Area
Flood Control Agency (WSAFCA), conducted a study to provide flood damage reduction to
West Sacramento by improving the levees that surround the city. The recommended plan was
authorized by Congress in WRDA 2016, and is awaiting appropriations to begin PED.

Projects

Antioch Dunes Restoration
This project is being implemented by USFWS, CDFW, the Port of Stockton, and USACE
to benefit three endangered and endemic species—two plants and one butterfly. Material
dredged through annual operations and maintenance dredging is being placed in the project area
to restore dune habitat. Construction is underway and will continue for approximately ten years.
California State Water Project (SWP)
The California SWP is a water storage and delivery system of reservoirs, aqueducts,
power plants and pumping plants. Its main purpose is to store water and distribute it to 29 urban
and agricultural water suppliers in Northern California, the San Francisco Bay Area, the San
Joaquin Valley, the Central Coast, and Southern California. Of the contracted water supply, 70
percent goes to urban users and 30 percent goes to agricultural users. The SWP makes deliveries
to two-thirds of California's population. It is maintained and operated by DWR. The SWP is
also operated to improve water quality in the Delta, control Feather River flood waters, provide
recreation, and enhance fish and wildlife.
Central Valley Project (CVP)
The CVP is a Federal water management project in the State of California under the
supervision of the Bureau of Reclamation. It was devised in 1933 in order to provide irrigation
and municipal water to much of California's Central Valley—by regulating and storing water in
reservoirs in the water-rich northern half of the state, and transporting it to the water-poor San
Joaquin Valley and its surroundings by means of a series of canals, aqueducts and pump plants,
some shared with the California SWP. Many CVP water users are represented by the Central
Valley Project Water Association.
Donlon Island and Venice Cut Mitigation for the 1987 Widening and Deepening of
the Stockton Deep Water Ship Channel
In 1987, USACE and the Port of Stockton completed widening and deepening the
Stockton DWSC. Dredging and other construction techniques resulted in the movement of
considerable volumes of dredged materials and some losses of existing marsh and riparian
vegetation. The final design of the project included features selected to mitigate for habitat
losses caused by the construction activities and to enhance fish and wildlife values beyond those
present before modification of the channel. Dredged materials were used to create
approximately 81 acres of new shallow water, wetland, and upland habitats within two flooded

islands, Donlon Island and Venice Cut Island. The resulting dredged-material islands were the
first created in the Delta specifically to benefit fish and wildlife. The newly created islands are
used by a wide variety of birds, and the number of species generally increased proportionally
with the extent and complexity of the habitats available. These findings have been translated
into design guidelines that can be used with increased confidence to design new habitat using
dredged material.
Sacramento River Flood Control Project
Congress directed the California Debris Commission in 1910 to prepare a flood
management plan for the Sacramento River system. The proposal incorporated the leveed
bypass concept, which became the basis of the present project. This major project was
authorized by the 1917 Flood Control Act and was sponsored by The Reclamation Board (now
called the Central Valley Flood Protection Board). The Sacramento River Flood Control Project
consists of a comprehensive system of 1,000 miles of levees, 5 major overflow weirs, 2 sets of
outfall gates, 3 major drainage pumping plants, 95 miles of bypass floodways, overbank
floodway areas, and channel enlargement in the lower reach of the Sacramento River. The
levees constructed for this project are known as “project levees.”
Lower San Joaquin River and Tributaries Project
The Lower San Joaquin River and Tributaries Project was authorized by the federal
Flood Control Act of 1944. The project includes: (a) Federal levee and channel improvement
and bank protection along the Lower San Joaquin River from the mouth of the Merced River to
the Delta; (b) the preservation of natural overflow lands upstream of the mouth of the Merced
River by the acquisition of flowage easements by the State of California, and/or by the
construction of levees at specified locations by responsible local interests at no cost to the
Federal Government; (c) Federal flood control storage on the Stanislaus River at the New
Melones site; (d) the provision of flood control storage on the Tuolumne River by local interests
with payment therefore by the United States; and (e) operation of the existing Federal Friant
Reservoir for flood control.

Public Involvement

On January 31 2013, USACE published a notice of intent (NOI) in the Federal Register
(Vol. 78, No. 921) to prepare an EIS for the Delta Study. In February 2013, two scoping
meetings were held to educate the public about the study efforts and to garner input on the
proposed scope, in accordance with NEPA. Table 1-1 describes the correlations between the
USACE planning and NEPA processes.
The meetings were open-house style workshops at which attendees could read and view
information about the two projects and interact with project staff, including representatives of
USACE and DWR.

Final Report

The agenda for the scoping meeting is summarized as follows:
•

Clarifications on data and history of the Delta;

•

Concerns of siltation in Delta channels;

•

Recommendation for coordination with other agencies and efforts in the Delta; and,

•

Recommendation to evaluate environmental effects of alternatives to water supply,
water quality, and aquatic and terrestrial biology.

The draft Feasibility Report/Environmental Impact Statement (FR/EIS) was circulated for
a 45 day review from April 18 to June 2, 2014 to Federal, State, and local agencies;
organizations; and individuals who have an interest in the project. A notice of availability of the
draft EIS was published in the Federal Register (79 FR 21917). Public workshops were held
during the public review period to provide additional opportunities for comments on the draft
document. These meetings were held at the following times and places:
•

Wednesday May 7, 2014, 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. at the Old Sugar Mill in Clarksburg,
California.

•

Friday May 9, 2014, 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. at the Sheraton Grand Hotel in Sacramento,
California.

During the FR/EIS public review period, a total of 7 comments were received from the
public, including 2 Federal agencies, 3 State agencies and 2 local agencies and organizations.
Comments received were primarily focused on: (1) consistency with Delta land use plans; (2)
permitting requirements; (3) air quality considerations; and (4) salinity and water quality
modeling. All comments received during the public review period were considered and
incorporated into the final EIS, as appropriate.
For more detail on comments received, information available at the meetings, and a
summary of key issues that were raised, see Appendix A which contains the Public Involvement
Appendix. USACE will ensure all agencies, organizations, and individuals who provided
comments will be provided a copy of the final integrated FR/EIS.

CHAPTER 2 – NEED FOR ACTION
2.1

Background

The Sacramento – San Joaquin River Delta (Figure 1-1) is part of the largest estuary on
the West Coast of the United States. The Delta is home to hundreds of species of fish, birds,
mammals and reptiles; and is considered an ecosystem of national significance. Agricultural
land irrigated by Delta water contributes billions of dollars in production for the Nation. Two
deep water ports in the Delta serve as important marine terminals for dry bulk cargo vessels
transporting agricultural products through the Delta’s deep draft navigation channels to world
markets. Delta levees protect thousands of acres of orchards, farms, and vineyards as well as
critical infrastructure including state and interstate highways, major rail lines, natural gas fields,
gas and fuel pipelines, water conveyance infrastructure, drinking water pipelines, and numerous
towns, businesses and homes.
In terms of geography, the Delta is a web of channels and reclaimed islands at the
confluence of the Sacramento, San Joaquin, Cosumnes, Mokelumne, and Calaveras Rivers.
Forty percent of California’s land area is contained within the watersheds of these rivers. The
Delta covers about 738,000 acres and is interlaced with hundreds of miles of waterways. Much
of the land is below sea level and protected by a network of 1,100 miles of levees which have
been constructed over the past 150 years to manage the flow of water through the Delta.
The land behind the levees is predominantly agricultural (corn, wheat, vineyards, cattle).
Nearly 95 percent of the historic wetland habitat in the Delta has been converted to agricultural
and urban uses. Waterways provide recreational outlets for nearby urban areas and essential
habitat for fish and wildlife, including Federally listed species under the Endangered Species Act
(FESA). The Delta is also the largest single source of California’s water supply, providing 25
million Californians with drinking water and irrigating millions of acres of farmland in the
Central Valley. In addition, more than 500,000 people live within the Delta and rely upon it for
water, recreation, and livelihood. The majority of that population is in the greater Sacramento
and Stockton areas and is the focus of other USACE FRM studies, though there are communities
within the Delta. Several Delta towns, known as “legacy communities,” are listed in the
National Register of Historic Places.
Historically, the Delta was defined by tidal wetlands, primarily comprised of peat soils.
The Swamp and Overflow Land Act of 1850 transferred ownership of all Federally owned
swamp and overflow land, including Delta marshes, from the Federal Government to private
parties agreeing to drain the land and turn it to productive, presumably agricultural, use. This
Act began the reclamation of wetlands in the Delta through the construction of levees and
drainage channels, typically by the new land owners. The majority of levees in the Delta are still
privately owned and maintained. Nearly three-fourths of the Delta is now in agriculture.

Final Report

Problems and Opportunities

A problem is an existing undesirable condition to be changed. An opportunity is a
chance to create a future condition that is desirable. Within the context of solving the problems,
opportunities contribute to the overall beneficial outcome of the project. The purpose of this
feasibility study is to develop an implementable and acceptable plan to improve future
environmental conditions by addressing specific water and related land resources problems and
opportunities in the Delta and Suisun Marsh.
Problems and opportunities to be addressed were identified in several ways. Based upon
a review of plan formulation efforts for the BDCP, the Delta Risk Management Study (DRMS),
the Delta Vision (Blue Ribbon Task Force), the CVFPP, USACE Special Study, USACE 180
Day Report to Congress, and other related State planning efforts, two general types of problems
were identified—Flood Risk and Ecological—as well as corresponding opportunities and
objectives. Problems and opportunities related to conveyance of water supply have been
identified and will be qualitatively discussed as they relate to flood risk and ER; but these
elements are peripheral to plan formulation for this study. Two Federal Deep Draft Navigation
studies are also underway within the study area and will be discussed as they relate to this study.
In addition to the review of the aforementioned references, several workshops and brainstorming
meetings were held to help define the existing conditions and identify problems and
opportunities for this study. Participants in these meetings included:
•

U.S. Army Corps of Engineers

•

California Department of Water Resources

Final Report

Various Reclamation District Engineers

The problems and opportunities addressed in the feasibility study are defined in the
following sections.

2.2.1

Flood Risk Problems

Delta levees protect critical infrastructure such as State highways, rail lines, natural gas
fields, gas and fuel pipelines, drinking water pipelines, and numerous businesses and towns.
Delta inhabitants are primarily located on six islands, although portions of Sacramento and
Stockton are located in the Delta. Flood risk reduction for Sacramento and Stockton is the focus
of other USACE studies. These studies are being closely coordinated to ensure assumptions,
scopes, and alternative plans are compatible.
Flood risks in the Delta are largely due to the potential for levee failure and overtopping. These
risks increase as a result of climate change, sea level change, subsidence (as much as 25 feet below
sea level), and seismic risk. In particular:
•

Population centers [such as those at Walnut Grove (1,542), Isleton (804), Locke (600),
Courtland (355), Bethel Island (2,137), Hood (271), and Ryde (142)] and surrounding
agricultural lands are located in deep floodplain areas, the flooding of which could result in
loss of life and flood damages;

•

Highways 4, 12, 5, and 160, as well as major railroads, are located in deep floodplain areas,
the flooding of which could disrupt critical transportation routes for people and goods, as
well as emergency evacuation and response;
Critical infrastructure including aqueducts, natural gas transmissions, oil and gas wells, and
high power transmission lines are located in deep floodplain areas, the flooding of which
could cause damages and service disruptions.

About two-thirds of the Delta levees were constructed without engineering specifications
and are non-Project levees, while only 385 miles of these levees are part of the Sacramento River
Flood Control Project or the Lower San Joaquin River and Tributaries Project. Inherent
weaknesses in Delta levees and foundations, due to construction practices, encroachments,
abandoned pipes, and burrowing by various mammals, commonly result in seepage distress,
internal erosion, and occasional levee failure and island inundation. Oxidation and loss of peat
soils (which occurs due to a number of factors, such as agriculture use) have caused many of the
reclaimed islands to subside below sea level. The phenomenon also causes levee foundations
and levees for a majority of Delta islands to consolidate which, in combination with interior
island subsidence, causes uneven settling and further weakening of the levees. It is apparent by
the frequency of historical flood events (over 168 instances in the past 100 years) that the current
Delta levees do not have a high level of performance for the 500,000 people living behind them.
17

Sacramento District

September 2018

Delta Island and Levees Feasibility Study

Final Report

A single island failure can result in the “domino effect” of multi-island failures due to the
extensive network of unstable levees. A breach on one levee system may overload an adjacent
levee system resulting in a larger flooding event.
Focus of BDCP/California WaterFix/EcoRestore
Ecological issues in the Delta and flood risk problems specific to water quality may be
addressed through the implementation of California’s WaterFix/EcoRestore. These problems are
described below to provide a general understanding of the study area; however, this report will
only qualitatively discuss these problems and the likely solutions under consideration by others.
Solutions under consideration by the California WaterFix include a dual water conveyance
system, which would create options to move water through the Delta’s interior or around the
Delta through an isolated conveyance facility (tunnel).
The impacts associated with the failure of fragile Delta levees can reach beyond the Delta
and disrupt the water supply for 25 million Californians reliant on drinking water that passes
through the Delta, and billions of dollars of agricultural production that is reliant on Delta water.
By reducing the volume of tidal exchange in the Delta, reclaimed islands and land tracts act as a
barrier between fresh and salt water, preventing sea waters from the San Francisco Bay and
Pacific Ocean from entering into the State and Federal Water Project intake structures. A multiisland failure could result in the saltwater contamination of water supplies and could take a year
or longer to rectify. In addition, insufficient emergency response plans and resources for some
areas in the Delta could prolong recovery of these water supplies for the San Joaquin Valley and
Southern California in the event of multiple levee failures.

2.2.2

Ecosystem Problems

The Delta, an ecosystem of national significance, is a critical link in the Pacific Flyway, a
major north-south route of travel for migratory birds in America, and is protected through the
Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) of 1918. Natural resource specialists agree that the
remaining ecosystems in the Delta no longer maintain the functions and richness that defined the
pre-channelized system, and that its ecological health and value for many species beyond
migratory birds will continue to decline without preventive action. For example, continued
decline in the Delta smelt population been attributed to reduced Delta outflows, entrainment
losses to water diversions, changes in food organisms, toxic substances, disease, competition and
predation by non-native species, and potential crossbreeding with the non-native wakasagi.
Native splittail populations have been adversely affected by loss of floodplain attributable to
levees and channelization (Moyle 2002). Populations of salmonids, a commercially,
recreationally, and culturally important fish species in the Delta are also in decline. Chinook
salmon, steelhead, and green sturgeon populations have also experienced sharp declines as a
result of natural and human‐related factors including blockage by dams from spawning and
rearing habitat, deleterious water temperature, and altered flows and flow fluctuations (Busby et
al. 1996; Good et al. 2005).

Sacramento District

September 2018

Delta Island and Levees Feasibility Study

Final Report

Many of the defining characteristics of the Delta’s pre-channelized ecosystem (spatial
extent, habitat heterogeneity, and dynamic storage) have either been lost or substantially altered
as a result of land use and water management practices during the past 100 years in California.
Nearly 95 percent of the historic wetland habitat in the Delta has been converted to agricultural
and urban uses (The Bay Institute 1998).
Pesticides, channelization, exotic and non-native invasive species, water supply
diversions, agricultural and urban runoff, and wastewater discharges have all been identified as
contributors to the decline of the Delta’s ecological health. Specifically, channelization of rivers
and streams through the construction of levees has resulted in the widespread loss of tidal marsh,
shaded riverine aquatic habitat, open water habitat, and the disconnection of floodplains from
waterways, which has greatly reduced the amount of shallow, gentle sloping near shore areas. If
this loss of Delta habitats and disconnection from floodplains continues, the current substantial
declines in the Delta’s fisheries could result in the extinction of culturally and economically
important species.
The conversion of the Delta for urban and agricultural uses, including levee
construction, has resulted in:
•

Substantial loss (95%) and fragmentation of historic intertidal and tidal
habitat areas and linkages for native plants and wildlife, including over 35
Federal and State listed Threatened and Endangered species;

•

Subsidence in the Delta and Suisun Marsh, which can cause significant
adverse ecological impacts due to deeper flooding;

•

Introduction and propagation of non-native invasive species;

•

Separation of historic floodplains from natural hydrologic flooding events
through channels within the Delta; and

•

Degraded water quality conditions from various stressors.

Central Valley Project and California State Water Project
Current operation of the CVP and California SWP, as well as other export operations and
diversions that result in consumptive losses, supply water to 25 million Californians and 4.5
million acres of irrigated land. But these water resource operations can have a damaging effect
on the plants and animals inhabiting the Delta. For example, the operation of pumping facilities
is known to alter flow patterns, affecting the migration of salmonids passing through the river
system. Delta smelt are drawn into the flow of water to the pumping facilities and can be
entrained, resulting in the mortality of this Federally-listed species. The altered hydrology and
operation of the State, Federal, and local water projects have resulted in:

19

Final Report

•

Altered natural water flows through the Delta and to Suisun Marsh and San Francisco
Bay;

•

Mortality of native species in/adjacent to water control structures (primarily delta
smelt and salmonids);

•

Changes to timing, volume and/or distribution of water throughout the Delta which
has adversely affected the ecosystem and the habitat requirements of many native
species; and

•

Reduction in seasonal variability in the migration and concentrations of saline water.

2.2.3

Opportunities

The Delta Islands and Levees Feasibility Study provides an opportunity to:

2.3

•

Restore, enhance, preserve, create, and maintain aquatic, riparian, and adjacent
terrestrial habitats in the Delta for native plants and wildlife, including Federal and
State threatened, endangered, and special-status species, with the potential secondary
benefit to recreation;

•

Manage invasive and non-native species for the benefit of native plant and wildlife
species, with the potential secondary benefit to recreation;

•

Restore floodplain functions and contiguous habitat in the Delta;

•

Reduce flood risk in the Delta to protect people, property, agriculture, habitat, and
infrastructure, with the potential secondary benefit to recreation and navigation;

•

Address seismic and sea-level change risks to levees in the Delta that protect
population centers, highways, railroads, and critical infrastructure;

•

Improve emergency management and response throughout the Delta;

•

Incidentally, improve water quality in the Delta; and

•

Beneficially reuse available dredged materials.

Federal and Sponsor Objectives

The specific objectives for this feasibility study were derived from the identification of
the study problems and opportunities and are discussed in Section 2.4.

20
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
Sacramento District

September 2018

Delta Island and Levees Feasibility Study

Final Report

The Federal objective of water and related land resources planning is to contribute to
National Economic Development (NED) consistent with protecting the nation’s environment,
pursuant to national environmental statutes, applicable executive orders (EO), and other Federal
planning requirements. Contributions to NED are increases in the net value of the national
output of goods and services, expressed in monetary units that would accrue in the planning area
and the rest of the nation as a result of project implementation.
USACE has added a second national objective for Ecosystem Restoration (ER) to
contribute to the Nation’s ecosystems (or National Ecosystem Restoration (NER)) by restoring
degraded ecosystem structure, function, and dynamic processes to a less degraded, more natural
condition. Contributions to NER are defined as increases in ecosystem value and productivity
provided by an ecosystem restoration project and are measured in non-monetary units such as
acres or linear feet of habitat, average annual habitat units (AAHU), or increased species number
or diversity.
DWR, as the non-Federal sponsor, has flood risk and ER objectives similar to the
national NED and NER objectives. Additionally, DWR has water supply objectives that it seeks
to meet through other related initiatives.

2.4

Planning Goals and Objectives

The planning objectives developed specifically for this study are more specific than the
Federal and non-Federal objectives; they seek to address the identified problems and
opportunities in the Delta Study area and help define the study’s purpose. They also represent
desired positive changes in the future without-project conditions.
The planning objectives for the Delta Study would be attained within the period of
analysis for the study, a 50-year timeframe beginning in 2020, pending identification of Federal
interest and inclusion in a selected plan. All of the objectives focus on activity within the study
area.
The goal of the feasibility study is to develop a range of alternative plans that balance the
objectives and avoid conflicts or, where necessary, demonstrate the tradeoffs between conflicting
objectives, enabling decisions to be made. The Federal objective is to maximize net NED and
NER benefits. Because of this, it is not appropriate to identify targets within objectives. For
example, no target level of flood risk, minimum acreage of habitat, or minimum habitat value
was identified for the project. Rather, the planning process includes formulation of alternative
plans designed to maximize NED and NER benefits relative to costs.

Final Report

Goal 1 - Restore sustainable ecosystem functions in the Delta.
Ecosystem Restoration Objective 1—Increase area, connectivity, and diversity of native tidal
and non-tidal aquatic, riparian, and related habitats within the study area during the period
of analysis.
Goal 2 - Improve flood risk management in the Delta.
Flood Risk Management Objective 1a – Reduce the probability and consequences and
annual damages associated with flood risk in the study area during the period of analysis.
Flood Risk Management Objective 1b – Improve resiliency and reduce the chance of loss of
life and key infrastructure (transportation corridors, aqueducts, pipelines/wells, etc.).
Flood Risk Management Objective 2 – Reduce risks to life loss within the study area during
the period of analysis, focusing on areas with the greatest potential life loss impacts (such
as areas with the greatest inundation).

2.5

Planning Constraints

A constraint is a restriction that limits the extent of the planning process. It is a statement
of things the alternative plans should avoid. Constraints are designed to steer project alternatives
away from undesirable changes between without and with-project future conditions.
In the development of the alternatives, the following constraints were identified to direct plan
formulation efforts so that beneficial effects would be maximized and adverse effects would be
minimized:
•

Must not impede the BDCP/California WaterFix/California EcoRestore; and

•

Must not be dependent upon the BDCP/California WaterFix/California EcoRestore.

CHAPTER 3 – ALTERNATIVE PLANS
3.1

Plan Formulation Process

Formulation, evaluation, and comparison of alternative plans comprise the third, fourth,
and fifth steps of the USACE planning process. These steps are often referred to collectively as
plan formulation. Plan formulation is an iterative process that involves cycling through the
formulation, evaluation, and comparison steps several times to formulate a range of alternative
plans and then narrow those plans down to a reasonable array of plans that are technically and
economically feasible. Ultimately, a single plan can then be identified as the best alternative for
implementation.

3.2

Planning Criteria

Planning criteria are used to formulate, screen, evaluate, and compare measures and
alternative plans. Four specific formulation criteria are required in USACE water resource
studies, as described in the Principles and Requirements for Federal Investments in Water
Resources, March 2013: completeness, effectiveness, efficiency, and acceptability. These
criteria are useful in narrowing down the array of possible alternative plans. With the exception
of completeness, these criteria are also useful in screening potential measures.
•

Completeness. Completeness is a determination of whether or not the plan includes
all elements necessary to achieve the objectives of the plan. It is an indication of the
degree to which the outputs of the plan are dependent upon the actions of others.
Plans that depend upon the actions of others to achieve the desired output were
dropped from consideration.

•

Effectiveness. Effectiveness is the extent to which a measure or alternative plan
achieves the planning objectives. Measures or alternative plans that clearly make
little or no contribution to the planning objectives were dropped from consideration.

•

Efficiency. Efficiency is a measure of the cost effectiveness of the plan expressed in
net benefits. Benefits can be both monetary and non-monetary. Measures or
alternative plans that provided little benefit relative to cost were dropped from
consideration.

•

Acceptability. Acceptability is a measure of the ability to implement a measure or
alternative plan. In other words, acceptability means a measure or plan is technically,
environmentally, economically, and socially feasible. Unpopular plans are not
necessarily infeasible, just unpopular. Measures or plans that were clearly not
feasible were dropped from consideration.

23
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
Sacramento District

Delta Island and Levees Feasibility Study

Final Report

Measures and plans that pass the screening criteria are evaluated and compared against
more specific evaluation criteria. Evaluation criteria are described later in this chapter.
Evaluation criteria can include costs, outputs, or effects and reflect the planning objectives or
constraints. Some or all of the evaluation criteria may be used at various stages in the plan
formulation process to compare alternative plans. Effective evaluation criteria must be
measurable and reveal differences or trade-offs between alternative plans.

3.3

Future Without-Project Condition

Through the 2009 Delta Reform Act, the State of California has established “two coequal
goals of providing a more reliable water supply for California and protecting, restoring, and
enhancing the Delta ecosystem.” The Act also established the Delta Stewardship Council as a
new, independent state agency tasked with delineating how to meet these goals through the
development and implementation of the Delta Plan, which became effective with legallyenforceable regulations on September 1, 2013. While the Delta Plan serves as a management
plan for the Delta, the primary state planning effort in place at the time of plan formulation for
this study is the Bay Delta Conservation Plan (BDCP). This large-scale plan would result in a
vastly changed Delta system, posing a significant risk to this study regarding the uncertainty of
future Delta conditions. In order to reduce this risk, this study includes the BDCP in the future
without project (FWOP) conditions to ensure that a recommended plan is successful if and when
the BDCP is implemented, now most likely through two related efforts: California WaterFix and
California EcoRestore.
Recognizing that realization of the habitat restoration/conservation measures outlined in
these plans is uncertain, study constraints for this interim report have been put in place to
minimize study risk associated with these assumptions. These study constraints, described in
Section 2.5, limited plan formulation from considering any measures that would impede or be
dependent upon the BDCP and Delta Plan. These assumptions and constraints apply only to this
interim report and would be revisited in any future follow-on feasibility studies. The purpose of
these assumptions and constraints is to allow successful plan formulation for this interim report,
independent of progress on the BDCP efforts. Even though those State planning efforts have
continued to evolve, there is no conflict between the selected plan identified in USACE’s 2014
draft feasibility report and the State’s current planning efforts. Therefore, it was not necessary to
revise and repeat the USACE plan formulation process for this final feasibility report based on
the current status of the State’s continuing planning efforts. Consequently, in the following
discussion of the FWOP conditions assumed by USACE during plan formulation, some specific
information is based on the status of the BDCP and Delta Plan at the time of the original plan
formulation process. The current status of the BDCP (California WaterFix and EcoRestore) and
the Delta Plan are described in Section 5.11.2.
The FWOP condition includes all authorized and funded projects, as well as the
recommended plans from the BDCP, as shown in Figure 3-1. For the purposes of this study, it is
assumed that implementation of the State of California Delta Reform Act would occur 10 to 15
years after the final report. The assumptions regarding this future scenario are:

Final Report

•

50-year period of analysis for future conditions; 100-year planning horizon for sea
level rise and climate change conditions.

•

Include the large-scale BDCP which would drastically alter the study area upon
implementation.
o Dual conveyance system in place to convey water from the Sacramento River
to Clifton Court Forebay in the south Delta for transfer to the CVP (Federal
water management project) and the California SWP. The proposed dual
conveyance system includes the existing through-Delta pathway and a new
alternative conveyance system with three 3,000 cubic feet per second (cfs)
pumping stations. Existing through-Delta conveyance (shown as the Armored
Pathway in Figure 3-1) for water supply would continue to be
armored/improved through levee improvements funded through DWR’s Delta
Levees Maintenance Subventions Program and Delta Levees Special Flood
Control Projects.
o Mitigation, habitat conservation, and ER features would be implemented
(145,000 acres to be implemented over 50 years) in the proposed “restoration
opportunity areas” shown in Figure 3-1.
In the 2016 FEIR/EIS for California WaterFix, the number and size of
Restoration Opportunity Areas (ROAs) were reduced from those shown in
Figure 3-1 and the proposed amount of restoration/mitigation was also
significantly reduced. Specific locations for habitat mitigation for California
WaterFix have not been identified and the project has not received final
approvals, so locations and amounts of mitigation are subject to change. Most
of the ROAs in Figure 3-1 are also identified as Recommended Areas for
Prioritization and Implementation of Habitat Restoration Projects in the Delta
Plan and/or include restoration projects under the California EcoRestore
program.
o California WaterFix/EcoRestore is being developed in compliance with the
existing laws, biological opinions, and regulations governing the management
of salinity that balance the sometimes-conflicting salinity levels for the
environment, with-sometimes conflicting needs between endangered species
such as Delta smelt and salmonids, Delta water exports, and in-Delta water
use/rights. Salinity management would continue based on these existing laws,
biological opinions, and regulations.

•

Ecosystem functions would be improved by restoration and conservation efforts
focused along the perimeter of the Delta (BDCP); however, system-wide ecosystem
dynamics would continue to be impaired, affecting:
o 47 special status species;
o Multiple essential fish habitat areas;
25

Final Report

o Multiple critical habitat areas (Delta smelt, Winter and Spring run salmon,
Central Valley Steelhead, and Green Sturgeon);
o Migratory birds;
o Tidal, intertidal, and riparian wetlands; and
o Water quality.
•

Population centers within the Delta would remain at risk of flooding; however, the
greater metropolitan areas extending from the cities of Sacramento and Stockton are
being evaluated through other mechanisms and those efforts will not be duplicated
through this study.

•

State and regional population growth would increase demands on Delta infrastructure
(i.e. transportation, power transmission, water conveyance); however, water
conveyance infrastructure would be improved through the implementation of the
BDCP.

•

Development would continue to be limited by the Delta Protection Act.

•

Agricultural practices would continue.

•

Recovery from catastrophic failure of Delta levees would be undertaken by the State
of California, if necessary, to manage salinity for the environment and human use,
which would also protect the brackish Suisun Marsh. As described in DWR’s Delta
Flood Emergency Facilities Improvement Project, the State is working to ensure that
it has the appropriate infrastructure and supplies in the Delta to respond to and
recover quickly and effectively from major flood or earthquake disasters in the Delta.
Locations of storage and transfer sites for stockpiled flood fight materials are shown
in Figure 3-1 and include the following features and actions:
o Establish two new material storage and transfer facility sites:


Stockton West Weber Avenue; and



Brannan Island State Park.

o Modify an existing material storage facility at Rio Vista.
o Establish new flood fight supply facilities at all three locations.
o Make site preparations to support Incident Command Posts at Stockton West
Weber Avenue and Brannan Island State Recreation Area.
o In addition to the 223,000 tons of quarry rock stockpiled by DWR at Rio Vista
and within the Port of Stockton, DWR would also stockpile up to 40,000 tons
of quarry rock material of variable gradations less than 24-inch-minus at
Stockton West Weber Avenue and Brannan Island, and 20,000 tons of sand in
Rio Vista for a total additional increment of 100,000 tons.

Final Report

Flood risk in the Delta would persist, if not increase, notwithstanding ongoing
operations and maintenance activities and scattered FRM projects, namely DWR’s
Delta Levees Maintenance Subventions Program and Delta Levees Special Flood
Control Projects.
o Probability for multiple levee failures from a seismic event would increase.
o Subsidence of reclaimed lands would continue to separate water and land
elevations, further increasing the hydraulic load on Delta levees within dry,
leveed islands and tracts.
o Seepage issues would continue.
o Climate change would put additional stress on Delta levees (DWR, 2008):


Projected climate change analyses indicate that the climate of the
Central Valley of California, including the Delta, will likely become
warmer and wetter overall in the future, with more extreme flood
events and droughts. This could lead to periods of reduced water
supply, and therefore reduced water quality and increased salinity.
This analysis applies to all measures within the final array of
alternatives.



Mean water levels in the Delta would increase as sea level rises;



Peak river inputs to the Delta would likely increase due to stronger
winter river flows, as well as possible increases in mean precipitation
rates and single-day precipitation amounts; and



In-Delta wind speeds may also increase, due to predicted increases in
the large-scale temperature and pressure gradients that drive these
flows.

•

Subsidence would not occur on submerged lands, consistent with current conditions.

•

Nonstructural FRM would continue through efforts of the State of California Delta
Protection Commission (DPC), to include:
o Emergency preparedness and response planning.
o Land use management to manage growth in Delta floodplains.

Final Report

Identification and Screening of Measures

A measure is a feature or an activity that can be implemented at a specific geographic site
to address one or more planning objectives. Table 3-1 lists the various general measures
identified for this study and identifies the individual objectives to which they contribute. 3
Measures are the building blocks that are grouped together to form alternative plans. The wide
variety of measures listed below was screened to determine whether each measure should be
retained for use in the formulation of alternative plans. Descriptions of the measures and the
decision to retain or drop each measure from further consideration are presented next. These
general measures were screened, as shown below, based on:
2F

•

Opportunity for implementation under future without-project conditions;

•

Effectiveness at achieving an objective;

•

General efficiency; and

•

General acceptability.

3.4.1

Flood Risk Management (FRM) Measures

These measures primarily achieve FRM objectives in the study area, but may also
contribute to the ER objectives. FRM measures can be nonstructural or structural. Nonstructural
measures reduce flood damages without significantly altering the nature or extent of flooding.
Nonstructural measures accomplish damage reduction by changing the use of the floodplains, or
by accommodating existing uses to the flood hazard zone. In contrast, structural measures alter
the nature or extent of flooding. Structural measures accomplish FRM by modifying the
magnitude, duration, extent, or timing of flooding. The general FRM measures considered in
this study are:
•

Protect Utility/Highway Corridor(s). Identify and reduce risk to a specific
area/corridor that contains the largest portion of utilities and highways in the study
area. This concept will be applied to other FRM measures through the evaluation
process. This measure will be further developed through economic analysis of levee
improvements. It is a reasonable measure for consideration to achieve FRM
objectives, and will be carried forward.

•

Levee Improvements. Reduce risk to life and assets through improvements to existing
levees. This is a reasonable measure for consideration and will be carried forward.

3

House Report 108-357 (Conference Report accompanying the Energy and Water Development Appropriations
Act, 2004, P.L. 108-137) urged the Secretary of the Army to incorporate locally preferred options that provide
protection to agricultural lands and residential properties. Measures considered include such options.

29
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
Sacramento District

September 2018

Delta Island and Levees Feasibility Study

Final Report

•

Ring Levees. Reduce risk to life and assets through construction of ring levees. This
is a reasonable measure for consideration and will be carried forward.

•

Emergency Response Planning and Coordination. Reduce risk to life loss through
emergency response planning and coordination. This is a reasonable measure for
consideration and will be carried forward.

•

Raise/Floodproof Communities. There is no opportunity for this measure as a method
of reducing flood damages due to the deep floodplains of the Delta. This measure
will be dropped from further consideration.

•

Raise/Floodproof Individual Structures. There is no opportunity for this measure as a
method of reducing flood damages due to the deep floodplains of the Delta. This
measure is therefore dropped from further consideration.

•

Relocate Community. This measure is considered unacceptable because communities
would have to be relocated outside the Delta, as there are no flood-free areas within
the Delta. Additionally, it would not be possible to truly relocate entire communities,
but rather purchase estates and allow individual entities within the communities to
relocate to a location of their choosing. Delta communities would be disbanded and
scattered to various locations outside of the Delta. Implementation of this measure
would impact the preservation of Delta history and eliminate the culture of the Delta,
which has been proposed as a National Heritage Area. For these reasons, this
measure is dropped from further consideration.

•

Relocate Individual Structures. This measure is considered unacceptable because
structures would have to be relocated outside the Delta, as there are no flood-free
areas within the Delta. Delta communities would be severely impacted and would
likely be disbanded and scattered to various locations outside of the Delta.
Implementation of this measure would impact the preservation of Delta history and
the culture of the Delta, which has been proposed as a National Heritage Area. For
these reasons, this measure is dropped from further consideration.

•

Enhance Flood Risk Communication. Retained for further consideration. Due to the
large six county area, many agencies would be involved in a large scale response
effort. Opportunity may exist to improve flood risk communications.

•

Reoperation and Transbasin Diversion. Reoperation of upstream reservoirs and
transbasin diversions in order to reduce flood risk. Although this measure would
likely reduce risk to the areas upstream of the tidal influence of the Delta, it would
not contribute to reducing flood risk to the largely tidal Delta. This measure does not
contribute to an objective and is therefore not effective. This measure is therefore
dropped from further consideration.

Final Report

Criteria were established to further screen the specific measures based on reduced risk to
life loss, reduced annual damages, reduced infrastructure at risk, and if a measure was included
in the FWOP condition. Measures were qualitatively assessed and rankings of “High-MediumLow” were assigned based on professional judgment. These specific measures and criteria are
shown below in Table 3-2. An overall ranking of “High-Medium-Low” is indicated by the
“Green-Yellow” color scheme, respectively. “High” ranking measures ranked “high” for at least
two criteria. “Medium” ranking measures ranked “medium” or “high” for at least one criterion.
No measures ranked as “Low” overall; therefore all measures were retained through this
screening process.

Structural Flood Risk Management
Once general measures were screened for effectiveness, efficiency, and acceptability, the
remaining general measures were refined to a greater level of detail. Locations were identified
for consideration of application of measures based on the following.
Ratio of Total Inundation Repair Costs to Upgraded Levee Costs
To calculate the ratio of total inundation repair costs to upgraded levee costs, information
was taken from both phases of DWR’s Delta Risk Management Strategy (DRMS). The total
inundation repair costs values are from the DRMS Phase I Impact to Infrastructure Technical
Memorandum (IITM); these costs represent the repair cost for each asset on a particular Delta
island, based on inundation depths, the percent damage incurred, and the original value of the
asset. The assets considered in the IITM include: a) points assets: structures and buildings (and
their contents), bridges, marinas, natural gas fields/storage areas, natural gas wells, commercial
32

Sacramento District

Delta Island and Levees Feasibility Study

Final Report

and industrial buildings, residences, and pump stations and b) linear assets: railroads, highways,
shipping channels, transmission lines, aqueducts, and gas and petroleum pipelines. Since
inundation repair costs are similar to the USACE concept of damages it was determined to be an
appropriate numerator value for a screening criterion ratio. The upgraded levee costs were taken
from DRMS Phase II report Upgraded Delta Levees (Section 4); these costs consist of upgrading
non-project Delta Levees to DWR’s Delta specific “P.L. 84-99” levee standard or Urban Project
Levee (UPL) standards. In DRMS, levees protecting urban centers were selected for UPL
upgrades and Delta specific “P.L. 84-99” levee standard upgrades were assumed for all other
areas. The higher the relative ratio of total inundation repair costs to upgraded levee costs for a
particular Delta island the higher the rating for this criterion.
Life Loss Risk
Life loss risk is based entirely on Delta island population data obtained from the DRMS
Economic Consequences Technical Memorandum (ECTM). Delta islands that have higher
populations were considered to have a greater potential for life safety issues and thus a higher
rating for this criterion.
Significance of Statewide Importance
A measure’s significance of statewide importance was determined qualitatively by using
the findings contained in the ECTM. If a Delta island contained an asset that would impact the
region or state during and after a flood event, then that island was rated with a “Yes”, otherwise
the island was rated with a “No.” The categories of statewide significance include: deep water
ship channels, electric transmission lines, highways, natural gas transmission, Mokelumne
Aqueduct, oil and gas wells, railroads, wastewater facilities, eight western islands, and legacy
communities.
For criteria one and two, each Delta island was assigned a rating of high, medium, or low.
For criterion three, each island was given a rating of Yes or No. The location measures that were
assigned a “high” rating are generally populated areas with relatively higher economic values
and therefore are likely to be included in the final array of measures as a more comprehensive,
whole island levee improvement. The measures that were assigned a “medium” rating are
generally somewhat populated with more limited economic values and therefore are likely to be
included in the final array of measures as a more limited structural or non-structural solution.
The measures that were assigned a “low” rating are sparsely populated areas with limited to no
infrastructure/economic value and were therefore dropped from further considerations.
This qualitative assessment was based on existing data from the DRMS and is
summarized below in Table 3-3 and shown in Figure 3-2. Developed by DWR and completed in
two phases, the overall purpose of the DRMS was to assess the performance of Delta and Suisun
Marsh levees and evaluate the economic, environmental, and public health and life loss
consequences of levee failures to California as a whole (Phase I); and to develop and evaluate
risk reduction strategies (Phase II). The DRMS was chosen because it is the only recent
comprehensive analysis on the local and statewide consequences of Delta levee failures.

Benefit-Cost Ratio Screening Analysis Criteria on the Focused Array
The three Delta Islands with the highest ratio of total asset repair costs to total
construction costs (from DRMS data) and not included in another current USACE study – Bethel
Island, Walnut Grove, and Brannon-Andrus Island (containing the City of Isleton) - were
considered for further screening level benefit-cost analysis. Based on suggestions from the local
sponsor and its high population, a fourth island, Discovery Bay, was also considered for further
analysis.
The main analytical tool used to perform the economic analysis was the USACE
Hydrologic Engineering Center’s Flood Damage Analysis (HEC-FDA) software. This program
uses engineering data (hydrologic, hydraulic, and geotechnical) and economic data
(structure/content inventory and depth-percent damage curves) to model flooding risk
management problems and potential solutions in the study area. Through integration of the
engineering and economic relationships HEC-FDA computes expected annual damages (EAD)
and performance statistics. EAD is the metric used to describe the consequences of flooding on
an annual basis considering a full range of flood events – from high frequency/small events to
low frequency/large events over a long time horizon. Without project EAD by major damage
area are reported in Table 3-4. All costs are based on the Fiscal Year 2013 Federal water
resource discount rate of 3.75 percent.

Final Report

For this screening level analysis, there were no floodplains or other engineering data
developed for with-project conditions. To develop estimates for with-project damages, two
scenarios were considered: 1) zero with-project damages (or best case scenario), the USACE
project would yield no residual damages, and 2) 25 percent remaining damages (or a typical case
scenario); the USACE project would eliminate 75 percent of without-project damages. The zero
with-project damages scenario is the highest level of FRM performance any USACE project
could yield; whereas, the 25 percent remaining with-project damages are more in line with the
FRM performance of a typical USACE project. The with-project EAD for both scenarios are
reported in Tables 3-6 and 3-7.

Final Report

Structural FRM Summary
The four Delta islands that have the highest potential for structural FRM measures (based
on the DRMS data) have negative net benefits and BCRs significantly below unity (with the
highest being 0.76). Consideration of future sea level rise or climate change would not change
this outcome because the benefits would not increase significantly in the near future. In light of
these results, no Federal Interest in structural FRM in the Delta can be found at this time, based
on applicable costs, water resources discount rate, and USACE policy.
Nonstructural FRM
Nonstructural measures retained through previous screenings include emergency
response planning, emergency response coordination, and enhancements to flood risk
communication. All of these nonstructural measures are included in the FWOP condition
through ongoing actions. In addition to these valuable ongoing efforts, there is an opportunity
for additional multi-agency response planning and public outreach in the Delta. This report
recommends that DWR, the DPC, USACE, and other Federal, state, and local agencies develop
preparedness plans, stockpile flood fight materials, and communicate flood risk through public
outreach. Advanced flood warning systems should also be considered for the Delta, as very little
warning time exists for much of the region due to the nature of the isolated tidal levee systems
and deep floodplains. The existing USACE Floodplain Management Services (FPMS) authority,
Planning Assistance to States (PAS) and Silver Jackets Programs provide an opportunity for the
state and local governments to request Federal assistance with these efforts. Therefore, these
measures are provided as general recommendations and will not be included in a recommended
plan for action, as sufficient authority exists to further explore these recommendations.

3.4.2

Ecosystem Restoration Screening of Measures

ER measures, described below, were developed to achieve ER objectives in the study
area . The ER measures address the critical nature of the ecological health of the Delta, address
the cause of habitat degradation, and re-establish some of the critical ecosystem structure and
functions. Addressing habitat degradation improves the overall ecosystem by reducing the
negative stressors that have depleted the ecosystem functions, thereby allowing the natural
processes to restore some ecosystem structure and functions, improving the overall health of the
ecosystem. Reviving ecosystem function typically involves actively restoring key hydrologic
and geomorphic processes through physical modifications and reestablishing native vegetation to
start the recovery process. The general ER measures considered in the study were:

Due to the integrated nature of levees and habitat in the Delta, some ER measures may also incidentally contribute to FRM
objectives.

Final Report

•

Restore native riparian habitat. Restoration of natural riparian habitat by active
means such as re-sloping banks, planting vegetation, or controlling invasive
species. In most, if not all cases, riparian habitat restoration would be connected to
the levee and would involve work within the levee prism. Due to the potential for
significant habitat gains from increased riparian habitat, this measure was retained for
further consideration.

•

Creation of new channels to connect habitat. Creating new channels would involve
dredging or otherwise creating new channels to improve stream connectivity and
resulting connections for aquatic and terrestrial species. Creation of new channels
would be connected to levees and would involve work within the levee prism. This
measure would be consistent with and improve the integrated nature of levees and
habitat in the Delta, therefore, this measure was retained for further consideration.

•

Invasive species management. This measure would include removal of non-native
plant species from existing or restored habitats. Generally, removal and continued
management of invasive species is costly and significant habitat gains are not realized
by this type of measure alone. Therefore, this measure will be dropped from further
consideration as a standalone measure, but the concept may be incorporated into other
restoration areas.

•

Restore in-channel islands and floodplains. This measure includes the reconnection
of floodplains to adjacent waterways through the partial or full removal of levees or
setting back of levees, along with re-sloping and contouring as necessary. Work
associated with this measure has the potential to realize significant habitat benefits.
Therefore, this measure was retained for further consideration by this study.

•

Restore historic marshes. This measure includes the creation of intertidal marsh
habitat to benefit native aquatic and terrestrial species. This measure is included in
the future without-project condition (which assumes BDCP/CA WaterFix/EcoRestore
implementation) for areas throughout the Delta that are currently of the appropriate
elevation (range of depths) for this habitat type; therefore, little opportunity would
exist under the assumed future conditions to implement this measure without
incorporation of subsidence reversal. Additionally, opportunities may exist within
already flooded islands, most of which are currently deep water (as opposed to marsh)
due to subsidence that occurred prior to levee failure and subsequent flooding 6.
Subsidence reversal in conjunction with restoration of tidal and intertidal habitat
provides an opportunity for restoration of historic marshes in areas not considered for
BDCP/CA WaterFix/EcoRestore implementation.
5F

•

Salinity Management. This measure would alter salinity patterns through the
operation of a salinity control gate in the Delta or modifying upstream reservoir
operations. Salinity management currently occurs in the Delta through a complex
system of laws, biological opinions, and regulations that balance the sometimes

6

Subsidence largely results from the oxidation of peat during dry conditions; therefore, subsidence does not occur on flooded
areas and/or submerged lands. Subsidence of flooded lands, as mentioned, occurred while those lands were dry/leveed.

conflicting salinity requirements for the environment (with sometimes conflicting
needs between endangered species such as Delta smelt and salmonids), Delta water
exports, and in-Delta water use/rights. The BDCP/CA WaterFix/EcoRestore is being
developed in compliance with the existing laws, biological opinions, and regulations
governing salinity; therefore, salinity management is included in the future withoutproject condition for this study and will be dropped from further consideration as an
ER measure.
•

Construct habitat friendly levees. This measure would include constructing or
modifying levees to include features such as benches for establishing native
vegetation. This measure could include setback levees or other measures. Due to the
connection between levees, floodplains, and associated habitat establishment, it was
determined that as a standalone measure, habitat friendly levees would not provide as
much ecosystem benefit as it would when combined with other measures. Therefore,
this measure will be dropped from further consideration as a standalone measure. It
will be incorporated into other restoration measures.

•

Setback levees (tidal/riparian). This measure would include constructing setback
levees that allow for tidal/riparian habitat to be restored in the area between the
existing levee and the setback levee. This measure may require landside levee
sloping and notching of the existing levee to allow for water to get to the restoration
area. This measure would require work within the levee prism, and has potential to
provide incidental FRM benefits and achieve significant habitat benefits. Therefore,
this measure was retained for further consideration.

•

Controlled flooding of appropriate subsided islands. This measure includes
degrading/removing/notching levees to allow restoration of the floodplain. Due to
subsidence, flows would have to be managed in order to create habitat suitable for
native species and prevent fish strandings. This measure would require work within
the levee prism, and has potential to be combined with FRM measures and achieve
significant habitat benefits. Therefore, this measure was retained for further
consideration.

•

Create bypasses. This measure includes creating bypasses with riparian and intertidal
habitats. Work may require levee modifications, removal, or minor channel
construction. This measure has a high potential for aquatic restoration benefits
associated with listed species for various life-stage functions. Therefore, this measure
was retained for further consideration.

Final Report

Ecosystem Restoration Measures Developed in Detail
Measures that were carried forward through the initial screening process were refined to a
greater level of detail and locations were identified for consideration. In order to ensure that
only implementable measures with a reasonable chance of achieving a significant increase in
habitat value at a reasonable cost were included in the final array of alternatives, the following
criteria were established to further screen detailed measures:
•

Areas considered for restoration must not coincide with restoration considered as part of
the future without-project condition. BDCP/CA WaterFix/EcoRestore Restoration
Opportunity Areas were excluded from ER analysis in order to avoid planning
constraints. As these potential restoration areas are fairly extensive, this criteria greatly
reduced the geographic footprint available for consideration within this study; however,
these limitations were put into place for this interim report in order to reduce study risk
and allow plan formulation to take place regardless of uncertain future conditions.
Again, it should be noted that these assumptions and constraints apply only to this interim
report and will be revisited in any follow-on feasibility studies.

•

Location selection should favor areas in closer proximity to potential fill material
necessary to restore elevations to the appropriate range for habitat, when possible.

•

Location selection should favor areas where potentially less fill material would be
required.

•

Location selection should avoid impacts to population centers and infrastructure.

•

Location selection should avoid impacts to islands in the western Delta that are
considered critical for salinity management – known as the “eight western islands.” The
functionality of the eight western islands is to restrict flow of more saline water from the
San Francisco Bay into the Delta for purposes of water supply. While several open water
areas such as Big Break lie in close proximity to the eight western islands, these flooded,
open water areas do not provide this same functionality. It should be noted that there is
no official designation of the "eight western islands" in the Delta; but rather, this is
common terminology used to highlight the importance of these areas for purposes of
maintaining appropriate salinity in the Delta for water supply.”

•

Location selection should favor areas which provide connectivity to existing habitat,
when possible.

Figure 3-3 provides a geographic representation of the limitations these criteria pose on
the geographic extent of restoration considered.
Once locations were identified, increments (or scales) of measures were developed, when
possible, in order to evaluate and determine the most cost effective scale of restoration necessary
to achieve the study objectives. Descriptions of these detailed ER measures follow.

Restore Intertidal Habitat with Subsidence Reversal at Big Break (see Figure 3-4)
Restore habitat value to native species through subsidence reversal and subsequent
restoration of intertidal habitat in the flooded Big Break Island. This location was selected
because it is in close proximity to potential fill material, would likely require less fill material
than other locations in the vicinity, would have no impacts to population centers or
infrastructure, and could provide connectivity to existing habitat. Big Break is owned and
managed by the East Bay Regional Park District as part of Big Break Regional Shoreline. Two
scales of this measure were included for evaluation:
•

Increment 1– The minimal restoration considered at Big Break would include 62
acres of tidal habitat restoration along the northern remnant levee adjacent to Jersey
Island. In-water placement of material would be required to increase elevations to
tidal range. Increment 1 is shown below in orange.

•

Increment 2 – The larger scale of restoration considered would include the remaining
621 acres at Big Break. In-water placement of material would be required to increase
elevations to tidal range. Increment 2 is shown below in purple.

Restore habitat value to native species through subsidence reversal and subsequent
restoration of intertidal habitat in the flooded Little Franks Tract and Franks Tract. This location
was selected because it is in close proximity to potential fill material, would likely require less
fill material than other locations in the vicinity, and would have no impacts to population centers
or infrastructure. Three scales of this measure were included for evaluation:
•

Increment 1 – The minimal restoration considered would include 319 acres of tidal
habitat restoration at Little Franks Tract. In-water placement of material would be
required to increase elevations to tidal range. Increment 1 is shown below in orange.

•

Increment 2 – The next larger scale of restoration considered would include 862 acres
along the remnant levee on the northern edge of Franks Tract. In-water placement of
material would be required to increase elevations to tidal range. Increment 2 is
shown below in purple.

•

Increment 3 – The largest scale of restoration considered would include the remaining
2,595 acres of Franks Tract. In-water placement of material would be required to
increase elevations to tidal range. Increment 3 is shown below in blue.

Restore Stream Connectivity and Riparian Habitat with Setback Levees at
Steamboat and Sutter Sloughs (see Figure 3-6)
Restore connectivity/habitat to improve channel margin habitat through floodplain
restoration including setback levee construction. This location was selected because it is in close
proximity to (likely more limited) potential fill material, could require less fill material than
other locations in the vicinity, and would have limited impacts to population centers or
infrastructure. Four scales of this sub-measure were included for evaluation:
•

Increment 1 – The minimal restoration considered at Steamboat and Sutter Sloughs
would include 0.4 miles of setback levee on the northern most tip (at the southern
extent of the Elk Slough restoration) of Sutter Island to improve connectivity between
Sutter and Steamboat Sloughs and the Sacramento River through the restoration of 66
acres of riparian habitat. Increment 1 is shown below in orange.

•

Increment 2a – This configuration of the next larger scale of restoration would
include the adjacent 1,967 acres of Sutter Island (extending from the north to just
south of Miner Slough), 732 acres on the southern tip of Netherlands (on the north
bank of Miner Slough), and 1,217 acres on the northern tip of Ryer Island (on the
south bank of Miner Slough). This 3,916 acre increment would connect the Elk
Slough restoration to Steamboat Slough and Miner Slough, as well as existing and
planned habitat areas on Prospect Island. This increment would require a 0.6 mile
setback levee across Sutter Island, a 2.1 mile levee across the southern tip of
Netherlands, and a 1.9 mile setback levee on the northern tip of Ryer Island.
Increment 2a is shown below in purple hatch.

•

Increment 2b – This configuration of the next larger scale of restoration would
include all of Sutter Island (an additional 2,449 acres in addition to the 66 acres in
Increment 1), as well as a 956 acre corridor (approximately 1,000 ft wide) along
Steamboat Slough on Ryer Island requiring 7 miles of setback levee. This 3,405 acre
increment would connect the Elk Slough restoration to Steamboat Slough and the
Sacramento Deep Water Ship Channel (DWSC) at their confluence with the
Sacramento River, restoring a corridor which could serve as an alternative migratory
pathway for endangered salmon and Delta smelt. Increment 2b is shown below in
purple hatch.

•

Increment 3 – The maximum restoration considered would be implemented in
conjunction with Increment 2b and would increase the restoration corridor on Ryer
Island by 2,197 acres, requiring a 5.6 mile of setback levee. Additionally, 2,251 acres
would be restored on the opposite bank of Steamboat Slough on Grand Island,
requiring a 6.6 mile setback levee. This 4,448 acre increment would provide
additional acres of restored habitat and connect the restoration to existing and planned
restoration on the southwest tip of Grand Island at the confluence of the Sacramento
River. Increment 3 is shown below in blue.

Restore Riparian/Intertidal Habitat, Floodplain Access, and Subsidence Reversal
along the South Mokelumne River (see Figure 3-7)
Increase floodplain connectivity through the use of gates or setback levees. This location
was selected because it would have limited impacts to population centers or infrastructure and
could provide connectivity to existing habitat. Four scales of this measure were included for
evaluation:
•

Increment 1 – The minimum restoration considered for this measure includes 3,530
acres of riparian/intertidal habitat along the South Mokelumne River, requiring 7.3
miles of setback levees on four tracts. This increment would extend other existing
and planned adjacent habitat areas to the north (Cosumnes Preserve, McCormackWilliamson Tract, Staten Island, and other BDCP/CA WaterFix/EcoRestore proposed
habitat areas). Increment 1 is shown below in orange. Portions of the following
tracts would be included in this increment:
o New Hope Tract – 563 acres of riparian/intertidal habitat, 2.4 miles of setback
levee.
o Canal Ranch – 868 acres of riparian/intertidal habitat, 2 miles of setback
levee.
o Brack Tract – 1216 acres of riparian/intertidal habitat, 1.4 miles of setback
levee.
o Terminous Tract – 883 acres of riparian/intertidal habitat, 1.5 miles of setback
levee.

•

Increment 2 – The next increment under consideration would extend Increment 1
south toward the San Joaquin River and would add an additional 1,217 acres of
riparian/intertidal habitat, requiring 3.7 miles of three setback levees on two tracts.
Two separate setback levees would be constructed on Terminous Tract. The eastern
Terminous Tract habitat area would span 118 acres and would require a 0.5 mile
setback levee. The southern Terminous Tract habitat area would encompass 471
acres and would require a 1.3 mile setback levee. The third habitat area in this
increment includes the 628 acres on the eastern most portion of Empire Tract and
would require a 1.9 mile setback levee. Increment 2 is shown below in purple.

Increase floodplain habitat through subsidence reversal and subsequent restoration of
riparian and intertidal habitat. This location was selected because it is in relatively close
proximity to potential fill material, would have limited impacts to population centers or
infrastructure, and could provide connectivity to existing habitat. Two scales of this measure
were included for evaluation:
•

Increment 1 – The minimum restoration considered for this measure includes 14 acres
of subsidence reversal and subsequent restoration of intertidal and riparian habitat on
the southeastern portion of Medford Island surrounded by an existing mitigation
habitat area/preserve (approximately 200 acres). Increment 1 is shown below in
orange.

•

Increment 2 – The maximum restoration considered for this measure would include
subsidence reversal and subsequent restoration of intertidal and riparian habitat on an
additional 664 acres of Medford Island. This increment would restore Medford
Island in its entirety, as approximately 512 acres of the island have already been
restored through mitigation efforts. Increment 2 is shown below in purple.

Additional Ecosystem Restoration Measures Considered
The following site-specific measures were considered, but dropped from further
evaluation for the reasons noted.
•

Restore Stream Connectivity and Riparian Habitat with Setback Levees at Elk Slough.
Restore connectivity/habitat to improve channel margin habitat through floodplain
restoration including setback levee construction. Upon investigation, it was
determined that this action is currently under consideration in the BDCP/CA
WaterFix/EcoRestore and is therefore part of the future-without project condition.
For this reason, it was dropped from further consideration.

•

Restore Floodplain/Bypass at Paradise Cut. Widen access to floodplain to increase
capacity and improve hydraulic conditions to benefit native species (consideration
must be taken to avoid migration of fish into State and Federal Water Projects due to
the proximity to these facilities). Upon investigation, it was determined that this
action is currently under consideration in the BDCP/CA WaterFix/EcoRestore and is
therefore part of the future-without project condition. For this reason, it was dropped
from further consideration.

•

Creation of Bypass at Prospect Island. Increase floodplain connectivity through the
use of gates or setback levees. Upon investigation, it was determined that this action
is currently under consideration in the BDCP/CA WaterFix/EcoRestore and is
therefore part of the future-without project condition. For this reason, it was dropped
from further consideration.

•

Restore Intertidal/Riparian Habitat, Floodplain Access, and Subsidence Reversal at
Staten Island: Mokelumne River. Increase floodplain connectivity through the use of
gates or setback levees. Upon investigation, it was determined that this action is
currently under consideration in the BDCP/CA WaterFix/EcoRestore and is therefore
part of the future-without project condition. For this reason, it was dropped from
further consideration.

•

Restore Intertidal/Riparian Habitat, Floodplain Access, and Subsidence Reversal at 8
Western Islands. Increase floodplain connectivity through the use of gates or setback
levees. Although this general measure would contribute to the ER objective, the
location of the 8 western islands was discussed due to its importance to the water
delivery system rather than ER objectives. Other areas were identified for more
suitable application of this general measure. Therefore, this site-specific measure was
dropped from further consideration.

Isleton on the Sacramento River downstream of the bypass and would provide
additional access and connectivity to the floodplains of Yolo Bypass under specific
flood conditions. Although this measure could contribute to the ER objective under
certain operation criteria, the primary formulation objective would be for FRM for
areas outside of the study area. For this reason, this site-specific measure was
dropped from further consideration.
Screening of Ecosystem Restoration Measures
In order to ensure that only implementable measures with a reasonable chance of
achieving a significant increase in habitat value at a reasonable cost were included in the final
array of alternatives, criteria were established to further screen these detailed measures. The
criteria used to screen detailed ER measures are described below:
•

Land Availability Concerns. Due to high value agricultural crops, competing land
uses and interests in the Delta, and the ongoing land issues associated with the
BDCP/CA WaterFix/EcoRestore project, land availability is a major concern for
implementing ER. Some areas have been in agriculture for generations, with the
owners having no interest in selling even a portion of the land. Short of exercising
eminent domain, these lands will not be available in the foreseeable future. Use of
eminent domain to acquire large areas of private land for single-purpose ER that
could be implemented elsewhere is generally not considered to be acceptable.
Additionally, some very high value crops lands (i.e. vineyards) would be cost
prohibitive to acquire even if there were willing sellers. A qualitative risk ranking
of High (not likely to have a willing seller), Medium (likely to have a willing seller),
or Low (public/state ownership) has been assigned to each measure based on input
from non-Federal sponsor staff with extensive experience concerning Delta land
acquisition and availability.

•

Likely Effects on Water Rights. For any of the measures that involve diverting water
or creating fish passage facilities or setback levees, an evaluation of water rights will
be required for any additional water that would be needed during the non-flood
season. Most of the water in the Sacramento River is either Federal CVP water or
SWP water and there may not be “extra” water from the river for restoration or fish
passage purposes.

•

Impacts to Existing Habitat. In order to implement restoration, modifications to the
existing habitats would likely occur. In some cases, good to high quality habitat
along the slough’s edge that could be adversely impacted through the restoration
activities. In order to avoid these impacts, a qualitative ranking of High (likely to
adversely impact existing habitat), Medium (may adversely impact existing habitat),
or Low (not likely to adversely impact existing habitat) has been assigned to each
measure based general information about the sites and input from the non-Federal
sponsor.

•

Gross Relative Real Estate Cost. The acquisition cost for necessary property rights is
likely to represent a major element of overall project costs. . In order to avoid
unrealistic consideration of areas for restoration with unrealistic real property
acquisition costs, a general ranking of High (purchase of private lands with likely
exponentially higher costs), Medium (purchase of private lands required), or Low
(public/state ownership of lands) has been assigned to each measure based on general
land use information and input from the non-Federal sponsor.

•

Gross Relative Construction Cost. Construction costs vary greatly between the
measures under consideration, largely driven by the necessity of setback levees at
some locations and distances from sources of dredged material. In order to screen out
measures that would have exponentially higher construction costs for similar benefits,
parametric cost estimates were developed for each measure. Costs included active
restoration costs and levee construction costs, as these were anticipated to be the
drivers in relative costs per acre (other costs were anticipated to be relatively similar
for each site). A summary of these parametric cost estimates is shown in Table 3-12.

•

Likely to Require Mitigation for Flood Impacts. Changes to the system hydraulics
would likely result from some ER measures under consideration. Some measures
would have a higher likelihood of resulting in upstream or downstream impacts that
would require hydraulic mitigation that could increase costs without providing
additional ER benefits. In order to screen out measures that would most likely have
high hydraulic mitigation costs for similar benefits, a general ranking of High
(extensive levee work likely required), Medium (some levee work likely required), or
Low (not likely to require hydraulic mitigation) has been assigned to each measure
based general information about the site.

Final Report

Final Ecosystem Restoration Measures
The following three ER measures were retained as viable candidates after conclusion of
all screenings: restoration of intertidal habitat with subsidence reversal at Big Break, or Franks
Tract, or Little Franks Tract. Detailed descriptions and final increments of these measures
follow. Costs developed for screening purposed were refined; therefore, costs shown in
subsequent report sections will vary from those shown in Table 3-12.
Prior to levee construction circa 1900, Big Break, Franks Tract, and Little Franks Tract
were comprised of intertidal marsh. Levees were constructed to drain the lands for agricultural
use, resulting in subsidence of the land surface due to compaction, oxidation, and wind erosion.
Multiple levee failures occurred in the early to mid-20th Century and these areas were eventually
not reclaimed (Big Break in 1928, Franks Tract in 1938, and Little Franks Tract in 1983);
however, enough subsidence had already occurred that these open water expanses now function
ecologically as lakes, providing no value to native species. As these areas are no longer dry,
subsidence has essentially halted.
The primary action required to restore habitat value to native species at Big Break,
Franks Tract, and Little Franks Tract is the reversal of subsidence that occurred while the lands
were dry/reclaimed. Similar restoration actions were undertaken by USACE in the 1990s at
nearby Venice Cut and Donlon Island. This restoration has demonstrated that subsidence
reversal to restore land surface to intertidal elevations, along with minimal plantings, can
produce successful restoration of intertidal marsh with 80 percent vegetation coverage within 2
years. Historical subsidence was reversed at these sites through the placement of dredged
material; further subsidence has not taken place. Measures considered at Big Break, Franks
Tract, and Little Franks Tract are based on the success of these reference sites. Donlon Island
provides a physical model that shows the proposed plan is physically feasible, reducing the need
for further advanced modeling and quantitative analysis during feasibility level design. Numeric
and computer modeling could be performed during the Preconstruction, Engineering, and Design
(PED) phase to design the project, using Donlon Island as an example.
Subsidence Reversal
Studies conducted on reference sites at Donlon and Venice Cut Islands indicate that
optimum intertidal marsh habitat (i.e., where vegetative cover is greater than 75 percent) is found
at elevations ranging from approximately -1 ft to + 1 ft mean tide level (~3 ft to 5 ft North
American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD)). Therefore, using a conservative approach for
estimating quantity of fill, a target elevation of +0.5 ft mean tide level (4.5 feet NAVD) was
initially assumed in order to estimate fill quantities for comparison of alternative sites.
Current elevations vary from site to site, resulting in differing requirements for volume of
material per acre to reach the target elevation. Intertidal marsh restoration at Big Break (1,064
acres of marsh with an additional 15 percent of open water) would require 12.7 million cubic
yards of material, or 9,400 cubic yards of material per acre. Intertidal marsh restoration at Little
Franks Tract (273 acres of marsh with an additional 15 percent of open water) would require 4.6

Final Report

million cubic yards of material, or 16,800 cubic yards of material per acre. Intertidal marsh
restoration at Franks Tracts (2,470 acres of marsh with an additional 15 percent of open water)
would require 42.6 million cubic yards of material, or 17,200 cubic yards of material per acre.
Increments were developed for each site based on availability and proximity of fill
material, as this is the primary driver in restoring ecological function and the primary driver of
cost. Based on monitoring results from the Donlon Island and Venice Cut reference sites,
placement of fill material to the appropriate elevations, followed by minimal plantings are
expected to be the only required actions needed to restore intertidal marsh. As elevations are
relatively constant within each site, calculations were made to determine the volume of fill
needed per acre at each site. Volumes of available material were matched to the most efficient
potential site. Potential sources of material include:
•

Direct placement from Operations and Maintenance dredging of the Stockton DWSC
– assumes normal hydraulic dredging operations with suspended material directly
placed into the restoration area(s) via pipeline and contained in an enclosed area
surrounded by either existing high ground (remnant levees) or sacrificial hay bales
and silt curtains to allow suspended material to settle and water to filter through the
silt curtains prior to exiting the site back into the waterways;

•

Pumping previously dredged material from nearby stockpiles – use previously
dredged material in nearby stockpiles by creating a slurry that can be pumped into the
restoration area(s) via pipeline and contained in an enclosed area surrounded by either
existing high ground (remnant levees) or sacrificial hay bales and silt curtains to
allow suspended material to settle and water to filter through the silt curtains prior to
exiting the site back into the waterways; and

•

Trucking and/or barging material from borrow sites within a 30 mile radius – truck
and/or barge material from borrow sites within a 30 mile radius and place material
into the restoration area(s) either directly from trucks (where possible) or via
excavators on barges into an enclosed area surrounded by either existing high ground
(remnant levees) or sacrificial hay bales and silt curtains to allow suspended material
to settle and water to filter through the silt curtains prior to exiting the site back into
the waterways.

Vegetation
The planting design includes installing bulrush (Schoenoplectus spp.) which will be
suitable to develop intertidal marsh habitat. The particular species of native bulrush selected for
planting will be determined by expert examination of local wild plants during detailed design.
Plants will be locally harvested and inspected for health, vigor, and correct identification.
Plantings will be installed at 3 feet on center over 10 percent of the intertidal marsh area. The
plant material may be nursery grown, or collected from nearby sources and directly planted at the
site.

Final Report

Vegetation monitoring surveys at Donlon Island, a similar beneficial use dredged
material intertidal marsh restoration project 1.5 miles west of the proposed project, confirmed an
80 percent or greater survival/establishment rate of intertidal marsh vegetation within two years.
The intertidal marsh vegetation at the Donlon project was naturally recruited and included
cattails as dominant species (USACE and USFWS, 1990). As a result, it is assumed that cattails
would also naturally recruit at the restoration site and would not need to be planted.
Additionally, 50 acres of the adjacent existing levee will be treated to remove nonnative
vegetation, such as Himalayan blackberry (Rubus armeniacus), pampas grass (Cortaderia
selloana), and, and pepper weed (Lepidium latifolium). Following nonnative treatment, the
remnant levee would be planted with native riparian vegetation.
Increments
Increments of restoration at each site were developed based on an acre grid system.
Available fill material calculations were used to determine the size of increments, i.e., how many
grid cells each increment included. It should be noted that the first increments at each site are
relatively small, with a large increment for the remainder of the site. This sizing is a product of
cost breakpoints associated with available fill material. The smaller increments were developed
based on available material that could be transported to the site without major modifications
(e.g., construction of a bridge, multiple transfers between trucks and barges, etc.). The larger
increment includes the remainder of each site for which a more efficient source of available
material could not be identified. Locations of increments are general within each site and are
based on proximity to fill material, proximity to remnant levees for improved constructability,
and connectivity to existing habitat. Figures 3-9 through 3-11 show increments and available fill
material. Table 3-14 provides a summary of all final increments/measures under consideration.

Preliminary Costs
The overall strategy for generating preliminary costs was to use historical construction
methodologies and current day prices for labor, equipment and materials. There are several
important assumptions that were used to create the costs, and generally served to create a less
conservative estimate of the cost, but were reasonably accepted to be true. The most influential
assumptions are related to direct placement dredging: all costs associated with direct placement
alternatives up to a distance of 15,000 feet of dredged material pumping are excluded from the
cost estimate and will be funded by Federal O&M funds (assume 100,000 cubic yards per year
O&M dredging direct placement). Direct placement dredging relative to the O&M measures are
not stand alone projects and require full cooperation and partnership with other programs or
projects.
The highest level of risk from these assumptions lies in the expectation of a low
likelihood of any potential water quality compliance costs to offset or mitigate turbidity that
these construction techniques could cause. It is assumed that the deployment of stacked hay
bales, or similar technology, will be sufficient and cost effective at the point of placement to
prevent a significant increase in water quality compliance costs. The hay bale/silt curtain
method is not a complicated methodology, but in tidal conditions, even the assumed robust cross
sectional design may not be able to withstand the tidal forces, and may require an even more
robust and costly plan. Fortunately, the cost of water quality compliance is 4 to 10 percent of the
total project cost, depending on the dredge/pumping increment and will not prohibitively alter
the “per acre” cost or the weighted contingency. There is also potential risk to cost increases in
trucking/barging material sourcing and water quality compliance for pumping from existing
dredged material storage sites.
The second most influential assumption is that moving the slurry pipeline’s discharge
point is the only practical means of placing slurried fine-grain material in desired locations.
Limited leveling of sand mounds at discharge points may be required if fine sands are also
present in the material. Essentially, this reduces the scope of the earthwork to outflow pipe
management. These assumptions reduce the exposure to costs for all in water placement through
pumping outflow and are considered conservative based upon Project Delivery Team (PDT)
discussion. A relatively low contingency of 25 percent was used, which is considered reasonable
due to the low complexity of the project's features of work.
The construction methodologies used to generate the cost estimate follow standard
industry practices for standard wet and dry earthwork conditions. Earthwork crews were
developed in the Micro-Computer Aided Cost Estimating System (MCACES MII) with
production quantities pulled from the Cost Engineering Section ProdQuant.xls spreadsheet. The
dry earthwork techniques rely primarily on heavy earthmoving equipment including: dozers,
scrapers and hydraulic excavators. Pumping costs were generated from an MCACES MII model
refined with bid information from multiple contractor proposals for similar work in the
immediate area. Pumping techniques require pipes to be laid over land and secured to the river
channel bottom as needed to maintain the most direct, cost efficient, and lowest environmental
and local impact. The material source sites placing at Big Break are assumed to be dependent on

the McCormick dredged material storage site pumping operation in order to create cost savings
by utilizing McCormick's infrastructure following completion of its pumping operation. The
outflow of the pipe is considered mobile and would be repositioned regularly in order to form
sand/silt mounds materials throughout the site. Some leveling of deposited material may be
required.

Formulation of Alternatives

As explained earlier in this chapter (section 3.4.1), the study did not carry forward
structural or non-structural FRM measures. Thus, the array of alternatives was formulated for
the single purpose of ER. Based on the screening of measures described in previous sections, all
increments included in the final array are focused on restoration of intertidal marsh using various
forms of subsidence reversal. The formulation strategy is a process of scaling of
alternatives. The following Plan Formulation principles were used in development of
alternatives:
•

Avoid the need for compensatory mitigation

•

Keep land acquisition to a minimum

•

Maintain Federal participation in monitoring and adaptive management consistent
with Federal law and USACE policy. (Section 2039 of WRDA 2007 requires
monitoring to determine ecological success and allows for up to 10 years of Federal
cost-sharing for monitoring.)

3.5.1

Ecosystem Restoration Alternative Formulation

USACE Institute for Water Resources (IWR) Planning Suite was used to formulate
alternatives based on the final increments/measures. Increments/measures were developed and
screened such that all measures meet planning objectives and avoid planning constraints. Cost
effectiveness and incremental cost analyses (CE/ICA) were performed and generated 9 Best Buy
Plans (alternatives) in addition to the no action alternative:
Alternative 1 is the No Action Plan and assumes no Federal action is taken as the result
of this study.
Alternative 2 is the restoration of 42 acres of intertidal marsh habitat at Big Break
(increment 1a). The primary measure included in this alternative is subsidence reversal in order
to restore historic elevations appropriate for intertidal marsh habitat. In order to do so, 500,000
cubic yards of fill material would be placed via direct placement of dredged material from yearly
O&M dredging from the Stockton DWSC for a period of five years. Upon completion of
subsidence reversal, the area would be planted with native tidal marsh vegetation (bulrush). The
total cost of this alternative is $11 million.

Alternative 3 is the restoration of 84 acres of intertidal marsh habitat at Big Break
(increments 1a and 1b). The primary measure included in this alternative is subsidence reversal
in order to restore historic elevations appropriate for intertidal marsh habitat. In order to do so,
one million cubic yards of fill material would be placed via direct placement of dredged material
from yearly O&M dredging from the Stockton DWSC for a period of ten years. Upon
completion of subsidence reversal, the area would be planted with native tidal marsh vegetation
(bulrush). The total cost of this alternative is $23 million.
Alternative 4 is the restoration of 126 acres of intertidal marsh habitat at Big Break
(increments 1a, 1b, 2, 3, 5 and 6). The primary measure included in this alternative is subsidence
reversal in order to restore historic elevations appropriate for intertidal marsh habitat. In order to
do so, 1.5 million cubic yards of fill material would be placed via direct placement of dredged
material from yearly O&M dredging from the Stockton DWSC for a period of ten years and via
pumping of previously dredged material. Upon completion of subsidence reversal, the area
would be planted with native tidal marsh vegetation (bulrush). The total cost of this alternative
is $61 million.
Alternative 5 is the restoration of 126 acres of intertidal marsh habitat at Big Break
(increments 1a, 1b, 2, 3, 5 and 6) and 10 acres of intertidal marsh habitat at Little Frank’s Tract
(increment 1). The primary measure included in this alternative is subsidence reversal in order to
restore historic elevations appropriate for intertidal marsh habitat. In order to do so, 1.7 million
cubic yards of fill material would be placed via direct placement of dredged material from yearly
O&M dredging from the Stockton DWSC for a period of ten years and via pumping of
previously dredged material. Upon completion of subsidence reversal, the area would be planted
with native tidal marsh vegetation (bulrush). The total cost of this alternative is $69 million.
Alternative 6 is the restoration of 126 acres of intertidal marsh habitat at Big Break
(increments 1a, 1b, 2, 3, 5 and 6), 10 acres of intertidal marsh habitat at Little Frank’s Tract
(increment 1), and 139 acres of intertidal marsh habitat at Frank’s Tract (increments 1 and 2).
The primary measure included in this alternative is subsidence reversal in order to restore
historic elevations appropriate for intertidal marsh habitat. In order to do so, 4 million cubic
yards of fill material would be placed via direct placement of dredged material from yearly
O&M dredging from the Stockton DWSC for a period of ten years and via pumping of
previously dredged material. Upon completion of subsidence reversal, the area would be planted
with native tidal marsh vegetation (bulrush). The total cost of this alternative is $224 million.
Alternative 7 is the restoration of 1,063 acres of intertidal marsh habitat at Big Break
(increments 1a, 1b, 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7), 10 acres of intertidal marsh habitat at Little Frank’s Tract
(increment 1), and 139 acres of intertidal marsh habitat at Frank’s Tract (increments 1 and 2).
The primary measure included in this alternative is subsidence reversal in order to restore
historic elevations appropriate for intertidal marsh habitat. In order to do so, 15.2 million cubic
yards of fill material would be placed via direct placement of dredged material from yearly
O&M dredging from the Stockton DWSC for a period of ten years and via pumping of
previously dredged material. Upon completion of subsidence reversal, the area would be planted
with native tidal marsh vegetation (bulrush). The total cost of this alternative is $1,387 million.

Evaluation of Final Array of Alternative Plans

All increments used to formulate alternatives, and therefore all alternatives, were
determined to meet Completeness and Acceptability criteria. All alternatives have varying levels
of Effectiveness and Efficiency; therefore, cost effectiveness and incremental cost analysis were
used to evaluate and compare alternatives, as follows.
A standard Habitat Evaluation Procedure (HEP) was used to quantify outputs for the
CE/ICA. The Habitat Suitability Model for the Marsh Wren was used to assess outputs of each
alternative. The marsh wren requires emergent herbaceous vegetation, typically cattails and
bulrushes for nesting and cover in water greater than 15 centimeters. The intertidal marsh habitat
being proposed would meet typical marsh wren requirements and is a scarce habitat type within
the Delta. This model was selected because it is a USACE-approved blue book model that has
been used in other projects in the area, is focused on the target habitat type, and has been
coordinated with the USFWS. USACE planning guidance requires ecosystem models which are
certified through the USACE Ecosystem Planning Center of Expertise. The USACE Ecosystem
Planning Center of Expertise confirmed that the model has been approved for use. Although the
Marsh Wren model provided an appropriate indicator of relative ecosystem outputs for
comparison of alternative sites, the Marsh Wren is not the only target species for intertidal marsh
restoration.

Final Report

Model assumptions were developed as the basis for the assessment. The assumption
regarding existing and future without-project conditions is that little to no intertidal marsh habitat
is or will be present at the sites; therefore, AAHUs without-project are projected at zero. The
future with-project assumption is that elevations are restored to support a robust intertidal marsh
habitat. HEP outputs are shown in Table 3-16.

Comparison of Alternative Plans

3.7.1

Cost Effectiveness and Incremental Cost Analysis

Alternatives were compared based on costs and outputs, as well as other criteria such as
contribution to planning objectives, environmental factors, completeness, effectiveness,
efficiency, and acceptability; all were relatively consistent between alternatives. This
comparison was made using IWR Planning Suite to conduct cost effectiveness and incremental
cost analysis based on costs (dollars, October 2018 price level) and outputs (marsh wren
AAHU). Incremental costs per unit of output were used to identify major breakpoints in cost
efficiency among the alternatives. These outputs are shown in Table 3-17 and Figures 3-12 and
3-13 7. Additional details on cost can be found in the Plan Formulation Appendix.

Contribution of Alternatives to Planning Objectives

All action alternatives achieve the first ER planning objective of increasing area,
connectivity, and diversity of native tidal aquatic and related habitats within the study area
during the period of analysis. None of the alternatives achieve the second objective, which was
to increase area, connectivity, and diversity of non-tidal or riparian habitats, as an effective
opportunity did not exist under the assumed future without-project condition. The extent to
which alternatives increase area of tidal habitat is the discriminating factor between alternatives.
Historically, the Delta was comprised almost entirely of about 350,000 acres of tidal marsh, yet
less than 5 percent of this remains. Any contribution to restoring tidal habitat would be seen as
beneficial in this ecosystem of national significance. Although more habitat area would be
viewed as better from an ecological perspective, the extent of Federal investment will be driven
by incremental costs necessary to achieve those additional outputs.

Recommended Plan

3.8.1

Plan Selection

Final Report

A recommendation for plan selection was made by identifying the plan that reasonably
maximizes environmental outputs relative to costs while meeting planning objectives and
avoiding planning constraints. As all alternatives are cost effective, every alternative achieves
the greatest number of outputs for a given cost; therefore, incremental costs per output were used
to identify the NER Plan. Plan selection also considered the effects of future sea level
rise/climate change on the project, but this was not a distinguishing factor among the
alternatives. As all alternatives propose to do similar actions in similar locations, inland
hydrology and sea level rise would equally affect all alternatives under consideration.
Outputs increase as alternatives progress (1-10); however, these outputs are achieved at
increasingly higher incremental costs. Breaks in incremental cost are found at Alternatives 3, 7,
and 9; therefore, these alternatives were identified as the most logical candidates for plan
selection. The incremental annual cost increase per AAHU is from $10,700 for Alternative 3 to
$45,800 for Alternative 7. This increase is considered to be unreasonable for the outputs
achieved. For these reasons, Alternative 3 is the recommended plan. Alternative 3 would
consist of restoration of intertidal marsh at Big Break using approximately 1,000,000 cubic yards
of maintenance-dredged material from the Stockton DWSC. The area of the restored marsh was
initially estimated as 84 acres, but the restoration area was expanded to 340 acres during
feasibility level design (see explanation below, at Section 3.8.1).

3.8.2

Feasibility Level Design

Upon selection of the recommended plan, designs and costs were developed to a greater
level of detail, as described in Appendix C. Two factors were of particular importance
throughout this process. First, additional data and information regarding the composition of
dredged material to be used in the recommended plan indicated that the material will be
comprised primarily of sand, rather than silt as previously assumed. Sandy material is expected
to perform differently during placement than silty material. For example, sandy material is
heavier than silty material, so it is expected to settle much faster than silt, which indicates that
there would likely be a significantly reduced concern over induced turbidity during placement
than previously assumed. Additionally, sandy material will retain its form when placed rather
than settling into a fluid, slurry mixture that would require containment in order to secure a
plantable elevation for marsh restoration. The sandy material will form into mounds when
placed via hydraulic dredging, which allowed the design of the recommended plan to be altered
to incorporate varying topography and interwoven channels to provide a greater range of benefits
for sensitive species of National importance in the Delta.

Final Report

Second, building off of the change of substrate and the ability to incorporate interwoven
channels into the designs, the target design elevation was refined from the assumptions used in
the draft report. The draft report incorporated a target elevation that considered optimizing
marsh wren HEP outputs consistent with the design approaches from Donlon Island. Since the
change in substrate enabled more control and flexibility over the design approach, the team
conducted a review of design considerations with a goal of ensuring that the feasibility level of
design would be developed using a more diverse, multi-species, ecosystem approach. The
considerations reviewed included looking at the optimal elevation for establishing marsh
vegetation, a review of the lessons learned from Donlon Island, a review of the HEP criteria for
marsh wren, and a review of appropriate target elevations for various life stage uses for Delta
smelt and juvenile salmonid and sturgeon, Federally-listed fish species of National significance
in the Delta. Ultimately, in reviewing these data a decision was reached to decrease the initial
overall target elevations.
Specifically, the design elevation was decreased to provide Delta smelt spawning habitat,
juvenile salmonid and sturgeon foraging habitat, and to ensure that aquatic marsh vegetation
species will adequately establish throughout the site. In addition, the primary criticism of the
Donlon Island monitoring reports was noting a need to provide more water circulation through
the site in order to provide for better water quality and conditions less optimal for non-native
aquatic vegetation establishment.
These factors described above would apply equally to all alternatives under consideration
in this study; therefore, previous evaluations and comparisons of alternatives were not revisited.
The alternatives include three sources of material for subsidence reversal: direct placement from
O&M dredging operations, previously dredged stockpiled material, and a gross assumption of
trucking/barging similar material from a 30 mile radius. All material sourced from direct
placement from O&M dredging operations is included in the Recommended Plan. The ultimate
source of stockpiled material under consideration in the array of alternatives is dredging of the
same channels; therefore, the material type would be similar to that of direct placement from
O&M dredging operations. Although there could be some detailed differences in these materials
due to settlement at the placement site, etc., the assumption that these material types are
generally similar is a reasonable assumption for alternative selection. The third material source
(trucking/barging) generally assumes that the same type of material utilized for the other
restoration increments would be sought in order to restore a continuous habitat with similar
design. Because material types are the same, expansion in footprint due to the detailed designs
would be proportional to all other alternatives under consideration. Additionally, target
elevations would apply to all areas under consideration for all alternatives.
These refined design characteristics resulted in an increase in the size of the restoration
area from 84 acres to 340 acres due to the varying topography, interwoven channels, and
decrease in target elevations. Of the 340 acres, 90 acres would be planted with marsh vegetation
species and the remaining 250 acres would be interwoven channels providing shallow water
habitat benefits to fish species. The HEP outputs for the Recommended Plan have been
quantified as 111.44 average annual habitat units (AAHUs) with the marsh wren model;

Final Report

however, it should be noted that the marsh wren model does not quantify the benefits associated
with the shallow water habitat benefits for fish species, which accounts for 250 of the 340 acres.
These benefits are described further in the Special Status Species analysis in Section 5.3, as well
as the Regional Benefits discussion in Section 8.1.2.
The estimated first cost of the Recommended Plan has changed from $23M to $25M;
however, the annual cost per acre has decreased from $274,000 to $74,000 due to these design
refinements. The remainder of this report is based on the feasibility level design. Figure 3-14
shows the revised footprint of the recommended plan based on feasibility level design.

Final Report

NEPA Project Description

NEPA compliance requires a greater level of detail than plan selection in order to fully
analyze the potential effects of the proposed alternatives on the natural and human environment.
Chapter 4 includes a description of the affected environment in the study area, followed by
Chapter 5, which includes a discussion of the potential environmental effects of the proposed
alternatives that are described below.

3.9.1

Alternatives not Considered in Detail

While the final array of alternatives for the CE/ICA was developed using preliminary
design assumptions, the feasibility level design described above was only applied to Alternatives
2 and 3. As a result, the remaining alternatives have been screened from consideration in the
final NEPA analysis, including the former preferred alternative from the draft EIS.
Alternatives 4 through 10 were eliminated through the CE/ICA process, because material
acquisition from the land-based dredged material placement sites was cost prohibitive. As a
result, the remaining alternatives in the NEPA analysis include Alternative 1 (No Action),
Alternative 2 (160 acres of restoration), and Alternative 3 (340 acres of restoration). Alternative
3 is the Selected Plan and is also the Environmentally Preferred Alternative.

3.9.2

NEPA Action Alternatives

Alternative 1 – No Action
Under the no action alternative, USACE would not participate in ER in the project area as
part of the Delta Islands and Levees Feasibility Study. Dredged material would continue to be
placed at the dredged material placement sites on dry land and would not be beneficially used.
The ecosystems of the Delta, as represented by the project area, could continue to degrade over
time, with the associated decline and loss of Delta habitats and species. The no action alternative
would not meet the planning goal to restore sustainable ecosystem functions in the Delta.
As discussed in Section 3.3, this feasibility study currently assumes that the features of
the California WaterFix and EcoRestore as proposed by the State in concert with other State,
Federal, and local agencies would be in place. WaterFix and EcoRestore involve implementing
ER activities throughout the Delta to offset habitat losses and declines. The cumulative benefits
of those restoration and mitigation activities would benefit the greater Sacramento-San Joaquin
Delta region. However, no specific State restoration activities are proposed for the action area
discussed in this study.

Delta Island and Levees Feasibility Study

Final Report

Ecological characteristics, such as spatial extent, habitat heterogeneity, and dynamic
storage, could remain substantially altered as a result of past and present land use and water
management practices in the Delta. Fragmentation and loss of shallow open waters, tidal marsh,
and shaded riverine aquatic habitats due to past channelization and construction of levees are
likely to remain, as would the separation of historic floodplains from natural hydrologic flooding
events through the channels in the Delta.
This continuing loss and fragmentation of habitats could provide reduced habitat values,
thus supporting fewer numbers and types of both plant and animal species. Native species,
including Federally listed threatened, endangered, and proposed species, such as Antioch Dunes
evening-primrose, Delta smelt, and salmonids, are likely to decline in overall health and numbers
due to degraded soil and water quality conditions. In addition, degraded conditions have led to
the introduction and propagation of non-native invasive species such as egeria and water
hyacinth that out-compete and replace native species for limited resources.
Alternative 2 – 160 Acres of Intertidal Marsh Restoration
Alternative 2 includes only Big Break increment 1a using O&M dredging over a five year
period to create approximately 160 acres of intertidal marsh habitat. Of the 160 acres,
approximately 45 acres would be planted with aquatic vegetation, and the remaining 112 acres
would be shallow water habitat for aquatic fauna species. Dredged material would be acquired
from O&M activities in the San Francisco Bay to Stockton DWSC between approximately
station points 400+00 and 850+00 (Figure 3-15). Big Break is owned and managed by the East
Bay Regional Park District as part of Big Break Regional Shoreline. Dredged material would be
directly pumped to the restoration site, rather than the usual land-based dredged material
placement sites. A chemical and granular composition analysis of the materials would be
conducted in advance of placement. For the purposes of the NEPA analysis, project construction
is estimated to begin in the fall of 2020.
The environmental effects of the hydraulic dredging and the piping of material to a
placement site are an ongoing USACE maintenance operation that is covered under the Stockton
DWSC Maintenance Dredging and Bank Protection Project, California (O&M Dredging
Project). USACE is currently updating the NEPA analysis for the O&M Dredging Project, with
a draft environmental analysis anticipated to be released for public review in 2018. In addition,
USACE has updated its programmatic consultation with both USFWS and NMFS under section
7(b) of the Endangered Species Act (FESA) of 1973 (16 U.S.C §1531 et seq. and implementing
regulations at 50 C.F.R. Part 402). NMFS issued a final 10-year programmatic biological
opinion (BO) on June 3, 2016 (Refer to NMFS No: WCR-2016-4548, Division Chon File:
ARN#151422-WCR2015-SA00150). USFWS issued a final 5-year programmatic BO on July
31, 2017 (Refer to USFWS File # 08FBDT00-2017-F-0098). In addition, annual permitting
occurs with the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board (CVRWQCB) and
California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) prior to each dredging season.

Figure 3-15. Dredging Reaches for Big Break Placement

The Stockton DWSC O&M Dredging program is a preexisting action that would occur
regardless of implementation of the proposed beneficial reuse restoration project, therefore
impacts associated with the dredging are not assessed as part of the action alternatives. The
proposed actions under both Alternatives 2 and 3 include the redirection of the hydraulic
dredging pipeline from the Stockton DWSC land disposal sites to Big Break, which in turn
includes the placement of a temporary pipeline across Jersey Island. Additionally, each action
alternative includes the placement of dredged material into Big Break, vegetation installation at
the restoration area, associated long-term maintenance actions, and monitoring and adaptive
management.

Final Report

Direct Placement of O&M Dredged Material
A hydraulic suction dredge would be used to acquire material under the existing O&M
Dredging Project. Dredging rates vary depending on the type of material being dredged, but
production rates of 300 to 600 cubic yards per operational hour are typical. It is estimated that
approximately 100,000 cubic yards of material would be available each year, for a total of
approximately 500,000 cubic yards over the estimated 10 year construction period. If a different
quantity of material is available in any given year, the overall construction schedule and footprint
would be adjusted accordingly.
The dredging operations are expected to be conducted 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.
Typically, approximately 18 hours per day are considered ‘operational,’ during which dredging
occurs. Placement would occur over a five year period in the timeframe of August 1 to
November 30, consistent with the current avoidance work windows for Delta smelt and
salmonids established in the Biological Opinions for the O&M Dredging Project. Placement at
Big Break is estimated to occur over approximately 15 days per work year.
Dredged material would be pumped from the dredging vessel directly to Big Break.
Materials would be pumped to the proposed project areas through a floating 18 inch double wall
high density plastic extrusion (HDPE) pipe. The piping system would be placed along the
shoreline of the Stockton DWSC in the San Joaquin River. The pipeline would be submerged
and anchored to the bottom to avoid navigation hazards. A floating diesel repeater pump station
would be positioned every 3 miles as necessary to aid slurry flow; pump(s) would be installed on
a floating platform with stakes to secure its position. Work boats would install and maintain the
floating pipeline. An additional work boat and crew would tender the position of the outfall
slurry pipe during pumping operations to ensure correct placement of materials.
The pipeline would access Big Break from the DWSC via a land-based crossing at Jersey
Island. There is one dirt farm road running north/south on Jersey Island; the pipeline would be
placed adjacent to the road above ground. Prior to installation of the pipeline, the dirt road
would be improved for vehicular access and hauling. Gravel would be placed on the road at a
width of 25 feet. After the haul road is improved, the pipe would be installed by placing 60-foot
segments of pipe and welding the segments together. The pipeline would take 1 day to install
each construction season and 1 day to remove. The removal process would be the same as the
installation process. A 12 person work crew could complete this task in a 12 hour work day.
The pipeline would cross one farm road running east/west, in addition to two levee roads
on the north and south shore of the island. Above-ground, culvert-style crossings would be
installed at these intersections in order to avoid impacts to the farm fields. The proposed crossing
location is shown on Figure 3-14 above. The Jersey Island crossing is not anticipated to need a
booster pump on the island; however, a floating booster pump station would likely be installed
adjacent to the north shore of Jersey Island.

Delta Island and Levees Feasibility Study

Final Report

In addition, a 1-acre staging area would be used each year on Jersey Island. The staging
area would be located on the south shore of Jersey Island at the end of the haul road and pipeline
crossing. The staging area would be improved, as needed, by placing gravel for vehicular use.
Material Placement
The hydraulic slurry would be discharged at the restoration sites at an assumed average
rate of 450 cubic yards per hour or 8,100 cubic yards per day. Placement of the material will
occur using baffle plates to dispel the energy and direct the sediment downward to create quasisymmetrical sand mounds. Analysis of over 10 years of grain size distribution data for the
400+00 to 850+00 dredging reaches shows the material to be virtually completely fine sand.
Since this sand will be falling in a hydraulic slurry, the sand is assumed to settle to a 1 on 20
slope below the mean tide level (MTL, which is 2 feet higher than the mean lower low water
[MLLW] level) and to a 1 on 10 slope above the MTL. This placement process is similar
enough to sand depositing in the navigation channel that no bulking of the placed dredged
material is assumed and no consolidation of the placed material is assumed (i.e. one cubic yard
taken from the channel is equal in volume to one cubic yard of a placed sand mound).
Sand mounds would be placed so that the mound toes do not overlap, leaving channels of
varying sizes between the mounds. The intent is to ensure that the channel centerlines are never
shallower than the existing condition (-3 to -4 feet MLLW). The goal of this placement plan is
to create a diverse habitat that provides value to both shallow water aquatic fauna that require
varying depths of soft bottom habitat, as well as terrestrial marsh species such as shore birds. In
addition, based on lessons learned from Donlon Island, this design is intended to provide
sufficient flow through the site to maintain water quality. A larger channel will be identified
through the restoration site in the preconstruction engineering and design phase to provide a
kayak trail to minimize the loss of recreational opportunities in the restoration footprint.
The bed material at Big Break is former agricultural land that was prone to subsidence
upon drying, thus the material is assumed to be highly compressible. Table 3-18 lists

Final Report

In addition to “losses” of placed dredged material by the compression of underlying
sediments (as a greater volume of sand is necessary to construct a mound of a given height above
the sediment bed), other potential losses that could occur include:
•

Wave wash erosion during storms;

•

Unpredicted consolidation in excess of assumed amounts; and,

•

Ineffective elevations due to sea level rise (SLR).

Table 3-18 also indicates a contingency amount of 1 foot of additional mound height
losses due to some combination of these factors. Figures 3-16a and 3-16b display the initial
placement (black line) and final geometry (red line, used for plantable area sizing calculations)
of a sand mound placed at -3 feet MLLW and -4 feet MLLW, respectively. It is estimated that
the sand mounds would require approximately 10 months for settlement following construction.
Following the settlement period, aquatic vegetation would be installed, as described below.

Final Report

The bed level within the proposed footprint varies from -3 to -4 feet MLLW; mean tides
within Big Break range from 0 feet MLLW to +4 feet MLLW. As a result, bed depths in the
restoration area range from 3 feet during a mean lower low water tide to 8 feet during a mean
higher high water tide. The proposed sand mounds would be constructed with a target elevation
of +3 feet MLLW. Thus at high tide, sand mounds will be approximately 1 foot below the water
surface level; and at low tide, the top of the vegetated sand mounds would be exposed.
Sacrificial hay bales will be placed to provide barriers to the predominant flow paths to
allow for sediment settling and sand mound stability. Hay bales are anticipated to persist 1 to 2
years, giving sufficient time for vegetative establishment, after which vegetation is assumed to
provide adequate erosion resistance. Sacrificial hay bales would be used to aid in compliance
with water quality requirements. Hay bale lines are not anticipated to be fully enclosing;
however, should enclosure become a possibility, the top of the sacrificial hay bale line would be
set at mean low tide level to allow fish an opportunity to escape the work area. If unanticipated
quantities of fine-grained material are present in dredged sediments, turbidity curtains can be
used in combination with sacrificial hay bales and would float slightly above the bottom
allowing aquatic species to escape entrapment.
Construction of the sand mounds would require approximately six workers.
Approximately 12 employee trips per day of 20 miles each way would be typical for access to
and from the site. Equipment anticipated for construction includes three generators/motors, one
lift pump, and two work boats.
Plantings
Plantings would be installed during two separate periods: the aquatic vegetation would be
installed in the spring and the terrestrial vegetation would be installed in the fall. Following
planting is the initial establishment period, which starts when all the plants have been installed
and accepted. The establishment period would be for three continuous years. Seed collection
would occur in the spring or summer. The seeds would then be propagated in a nursery for
approximately 1 year prior to installation. Table 3-19 identifies species generally conductive to
the project region.

Riparian Planting
Prior to construction, the existing remnant levee would be treated to remove existing
invasive vegetation. Invasive vegetation would be removed using a gas-powered hedger. The
cuttings would be raked-up using pitchforks, and the cuttings would be chipped. The chips
would be spread over the ground as mulch. The exposed residue rootstock would be treated with
three treatments of herbicide, spaced one month apart. The herbicide would be approved for use
near water bodies. This treatment is necessary to ensure the desirable planted grass and terrestrial
vegetation would establish without competition. This would give native vegetation a head start,
and make it harder for the nonnative vegetation to return. Native grass would be seeded
following initial invasive removal to provide both habitat and soil stabilization while the remnant
levee is being monitored to ensure that the invasive treatment is successful. Invasive treatment
of the remnant levee is expected to occur the summer before the first dredged placement occurs.
Terrestrial riparian species would be planted in the fall of the first construction season on
the remnant levee at 235 plants per acre, protected and maintained for 3 years until their roots
have established. Ground water is relatively close to the ground level, so survival is expected to
be high and would easily achieve a goal of 141 plants per acre, or 60% of all installed plants.
The ultimate goal is to promote root growth and enable the plants to achieve self-sufficiency by
85
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
Sacramento District

Delta Island and Levees Feasibility Study

Final Report

the end of the 3 year establishment period. The plantings are considered self-sufficient when a
plant is developed and adapted sufficiently to its setting and is able to sustain itself in its current
environment without artificial or human support.
Terrestrial riparian planting would be installed by a crew of up to eight workers for 12
hour work days. Equipment needs for riparian planting, establishment, and monitoring is
estimated to include a boat, a truck, a hedger, a tractor, and a weed whacker.
Aquatic Planting
Following dredged material placement and the 10-month settlement period, vegetation
would be installed on the sand mounds. Based on experience from the nearby Donlon Island
restoration project, the plantable zone on the placed sand mounds is assumed to be from -2.5 to +
1 feet MTL (or, -0.5 to +3 MLLW). Desirable aquatic vegetation would be planted to pioneer a
source for colonization before undesirable exotic vegetation could develop. The plant material
may be nursery grown or collected from nearby sources and directly planted at the site. For the
purposes of this analysis, it is assumed that the plant material would be nursery grown.
Bulrush (Schoenoplectus spp.) and cattail (Typha spp.) are two desirable prominent
aquatic species that are expected to colonize the mounds. Other aquatic species to be planted are
rushes, sedges and spike rushes. However, since cattail is a dominate colonizer and bulrush is
slow to colonize, bulrush will be planted to give it a head start. Ten percent of the target area
would be planted with bulrush spaced at 3 feet on center, which averages out to approximately
45 plants per acre, with natural recruitment assumed over time. Bulrush will be installed in the
mid elevation of the aquatic planting elevation zone.
Aquatic plant installation would be conducted using a crew of approximately 4 workers.
Equipment needs are estimated to require 2 boats and a truck for approximately 11 days of work
(standard daylight work hours) each planting year.
Monitoring & Adaptive Management
Riparian Plant Monitoring & Adaptive Management
Maintenance activities as part of the riparian plant establishment process would begin
after all installation is complete and would continue through the duration of the 3-year
establishment period. Watering and weeding would ensure that individual plants are kept moist
and free from competition. Mowing would ensure that the site and plants are accessible while
minimizing undesirable seedhead development and potential fire danger. Spraying would reduce
undesirable herbaceous competition, allowing the native grasses a greater opportunity to
establish. Any herbicides used would be in compliance with water quality standards.

Final Report

During the establishment period, all riparian plants would be surveyed in the fall before
they lose their leaves. All dead terrestrial plants would be identified and replaced that same fall
for the first two years of establishment. Based on historical data, it is expected that mortality
would be below 20% for each of the first two years. Replacement plants would be with the same
species that it is replacing, using the same size container as was originally planted, unless it is
determined that another species would be more appropriate to the site. Where it becomes evident
a particular species is not conducive to the site, a different species would be substituted to ensure
success.
A riparian plant survival survey would be performed at the end of each establishment
year and a report would be prepared. The report would include the monthly maintenance
records, plant survey totals, and observations and recommendations of how to improve the site.
As-builts would be prepared and kept current of what was planted, how much was planted, and
where it was planted.
A monitoring and adaptive management plan is included as Appendix D. The monitoring
plan establishes the methods and data that would be collected annually in order to determine
restoration success. In addition, adaptive management measures are proposed to address
challenges in meeting restoration success (i.e., lack of vegetative growth, increased turbidity,
etc.) Monitoring reports and records would be required to document planting processes and
progress. Since the purpose of the riparian restoration on the remnant levee is to reduce the
potential for invasive species to overtake the marsh habitat, the riparian plantings would be
monitored for the percent cover of invasive plant species versus native plant species. This
process begins at the completion of the establishment period.
Aquatic Plant Monitoring and Adaptive Management
It is anticipated that the aquatic plantings would not require maintenance. Based on past
experience on similar marsh restoration projects, the vegetation has established very quickly,
typically within one year. During the 10 year construction period, the Corps would monitor the
marsh habitat to ensure that it is performing as expected. If needed, adjustments would be made
to the construction techniques on a year-to-year basis to apply lessons learned and adapt the plan
to achieve maximum success.
The marsh habitat would be monitored following construction of each segment for 5
years to ensure success via percent cover of aquatic species. If needed, invasive plant species
would be removed during the annual monitoring period. If the habitat is not meeting the success
criteria in the timeframe anticipated, then contingency measures would be applied in order to
ensure success. This could include the installation of more plantings, or an adjustment in the
plant selection if the selected species are not conducive to the site.
Monitoring reports documenting the restoration effort would be prepared following the
first monitoring period and would continue annually until the site has met the success criteria.
These reports would include photos, the timing of the completion of the restoration, what

materials were used in the restoration, and plantings (if specified). The reports would also
document the results of the percent cover measurements, the proportional abundance of different
habitat types, and the estimated natural recruitment versus planted habitats. Recommendations
for additional adaptive management measures, as needed, would also be identified in the reports.
Operation and Maintenance
Following the establishment period, the project would be turned over to the non-Federal
sponsor for long-term operation and maintenance. The restoration site would not require
significant long-term maintenance beyond the establishment period. Soil accretion and
vegetative recruitment have historically aided plantings on restored intertidal marsh habitats.
Plantings typically survive and reach desired density within 2 years. Long term maintenance
would primarily consist of replacement of any lost habitat due to damage; however, such a
scenario is not considered to be highly likely, and it is anticipated that the habitat would be
independently successful in perpetuity.
Alternative 3 – 340 Acres of Intertidal Marsh Restoration (Selected Plan)
Alternative 3 includes Big Break Increments 1a and 1b, using O&M dredging over an
approximately 10 year period to create approximately 340 acres of intertidal marsh habitat. Of
the 340 acres, approximately 95 acres would be planted with riparian and aquatic vegetation, and
the remaining 245 acres would be shallow water habitat for aquatic fauna species. The annual
construction activities, including O&M dredging, material placement, plantings, monitoring, and
adaptive management would all be conducted consistently with the description for Alternative 2,
above, except that it would occur over a 10 year period rather than a 5 year period. Alternative 3
is the Selected Plan and is also the Environmentally Preferred Alternative, as defined in the
Clean Water Act Section 404(b)(1) Analysis (Appendix H).

CHAPTER 4.0 – AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT
This section describes the existing conditions of the environmental resources in the
project area. In Chapter 5.0, these existing conditions are compared to the with-project
conditions in order to determine the effects of the proposed project. Resources less likely to be
adversely affected by the project are described first, followed by the resources that may be
affected by the alternatives. Although all resources are subject to some change over time, most
of these resources are not expected to change significantly during the period of analysis for this
study. Thus for most of the resources in the affected environment existing conditions are
assumed in this environmental analysis to be the future without-project conditions as well.
Excepted resources which are likely to experience significant changes due to implementation of
one of the proposed alternatives include vegetation and wildlife, special status species, land use,
socioeconomics, and traffic and circulation. These resources are described in greater detail in
Section 4.2 below.

4.1

Resources Not Considered In Detail

Initial evaluation of the effects of the project indicated that there would likely be little to
no effect on several resources. These resources are discussed in Sections 4.1.1 through 4.1.5 to
add to the overall understanding of the area, and to identify why it has been determined that they
do not need to be evaluated in detail.

4.1.1

Hydrology and Hydraulics

The Delta watershed includes the tributary rivers that flow into the Delta from the
Sacramento River and the San Joaquin River basins (Figure 2-1). In general, the Delta
watershed is represented by the drainage of the Central Valley except for the Tulare Lake area.
Areas outside of the Delta that receive Delta water include Tulare Lake, San Francisco Bay,
Central Coast, and Southern California. The project area is not isolated and subject to the overall
hydrologic and hydraulic processes, both natural and human, which are present in the Delta.
Analysis of available gauge and flow data and hydrodynamic modeling results suggests
that it is highly unlikely the proposed Ecosystem Restoration (see C-4 Geotechnical and C-6
Civil Design for material and design specifics) to have a measurable increase in stage in the Big
Break area. Following the SMART Planning process and the tenants of Risk-Based Decision
Making, the risk of adverse impacts to the floodplain and the omission of detailed hydrodynamic
modeling of the with-project condition is deemed to be low by the Project Delivery Team (PDT);
this risk has been added to the Project’s Risk Register. Should more detailed study in
Preconstruction Engineering and Design suggest a necessity for detailed hydrodynamic
modeling, that modeling can be accomplished in that phase of the project.

Final Report

Delta Hydrology
The hydrologic function of the Delta involves the interaction of streamflow runoff from
the major rivers and tidal inflow of salt water from the Pacific Ocean. Two major rivers supply
the majority of the freshwater: the Sacramento River from the north and the San Joaquin River
from the south. The runoff of the Sacramento River is greater, accounting for 80 percent of the
freshwater runoff by volume. The water in the San Joaquin River and its tributaries has been
highly diverted for agricultural use, and much of the runoff is diverted upstream of the Delta. At
their junction, runoff from the Sacramento River channel near Sherman Island flows southward
to create a freshwater barrier across the mouth of the San Joaquin; without this barrier, it is
postulated that saltwater inflow to the south-central Delta would increase significantly. The
south-central delta is closer to the San Francisco Bay, hence salt water intrusion is more likely in
the event of reduced freshwater flows in this tidally influenced area. Flow in the Delta channels
can change direction as a result of tidal exchange, ebbing and flooding with the two tides per
day, which is a major factor of Delta hydrodynamics. The daily, seasonal, and year-to-year
differences in source water contributions to various locations throughout the Delta affect salinity
in the Delta (Contra Costa Water District, 2010).
Sacramento River Basin
The Sacramento River flows generally north to south from its source near Mount Shasta
to the Delta. The Sacramento River receives contributing flows from numerous major and minor
streams and rivers that drain the east and west sides of the basin, including the Feather River,
Yuba River, and American River. In addition, Putah and Cache Creeks flow into the Yolo
Bypass, which subsequently flows into the Cache Slough complex prior to entering the
Sacramento River upstream of Rio Vista. The Sacramento River basin topography ranges in
elevation from approximately 14,000 feet above sea level on Mount Shasta to approximately
1,070 feet at Shasta Dam, to sea level in the Delta. Generally, precipitation occurs in the form of
snow during winter and early spring at elevations above 5,000 feet. The snowmelt generally
occurs in April and May.
San Joaquin River Basin
The San Joaquin River originates in the Sierra Nevada and then flows west into the San
Joaquin Valley through Millerton Lake at Friant. The San Joaquin River turns north near
Mendota and flows through the San Joaquin Valley and into the Delta near Vernalis. The San
Joaquin River receives contributing flows from the Fresno, Chowchilla, Merced, Tuolumne,
Stanislaus, Calaveras, Mokelumne, and Cosumnes Rivers. The Calaveras, Mokelumne, and
Cosumnes Rivers flow into the San Joaquin River within the boundaries of the Delta. When
Kings River in the Tulare Lake hydrologic region floods, the San Joaquin River also receives
flood waters as high as 5,000 cfs from the Kings River via Fresno Slough.

Delta Island and Levees Feasibility Study

Final Report

The San Joaquin River basin topography ranges in elevation from over 10,000 feet above
sea level in the Sierra Nevada to sea level in the Delta. Generally, precipitation occurs in the
form of snow during winter and early spring at the upper elevations, and snowmelt occurs in the
late spring and early summer months. Flows in the San Joaquin River are regulated by operation
of Friant Dam, which diverts water into the CVP Friant Division. The Friant Division conveys
water in the Madera Canal to the north and the Friant‐Kern Canal to the south for irrigation and
municipal and industrial water supplies, and releases water in the San Joaquin River to meet
downstream water rights and instream flow requirements. Hydropower generation facilities in
the upper reaches of the San Joaquin River influence water flows into Millerton Lake (formed by
Friant Dam). There are numerous other diversions from the San Joaquin River associated with
the CVP and SWP that influence the river’s flows, including the Delta-Mendota Canal and the
Mendota Pool.
Delta Hydraulics
The Delta is a complex network of over 700 miles of tidally influenced channels and
sloughs. Four strong forcing mechanisms drive circulation, transport, and mixing of water in the
Delta: (1) freshwater river flow from drainages to the Delta; (2) tides from the west propagating
from the Pacific Ocean through San Francisco Bay; (3) SWP and CVP water supply facilities
operating in the Delta; and (4) collective effects of in‐Delta agricultural diversions (USGS 2005).
Influence of Delta Inflows
The Sacramento River is the primary contributor to Delta inflows. The San Joaquin
River is the second biggest contributor to Delta inflows. Finally, east side streams (Mokelumne,
Cosumnes, and Calaveras Rivers) provide inflow to Delta annually that join from east and flow
towards west.
Influence of Delta Tidal Flows
Tidal flows have a major influence on Delta hydraulics and vary with the extent of high
and low tides. On average, tidal inflows to the Delta are approximately equal to tidal outflows.
All tidal flows enter and leave the Delta along the San Joaquin River at Chipps Island. Water
levels vary greatly during each tidal cycle, from less than one foot on the San Joaquin River near
Interstate 5 to more than five feet near Pittsburg. Sea level rise is another factor that has a
notable influence on Delta hydraulics. Factors affecting sea level rise include tidal variations,
storm surges, large‐scale changes in water temperature and wind forces, and climate‐related
changes.

Delta Island and Levees Feasibility Study

Final Report

Influence of the State Water Project and Central Valley Project on Delta Operations
The withdrawal rates at the south Delta intakes influence Delta hydraulics and can
change the direction of flow of some waterways in the south Delta. The most influential effects
occur on Old and Middle Rivers. Reverse flows also occur in False River in the western Delta
and Turner Cut in the San Joaquin River.
South Delta hydraulics are influenced by several channels that have been widened or
connected and by barriers to reduce connectivity between other channels to protect agricultural
water uses or aquatic resources. Operations of these facilities affect operations of the SWP/CVP
south Delta intakes (DWR 2009a).
Influence of Delta Agricultural Diversions
There are over 1,800 diversions in the Delta area that are estimated to siphon away up to
5,000 cfs during peak summer months. Most of these diversions are related to agricultural
operations. Surface water in the Delta also is influenced by consumptive use of groundwater by
agricultural crops and by seepage from the surface water into the interior of the islands and
tracts. A substantial portion of the water diverted from the Delta or that seeps into the islands
and tracts is returned to the Delta surface water by agricultural and drainage flows and seepage
that is pumped from the islands and tracts into the Delta (DWR 2009b).
The creation of intertidal marsh habitat in the Delta estuary would not have an effect on
hydraulic or hydrologic processes. The project is very small relative to the entire Delta system.
The placement area at Big Break is hydraulically contiguous with the material source, the
Stockton DWSC. Removal of material from the DWSC and placement at Big Break would
occur in real time. By inspection, there can be no impact to water levels in the Delta at large.
Similarly, existing hydrodynamic modeling and gauge data shown in Appendix C – Engineering
show that flows through Big Break are incredibly low when compared to those of the
Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers and are virtually solely tidally influenced. The placement of
dredged material in the slackwater area of Big Break can by inspection be determined not to
affect Delta hydrodynamics at large. Because the project would only include the placement of
fill material into open waters to create intertidal marsh habitat surface water, flood plain
boundaries, flood characteristics, or flood control structures (such as levees) adjacent or
downstream of the action area are not expected to change.

Land Use and Agriculture

Land Use
Big Break is located in Contra Costa County, California. The majority of the land use
surrounding Big Break is privately owned and designated for agriculture (58%). The remaining
land uses include industrial (16%), residential (15%), recreation (5%), marina (2%) and public
education facilities (1%). Big Break is interior tidal open water area owned by the East Bay
Regional Park District as part of the East Bay Regional Shoreline.
The subsections below identify a number of land use plans that were reviewed as part of
this study. Information regarding the regulatory guidelines of these plans are discussed below;
however, it should be noted that the proposed alternatives assessed in this EIS are consistent with
the local land use plans. Restoring historical tidal marsh habitat and reversing subsidence in the
Delta is a consistent goal included in all local land use plans that incorporate the Delta region
within its policies.
Contra Costa County General Plan and Delta Land Use and Resource Management
Plan
A comprehensive update to the Contra Costa County General Plan 2005–2020 was
adopted on January 18, 2005, to guide future growth, development, and resource conservation
through 2020 (Contra Costa County 2005). Amendments to the general plan occurred in 1996
and 2005 to reflect changes to the land use map and the incorporation of the city of Oakley, and
the Housing Element was updated in 2009 (Contra Costa County 2013a).
The Contra Costa County General Plan has developed its land use policies to be
consistent with the Delta Land Use and Resource Management Plan for the Primary Zone of the
Delta at the county level. The Primary Zone lands generally are designated for agriculture or
special Delta resources in their respective general plans. The zoning codes allow a variety of
uses in the Primary Zone: agriculture and agriculturally oriented uses; outdoor recreation;
wildlife habitat; public facilities; and limited areas for commercial, industrial, and rural
residential development. The parcel sizes specified in the general plans and zoning codes range
from 5 to 160 acres, with most of the Primary Zone in the 20 to 80 acre minimum parcel sizes.
General plan policies relevant to specific resource areas (e.g., aesthetics, cultural resources,
minerals, visual resources, transportation) are discussed in the sections corresponding to those
resources.
The area within Contra Costa County potentially affected by the action alternatives is
largely agricultural and recreational. The applicable general plan policies related to agriculture
that are potentially affected by the action alternatives specifically address farmland of
importance, habitat preservation, open space creation, and providing Delta recreation
opportunities. Recreation is discussed separately in Sections 4.2.9 and 5.8.

Final Report

The Delta Plan
The Delta Plan was previously described in Section 1.5.1. The Delta Plan was developed
by the Delta Stewardship Council (DSC) and adopted on May 16, 2013. It became effective, with
legally-enforceable regulations, on September 1, 2013. It is a long-term, comprehensive
management plan designed to meet the co-equal goals of providing a more reliable water supply
for California and protecting, restoring and enhancing the Delta ecosystem. The Delta Plan
generally covers five topic areas and goals: (1) increased water supply reliability; (2) restoration
of the Delta ecosystem; (3) improved water quality; (4) reduced risks of flooding in the Delta;
and (5) protection and enhancement of the Delta. The DSC does not propose constructing,
owning or operating any facilities related to these topic areas. Rather, the Delta Plan sets forth
regulatory policies and recommendations that seek to influence the actions, activities and
projects of cities, counties, State, Federal, regional and local agencies toward meeting the goals
in the 5 topic areas.
San Francisco Estuary Project Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan
The San Francisco Estuary Project Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan
(CCMP) was developed to guide the management of the San Francisco Estuary, an estuary of
national significance established under the National Estuary Program. The San Francisco
Estuary consists of the San Francisco and Suisun Bays, the Suisun Marsh, and the Sacramento
and San Joaquin River Delta. The San Francisco Estuary program is managed by the USEPA,
State of California, and locally by the San Francisco Estuary Partnership. The CCMP presents a
blueprint to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Bay and
Delta within its urban context. The CCMP identifies five critical program areas of
environmental concern: (1) decline of biological resources; (2) pollutants; (3) freshwater
diversions and altered flow regime; (4) dredging and waterway modification; and (5) intensified
land use.
East Bay Regional Park District Master Plan
The East Bay Regional Park District (EBRPD) Master Plan (2013) establishes the
mission and vision for the EBRPD, the land owner and manager of Big Break Regional
Shoreline. The Master Plan establishes policies to guide the stewardship and development of the
Parks, with a goal of maintaining balance between resource protection and conservation and
recreation opportunities.
Big Break Land Use Plan
The Big Break Land Use Plan was prepared by the EBRPD in 2001. The purpose of the
plan was to establish appropriate resource management guidelines for protecting the habitat and
species in the Big Break area. Additionally, the plan set up the process for establishing access
and facilities at Big Break for recreational use. The Big Break Land Use Plan establishes the
94

Delta Island and Levees Feasibility Study

Final Report

need to protect the existing habitat at Big Break, but also recommends that the EBRPD consider
opportunities for marsh restoration.
The proposed alternatives involve restoring the open water habitat of sunken islands to
their historic tidal marsh condition, which would create habitat value for numerous Delta wildlife
species. The created marshlands would offer new recreation possibilities while not hindering the
existing land use practices established in the plans described above. There would be no changes
in land use policies associated with any of the proposed alternatives. All restoration work would
be consistent with local plans and policies. As a result, there would be no effect to land use and
no mitigation would be required.
Agriculture
The California Department of Conservation administers the Farmland Mapping and
Monitoring Program (FMMP) to characterize the types and amounts of agricultural land in an
area. The only agricultural lands in the action area are on Jersey Island adjacent to Big Break.
The land on Jersey Island is characterized in the FMMP as:
•

Prime farmland: Land that has the best combination of physical and chemical
characteristics for producing food, feed, fiber, forage, oilseed, and other agricultural
crops with minimum inputs of fuel, fertilizer, pesticides, and labor, and without
intolerable soil erosion (7 USC 4201[c][1][A]).

•

Additional farmland of statewide or local importance: Land identified by state or
local agencies for agricultural use, but not of national significance (7 USC
4201[c][1][C]).

The pipe used to transport dredged material from the Stockton DWSC to Big Break
would cross Jersey Island. The pipes would be placed along the existing farm road, with culverts
or other crossing designs incorporated to allow access across the pipeline so that no impacts to
important farmland would occur. Habitat restoration is not proposed on land designated as
important farmland, and no farmlands would be converted to other land uses. As a result, there
would be no impacts to agriculture and no mitigation would be required.
4.1.3

Socioeconomics and Environmental Justice

There are no populations living within the action area, including low income or minority
communities. There is one occupied farm house along the access route to Jersey Island to install
the pipeline crossing. During installation of the pipeline and any associated preconstruction
surveys, there would be a slight increase in traffic along Jersey Island Road. However, this
traffic is a minor, temporary impact and would not require any mitigation.

Final Report

The economy of the Delta is rooted in agriculture. Major crops grown in the Delta
include asparagus, pears, and grapes. Agriculture became the primary economic driver in the
Delta because of its rich, peaty soil, ample water supply, and proximity to urban markets. As
discussed above in Section 4.1.3, with the implementation of crossing locations for access over
the temporary dredged material slurry pipeline, there would be no effects to agriculture, and no
mitigation would be required.
The alternatives are located in open water sites within Big Break. Construction activities
and equipment placement would not result in disturbance to existing population centers or
individuals. Therefore the alternatives would have no disproportionate and adverse human
health or environmental effects on minority and low-income populations. The alternatives would
have no adverse effects on the local, regional, state, or national economies.

4.1.4

Noise

This section describes the existing noise environment in the study area. This includes
local, Federal, and State criteria; sources and levels of noise; and noise-sensitive land uses and
receptors. Noise can be defined as unwanted sound, and effects are interpreted in relationship to
noise level criteria for Contra Costa County.
Federal and State criteria for evaluating traffic effects on noise are contained in the
Federal Procedures for Abatement of Highway Traffic Noise and Construction Noise (23 CFR
772) and the California Department of Transportation (CalTrans) Traffic Noise Analysis
Protocol dated October 1998. The Category B criterion in these documents applies to residences,
churches, schools, recreation areas and similar uses, and is an hourly sound level that approaches
or exceeds 67 dBA Leq. There are no criteria for undeveloped land or construction noise. The
Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and Caltrans consider traffic to have an effect on
noise if predicted peak-hour traffic noise levels approach or exceed the noise abatement criteria.
Caltrans defines “approach or exceed” as noise levels within 1 dBA of noise abatement criterion,
meaning 66 dBA for Category B. In addition to the criterion sound levels described above, the
FHWA and Caltrans consider traffic to have an effect on noise predicted sound levels
"substantially" exceed existing noise levels. Caltrans defines "substantial" as an increase of 12
dBA over existing peak-hour noise levels. Caltrans and FHWA policies dictate that noise
abatement measures must be considered when effects on noise are identified.
The Noise Element of the Contra Costa County General Plan (2005-2020) contains
guidelines for Land use Compatibility for Community Noise Environments. Guidelines that
would be relevant to the Delta Study include:
•

If an area is currently below the maximum "normally acceptable" noise level, an
increase in noise up to the maximum should not be allowed necessarily.

Final Report

•

Public projects shall be designed and constructed to minimize long-term noise
impacts on existing residents.

•

Construction activities shall be concentrated during the hours of the day that are not
noise-sensitive for adjacent land uses and should be commissioned to occur during
normal work hours of the day to provide relative quiet during the more sensitive
evening and early morning periods.

Noise sources in Big Break are primarily related to recreational boat use and agricultural
activities on Jersey Island. Land uses near project components are primarily rural. As such,
existing noise levels are in the range of 40 to 50 dBA. The only noise associated with project
activities are from the pumps transporting dredged material through the pipeline and from the
dredged material being directly placed in the restoration site. Temporary increases in ambient
noise would be minimal, would not reach regulatory levels, and would not harm wildlife. There
would be a temporary impact to the one farm house on Jersey Island, as worker vehicles would
pass the house to access the staging area; however, this effect would not raise noise levels above
regulatory levels and therefore would not be considered an effect.

4.1.5

Hazardous, Toxic, and Radiological Waste

Naturally Occurring Hazards
Historic geologic conditions in the study area have led to the formation of peat and other
organic soils with thicknesses of up to approximately 55 feet on the western side of the Delta;
peat deposits are not commonly found on the eastern side. The thick organic soils and peat have
the potential to generate flammable gases such as methane that can pose hazards to workers
during deep excavations and tunneling.
Hazards from Agricultural Practices
Agriculture has been the primary land use in the study area for more than a century.
Approximately 538,000 acres of the 738,000 acres of agriculture land potentially affect the
waters adjacent to the project areas.
A wide variety of pesticides, including insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides, have been
used throughout the agricultural lands surrounding the project area for decades; and those
chemicals still may be present in and near agricultural lands. While some pesticides that were
used in 1974 were still in use in 2008 (e.g., sulfur, petroleum oils, 1,3‐dichloropropene, diuron,
and carbaryl), a number of new pesticides, such as chloropicrin, chlorpyrifos and propanil, are
available and in use currently. Notably, a number of pesticides prevalently used in the 1970s are
no longer prevalently used: dinoseb, chlordane, dibromochloropropane, ethylene dibromide,
parathion, and toxaphene.

Delta Island and Levees Feasibility Study

Final Report

The wide variety of pesticides that has been applied, the numerous crops grown in the
region, and the fact that predominant land use across the Delta supports agriculture indicate that
pesticides and their residues are likely to be found in the soils throughout the Delta. No
comprehensive area‐wide soil or sediment sampling program is known to have been conducted to
evaluate pesticide residues from agricultural use.
Hazards from Historical Mercury Mining
Mercury has been identified as a chemical of concern in Delta area sediments, resulting
from gold and mercury mining operations in the watersheds upstream of the Delta. Mercury was
used extensively upstream of the study area in mining to extract gold from ores and placer gravel
deposits. Mercury released into the environment by historic gold mining practices has been
flowing into the study area via water, primarily from the Sacramento River watershed, and
sediments since the mid‐1800s and is expected to continue to enter the study area. An unknown
amount of mercury is present in sediments within the project area, but estimates of mercury
flowing into the Delta area, mainly associated with suspended sediment (Alpers et al. 2008),
range from approximately 200–400 kg/yr (CVRWQCB 2008).
Urban, Residential, and Recreational Land Use
In general, hazardous materials released from cities and towns are associated with
stormwater runoff and primarily affect water bodies. Cities and towns account for
approximately 9% of the total study area. Urban stormwater discharges are generally
characterized by varying levels of metals and hydrocarbons that can accumulate in river
sediments over time. Historically, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have been associated with
urban discharge, and these contaminants have been detected in fish tissues in San Francisco Bay.
Urban areas have many facilities with the potential for hazardous materials releases,
including gas stations, dry cleaners, automotive repair facilities, and, in larger towns,
manufacturing facilities. Stockton, for example, has large shipping and port facilities, as well as
Federal facilities with a history of hazardous materials use, storage, and releases. Antioch and
Oakley, located on the south side of the San Joaquin River near the project areas, have major
power‐producing facilities and several active or former industrial facilities with known
groundwater impacts. Possible contaminants of concern from urban land uses are extensive, but
the most common contaminants in soil and groundwater are petroleum and associated
compounds (typically gasoline and diesel releases from USTs as the source), chlorinated solvents
and degreasers (from dry cleaning and vehicle repair facilities), and various heavy metals, such
as arsenic and lead. Marinas typically include bulk fuel storage and overwater fueling, various
boat repair/maintenance facilities, stores, boat storage, and camping facilities. Typical chemicals
associated with marinas include fuels, lubricants, cleaners, anti‐fouling paints, and fiberglass
components.

Final Report

Project construction activities are not expected to disturb existing hazardous, toxic, and
radiological waste (HTRW) sources that could lead to contamination of environmental resources.
The placement of material into the sites would not cause disruption of the areas under the sites
because placement would be directly on top of the existing soil. Additionally, the pipes that
would carry any material to the placement sites would be placed directly on top of existing land
or floated on the surface of the water and not disturb any bed material. The dredged material
being used to create intertidal marsh habitat would be tested prior to any processing of the
material. Only material meeting baseline criteria would be used and therefore no affects to
HTRW would occur from use or transport of this material. Because no HTRW material or sites
would be affected by the project, no impacts to HTRW would occur with implementation of the
project.

4.2

Resources Considered in Detail

Sections 4.2.1 through 4.2.10 describe the Federal Regulations and existing conditions
for those resources that are more likely to be affected by implementation of the proposed
alternatives.

4.2.1

Geologic Resources
Regulatory Setting
There are no Federal laws established that are applicable to this study.
Affected Environment
Geology

The Delta and Suisun Marsh lie within California’s Central Valley, which is
approximately 465 miles long and 40 to 60 miles wide. The valley is bounded by the Sierra
Nevada on the east and the Coast Ranges on the west. Paleogeographic reconstructions of this
region indicate that Miocene sedimentation was similar to a modern fore-arc basin (a sea floor
depression between a subduction zone and an associated volcanic arc), shedding arkosic
(granular quartz and feldspar or mica), and volcanoclastic sediments westward from the
continent. In the mid-Pliocene Epoch, a shift in plate tectonics triggered uplift of the Coast
Ranges, which gradually closed the southern marine outlet to the basin. By the late Pliocene,
sub-aerial conditions prevailed throughout the valley, resulting from marine regression (i.e.,
when the oceans were regressing seaward over land) and sedimentation from the west. During
Pleistocene Epoch, the valley separated from the Pacific Ocean and developed internal drainage,
the modern outlet being the Carquinez Strait, through which the Sacramento River flows to the
San Francisco Bay (Lettis and Unruh 1991).

Delta Island and Levees Feasibility Study

Final Report

The historical Delta evolved at the inland margin of the San Francisco Bay Estuary as
two overlapping geomorphic units. The Sacramento River Delta comprises about 30 percent of
the total area and was influenced by the interaction of rising sea level and river floods that
created channels, natural levees, and marsh plains. During large river flood events, silts and
sands were deposited adjacent to the river channel, forming natural levees above the marsh plain.
In contrast, the larger San Joaquin River Delta—located in the central and southern portions of
the Delta and having relatively small flood flows and low sediment supply—formed as an
extensive, unleveed freshwater tidal marsh dominated by tidal flows and organic soil (peat and
muck) accretion (Atwater and Belknap 1980). Because the San Joaquin River Delta had less
well defined levees, sediments were deposited more uniformly across the floodplain during high
water, creating an extensive tule marsh with many small branching tributary channels. As a
result of the differential amounts of inorganic sediment supply, the peats and mucks of the San
Joaquin River Delta grade northward into peaty mud and then into mud as it approaches the
natural levees and flood basins of the Sacramento River Delta (Atwater and Belknap 1980). The
proposed alternatives are small-scale ER projects that would restore the proposed locations to
historic conditions. As a result, the project would have no effect on the geologic features in the
project area.
Soils
Soils in the study area are extremely variable in texture and chemical composition. The
soil composition of the islands surrounding the study are a combination of peat beds in the center
of islands with relatively coarse textured inorganic sediments deposited in the channels and
along the margins of the islands. Soils in perimeter marsh areas around islands are comprised of
peat beds that accumulated and were preserved under anoxic conditions (lack the presence of
oxygen). In contrast, soils in channels and along the higher energy channel margins of islands
tend to be comprised primarily of mineral sediment. The peat soils have been largely drained,
resulting in oxidation of organic matter and subsequent large‐scale land subsidence on Delta
islands (Deverel, S. J., and S. Rojstaczer. 1996). The soils that would be used as part of the
proposed alternatives are dredged materials that originate from the waterways within the study
area. Reusing this soil to create intertidal marsh habitat would not have any impact on the
existing soils in the study area.
Seismicity
The California Coast Ranges physiographic province lies along the complex boundary
between two tectonic plates: the North American Plate and the Pacific Plate. The geologic and
tectonic conditions in the Delta and Suisun Marsh have been, and continue to be, controlled
primarily by the interaction of these two massive blocks of the Earth’s crust. Under the current
tectonic regime, the Pacific Plate moves northwestward relative to the North American Plate at a
rate of about 1.57 inches (40 millimeters) per year (Working Group on California Earthquake
Probabilities 2003). Although relative motion between these two plates is predominantly lateral
(strike-slip), an increase in convergent motion along the plate boundary within the past few
million years has resulted in the formation of mountain ranges and structural valleys of the Coast
Ranges province.

Delta Island and Levees Feasibility Study

Final Report

The San Andreas Fault system dominates the seismicity of the region, and it comprises
several major faults including the San Andreas, Hayward–Rodgers Creek, Calaveras, Concord–
Green Valley, and Greenville faults. In addition to these major faults, many other named and
unnamed regional faults accommodate relative motion between the plates and relieve
compression stresses that also act along the plate boundary.
The Delta and Suisun Marsh are in the eastern portion of the greater San Francisco Bay
region, one of the most seismically active areas in the United States. Since 1800, several
earthquakes with magnitudes greater than 6.5 have occurred in the immediate San Francisco Bay
Area, including the 1868 magnitude 6.8 earthquake on the Hayward Fault, the 1906 magnitude
7.9 San Francisco earthquake on the San Andreas Fault, and the more recent 1989 magnitude 6.9
Loma Prieta earthquake that occurred in the Santa Cruz Mountains.
The proposed alternatives are small-scale ER projects in rural areas. There are no
permanent structures associated with the proposed alternatives that would require compliance
with State seismic laws and regulations. Since the proposed restoration area at Big Break is
approximately 50 miles inland from the Pacific Ocean it is highly unlikely to be impacted by a
tsunami resulting from a major earthquake. Additionally the Big Break area is not in a
California Department of Conservation Tsunami Inundation Hazard Zone (CDC, 2018). Wave
wash erosion, which could result from earthquake ground shaking, has been accounted for in the
project designs. As a result, the proposed alternatives would not be impacted by seismicity
within the project area.
Topography
Soils formed in the Delta as the result of geologic processes over approximately the past
7,000 years. These processes produced landward accumulation of sediment behind the bedrock
barrier at the Carquinez Strait, forming marshlands comprising approximately 100 islands that
were surrounded by hundreds of miles of channels (Weir 1950). Generally, mineral soils formed
near the channels during flood conditions and organic soils formed on marsh island interiors as
plant residues accumulated faster than they could decompose.
Prior to the mid‐1800s, the Delta was a vast marsh and floodplain, under which peat soils
developed to a thickness of up to 30 feet in many areas (Weir 1950), with a thickness of
approximately 55 feet in the vicinity of Sherman Island (Real and Knudsen 2009). The tidal
portion of the Delta consisted of backwater areas, tidal sloughs, and a network of channels that
supported highly productive freshwater tidal marsh and other wetland habitats (CALFED Bay‐
Delta Program 2000).
In the mid to late 1800s, much of the Delta was reclaimed for agricultural use, including
the study area. Big Break was once a leveed estate, with the levees believed to have been
constructed sometime between 1876 and 1910. There are records indicating that Big Break was
in agricultural use and that asparagus was grown there in the 1920s. However, the levee broke in
1921 and Big Break was flooded. There are some records indicating that the entire area did not

all flood immediately, but by 1928 when the levees broke again, no further agricultural
production occurred on the land (EBRPD 2018).
Today, Big Break has subsided to approximately 3 to 4 feet below MTL. The area is
open shallow water that is tidally influenced. The only remaining terrestrial land is the remnant
levees along the northern edge of Big Break adjacent to Jersey Island.

4.2.2

Aesthetics
Regulatory Setting
There are no Federal or State laws regulating aesthetics.
Affected Environment

The statutory Delta encompasses 738,000 acres and consists of largely undeveloped
islands and low-lying tracts of land surrounded by waterways and levees. Historically, more than
40% of the state’s runoff flowed to the Delta through the Sacramento, San Joaquin, and
Mokelumne Rivers (California DWR 1993). In addition to the natural waterways, the area
contains a variety of water development facilities such as levees, aqueducts, and intake
structures. The construction of levees resulted in the conversion of wetlands, riparian corridors,
and open water to agricultural lands characterized by elevated and vegetated levees surrounding
low-lying areas of farmland. Construction of these levees, completed before World War II, also
allowed for urbanization, commercial shipping to the Ports of Stockton and West Sacramento,
recreational boating, and marina development within the Delta (SacDelta 2009).
Lands contributing to the visual resources of the study area include waterways, recreation
areas, agricultural production, wildlife refuges and preserves, marinas, and shoreline recreation
facilities.
Agricultural lands account for the primary land use in the Delta. The extensive tracts of
agricultural land shape the Delta’s visual character. A wide mixture of crops, land management
practices, and agricultural infrastructure create a pastoral visual landscape composed of a variety
of colors, textures, and views from different distances. Vegetation, agricultural crops, and land
use patterns vary according to the time of year and farming activities. For instance, a particular
field may be fallow through winter and early spring and yet exhibit substantial vegetative growth
through summer. Often stubble or crop remnant can be seen in fall after harvest.
Approximately 1,000 miles of waterways traverse the Delta, making them a defining and
dominant feature of the landscape (Delta Science Center 2009a). Many of the waterways follow
natural courses, while others have been constructed for navigation, flood control, water supply,
and drainage. The predominant features constraining and defining these waterways are artificial
levees. The Delta’s waterways are unique in their diversity and wide range of distribution and
abundance, adding substantially to the region’s visual characteristics. Most Delta waterways

Delta Island and Levees Feasibility Study

Final Report

have a general scenic quality that attracts and contributes to varied types of recreation. The three
general types of Delta waterway visual landscapes consist of open river, channels and sloughs,
and marsh.
The open river is a visual landscape dominated by a singular, expansive waterway. This
landscape type is a common sight along Delta roadways that closely parallel the Sacramento and
other rivers and offer views of the river corridor. In the study area where former islands have
been inundated (Big Break), the open-river landscape expands broadly, creating an open-water
visual landscape. Numerous channels and sloughs wind through the Delta as the large
Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers mingle with smaller rivers that drain the Sierra Nevada and
Coast Ranges (Delta Science Center 2009b). Sloughs meander through the landscape in a
curvilinear fashion, while engineered waterways that have been channelized and diverted for
agriculture and water conveyance tend to carve straighter paths. The marsh landscape type
consists of intermixed open water and wetland vegetation. It is characterized by fluctuating water
levels and/or seasonal flooding from tidal action, rain, and management actions.
The greater Delta study area includes a number of public parks, conservation areas, and
other areas of scenic importance. However, in the action area, the only aesthetic resource of this
type is Big Break Regional Park. There are no designated Wild and Scenic Rivers in the study
area.

4.2.3

Vegetation and Wildlife

This section describes the existing vegetation, wildlife, and habitats which occur in the
study area. Biological resources such as plants and animals are important because they influence
ecosystem functions and values, have intrinsic value, and are subject to a number of statutory
and regulatory requirements.
Regulatory Setting
Federal
Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act. The Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act (FWCA)
requires USACE to coordinate with the USFWS on water resources development projects to
obtain their views toward preservation of fish and wildlife resources and mitigation of
unavoidable impacts.
Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) and EO 13186, Conservation of Migratory Birds.
The MBTA states that it is unlawful to kill, capture, collect, possess, buy, sell, trade, or transport
any migratory bird, nest, young, feather, or egg in part or in whole, without a Federal permit
issued in accordance with the MBTA’s policies and regulations. Under EO 13186, Federal
agencies are directed to evaluate the impacts of their actions on migratory birds in NEPA
documents and to conserve migratory birds, giving priority to species of concern (listed by
USFWS), and their important habitats.

EO 13112, Invasive Species. Dated February 3, 1999, this EO directs Federal agencies to
expand and coordinate their efforts to combat the introduction and spread of “invasive species”
(i.e., noxious plants and animals not native to the U.S.). Non-native flora and fauna can cause
significant changes to ecosystems, upset ecological processes and relationships, and cause harm
to our nation’s agricultural and recreational sectors. Those species that are likely to harm the
environment, human health, or economy are of particular concern.
National Estuary Program. The National Estuary Program was created by Congress in
the 1987 amendments to the Clean Water Act. The Program consists of 28 local estuary
programs, managed Federally by the USEPA, with a focus of improving the waters, habitats, and
living resources of estuaries of national significance. The National Estuary Program is a nonregulatory program. The San Francisco Estuary, consisting of the San Francisco and Suisun
Bays, the Suisun Marsh, and the Sacramento and San Joaquin River Delta, is one such estuary.
The San Francisco Estuary program is managed by the USEPA, State of California, and locally
by the San Francisco Estuary Partnership. Management of the estuary is guided by the San
Francisco Estuary Project Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan (CCMP), which
includes an action plan to manage the resources of the San Francisco Estuary.
Affected Environment
Big Break was historically tidal marsh before levees were constructed to reclaim the land
for agriculture. Big Break’s lands then became submerged when the levees failed. Before land
reclamation for agriculture and flood control activities around the turn of the 20th century, the
Delta supported a complex network of rivers and sloughs with in-channel islands and vast
expanses of tidal marsh. Much of the vegetation of the Delta (approximately 380,000 acres;
1,538 square kilometers) was dominated by tidal marshes (Atwater 1980; Institute 1998). By
1930, island reclamation was complete, and by 1980, only about 16,000 acres (65 square
kilometers) of marshes remained (Atwater 1980; The Bay Institute 1998). Today, these areas of
former tidal marshes consist primarily of channelized waterways surrounding highly productive
row-cropped agricultural islands that are protected from flooding by over 1,300 miles (2,093
kilometers) of levees.
Despite the loss of more than 95 percent of historic tidal marsh habitat in the Delta (The
Bay Institute 1998), fish and wildlife diversity is high, with an estimated 200 species of birds, 55
species of fish, 22 species of reptiles, 58 species of mammals, and 9 species of amphibians
occurring in the Delta (California DWR et al. 2013).
Freshwater intertidal marsh is the vegetation type and habitat proposed for restoration
under the current alternatives. Other planning efforts in the Delta are also underway, including
the Delta Vision Strategic Plan, the Delta Plan, the California WaterFix (formerly BDCP), and
California EcoRestore, to restore tidal marsh and improve the ecological health of the Bay-Delta
Ecosystem. The proposed Dutch Slough Tidal Restoration Project, adjacent to and east of Big
Break, will restore tidal wetlands and other habitats on 1,166 acres of land owned by DWR in
eastern Contra Costa County near Oakley. The former dairy lands were slated for residential

development, but were instead purchased by the State so that declining natural habitats of the
Delta could be restored to the site. Restoration at Big Break and Dutch Slough would in
combination create a large continuous block of restored habitat which would be important for
dispersal of plant and wildlife populations and those species requiring large habitat blocks.
General Description of Habitat Types in the Study Area
This section describes the habitat types in the project area and the wildlife that occupy
these habitats. The description of existing conditions is based on a literature review, field visits,
and coordination with resource agencies.
Tidal Perennial Aquatic
The tidal perennial aquatic natural community is the dominant habitat cover type within
the flooded islands. This aquatic community in the Delta is identified as deep water aquatic
(greater than 10 feet MLLW), shallow aquatic (less than or equal to 10 feet MLLW) and nonvegetated intertidal (mudflat) zones of estuarine bays, river channels, and sloughs (CALFED
Bay-Delta Program 2000). However, the only habitat that is present in the immediate project
area is shallow aquatic habitat with a shallow band of emergent vegetation and an
upland/riparian combination located on the remnant levee. Under present water operation
conditions in the project area, tidal perennial aquatic is mainly freshwater, with brackish and
saline conditions occurring at times of high tides and low freshwater inflows.
Vegetation. The tidal perennial aquatic natural community is largely unvegetated. Where
vegetation exists, it can be separated into two categories: submerged aquatic vegetation and
floating vegetation (both rooted and non-rooted) (Cowardin et al. 1979). The geographic extent
of this vegetation is highly dynamic because it is largely dependent on physical factors that are
highly variable, such as depth, turbidity, water flow, salinity, substrate, and nutrient with a
nitrogen fixing bacteria that lives within its tissues (Armstrong 1979). Invasive water hyacinth
(Eichhornia crassipes) grows in dense mats that can have harmful effects on native fish and
plant species.
Wildlife. Zooplankton in the foodweb of the tidal perennial aquatic natural community
consume phytoplankton and detritus, and are fed upon by other consumers, such as fish and
macroinvertebrates. Water salinity is a major factor that influences the distribution of
zooplankton species in the tidal perennial aquatic natural community. In the brackish portions of
the project area, calanoid copepods (Calanoida spp.), and cyclopoid copepods are the primary
zooplankton species, and mysid shrimp (Mysida spp.) is the dominant macrozooplankton. In
freshwater regions, cladocerans (Cladocera) and calanoid copepods are the dominant
zooplankton present (Kimmerer and Orsi 1996; Kimmerer 2004; Gewant and Bollens 2005;
Winder and Jassby 2010). It is used as habitat by fish for foraging, spawning, egg incubation
and larval development, juvenile nursery areas, and migratory corridors. Most species spend
their entire lives in the community while others may spend certain seasons or part of their lives
in habitats outside of the tidal perennial aquatic natural community depending on the state of
physical factors such as salinity, turbidity, dissolved oxygen (DO), flow rates, and water
105

temperature. The terrestrial species known to forage in tidal perennial aquatic habitat include
Townsend’s big-eared bat (Corynorhinus townsendii), California least tern (Sterna antillarum
browni), and giant garter snake (Thamnophis gigas).
In addition to its value as habitat for fish, the tidal perennial aquatic natural community
provides reproduction, feeding, and resting habitat for many species of mammals and birds.
Open water areas supply habitat for rest and foraging by water birds, especially during heavy
winter storms when open coastal waters become rough. Bird species that use the inland open
water include loons (Gavia spp.), gulls (Laridae spp.), cormorants (Phalacrocoracidae), and
diving ducks (Aythyinae) (CALFED Bay-Delta Program 2000).
Tidal Freshwater Emergent Wetland
The tidal freshwater emergent wetland natural community is typically a transitional
community between the tidal perennial aquatic, and valley/foothill riparian and various terrestrial
upland communities across a range of hydrologic and edaphic conditions. In the study area, the
tidal freshwater emergent wetland natural community often occurs at the shallow, slow-moving
or stagnant edges of freshwater waterways in the intertidal zone and is subject to frequent long
duration flooding.
The tidal freshwater emergent wetland natural community is distributed in narrow,
fragmented bands along island levees, in-channel islands, shorelines, sloughs, and shoals.
Channelization, levee building, removal of vegetation to stabilize levees, and upstream flood
management have also reduced the extent of this community and altered its ecological function
through changes to flooding frequency, inundation duration, and quantity of alluvial material
deposition.
The tidal freshwater emergent wetland natural community occurs along a hydrologic
gradient in the transition zone between open water and riparian vegetation or upland terrestrial
vegetation such as grasslands or woodlands. In the project area, there are often abrupt transitions
to agricultural habitats and managed wetland natural communities and also along the boundaries
formed by levees and other artificial landforms. The environmental conditions that support the
tidal freshwater emergent wetland natural community are dynamic with frequent flooding
disturbances and geomorphologic changes (i.e., alluvial deposition and scouring). Its constituent
species composition and ecosystem functions are consequently variable in space and time (The
Bay Institute 1998). As a result of the different sources of variability and the anthropogenically
restricted area in which it can occur, the community vegetation may be distributed in small
patches or in occasional large areas.
Soils underlying the tidal freshwater emergent wetland natural community are heavily
influenced by inundation period, water flow, and alluvial deposition. They are hydric soils and
when mineral based, their texture can vary from clay to sand; and when based on organic
material, can form peat beds (Goman and Wells 2000; Hitchcock et al. 2005; Drexler et al.
2009a). The soils are typically anaerobic due to frequent or permanent saturation with slow
decomposition rates resulting in the accumulation of organic debris in various stages of
106

Sacramento District

Delta Island and Levees Feasibility Study

Final Report

decomposition. The composition of the vegetation is limited to relatively few dominant species
that are tolerant of inundation and anaerobic soil conditions and typically are not tolerant of
saline or brackish conditions (Holland and Keil 1995).
Although the project area at Big Break provides adequate habitat for emergent wetlands,
there is not any significant source of this habitat type within the Big Break area. However, if
successful, the proposed alternatives would provide this habitat type, therefore it is still discussed
in detail in this analysis.
Vegetation. The tidal freshwater emergent wetland natural community is characterized
by erect herbaceous hydrophytes (Holland and Keil 1995). The typical vegetation of this type, as
mapped by CDFW and adopted for vegetation mapping purposes, is dominated by tall, perennial
monocots that reproduce by seed as well as vegetatively through rhizomes. However, the CDFW
vegetation classification was based on vegetation structure and species composition and did not
consider ecosystem functions such as location within or above the intertidal region along
drainages. In many areas of what is functionally tidal freshwater emergent wetland, woody
species, especially willows (Salix spp.), occur in the intertidal region and co-dominate the
vegetation (Atwater 1980; Watson 2006; EDAW 2007a; Watson and Byrne 2009). These
intertidal areas with woody vegetation were not distinguishable in the CDFW data set.
Cattails dominate the vegetation of this community along the Sacramento River; while
throughout the San Joaquin River area, bulrushes, tules, and common reed are more often the
dominant species (Atwater 1980; Watson 2006; EDAW 2007a; Hickson and Keeler-Wolf 2007;
Watson and Byrne 2009). In the far western portion of the Delta, where tidal waters are
generally fresh but may be brackish during periods of low outflow, saltgrass (Distichlis spicata)
becomes common (Boul and Keeler-Wolf 2008). Numerous native and nonnative dicots and
rooted aquatics also commonly occur in the tidal freshwater emergent wetland natural
community.
Wildlife. The tidal freshwater emergent wetland natural community provides productive
habitat for wildlife. Its vegetation and associated waterways provide food and cover for
numerous species of birds (e.g., waterfowl, wading birds), mammals, reptiles, emergent aquatic
insects, and amphibians. Fish such as salmonid species use tidal freshwater emergent wetland
habitat for foraging, juvenile rearing, and refugia. Terrestrial species that rely on tidal freshwater
emergent wetland for habitat include Townsend’s big-eared bat, California black rail (Laterallus
jamaicensis), Suisun song sparrow (Melospiza melodia), tricolored blackbird (Agelaius tricolor),
giant garter snake, western pond turtle (Actinemys marmorata), California red-legged frog (Rana
draytonii), delta mudwort (Limosella australis), Delta tule pea (Lathrus jepsonii), Mason’s
lilaeopsis (Lilaeopsis masonii), and Suisun marsh aster (Symphyotrichum lentum).
Although the remaining areas of tidal freshwater emergent wetlands in the project area
are highly altered, they remain critical wintering grounds for migratory birds. A small number of
wetland associated species, such as waterfowl and egrets, have successfully adapted to foraging
on some types of croplands that were converted from historical wetland areas (CDFG 2005).
Many of the species of fish that use the tidal perennial aquatic natural community for habitat will

also use the tidal freshwater emergent wetland natural community as habitat. Younger stages
(e.g., larvae and fry) of some salmonid species rear in shallow waters that support emergent
vegetation. Many fish species use emergent vegetation as refuge from predation and high flows
(Bay Institute 1998).
Existing Vegetation Types in the Project Area
The dominant vegetation types in the project area include emergent tidal marsh, riparian
scrub/woodland, and submerged and floating aquatic vegetation. Big Break is currently
characterized by vast expanses of open water habitat. Although Big Break has been flooded for
a number of years, it has not accumulated enough sediment to support the reestablishment and
expansion of tidal marsh vegetation. Vegetation cover types for the Big Break area is shown on
Figures 4-1.
Big Break is subject to daily tidal fluctuations and is at a sufficient distance from the Bay
that the tidal waters inundating this area have minimal salinity levels. A remnant levee runs
along the northern border of the area. Riparian scrub vegetation dominated by arroyo willow and
Himalayan blackberry (Rubus armeniacus) grows along the upper portions of this levee, but the
lower elevations of the levee support a low cover of tidal marsh vegetation. Extensive stands of
perennial emergent marsh are present within the open water habitat. Different elevations have
created a mosaic of emergent species in this perennial freshwater marsh with common threesquare in shallowly inundated areas, cattail and tule in deeper waters, and California bulrush
(Schoenoplectus californicus) in the deepest waters (Vollmar 2000).
Flats along the shore support large stands of arroyo willow scrub. Riparian habitats also
support small stands of tree species such as Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii),
Goodding’s willow (Salix gooddingii), northern California black walnut (Juglans hindsii), coast
live oak (Quercus agrifolia), California wild rose (Rosa californica) and red alder (Alnus rubra).
A portion of the Big Break study area supports upland habitat. This upland area is
located in the southwestern corner of the study area and primarily supports alkali grassland.
Alkali grassland is dominated by perennial grasses including saltgrass and creeping wildrye
(Leymus tritcoides). Associated species are predominantly nonnative annual grasses and forbs
such as perennial pepperweed (Lepidium), wild oats (Avena fatua), ripgut brome (Bromus
diandrus), telegraph weed (Heterotheca grandiflora), and spring vetch (Vicia sativa).

Other upland habitats present at this location include nonnative tree stands and disturbed or
developed areas. The scattered stands of nonnative trees are dominated by black locust (Robina
pseudoacacia), tree of heaven (Ailanthus altissima), and white poplar (Populus alba). Isolated
individual trees are predominantly nonnative species such as eucalyptus (Eucalyptus globulus) and
tamarisk (Tamarix). Disturbed/developed areas are dominated by nonnative and invasive plant species
or support buildings and/or paved roads. Infestations of Egeria and water hyacinth are present within
the extensive open water habitat of Big Break.

Special Status Species

This section describes special status species that either occur or have the potential to occur in the
project area that may be potentially impacted by the project.
Regulatory Setting
Federal
Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 668-668c)
This Act provides protections for bald and golden eagles and requires a permit from the
Secretary of the Interior for any actions that may result in take of these species. The Act defines “take”
as “pursue, shoot, shoot at, poison, wound, kill, capture, trap, collect, molest, or disturb”. This Act also
covers impacts that result from human alterations initiated around previously used nest sites.
Federal Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.)
The FESA requires that any action authorized by a Federal agency not be likely to jeopardize the
continued existence of a threatened or endangered species, or result in the destruction or adverse
modification of habitat of such species that is determined to be critical. Section 7 of the FESA, as
amended, requires Federal agencies to consult with the USFWS and NMFS to ensure that project actions
do not jeopardize the continued existence of endangered or threatened species, or result in the
destruction or adverse modification of the critical habitat of these species.
Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16 U.S.C. §703-712)
This act implements treaties that the United States has signed with a number of countries to
protect birds that migrate across national borders. The act makes unlawful the taking, possessing,
pursing, capturing, transporting, or selling of any migratory bird, its nest or its eggs.

Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801) (MagnusonStevens Act)
The Magnuson-Stevens Act establishes a management system for national marine and estuarine
fishery resources. This legislation requires that all Federal agencies consult with the NMFS regarding
all actions or proposed action permitted, funded, or undertaken that my adversely affect “essential fish
habitat”. Essential fish habitat (EFH) is defined as “waters and substrate necessary to fish for spawning,
breeding, feeding, or growth to maturity.” The legislation states that migratory routes to and from
anadromous fish spawning grounds are considered EFH. The phrase “adversely affect” refers to the
creation of any impact that reduces the quantity or quality of EFH.
Affected Environment
Information on special status species that may be affected by the project was gathered from
various sources:
•

The USFWS online services species list (USFWS, accessed on 19 March 2018); and

•

CDFW’s California Natural Diversity Database (CDFW 2018).

The USFWS query was run using the Information for Planning and Consultation (IPaC) system
based off of a polygon of the project area. The query has been run a number of times over the course of
the study including in September 2011, August 2016, January 2018, and May 2018. The database query
from CDFW was done using the CNDDB system based off of all species occurring in Contra Costa
County. The resulting queries are included in Appendix G. All lists were reviewed; habitat preferences
for each species were compared with the affected areas and project site description. Those Federally
listed special status species known to occur, or with suitable habitat, in or near the project area are
identified in Table 4-1 and discussed in detail below.
The following species were identified on the IPaC list, but were eliminated from consideration
under this study. The reasons for their elimination are also listed below.
•

Clapper Rail: Habitat for the clapper rail is salt marsh found directly along the coast and the San
Francisco and Suisun Bays. The inland freshwater portion of the Delta does not provide suitable
habitat for this species.

•

California Red-legged frog: The frog spends most of their lives in and near sheltered backwaters
of ponds, marshes, springs, streams, and reservoirs. Deep pools with dense stands of
overhanging willows and an intermixed fringe of cattails are considered optimal habitat. This is
distinctly not the habitat found in Big Break.

•

California Tiger salamander: The salamander’s habitat is restricted to grasslands and low
foothills with pools or ponds that are necessary for breeding. The habitat within the project area
is tidal open water, tidal marsh and edge riparian, and is not suitable for this species.

Final Report

In addition to the above species that were identified on the IPaC list, but would not be affected
by the proposed alternatives, the San Francisco Bay-Delta Distinct Population Segment (DPS) of the
longfin smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthys) was not identified on the IPaC list, but has the potential to occur
in the action area and has the potential to be affected by the proposed alternatives. The longfin smelt is
a candidate species under the FESA, which means that it does not currently have protections under the
Act, but assessing potential effects to this species is encouraged and recommended under NEPA. The
longfin smelt tend to be more associated with the San Francisco Bay than with the freshwater portion of
the Delta; however, there have been occurrences of longfin smelt entrainment during O&M dredging.
While there is the potential for construction of the proposed alternatives to impact longfin smelt, this
species is very similar in habitat requirements and potential impacts from the action to the Delta smelt;
therefore the below description for Delta smelt habitat and the impact assessment for Delta smelt in
Chapter 5 are both applicable to this species as well. Longfin smelt is not discussed further in this
document as a result.
Special Status Plant Species
The Delta is home to many plant species, many of which are endemic. One Federally listed
special status plant species has been reported in the Big Break project area (Table 4-1). The records
search of CNDDB (2018) reports populations of the Antioch Dunes evening-primrose (Oenothera
deltoides ssp. howellii) at or in the vicinity of Big Break. There were number of plant species that were
listed in the CNDDB database query; however, the only Federally listed species is the Antioch Dunes
evening-primrose. Information on these additional species is in Appendix G.
Special Status Wildlife Species
Eight special-status wildlife species were identified from database queries and literature searches
as having potential to occur in the study area (Table 4-1). Out of the eight Federally listed species that
have the potential to occur in the project area, most of these species were eliminated from further
consideration since the alternatives are outside of the species range or no suitable habitat is present. The
species that have the potential to occur are further discussed below.
Valley Elderberry Longhorn Beetle
Status. The valley elderberry longhorn beetle (Desmocerus californicus dimorphus) (VELB) is
Federally listed threatened is Federally listed as threatened. The USFWS has designated critical habitat
for VELB along the American River Parkway and in an area within the Sacramento metropolitan area
(54 FR 48229). The species has no State status.
Distribution and Habitat. The VELB is endemic to the Central Valley and is found in riparian
habitats and associated uplands where the elderberry (sambucus spp.), the beetle’s food plant, grows.
The beetle is a pith-boring species that depends on elderberry plants during its entire life cycle. Larvae
feed on tree pith, while adults eat the foliage and possibly the flowers of the plants. The adult stage of
the VELB is short-lived, and most of the life cycle is spent in the larval stage. The adults are active
from early March through early June with mating occurring in May. Eggs are laid singly, or in small

Final Report

groups, in crevices in elderberry bark and hatch in about 10 days. Larvae bore into the pith of elderberry
roots, branches, and trunks to create an opening in the stem within which they pupate, remaining in this
stage for one to two years before emerging as adults. After metamorphosing into an adult, the VELB
chews a circular exit hole through which it emerges, sometime during the period of late March to June.
It appears that VELB occupancy of elderberry shrubs is determinant upon a number of variable such as
shrub condition, water availability, elderberry density, and the health of the overall riparian habitat;
however, VELB have a tendency to stay within a general clumped distribution of shrubs (USFWS 2017.
Potential for Occurrence in Project Area. There are no CNDDB records in the project area.
Elderberry shrubs are not likely to be present in the project area.
Giant Garter Snake
Status. The giant garter snake is Federally and State-listed as threatened.
Distribution and Habitat. The giant garter snake is endemic to wetlands in the Sacramento and
San Joaquin valleys (Hansen and Brode 1980). The current distribution extends from near Chico in
Butte County south to the Mendota Wildlife Area in Fresno County.
Rice fields and their adjacent irrigation and drainage canals and ditches serve an important role
as aquatic habitat for the snakes. During the summer, some snakes use the flooded rice fields as long as
their prey is present in sufficient densities. In late summer, rice fields provide important nursery areas
for newborns. In late summer/fall, water is drained from the rice fields and the snakes prey items
become concentrated in the remaining pockets of standing water, which allow the snakes to gorge before
the winter their period of winter inactivity (USFWS 1999). It appears that the majority of the snakes
move back into the canals and ditches as the rice fields are drained, although a few may overwinter in
the fallow fields, where they hibernate within burrows in the small berms separating the rice checks
(Hansen 1998).
Potential for Occurrence in Project Area. A giant garter snake was found on Webb Tract
(adjacent to Franks Tract to the North) during April, 2002, near the ferry dock. One giant garter snake
was found in 1998 near Sherman and Decker Islands, but it is not known whether this snake represented
a resident population in the western Delta or was washed into the Delta from high-water flows in the
winter. Another garter snake was observed at the north end of the Antioch Bridge before the mid-1980s
(IES 2000). Sherman Island (adjacent to Lower Sherman Island to the east) has been identified for
recovery efforts in the Draft Recovery Plan for Giant Garter Snakes (USFWS 1999).
Intensive trapping surveys conducted within Contra Costa County independently by Eric Hansen
and by Biological, Inc. have failed to detect giant garter snake (Contra Costa County, 2006). Likewise,
Swaim intensively trapped in regions northeast of Oakley in 2003 and 2005, including Marsh Creek, Big
Break, and Contra Costa Canal, without success (Swaim 2004, Swaim 2005a-f, Swaim 2006).

Final Report

Giant garter snake may potentially be using drainage and irrigation channels near the overland
pipeline layout over Jersey Island. A single giant garter snake was sighted in 2015 on the east side of
Jersey Island, outside of the proposed action area. Based on the studies discussed above, giant garter
snakes have the potential to be present in the action area.
Special Status Fish Species
The Bay–Delta estuary, including the Delta flooded islands, serves as habitat for a variety of
special status fish species, several of which have been listed for protection under the FESA. California
Central Valley steelhead trout are present seasonally within the Delta. Green sturgeon inhabit Suisun
Bay and the Delta. Delta smelt and juvenile Chinook salmon identified as winter-run and spring-run
Chinook salmon have been collected within Suisun Bay and the Delta, including the flooded islands.
Chinook salmon, (winter-run and spring-run) and steelhead, (Central Valley Evolutionary
Significant Unit or ESU use the Delta in the vicinity of Big Break as a migratory corridor. In addition,
Delta smelt, have been documented within the waters of Suisun Bay and the Delta, including the flooded
islands. Big Break is in the area designated as EFH for managed species, including Pacific salmon.
Table 4-1 shows the listed species that have the potential to occur within the project area.
Southern Distinct Population Segment (sDPS) Green Sturgeon
Status. Southern DPS green sturgeon are listed as a Federally threatened species under the FESA
(75 FR 30714).
Distribution and Habitat. Southern DPS green sturgeon are the most marine species of sturgeon,
making extensive oceanic migrations and only coming into freshwater rivers to spawn. Adults migrate
into rivers to spawn from April to July, with May to June being the peak season. Southern DPS green
sturgeon first reach sexual maturity at age 15 for males and 17 for females, with spawning thought to
occur every 3 to 5 years (Tracy 1990 in Adams et al. 2002). Preferred spawning substrate likely is large
cobble but can range from clean sand to bedrock (Moyle 1992 in Adams et al. 2002). Eggs are
broadcast and externally fertilized in relatively fast water and probably in depths greater than 3 meters
(about 10 feet). Specific water quality requirements are unknown, but a small amount of silt is known to
prevent the eggs from adhering to each other, thus increasing survival (Moyle 2002).
Young sDPS green sturgeon grow rapidly, reaching 74 millimeters (about 3 inches) 45 days
post‐hatching. Based on trapping data from the Red Bluff Diversion Dam (RBDD) and the Glenn‐
Colusa Irrigation District (GCID) trap, juvenile sDPS green sturgeon average 29 millimeters in length
during June and July at RBDD, and 36 millimeters in July at GCID. Juvenile sDPS green sturgeon may
spend between 1 and 3 years in fresh water before migrating to the ocean (Adams et al. 2002), but may
spend time near estuaries at first to rear (Moyle 2002, 111). Juvenile sDPS green sturgeon have been
collected in the Sacramento River, near Hamilton City, and in the Delta and San Francisco Bay.
According to Kohlhorst et al. (1991), juveniles inhabit the estuary until they are approximately 4 to 6
years old, when they migrate to the ocean.

Final Report

Adult and juvenile sDPS green sturgeon are benthic (bottom) feeders, but may also take small
fish. Juveniles in the Sacramento–San Joaquin Estuary feed primarily on opossum shrimp and
amphipods (Moyle 2002).
Southern DPS green sturgeon adults occur in the project area on the Sacramento River when
migrating to and from upstream spawning habitat. Juveniles may occur in the project area during
downstream migration. Juveniles also may rear in the area. The general behavior and distribution
patterns indicate that the earliest life stages (larvae and post‐larvae) rear upstream of the project area in
the Sacramento River for several months before migrating to the Delta and estuary. Salvage and
trawling records from the Delta suggest that most juveniles in the project area are likely to be more than
200 millimeters long and at least 9 months old. Juveniles move downstream in the Sacramento River
from May to August (Beamesderfer et al. 2007).
Population abundance information concerning the Southern DPS of green sturgeon is described
in the NMFS status reviews (Adams et al. 2002; NMFS 2005). Limited population abundance
information comes from incidental captures of North American green sturgeon from the CDFW white
sturgeon monitoring program (CDFG 2002). By comparing ratios of white sturgeon to green sturgeon
captures, CDFW provides estimates of adult and sub‐adult North American green sturgeon abundance.
Estimated abundance between 1954 and 2001 ranged from 175 fish in 1993 to more than 8,421 in 2001,
and averaged 1,509 fish per year. Unfortunately, there are many biases and errors associated with these
data, and CDFW does not consider these estimates reliable since the population estimates are based on
small sample sizes, intermittent reporting, and inferences made from white sturgeon catches. Fish
monitoring efforts at RBDD and GCID on the upper Sacramento River have captured between 0 and
2,068 juvenile Southern DPS of green sturgeon per year (Adams et al. 2002).
Potential for Occurrence in Project Area. Southern DPS green sturgeon may occur seasonally
within Big Break as juveniles and adults. The area may allow the upstream passage of adults and the
downstream emigration of juveniles (NMFS 2006).
Delta Smelt
Status. Delta smelt are listed as a threatened species under the FESA (58 FR 12854).
Distribution and Habitat. Delta smelt are endemic to the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta
estuary. Delta smelt inhabit the freshwater portions of the Delta and Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers
and the low-salinity portions of Suisun Bay. They typically are found in shallow water (less than 10
feet) where salinity ranges from 2 to 7 parts per thousand (ppt), although they have been observed at
salinities between 0 and 18.4 ppt. Delta smelt have relatively low fecundity and most live for 1 year.
They feed on planktonic copepods, cladocerans, amphipods, and insect larva (Moyle 2002).
Adult Delta smelt migrate upstream into channels and sloughs of the eastern Delta during fall
and winter in preparation for spawning. Delta smelt live their entire life cycle in the Sacramento–San
Joaquin Delta. USFWS has prepared a recovery plan for Delta smelt that identifies criteria for
evaluating the status of the Delta smelt population (USFWS 1996). These criteria include annual indices
of abundance and geographic distribution in the estuary as determined through CDFW’s fall mid-water
116
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,

Final Report

trawl surveys. Indices of abundance and geographic distribution of Delta smelt have improved in recent
years. USFWS continues to evaluate the available scientific information regarding the status of Delta
smelt and the performance of various management actions designed to improve protection, reduce
mortality, and enhance habitat quality and availability within the estuary.
Potential for Occurrence in Project Area. As a result of their life history and geographic
distribution, Delta smelt may occur seasonally within Big Break as eggs, larvae, juveniles, and adults.
Larval, juvenile, and adult Delta smelt are most abundant in the vicinity of Big Break during spring,
summer, and fall (CDFW unpublished data).
Sacramento River Winter-run Chinook Salmon
Status. Winter-run Chinook salmon is Federally listed as an endangered species (70 FR 37104).
The NMFS designated critical habitat for Sacramento River winter-run Chinook salmon in 1993 (58 FR
33212). The critical habitat designation includes the Delta and the Sacramento River.
Distribution and Habitat. Sacramento River winter-run Chinook salmon spend 1 to 3 years in
the ocean. Adult winter-run Chinook salmon leave the ocean and migrate through the Delta into the
Sacramento River from December through July, with peak migration in March. Adults spawn from
mid-April through August, and egg incubation continues through October (Moyle 2002). The primary
spawning habitat in the Sacramento River is above the RBDD at river mile (RM) 243, although
spawning has been observed downstream as far as RM 218 (NMFS 2001). Spawning success below the
Red Bluff Diversion Dam may be limited primarily by warm water temperatures (Yoshiyama et al.
1998). Sacramento River winter-run Chinook salmon smolts (i.e., juveniles that are physiologically
ready to enter seawater) may migrate through the Delta and bay to the ocean from November through
May (Yoshiyama et al. 1998). In general, juvenile abundance in the Delta increases in response to
increased Sacramento River flow (Brandes and McLain 2001).
Potential for Occurrence in Project Area. Juvenile winter-run Chinook salmon are found in the
Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta from October through early May based on data collected from trawls,
beach seines, and salvage records associated with both State and Federal water projects (CDFG 1998).
Juveniles arrive in the upper Delta from January to March, and rear in freshwater areas for the first 2
months (Kjelson et al. 1981, 1982). As they grow, fry and fingerlings tend to rear in the downstream
portions where the ambient salinity is roughly 1.5 to 2.5 parts per thousand (Healey 1980, 1982; Levings
et al. 1986).
Winter-run Chinook salmon critical habitat, encompassing the Sacramento River from Keswick
Dam (RM 302) to Chipps Island (RM 0), the Carquinez Straight, Suisun, Honker, Grizzly and San Pablo
Bays, and San Francisco Bay north of the Oakland Bay Bridge, has been designated by NMFS. In
addition to the water and channel bottom, critical habitat includes the adjacent riparian zone, which
provides “cover and shade to the near-shore aquatic areas” (58 CFR 33212). Big Break is within the
region identified as EFH for Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus species), including the winter-run Chinook,
spring-run Chinook, and fall/late fall-run Chinook.

Central Valley Spring-run Chinook Salmon
Status. The Central Valley spring-run Chinook salmon ESU was Federally listed as threatened
on 16 September 1999 (64 FR 50394). Their threatened status was reaffirmed in the NMFS final listing
determination issued on 28 June 2005 (70 CFR 37160). Critical habitat for Central Valley spring-run
Chinook salmon was designated by NMFS on 2 September 2005 (70 FR 52488). Designated critical
habitat includes the San Francisco Bay-Delta estuary, mainstem Sacramento River upstream to Keswick
Dam, and most of the Sacramento Valley’s perennial tributaries with established spring salmon runs,
including the Feather River and Feather River Hatchery.
Distribution and Habitat. Spring-run Chinook salmon were historically widely distributed and
abundant within the Sacramento and San Joaquin River systems (Yoshiyama et al. 1998). Spring-run
Chinook salmon historically migrated upstream into the upper reaches of the main-stem rivers and
tributaries for spawning and juvenile rearing (Moyle 2002). Construction of major dams and reservoirs
on these river systems eliminated access to the upper reaches for spawning and juvenile rearing, and
completely eliminated the spring-run Chinook salmon population from the San Joaquin River system
(Moyle 2002). Spring-run Chinook salmon abundance has declined substantially (NMFS 2009), and the
geographic distribution of the species in the Central Valley has also declined substantially. Spring-run
spawning and juvenile rearing currently occur consistently in only a small fraction of their previous
geographic distribution, including populations inhabiting Deer, Mill, and Butte Creeks, the main-stem
Sacramento River, several other local tributaries on an intermittent basis, and the lower Feather River
(Moyle 2002). Recent genetic studies show that spring-run Chinook salmon returning to the lower
Feather River are genetically similar to fall-run Chinook salmon. Hybridization between spring-run and
fall-run Chinook salmon, particularly on the Feather River where both stocks are produced within the
Feather River hatchery, is a factor affecting the status of the spring- run Chinook salmon population.
NMFS is in the process of developing a recovery plan for Central Valley spring-run Chinook salmon.
Probability of Occurrence in Project Area. Central Valley spring-run Chinook salmon occur in
the Delta either as adults migrating upstream to their spawning habitat, or as juveniles, rearing and
migrating towards the ocean. Spring-run Chinook salmon have the potential to occur in the study area
due to the presence of rearing and migratory habitat. Although the majority of adult spring-run Chinook
salmon migrate upstream in the main-stem Sacramento River passing Sherman Lake, there is a
probability, although low, that adults may migrate into the central Delta. The occurrence of adult
spring-run Chinook salmon in the western and central Delta in the vicinity of Big Break, although
expected to be very low, would be limited to the late winter and spring adult upstream migration.
California Central Valley (CCV) Steelhead
Status. The CCV steelhead Distinct Population Segment (DPS) (formerly ESU) was Federally
listed as threatened on 19 March 1998 (63 FR 13347) and its threatened status was reaffirmed in the
NMFS final listing determination on 5 January 2006 (71 FR 834). Critical habitat for California Central
Valley steelhead was designated on 2 September 2005 (70 FR 52488), and includes all river reaches
accessible to steelhead in the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers and their tributaries.
118
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
Sacramento District

September 2018

Delta Island and Levees Feasibility Study

Final Report

Distribution and Habitat. CCV steelhead historically migrated upstream to the high gradient
upper reaches of Central Valley streams and rivers for spawning and juvenile rearing. Construction of
dams and impoundments on most Central Valley rivers has created impassable barriers to upstream
migration and substantially reduced the geographic distribution of steelhead. Although quantitative
estimates of the number of adult steelhead returning to Central Valley streams to spawn are not
available, anecdotal information and observations indicate that population abundance is low. Steelhead
distribution is currently restricted to the main-stem Sacramento River downstream of Keswick Dam, the
Feather River downstream of Oroville Dam, the American River downstream of Nimbus Dam, the
Mokelumne River downstream of Comanche Dam, and a number of smaller tributaries to the
Sacramento River system, Delta, and San Francisco Bay. The project areas within the San Joaquin
River system serve as EFH for managed species, including Pacific salmon. Big Break supports juvenile
rearing and migration.
Steelhead have one of the most complex life histories of any salmonid species, exhibiting both
anadromous and freshwater resident life histories. Freshwater residents of the species are referred to as
rainbow trout, and those exhibiting an anadromous life history are called steelhead. The California
Central Valley steelhead population is composed of both naturally spawning steelhead and steelhead
produced in hatcheries.
In the Sacramento River, adult CCV steelhead migrate upstream during most months of the year,
beginning in July, peaking in September, and continuing through February or March. Spawning occurs
primarily from January through March, but may begin as early as late December and may extend
through April. Individual steelhead may spawn more than once, returning to the ocean between each
spawning migration. Juvenile CCV steelhead rear a minimum of 1 year, but typically spend 2 or more
years in fresh water before migrating to the ocean during smoltification, which is the process of
physiological change that allows ocean survival. Juvenile migration to the ocean generally occurs from
December through August. The peak months of juvenile migration are January to May (McEwan 2001).
Potential for Occurrence in Project Area. CCV steelhead occur in the Delta as adults, migrating
upstream to their spawning habitat, and as juveniles and smolts rearing and migrating toward the ocean.
CCV steelhead have the potential to occur in the study area due to the presence of rearing and migratory
habitat. Although the majority of adult CCV steelhead migrate upstream in the main-stem Sacramento
River, there is a probability that adults migrate through the central Delta and would be present
seasonally in the vicinity of Big Break. The occurrence of adult steelhead within the Delta, and
potentially within Delta flooded islands, would be limited to the winter and early spring adult upstream
migration.

Essential Fish Habitat
The 1996 amendments to the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act
(MSA) (16 U.S.C. § 1801 et seq.), pursuant to Section 305(b), require the identification of EFH for
Federally managed fishery species and the implementation of measures to conserve and enhance this
habitat (50 CFR § 402.14(j)). EFH is the aquatic habitat (water and substrate) necessary to fish for
spawning, breeding, feeding, or growth to maturity that would allow a level of production needed to
support a long-term, sustainable commercial fishery and contribute to a healthy ecosystem (NMFS
2002).
Because the project has the potential to adversely affect EFH for the following fishery
management plan (FMP), the Corps requested consultation pursuant to Section 305(b) of the MSA for:
•

Pacific Salmon FMP (Sacramento River winter-run Chinook salmon, Central Valley springrun Chinook salmon, and Central valley fall-/late fall-run Chinook salmon) (O.tshawytscha)

Necessary elements of EFH for spawning, rearing, and migration include sufficient substrate
composition; water quality; water quantity, depth, and velocity; channel gradient and stability; food
(invertebrates); cover and habitat complexity; space; access and passage; and habitat connectivity. The
EFH components that may be influenced by dredged material placement are adult migration and juvenile
migration and rearing (Corps and EPA 2003).
Critical Habitat
The Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers and the Bay–Delta estuary serve as a migration corridor
for anadromous salmonids, sDPS green sturgeon, and delta smelt which have been listed for protection
under the FESA. Listed salmonids that occur seasonally in the Delta in the vicinity of the flooded
islands include winter-run Chinook salmon, spring-run Chinook salmon, and CCV steelhead as well as
the Federally listed delta smelt. The Sacramento River and Bay–Delta estuary are designated as critical
habitat by NMFS for winter-run and spring-run Chinook salmon, CCV steelhead, and sDPS green
sturgeon. The Bay–Delta estuary, including the flooded islands, has been designated as critical habitat
by USFWS for Delta smelt.

Regulatory Setting
Clean Water Act
The Clean Water Act (CWA) is the primary Federal law governing water quality. It established
the basic structure for regulating discharges of pollutants into waters of the U.S. and gives the USEPA
the authority to implement pollution control programs, such as setting wastewater standards for
industries (USEPA 2002). In some states, such as California, the USEPA has delegated authority to
regulate Section 401 and 402 of the CWA to state agencies.
Section 401 of the CWA regulates the water quality for any activity that may result in any inwater work or discharge into navigable waters. These actions must not violate Federal water quality
standards. The Central Valley RWQCB administers Section 401 in California, and either issues or
denies water quality certifications that typically include project-specific requirements established by the
RWQCB to ensure attainment of water quality standards.
Section 404 of the CWA requires that a permit be obtained from USEPA and USACE when an
action will result in discharge of dredged or fill material into wetlands and waters of the U.S. Under
Section 404, USACE regulates such discharges and issues individual and/or general permits for these
activities. Before USACE can issue a permit under Section 404, it must determine that the project is in
compliance with the CWA Section 404(b)(1) guidelines. The 404(b)(1) guidelines specify that “no
discharge of dredged or fill material shall be permitted if there is a practical alternative to the proposed
discharge which would have less adverse impact on the aquatic ecosystem, so long as the alternative
does not have other significant adverse environmental consequences” (40 CFR 230.10[a]). USEPA has
“veto” authority over permits issued by USACE.
When conducting its own civil works projects, USACE does not issue permits to themselves.
Rather, USACE would comply with the guidelines and substantive requirements of the CWA, including
Section 404, and Section 401. The discharge of fill material would be required to comply with
404(b)(1) guidelines with the inclusion of appropriate measures to minimize pollution or adverse effects
on the aquatic ecosystem. A Section 401 water quality certification will be required from the Central
Valley RWQCB prior to construction.

Final Report

The project would also require a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
permit since it would disturb 1 or more acre of land and involves possible storm water discharges to
surface waters. Prior to construction, the contractor would be required to prepare a SWPPP and then
submit a Notice of Intent (NOI) for a Construction General Permit (CGP) form to the Central Valley
RWQCB, requesting approval of the proposed work. This storm water plan would identify best
management practices to be used to avoid or minimize any adverse effects of construction on surface
waters. Once the work is completed, the contractor would submit a Notice of Termination (NOT) in
order to terminate coverage by the CGP permit.
Affected Environment
Primary Factors Affecting Water Quality
Primary factors affecting water quality in the project area include patterns of land use in the
upstream watersheds and the Delta, operations of the SWP and CVP. The CVP is operated by the
Bureau of Reclamation; it is one of the world’s largest water storage and transport systems. The CVP is
a Federal water management project under the supervision of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. The
CVP provides irrigation and municipal water to much of California's Central Valley by regulating and
storing water in reservoirs in the water-rich northern half of the state, and transporting it to the waterpoor San Joaquin Valley by means of a series of canals, aqueducts and pump plants, some shared with
the SWP.
Point and nonpoint pollutant sources include historic and recent drainage from inactive and
abandoned mines and related debris/sediment, industrial and municipal wastewater treatment plant
discharges, agricultural drainage, urban stormwater runoff, atmospheric deposition, recreational uses,
and metabolic waste (e.g., pathogens) from wildlife. Other major point sources consist primarily of
municipal wastewater treatment plants and nonpoint sources consist of urban stormwater runoff of
pollutants. Natural erosion and instream sediments, atmospheric deposition, and geothermal inputs also
affect Delta water quality. The principal contaminants and conditions affecting water quality in the
Delta are as follows (CALFED Bay-Delta Program 2000).
•

Historical drainage and sediment discharged from upstream mining operations in the late
1800s and early 1900s has contributed metals, such as cadmium, copper, and mercury.

•

Stormwater runoff can contribute metals, sediment, pathogens, organic carbon, nutrients,
pesticides, dissolved solids (salts), petroleum products, and other chemical residues.

•

Wastewater discharges from treatment plants can contribute salts, metals, trace organics,
nutrients, pathogens, pesticides, organic carbon, personal care products, pharmaceuticals, and
oil and grease.

•

Agricultural irrigation return flows and nonpoint discharges can contribute salts (including
bromide and selenium), organic carbon, nutrients, pesticides, pathogens, and sediment.

•

Large dairies and feedlots can contribute nutrients, organic carbon, and pathogenic
organisms.

Final Report

•

Water-based recreational activities (such as boating) can contribute hydrocarbon compounds,
nutrients, and pathogens.

•

Atmospheric deposition can contribute metals, nutrients, pesticides, and other synthetic
organic chemicals, and may lower pH.

•

Miscellaneous contaminants and conditions from the San Joaquin River include selenium and
low DO.

Water quality can vary seasonally in response to winter spring runoff and summer-fall lower
flow periods, and can also vary from year to year as a result of precipitation and snow pack levels in the
upper watersheds, and the resulting releases from upstream reservoirs for water supply, flood
management, and environmental obligations (e.g., fish flows, Delta water quality objective
compliance), operations of the Delta Cross Channel, and seasonal and annual variations in SWP and
CVP pumping rates.
As defined by USEPA, water quality standards consist of: (1) the designated beneficial uses of a
water segment; (2) the water quality criteria (referred to as objectives by the state) necessary to support
those uses; and (3) an antidegradation policy that protects existing uses and high water quality. Each
Regional Water Board’s Basin Plan identifies numeric and narrative water quality objectives, together
with the beneficial uses assigned to water bodies and the state anti-degradation policy.
The latest version of the Section 303(d) list for California issued by the State Water Resources
Control Board (approved April 6, 2018) identifies impaired status for waterways in the study area,
including the San Joaquin River and Stockton DWSC. The Stockton Deep Water Ship Channel portion
of the San Joaquin River is being addressed by a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) for dissolved
oxygen (DO). TMDLs were initiated for organophosphorous pesticides (i.e., diazinon and chlorpyrifos),
salinity and boron and selenium in the San Joaquin River watershed and for total dissolved solids (TDS)
and mercury in Delta channels. The proposed alternatives would be required to comply with the TMDL
thresholds established for the Delta and the other area waterways discussed above.
Water Quality Control Plan for the Delta Estuary
The Bay-Delta WQCP identifies beneficial uses of water in the Bay-Delta, water quality
objectives for the reasonable protection of those beneficial uses, and a program of implementation for
achieving the water quality objectives. The State of California is currently in the process of updating the
plan including the area where the project would occur. Unless otherwise indicated, water quality
objectives cited for a general area, such as for the south Delta, are applicable for all locations in that
general area, and specific compliance locations are used to determine compliance with the cited
objectives within the area.
The established water quality objectives provide reasonable protection for fish and wildlife. The
beneficial uses in the Bay-Delta Estuary include the following:

Water Quality Control Plan for Sacramento and San Joaquin River Basins
The Basin Plan for the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers defines the beneficial uses, water
quality objectives, implementation programs, and surveillance and monitoring programs for waters of
the Sacramento and San Joaquin River basins. The Basin Plan contains specific numeric water quality
objectives that are applicable to certain water bodies, or portions of water bodies. Numerical objectives
have been established for bacteria, DO, pH, pesticides, electrical conductivity (EC), TDS, temperature,
turbidity, and trace metals. The Basin Plan also contains narrative water quality objectives for certain
parameters that must be attained through pollutant control measures and watershed management.
Narrative water quality objectives also serve as the basis for the development of detailed numerical
objectives.

Mercury
Mercury occurs in the Delta as a result of both natural and anthropogenic sources and continually
cycles through the aquatic environment. Mercury occurs naturally in the environment regardless of
human influence. Natural mercury exists in the Delta; however, it is difficult to determine the balance
of natural to unnatural sources because there is so much regional variability and historic degradation in
the Sacramento River watershed. Forest fires in Northern California contribute some mercury to the
environment, in addition to an ongoing load of some magnitude associated with historic gold mining.
Concentrations of mercury in inflowing rivers to the Delta greatly exceed rivers in comparable regions
without local mercury sources (Jones and Slotten 1996).
In 1990 the Central Valley Water Board identified the Delta as impaired by mercury because fish
had elevated levels of mercury that posed a risk for human and wildlife consumers. In addition, the San
Francisco Bay mercury control program identified Central Valley outflows from the Delta as one of the
principal sources of total mercury to San Francisco Bay (CVRWQCB, 2010). Methyl mercury
production and accumulation in fish can then be ingested by fish-eating birds, animals and people. In
addition, methyl mercury generally comprises a relatively greater percentage of the total mercury
content at higher levels. Accordingly, mercury exposure and accumulation is of particular concern for
animals at the highest trophic levels in aquatic food webs and for animals and humans that feed on these
organisms (EPA 1997).
There are a number of ongoing studies in the Delta assessing the effects associated with open
water or marsh restoration projects on methyl mercury production throughout the system. These studies
are required to report their findings to the CVRWQCB in October 2018. Based on the progress reports
submitted in 2015, there are some uncertainties associated with the overall effect of these restoration
actions. Tidally influenced sites tend to produce less mercury than sites than remain consistently
flooded. Some vegetation, including native marsh species, have been found to contribute mercury to the
Delta system. Other restoration actions have had no noticeable impact on the mercury conditions in the
Delta, with most monitoring results remaining consistent with offsite conditions. (CVRWQCB, 2018)
Salinity
Salinity concentrations within the Delta are primarily a function of the location of high-salt
content ocean water with daily tidal action, freshwater inflow to the Delta, and the hydrodynamic
processes in the Delta channels that govern channel flow conditions and mixing of water sources with
variable salt content. During winter and early spring, freshwater inflows to the Delta are usually above
the minimum required to control salinity. However, at least for a few months in summer and fall of most
years when freshwater inflows to the Delta have declined, Delta salinity conditions must be carefully
monitored and controlled. Broad-scale salinity control actions are taken in the Delta because its channels
are at or below sea level and unless repelled by continuous seaward flow of fresh water, seawater can
advance into the western Delta and adversely affect compliance with water quality objectives and
beneficial uses provided by Delta water resources.

125
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
Sacramento District

Delta Island and Levees Feasibility Study

Final Report

Additional influential factors of the Delta salinity conditions include the San Joaquin River
inflow, in-Delta agricultural drainage, and other miscellaneous inputs (e.g., municipal wastewater, urban
runoff, connate groundwater). San Joaquin River inflows are particularly influential to salinity
conditions in the southern Delta after winter rainfall and runoff from the Sierra Mountains have ceased
and the river is influenced primarily by drainage return flows from the San Joaquin Valley floor. High
concentrations of salts are carried by the San Joaquin River into the Delta and much of the salt load
represents recirculation and increased salt content of water diverted to the San Joaquin Valley via the
CVP. Salinity problems in the western Delta result primarily from the incursion of saline water from the
San Francisco Bay when freshwater inflow from the Delta to the bay is low. However, it should be
noted that compared to historical conditions, Delta salinity during low-flow periods is much lower since
the construction of the major dams on Delta tributaries in the Sierra Mountains and foothills, which
allow storage and fresh-water releases during the summer to repel tidal seawater intrusion. For the
Sacramento River in the north Delta, which is not substantially affected by sea-water intrusion due to the
large flow of the Sacramento River, concentrations of all salinity parameters are uniformly much lower
than other Delta locations.

Air Quality

This air quality section describes the existing air quality conditions in the project vicinity. The
section first explains the air quality regulatory environment the existing physical air quality
environment, including the area’s climate and atmospheric conditions, the air pollutants of most
concern, air quality conditions, and sensitive receptors in the project area.
Regulatory Setting
Air quality management and protection are regulated by Federal, state, and local levels of
government. The primary Federal statute that establishes ambient air quality standards and regulatory
authorities to enforce attainment is the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA). Applicable air quality regulations
and responsible agencies are described below.
Federal
Clean Air Act
The Federal 1970 CAA authorized the establishment of national health-based air quality
standards, and also set deadlines for their attainment. The Federal CAA Amendments of 1990 (1990
CAAA) made major changes in deadlines for attaining National Ambient Air Quality Standards
(NAAQS) and in the actions required of areas of the nation that exceeded these standards. Under the
CAA, state and local agencies in areas that exceed the NAAQS are required to develop state
implementation plans (SIP) to show how they will achieve the NAAQS for nonattainment criteria
pollutants by specific dates. SIPs are not single documents; rather, they are a compilation of new and
previously submitted plans, programs (such as monitoring, modeling, permitting, etc.), district rules,
126
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,

Delta Island and Levees Feasibility Study

Final Report

state regulations and Federal controls. The USEPA is responsible for enforcing the NAAQS primarily
through reviewing SIPs that are prepared by each state.
As required by the Federal CAA, the USEPA has established and continues to update the
NAAQS for specific criteria air pollutants: ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2),
sulfur dioxide (SO2), inhalable particulate matter (PM10), fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and lead (Pb).
The NAAQS for these pollutants are listed under “Federal Standards” in Table 4-2 and represent the
upper-bound levels of pollutant concentrations deemed necessary by the USEPA to protect the public
health and welfare with an adequate margin of safety.
General Conformity Rule and de minimis Levels
Pursuant to CAA Section 176(c) requirements, USEPA promulgated the General Conformity
Rule (GCR), which applies to most Federal actions, including the selected plan. The GCR is used to
determine if Federal actions meet the requirements of the CAA and the applicable SIP by ensuring that
pollutant emissions related to the action do not:
•

Cause or contribute to new violations of a NAAQS.

•

Increase the frequency or severity of any existing violation of a NAAQS.

•

Delay timely attainment of a NAAQS or interim emission reduction.

A conformity determination under the GCR is required if the Federal agency determines: the
action will occur in a nonattainment or maintenance area; that one or more specific exemptions do not
apply to the action; the action is not included in the Federal agency’s “presumed to conform” list; the
emissions from the proposed action are not within the approved emissions budget for an applicable
facility; and the total direct and indirect emissions of a pollutant (or its precursors), are at or above the
de minimis levels established in the General Conformity regulations.
An action will be determined to conform to the applicable SIP if the action meets the
requirements of 40 CFR 93.158(c). In addition, Federal activities may not cause or contribute to new
violations of air quality standards, exacerbate existing violations, or interfere with timely attainment or
required interim emissions reductions toward attainment.

Local
The focused project area encompasses the Bay Area Air Quality Management District
(BAAQMD). The BAAQMD is responsible for implementing Federal and State regulations at the local
level, permitting stationary sources of air pollution, and developing the local elements of the SIP.
Emissions from indirect sources, such as automobile traffic associated with development projects, are
addressed through the BAAQMD’s air quality plans, which is the air quality district’s contribution to the
SIP. In addition to permitting and rule compliance, air quality management at the local level is also
accomplished through the BAAQMD imposition of mitigation measures on project environmental
impact reports and mitigated negative declarations developed by project proponents under CEQA.
Specific to project construction emissions, CEQA requires mitigation of air quality impacts that exceed
certain significance thresholds set by the local AQMD.

Environmental Setting
The study area for the project is located in the San Francisco Bay Area Air Basin, which is
primarily regulated by the BAAQMD. Criteria air pollutants relevant to the project were determined
based on the existing pollutant conditions in the BAAQMD. Toxic air contaminants (TAC) relevant to
the project were determined based on the BAAQMD guidance and the project site conditions.
Criteria and Non-Criteria Air Pollutants
Pollutants are typically classified as either criteria or non-criteria pollutants. Federal and
California regulators have established ambient air quality standards for criteria pollutants whereas no
ambient standards have been established for non-criteria pollutants. For some criteria pollutants,
separate standards have been set for different periods. Most standards have been set to protect public
health. For some pollutants, standards have been based on other values such as protection of crops,
protection of materials, or avoidance of nuisance conditions. A summary of Federal ambient air quality
standards for criteria pollutants is shown in Table 4-2. Air pollutants relevant to the project and their
health effects are discussed below and summarized in Table 4-4. In addition, sensitive receptors are
defined and receptors near the project are identified.

Criteria Pollutants
For criteria pollutants, NAAQS have been established to protect public health and welfare.
Criteria pollutants include CO, NO2, O3, PM10, PM2.5, and SO2. Ozone is a secondary pollutant that is
not emitted directly to the atmosphere. Instead, it forms by the reaction of two ozone precursors –
reactive organic gases (ROGs) and nitrogen oxides (NOX) – in the presence of sunlight and high
temperatures. The sources of these pollutants, their effects on human health and the nation's welfare, and
their annual emission to the atmosphere vary considerably.
Toxic Air Contaminants
A TAC is defined by California law as an air pollutant that “may cause or contribute to an
increase in mortality or an increase in serious illness, or which may pose a present or potential hazard to
human health.” The USEPA uses the term hazardous air pollutant (HAP) in a similar sense. HAPs can
be defined as pollutants that are known or suspected to cause cancer or other serious health effects, such
as reproductive effects or birth defects, or adverse environmental effects (EPA, 2017). Controlling air
toxic emissions became a national priority with the passage of the CAA Amendments, whereby
Congress mandated that the USEPA regulate 187 air pollutants. HAPs can be emitted from stationary
and mobile sources.
Air Quality Standards and Attainment Status
Ambient air quality standards are set to protect public health. There are currently both Federal
and State ambient air quality standards by USEPA and state air quality agencies, CALEPA for
California. California air quality standards are generally more stringent than Federal standards. The four
designations are further defined as:
•

Nonattainment—assigned to areas where monitored pollutant concentrations consistently
violate the standard in question.

•

Maintenance—assigned to areas where monitored pollutant concentrations exceeded the
standard in question in the past but are no longer in violation of that standard.

•

Attainment—assigned to areas where pollutant concentrations meet the standard in question
over a designated period of time.

•

Unclassified—assigned to areas were data are insufficient to determine whether a pollutant is
violating the standard in question.

Table 4-5 summarizes the level of Federal pollutant attainment status for the study area.

Local Air Quality Management and Sensitive Receptors
Project site standards would follow those enforced by the BAAQMD. Air quality in each air
basin is regulated by Federal, State, and regional agencies. The NAAQS apply at publicly accessible
areas, regardless of whether those areas are populated. For the purposes of air quality analysis, sensitive
land uses are defined as locations where human populations, especially children, seniors, and sick
persons, are located and where there is reasonable expectation of continuous human exposure according
to the averaging period for the air quality standards (e.g., 24-hour, 8-hour, and 1-hour). Typical
sensitive receptors include residences, hospitals, and schools. There are no sensitive receptors in the
study area.

4.2.7

Climate Change

Regulatory Setting
Federal
The USEPA is responsible for greenhouse gas (GHG) regulation at the Federal level. Key
Federal GHG guidance and regulations relevant to the project are summarized below.
In Massachusetts v. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, et al., 127 S.Ct. 1438 (2007), the
United States Supreme Court ruled that GHGs fits within the CAA’s definition of a pollutant, and that
the USEPA has the authority to regulate GHGs.
On December 7, 2009, the Final Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for
Greenhouse Gases (endangerment finding), under Section 202(a) of the CAA went into effect. The
endangerment finding states that current and projected concentrations of the six key well-mixed GHGs
in the atmosphere, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons
(HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), and other fluorinated gases including
nitrogen trifluoride (NF3) and hydrofluorinated ethers (HFEs), threaten the public health and welfare of
current and future generations. Furthermore, it states that the combined emissions of these GHGs from
new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle engines contribute to the GHG pollution which threatens
public health and welfare (USEPA 2012a).

Final Report

Under the endangerment finding, the USEPA is developing vehicle emission standards under the
CAA. The USEPA and the Department of Transportation’s National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration have issued a joint proposal to establish a national program that includes standards that
will reduce GHG emissions and improve fuel economy for light-duty vehicles in model years (MYs)
2012 through 2016. This proposal marks the first GHG standards proposed by the USEPA under the
CAA as a result of the endangerment and cause or contribute findings (USEPA 2012b). These emission
reductions were incorporated into the project analysis.
On February 18, 2010, the CEQ released draft guidance regarding the consideration of GHGs in
NEPA documents for Federal actions. The draft guidelines include a presumptive threshold of 25,000
metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions from a proposed action to trigger a
quantitative analysis. CEQ has not established when GHG emissions are “significant” for NEPA
purposes; rather, it poses the question to the public (CEQ 2010). On August 5, 2016, the CEQ published
a Notice of Availability on how to consider greenhouse gas emissions and the effects of climate change
in the document “Final Guidance for Federal Departments and Agencies on Consideration of
Greenhouse Gas Emissions and the Effects of Climate Change in National Environmental Policy Act
Reviews”. Most recently, this final guidance has been withdrawn for further consideration on March 28,
2017. The withdrawal of this final guidance does not change any law, regulation, or other legally
binding requirements.
On March 19, 2015, President Obama signed EO 13693, Planning for Federal Sustainability in
the Next Decade. While EO 13693 introduced new requirements and expanded upon previous
requirements for consideration of climate change in Federal actions, this EO was since revoked.
Affected Environment
This section addresses the existing conditions of global climate change. Emissions of GHGs are
a contributing factor, on a cumulative basis, to global climate change. Global climate change has the
potential to result in sea level rise (which may result in flooding of low-lying areas), to affect rainfall
and snowfall levels (which may lead to changes in water supply and runoff), to affect temperatures and
habitats (which in turn may affect biological and agricultural resources), and to result in many other
adverse effects. Although global climate change is inherently a cumulative impact, it is important to
remember that any single project is unlikely to be able to generate sufficient GHGs by itself to have a
significant impact on the environment. However, the cumulative effect of human activities has been
clearly linked to quantifiable changes in the composition of the atmosphere, which in turn have been
shown to be the main cause of global climate change.
Global Climate Trends and Sea Level Rise
Global warming is the name given to the increase in the average temperature of the Earth’s nearsurface air and oceans since the mid-20th century and its projected continuation. Warming of the climate
system is now considered by a vast majority of the scientific community to be unequivocal, based on
observations of increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and
ice, and rising global average sea level (IPCC, 2007). Human influence on the climate system is clear,
and recent anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases are the highest in history (IPCC, 2014).

Final Report

Global mean surface temperatures have risen by 0.74 degrees Celsius (°C) ± 0.18°C when
estimated by a linear trend over the last 100 years (1906 to 2005). On a global scale, the ocean warming
is largest near the surface, warming by 0.11 [0.09 to 0.13] ℃ per decade over the period 1971 to 2010
(IPCC, 2014). The rate of warming over the last 50 years is almost double that over the last 100 years
(0.13°C ± 0.03°C versus 0.07°C ± 0.02°C per decade). The causes of this measured warming have been
identified as both natural processes and the result of human actions.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concludes that variations in natural
phenomena such as solar radiation and volcanoes produced most of the warming from preindustrial
times to 1950 and had a small cooling effect afterward. However, since 1950, increasing GHG
concentrations resulting from human activity such as fossil fuel burning and deforestation have been
responsible for most of the observed temperature increase. These basic conclusions have been endorsed
by more than 45 scientific societies and academies of science, including all of the national academies of
science of the major industrialized countries. Since 2007, no scientific body of national or international
standing has maintained a dissenting opinion (DWR, 2012).
Increases in GHG concentrations in the Earth’s atmosphere are thought to be the main cause of
human-induced climate change. GHGs naturally trap heat by impeding the exit of solar radiation that has
hit the Earth and is reradiated back into space as infrared radiation. Some GHGs occur naturally and are
necessary for keeping the Earth’s surface habitable. However, increases in the concentrations of these
gases in the atmosphere above natural levels during the last 100 years have increased the amount of
infrared radiation that is trapped in the lower atmosphere, intensifying the natural greenhouse effect and
resulting in increased global average temperatures.
The effects of warming of the Earth’s atmosphere and oceans affect global and local climate
systems. Observational evidence from all continents and most oceans shows that many natural systems
are being affected by regional climate changes, in addition to temperature increases (IPCC, 2007).
Based on growing evidence, there is high confidence that the following effects on hydrologic systems
are occurring: (1) increased runoff and earlier spring peak discharge in many glacier- and snow-fed
rivers; and (2) warming of lakes and rivers in many regions, with effects on thermal structure and water
quality (IPCC, 2008).
There is very high confidence, based on increasing evidence from a wider range of species, that
recent warming is strongly affecting terrestrial biological systems, including such changes as geographic
ranges, seasonal activities, migration patterns, abundances and species interactions in both plant and
animal species (IPCC, 2014).
There is high confidence, based on substantial new evidence, that observed changes in marine
and freshwater biological systems are associated with rising water temperatures, as well as related
changes in ice cover, salinity, oxygen levels, and circulation. These include shifts in ranges and changes
in algal, plankton, and fish abundance in high-latitude oceans; increases in algal and zooplankton
abundance in high-latitude and high-altitude lakes; and range changes and earlier fish migrations in
rivers (IPCC, 2007). In addition to direct detrimental effects to marine ecosystems (ocean acidification),
133

Final Report

over the period 10901 to 2010, global mean sea level rose by 0.19 [0.17 to 0.21] meters, which has been
larger than the mean rate during the previous two millennia (IPCC, 2014).
Changes in many extreme weather and climate events have been observed since approximately
1950 and some of these changes have been linked to human influences. Additionally, changes in the
ocean and on land, including observed decreases in snow cover and Northern Hemisphere sea ice extent,
thinner sea ice, shorter freezing seasons of lake and river ice, glacier melt, decreases in permafrost
extent, increases in soil temperatures and borehole temperature profiles, and sea level rise, provide
additional evidence that the world is warming (IPCC, 2014).
Climate Change Conditions in California
With respect to California’s water resources, the most important effects of global warming have
been changes to the water cycle and sea level rise. Over the past century, the precipitation mix between
snow and rain has shifted in favor of more rainfall and less snow (Mote et al., 2005; Knowles et al.,
2006), and snowpack in the Sierra Nevada is melting earlier in the spring (Kapnick and Hall, 2009). The
average early-spring snowpack in the Sierra Nevada has decreased by about 10 percent during the last
century, a loss of 1.5 million acre-feet of snowpack storage (DWR, 2008). These changes have major
implications for water supply, flooding, aquatic ecosystems, energy generation, and recreation
throughout the state.
Precipitation
Climate change can affect precipitation by changing the overall amount of precipitation, type of
precipitation (rain versus snow), and timing and intensity of precipitation events. Changes to these
factors propagate through the hydrologic system in California and have the potential to affect snowpack,
runoff, water supply, and flood control.
Former State Climatologist James Goodridge compiled an extensive collection of longer-term
precipitation records from throughout California. These data sets were used to evaluate whether there
has been a changing trend in precipitation in the state over the past century (DWR, 2006). Long-term
runoff records in selected California watersheds were also examined. Based on a linear regression of the
data, the long-term historical trend for statewide average annual precipitation appears to be relatively
flat (no increase or decrease) over the entire record. However, it appears that there might be an upward
trend in precipitation toward the latter portion of the record. Precipitation in Northern California
appears to have increased between 1 and 3 inches annually between 1890 and 2002 (DWR, 2006).
Snowpack
An increase in the global average temperature is expected to result in a decreased volume of
precipitation falling as snow in California and an overall reduction in the Sierra Nevada’s snowpack.
Snowpack in the Sierra Nevada provides both water supply (runoff) and storage (within the snowpack
before melting), which is a major source of supply for California. According to the California Energy
Commission (CEC), the snowpack portion of the water supply has the potential to decline by 30 to 90
percent by the end of the 21st century (CEC, 2006). A study by Knowles and Cayan projects that
134
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
Sacramento District

September 2018

Delta Island and Levees Feasibility Study

Final Report

approximately 50 percent of the statewide snowpack will be lost by the end of the century (Knowles and
Cayan, 2002).
On average, California’s annual snowpack has the greatest accumulations from November
through the end of March. The snowpack typically melts from April through July. California’s
reservoir managers rely on snowmelt to fill reservoirs once the threat of large winter and early-spring
storms and related flooding risks have passed.
An analysis conducted by DWR of the effect of rising temperatures on snowpack shows that a
rise in average annual air temperature of 3°C (5.4°F) would likely cause snowlines to rise approximately
1,500 feet (DWR, 2006). This would result in the equivalent of approximately 5 million acre-feet of
water per year falling as rain rather than snow at lower elevations.
Runoff
Runoff is directly affected by changes in precipitation and snowpack. If the amount of
precipitation falling as rain rather than snow were to increase earlier in the year, flooding potential could
increase. Water that normally would be held in the Sierra Nevada snowpack until spring would flow
into the Central Valley concurrently with the rain from winter storm events. This scenario would place
more pressure on California’s flood control system (DWR, 2006).
Changes in both the amount of runoff and the seasonality of the hydrologic cycle also have the
potential to greatly affect the heavily managed water systems of the western United States. The
hydrology of the Sacramento River watershed is highly dependent on the interaction between Sierra
Nevada snowpack, runoff, and management of reservoirs. Higher snow lines and more precipitation
falling in the form of rain rather than snow will increase winter inflows to reservoirs. Higher winter
inflows will also likely mean that a greater portion of the total annual runoff volume will occur in the
winter, which would translate to higher flows in the Delta in the winter than those that currently occur.
Appendix C (Engineering) Attachment HH-B is a technical memorandum containing a policy
compliant Inland Hydrology analysis. Results Based on National Standard Settings for each Hydrologic
Unit Code-4 (HUC-4) watershed provide an indication of how vulnerable the watershed is to potential
impacts of climate change relative to the other 201 HUC-4 watersheds in the United States. For the
Sacramento River Watershed (HUC 1802), this tool shows that the ecosystem restoration line of
business is vulnerable to climate change for two scenarios/epoch combinations (2085 wet and dry)
compared to the other 201 HUC-4 watersheds in the nation (Table 13; Figure 42 - Figure 43). The
indicator contributing the highest amount to the Weighted Order Weighted Average (WOWA) score
under both scenarios is the at risk freshwater plants indicator. For the San Joaquin River Watershed
(HUC 1804), this tool shows that the ecosystem restoration line of business is not vulnerable to climate
change for any scenario/epoch combination relative to the other 201 HUC-4 watersheds in the nation
(Attachment HH-B Table 13; Figure 42 -Figure 43).
The Recommended Plan location, although close to the confluence of the Sacramento and San
Joaquin Rivers, is dominated by the San Joaquin River. Thus, the low vulnerability conclusion
contained in Attachment HH-B is applied to the project location. Climate change-induced modifications

to inland hydrology are not concluded to affect ecosystem restoration long-term performance or
feasibility level designs.
Greenhouse Gas Emissions
As defined in Section 38505(g) of the California Health and Safety Code, the principal GHGs of
concern are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFC),
perfluorocarbons (PFC), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3). With the exception of
NF3, these are the same gases named in the USEPA’s Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings
for Greenhouse Gases under Section 202(a) of the CCA. Each of the principal GHGs has a long
atmospheric lifetime (one year to several thousand years), and is globally well mixed. In addition, the
potential heat trapping ability of each of these gases varies significantly from one another. On a 100year timescale, methane is about 25 times as potent as CO2, nitrous oxide is about 298 times as potent as
CO2, and sulfur hexafluoride is about 22,800 times more potent than CO2 (IPCC, 2007).
Conventionally, GHGs have been reported as CO2 equivalents (CO2e). CO2e takes into account the
relative potency of non-CO2 GHGs and converts their quantities to an equivalent amount of CO2 so that
all emissions can be reported as a single quantity.
The primary human-made processes that release these gases include: (1) the burning of fossil
fuels for transportation, heating, and electricity generation; (2) agricultural practices that release
methane, such as livestock grazing and crop residue decomposition; and (3) industrial processes that
release smaller amounts of high global warming potential gases, such as sulfur hexafluoride, PFCs, and
HFCs. Deforestation and land cover conversion have also been identified as contributing to global
warming by reducing the Earth’s capacity to remove CO2 from the air and altering the Earth’s surface
reflectance. The major sources of GHGs that are relevant to the study are transportation sources and
construction emissions. These are discussed in greater detail below.
Transportation
Transportation is a major source of GHGs in California, accounting for 36 percent of the State’s
total GHG emissions in 2008 (CARB, 2011). Transportation emissions within California are generated
primarily by combustion of gasoline, diesel, and some alternative fuels by mobile sources. The
indicators of vehicular activity, and resulting GHG emissions, are vehicle miles traveled and the fuel
economies of the individual vehicles composing the vehicular fleet. Vehicle miles traveled are
associated with movement of people and goods on local, regional, and statewide scales.
Construction
Construction emissions are generated when materials and workers are transported to and from
construction sites and when machinery is used for construction activities such as trenching, grading,
dredging, paving, and building. Emissions from construction activities are generated for shorter periods
than operational emissions; however, GHGs remain in the atmosphere for hundreds of years or more, so
once released, they contribute to global climate change unless they are removed through absorption by
the oceans or by terrestrial sequestration.

Final Report

Construction emissions are not accounted for in a separate category in the California GHG
inventory (or other inventories that use IPCC GHG emissions sectors for accounting purposes).
However, based on the category “Transportation—Not Specified,” which includes off-road vehicles and
associated diesel fuel combustion, construction emissions accounted for a maximum of 0.4 percent of
California’s GHG inventory between 2000 and 2008 (CARB, 2011).
Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventories
A GHG inventory is a quantification of GHG emissions and sinks within a selected physical
and/or economic boundary over a specified time. GHG inventories can be performed on a large scale
(i.e., for global and national entities) or on a small scale (i.e., for a particular building or person).
Many GHG emission and sink specifications are complicated to evaluate because natural
processes may dominate the carbon cycle. Although some emission sources and processes are easily
characterized and well understood, some components of the GHG budget (i.e., the balance of GHG
sources and sinks) are not known with accuracy. Because protocols for quantifying GHG emissions
from many sources are currently under development by international, national, state, and local agencies,
ad-hoc tools must be developed to quantify emissions from certain sources and sinks in the interim.
Table 4-6 outlines the most recent global, national, statewide, and local GHG inventories to help
contextualize the magnitude of potential project-related emissions.

responsibilities for search and rescue, marine environmental protection, and the maintenance of river
aids to navigation, among other roles. Specific to the Delta, 33 CFR 162 provides regulations for the

excavation or deposition of material in waters, and obstruction or alteration of waters. However, since
USACE is the responsible agency for implementing this law, USACE could not issue a permit to itself,
and instead would ensure that its projects are designed in compliance with this law.

Affected Environment
The subsections below describe the existing conditions of the roadways near the study area that
could be used during construction of the proposed alternatives. Additionally, the local marine highways
(i.e., the deep water ship channels) are described). There are no other transportation services in the
vicinity that could be impacted by the study, including ferry routes. The closest airport to Big Break is
the Byron Airport, a small local airport operated by Contra Costa County, which is located
approximately 20 miles to the south of the study area.
Regional and Local Roadways
The main roadway and access route to the project areas and borrow sites is Highway 160. This
two lane highway runs north to south through the Delta region. It provides access to most Delta cities
while connecting Sacramento to Antioch. Highway 160 is used primarily by local travelers and some
commuters who enjoy the tranquil setting of the Delta for traveling to and from the Bay Area. Vehicular
access to Big Break and Jersey Island is possible using the existing two lane arterials which include
Main Street, East Cypress Road, and Jersey Island Road in Oakley.

Port of Stockton/Stockton DWSC
The Port of Stockton is located on the Stockton DWSC, 75 nautical miles due east of the
Golden Gate Bridge. The port is a major transportation center with berthing space for 17 vessels,
1.1 million square feet of dockside transit sheds and shipside rail trackage, and 7.7 million square
feet of warehousing served by rail. The Port of Stockton has the capacity to move cargo from
vessels directly to truck and rail (Port of Stockton 2012). River access to the port is through the
Suisun Bay, San Joaquin River, and the Stockton DWSC. The Stockton DWSC connects the
Disappointment Slough with the Port of Stockton marine terminal facilities, a distance of
approximately 14 miles (State Water Resources Control Board 2010). Stockton's DWSC has an
average depth of 35 feet, and an average depth at high tide of 40 feet (Port of Stockton 2010).
Port of West Sacramento/Sacramento DWSC
The Port of West Sacramento is an inland port located within the Sacramento
metropolitan area, about 79 miles northeast of San Francisco. The port is situated on the
Sacramento DWSC, which flows into the San Francisco Bay and has a depth of 30 feet. Unlike
most other ports in California, the Port of Sacramento does not receive container ships. The
majority of the cargo transported through the port is agricultural, due to its location within the
agricultural heartland of the Central Valley. Access to the Port of West Sacramento is related to
the level of operation and maintenance of the Sacramento DWSC. As of FY 16, USACE had on
hold a study evaluating the deepening of the Sacramento DWSC to 35 feet. If such deepening
were to occur in the future, it would affect the cumulative impacts related to the Delta Study.
However, the Sacramento DWSC is outside of the selected plan’s impact area.

4.2.9

Recreation

Regulatory Setting
There are no Federal regulations associated with recreation in the action area.
Affected Environment
The Delta is a major destination for water based recreationists because of its climatic
conditions, variety and abundance of fish, large maze of navigable waterways, and favorable
water levels during summer. Activities in the Delta include cruising, waterskiing, wakeboarding,
using personal watercraft, sailing, windsurfing, and kiteboarding, as well as fishing and hunting
both from land and by boat.
Boating is the primary recreation activity in the Delta. Throughout the Delta, there are a
variety of boat launching sites. Other recreation opportunities within the project area include
hunting, fishing, hiking, day-use/picnicking, and wildlife observation. Boaters also participate in
other related activities, such as boat camping (typically in houseboats or other large boats with
sleeping accommodations). The area shelters more than 70 species of birds and a great variety of

fish species. Winter temperatures range from 45 to 55 degrees. Summer days vary from 65 to
100 degrees. Cooling Delta breezes often gust to 25 mph, and tides can vary as much as six feet
in one day (Department of Parks and Recreation 1997).
Big Break is a popular destination for wildlife viewing hiking/biking, boating, and
fishing. The Big Break Regional Shoreline park facility offers the majority of recreational
experiences within the Big Break area. General boating also takes place at Big Break estuary due
to its accessibility to the rivers and sloughs of the Inland Coast. Numerous private marinas offer
services to boaters and anglers. The facilities that exist in the Big Break area are shown on Table

4.2.10 Cultural Resources
This chapter describes the environmental setting associated with cultural resources,
assesses the effects to cultural resources that would result from implementation of the proposed
program, and presents mitigation measures that would reduce these effects. The key sources of
data and information used in the preparation of this chapter are listed below.
•

A review of existing information.

•

Consultation with interested parties.

•

Archival research.

•

Reconnaissance level surveys of the study area.

Cultural resources are defined in this chapter as prehistoric and historic archaeological
sites, the historic built environment, and traditional cultural properties.
Regulatory Setting
National Historic Preservation Act
The proposed project would require that USACE comply with Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (NHPA), and its implementing
regulations (36 CFR 800, Section 106). Section 106 requires that, before beginning any
undertaking, a Federal agency must take into account the effects of the undertaking on historic
properties (cultural resources listed or eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic
Places [NRHP]) and afford the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) an
opportunity to comment on these actions. Federal agencies may comply with Section 106 by
either completing the management steps indicated in the regulations (36 CFR Part 800) or
preparing an agreement document that describes the particular process an agency will use to
complete the same steps for a specific set of undertakings, as described below.
Cultural resources are eligible for the NRHP if they have integrity and significance as
defined in the regulations for the NRHP. A property may be significant if it displays one or
more of the following characteristics (36 CFR 60.4): (1) It is associated with events that have
made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of our history (Criterion A); (2) is
associated with the lives of people significant in our past (Criterion B); (3) embodies the distinct
characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that represents the work of a
master, or that possesses high artistic values, or it represents a significant and distinguishable
143

Final Report

entity whose components may lack individual distinction (Criterion C); (4) it has yielded, or is
likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history (Criterion D).
Some types of cultural resources are not typically eligible for the NRHP. These resources
consist of cemeteries, birthplaces, graves of historical figures, properties owned by religious
institutions or used for religious purposes, structures that have been moved from their original
locations, reconstructed historic buildings, properties primarily commemorative in nature, and
properties that have achieved significance within the past 50 years. These property types may be
eligible for the NRHP if they are integral parts of eligible districts of resources or meet the
criteria considerations described in 36 CFR 60.4.
In addition to possessing significance, a property must also have integrity to be eligible
for listing in the NRHP. The principle of integrity has seven aspects: location, design, setting,
materials, workmanship, feeling, and association (36 CFR 60.4). To retain historic integrity, a
property needs to possess several, and usually most, of these aspects (National Park Service
2002). The evaluation of a resource’s integrity in relation to its significance will be conducted as
prescribed in National Register Bulletin No. 15: How to Apply the National Register Criteria for
Evaluation (National Park Service 2002).
The Section 106 review process typically consists of the following major steps.
•

Study Area and Area of Potential Effects
The original study area focused on Big Break and Little Franks Tract to determine the
effectiveness of placing dredged materials. The area of potential effects (APE) is a smaller area
within the larger study area and encompasses any ground disturbing activities, staging areas, and
access to the APE. This also includes the soil placement location at Big Break and a portion of
Jersey Island where a road improvement will take place and a pipeline will cross the island to
deliver the dredged materials. Areas not considered as part of the APE are the locations where
the dredged materials will be taken from including McCormick, Scour, Decker, and Bradford
disposal sites, as well as the Stockton DWSC. These areas are established dredge spoils
deposition areas or ongoing maintenance activities and are comprised entirely of displaced
material from maintenance dredging, and covered under their own consultation.

The first three reports were prepared as joint Federal and State documents for the BDCP
and cover the entire Delta. More specific information concerning Little Franks Tract and Big
Break follow the general overview.
Prehistoric Setting
Prior to the arrival of Europeans, inhabitants of the Delta occupied the riparian forest,
marsh, alkali basins, oak savanna, and foothill woodland communities found throughout the
Central Valley. In the Delta specifically, they located their main population centers on natural
levees, mounds and other high spots. Their society developed a sophisticated material culture
and established trade system involving a wide range of manufactured goods and raw materials,
and their population and villages prospered in the centuries prior to historic contact (Rosenthal et
al. 2007).
The following discussion uses a simple classification based on the three basic periods
proposed by Fredrickson: the Paleo‐Indian, Archaic, and Emergent (Fredrickson 1973, 1974).
The Archaic period has been further divided into the Lower, Middle, and Upper Archaic based
on newer radiocarbon dates, adjusted with modern calibration curves (Rosenthal et al. 2007).
Paleo-Indian
No evidence of the Paleo‐Indian Period (11,550–8,500 BC) has been found in the Delta.
However, basally thinned and fluted projectile points at three separate locations in the southern
portion of the Central Valley show that people were present there during that time (Rosenthal et
al. 2007). Meyer and Rosenthal have shown through geoarchaeological studies that periodic
episodes of erosion and deposition during the Holocene have removed or buried large segments
of the Late Pleistocene landscape (Rosenthal and Meyer 2004; White 2003a). Therefore,

archaeological deposits associated with these ancient landforms have either been destroyed or are
buried beneath more recent alluvial deposits (Rosenthal et al. 2007).
Lower Archaic
Evidence of the Lower Archaic Period (8,000–5,550 BC) is likewise rare in the Delta, but
is characterized primarily by isolated finds, including stemmed points, chipped stone crescents,
and early concave base points. Intact deposits are even rarer and only one Lower Archaic
deposit has been found in the Central Valley.
Middle Archaic
The physical Delta itself truly formed during the beginning of the Middle Archaic
(5,550–550 BC) as a result of warmer, drier conditions in the Central Valley, sea level rise, and
the stabilization of fans and floodplains around 5,550 BC (Rosenthal et al. 2007). Around this
time, two distinct settlement‐subsistence adaptations operating in central California developed—
one centering on the foothills and the other on the valley floor (Fredrickson 1994; Rosenthal and
McGuire 2004). Population sites during this time appear to be increasingly sedentary, as
indicated by refined and specialized tool assemblages and features, a wide range of non‐
utilitarian artifacts, abundant trade objects, and plant and animal remains indicative of year‐
round occupation (Moratto 1984; Ragir 1972; Schulz 1970, 1981; White 2003a, 2003b). Again,
deposits dating to this time period are rare in the Central Valley. After about 2,500 BC, sites
become much more abundant, and have elaborate material cultural, diverse technology, and
dietary assemblages (Rosenthal et al 2007). Additionally, procurement patterns become
logistically based and populations have increasing residential stability (Rosenthal et al 2007).
Upper Archaic
A cooler, wetter Upper Archaic (550 BC–AD 1,100) led to renewed fan and floodplain
deposition and soil formation in the Central Valley (Rosenthal et al. 2007). People in the Upper
Archaic developed new, specialized technologies and there was widespread use of decorative
items including shell beads, Haliotis ornaments, and ceremonial blades (Bennyhoff and
Fredrickson 1994; Moratto 1984; Rosenthal et al 2007). There is evidence of regionalized
economies and a heavy reliance on acorns, salmon, fish and deer (Moratto 1984, Rosenthal et al
2007). Large villages also appeared during this time period (Lilliard et al 1939). Sites dating to
this time typically contain large quantities of habitation debris and features (such as fire‐cracked
rock heaps, shallow hearths, house floors, and flexed burials) that reflect long‐term residential
occupation.

Emergent
The archaeological record for the Emergent/Historic Period (AD 1,000) is more
substantial and comprehensive than those of earlier periods in the Central Valley, and the artifact
assemblages are the most diverse (Bennyhoff 1977; Fredrickson 1974; Kowta 1988; Sundahl
1982, 1992). In part this is due to the increasingly complex societies developing in the Delta
region; however, some of this may be because the rarity of earlier sites. The Emergent period
can be divided into Lower and Upper periods. Aspects of culture include the reliance on acorn,
pine nut, and Manzanita; the decentralization of bead production; use of Napa obsidian; and
proliferation of baskets. Use of the bow and arrow also became common (Bennyhoff 1994).
Village sites from the late Emergent were often used into the Ethnographic period.
Ethnographic Setting
Beginning with Euroamerican contact, at least two Native American cultural groups may
have inhabited portions of the Study Area. These groups are the Plains, Bay or Eastern Miwok
and Southern Patwin.
Plains Miwok
The Eastern Miwok, and more specifically the Plains or Bay Miwok, inhabited the lower
reaches of the Mokelumne and Cosumnes Rivers, and the banks of the Sacramento River from
Rio Vista to Freeport (Levy 1978). Although the Plains Miwok shared a common language
subgroup, Utial, and cultural background, they were comprised of several separate, politically
independent nations, or tribelets. The tribelet represented an independent, sovereign nation that
defined and defended a territory. The tribelet chief, usually a hereditary position, served as the
voice of legal and political authority in the tribelet (Levy 1978). Within the project area the
people were likely part of the Julpun tribelet (Bennyhoff 1977).
The Miwok suffered exposure to diseases introduced through the arrival of Europeans,
including trappers, gold miners, and other settlers to California. Hostilities between the Miwok
and Europeans took an additional toll on the population. The Spanish mission system forcibly
assimilated many Plains Miwok circa 1811 to 1836 (Bennyhoff 1977). After California was
annexed by the United States, some Miwok were displaced to Central Valley locations, yet many
remained on the rancherias established in the Sierra Nevada foothills. During the late nineteenth
and early twentieth centuries, the Miwok living on the foothill rancherias adapted to new
lifestyles, such as seasonal wage labor on ranches and farms, to augment subsistence through
hunting and gathering (Levy 1978). Since the early twentieth century, many persons of Miwok
descent survived and maintained strong communities and action-oriented organizations,
including the Ione Band of Miwok and Wilton Rancheria (Bennyhoff 1977).

Southern Patwin
The Southern Patwin are a series of linguistically and culturally related tribelets that once
occupied a portion of the lower Sacramento Valley west of the Sacramento River and north of
Suisun Bay. The ethnographically documented villages nearest to the APE are Aguasto and
Tolenas, both situated immediately north of San Pablo Bay to the west‐northwest (Kroeber 1925,
1932).
The largest political unit for the Patwin was the tribelet. Patwin tribelets maintained their
own autonomy and sense of territoriality and typically consisted of one primary and several
satellite villages. Villages were located along waterways, often near the junction with another
major topographic feature, such as foothills or another waterway (Kroeber 1925, 1932). While a
common language unified these social units, the Southern Patwin language disappeared shortly
after European contact, but may be related to a Wintuan language. Within the tribelet were
several political and social distinctions, including a chief who oversaw village activities; this
position was passed through inheritance from father to son (Johnson 1978).
The principal subsistence activities of the Patwin were hunting, fishing, and the gathering
of wild plants. Along with the acorn, which was the primary staple, the Patwin gathered
buckeye, pine nuts, berries, wild grapes, and other plants. Each village had its own location for
these food sources, and the village chief oversaw the procurement of food for the village
(Johnson 1978).
Population estimates for Patwin groups, from pre‐contact until 1833, are more than
15,000 (Kroeber 1932; Cook 1955). The Patwin were in contact with the Spanish missions by
the late eighteenth century, and some of the earliest historic records of the Patwin are found
among mission registers of baptisms, marriage, and deaths of Native American neophytes.
Mission San Jose, established in 1797, along with Mission Dolores, actively proselytized Patwin
from their southern villages, and Mission Sonoma, built in 1823, also baptized neophytes, until
the secularization of all missions by the Mexican government in 1832–1836. Afterward, many
tribal territories were divided into individual land grants (Johnson 1978).
The U.S. conquest of California (1846–1848) was followed by a massive influx of
American settlers into Patwin territory. To facilitate the development of ranching, agriculture,
mining, and large settlements, the Patwin were usually moved to reservations. However, some
Patwin assimilated themselves, at least partially, into white culture by working as ranch laborers
(Johnson 1978). Today, some Patwin descendants live on the Colusa, Cortina, and Rumsey
Rancherias; although many of the people living on these rancherias are of general Wintun
descent.

Historic Era Setting
The historic setting is intended to illustrate general themes in the development of the
Delta as a place. The Delta’s history is steeped in land reclamation and development of
agriculture, but also includes commercial activities such as fishing, canning, and industrialized
produce processing. At Big Break activities were limited to agriculture. Large and small scale
agriculture was facilitated by development of transportation routes, first focused on Delta
waterways but eventually developing into land routes. The Delta’s built environment has also
been shaped by large‐scale flood control and water management efforts, as well as recreational
activities such as fishing and boating.
Spanish Era to Gold Rush
The first Spanish expedition to reach the Delta was led by Captain Pedro Fages in 1772;
however, the Spanish presence in California remained concentrated mainly along the coastal
strip of missions and presidios, the nearest of which was located west of the Delta. During the
early nineteenth century, Spanish and Mexican soldiers would enter the Delta region on
incursions to capture Native Americans who had fled missions. The Bay Miwok were the first to
be missionized. When Mexico achieved independence from Spain in 1822, California became a
territory of Mexico, but remained a remote frontier province. By the end of the decade,
American fur trappers began to enter the San Joaquin Valley and the Delta after hearing reports
of abundant beaver that circulated after Jedediah Smith’s trapping expeditions through central
California in 1827 and 1828. Fur trapping in and around the Delta resulted in a steep decline of
beaver populations, and fur trappers introduced diseases in the region that heavily affected
Native American tribes (Owens 1991; Sandos 2004; Thompson 1957).
By 1848, when gold was discovered at Sutter’s Mill in Coloma, only a handful of people
had settled in the Delta, but thousands of newcomers traveled Delta waterways en route to the
foothill and mountain mines to the east. Some California newcomers chose to farm instead of
mine. Farmers began to work land at the edge of the Delta, along the natural levees of the major
rivers draining into it. Known as “rim landers,” these early settlers built shoestring levees (3-5
feet tall) atop the natural levees to withstand the highest tidal rises. Later, more extensive levee
construction downstream would transform the Delta (Paul 1973; Street 2004; Thompson 1957).
Land Reclamation
The Swampland Act of 1850 and creation of the State Board of Swamp Land
Commissioners enabled the establishment of districts to reclaim land in the Delta. However,
lack of cooperation among small landowners and later legislation allowed wealthy absentee
owners to take over large portions of the Delta. The speculative, large‐scale land reclamation
brought thousands of Chinese workers to the Delta. They first helped with the construction of
levees and then worked in the resulting agricultural fields (Garone 2011; Lund et al. 2007;
Owens 1991; Thompson 1957). Chinese tenant farmers are known to have worked and lived
within the once reclaimed lands of Big Break during the 1870s and 1880s (Busby 2001).

Delta Island and Levees Feasibility Study

Final Report

People reclaiming the Delta faced many challenges. Levees in the Delta have required
constant and expensive maintenance and repair as they frequently failed and islands flooded.
The beds of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers and tributaries beds were raised and choked
by tailings from hydraulic mining in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. The floors of the Delta’s peat
islands frequently underwent subsidence from farming and because they were no longer subject
to deposition activities during annual inundation. Groundwater seepage increased, creating
marsh areas. Irrigation for agriculture upstream caused saltwater intrusion deeper into the Delta.
New technology helped landowners build larger levees and move floodwater out more
quickly. The introduction of clamshell dredges in 1879 enabled the construction of increasingly
larger and more secure levees. Modern pumps and the introduction of electricity allowed for
more efficient and thorough draining of flooded islands. By the early twentieth century, the rise
of industrial agriculture across the Delta increased pressure for state and Federal action to protect
and facilitate the region’s agricultural economy through flood control efforts, transportation
development, and large‐scale water policy and development in the early twentieth century
(Garone 2007; Thompson 1957; Thompson 2006). Subsidence and deteriorating levees are
ongoing challenges today.
Agriculture
Agricultural activity in the Delta took place on higher lands near natural levees and rises
along the Sacramento River, where farmers raised potatoes, onions, and beans, among other
crops, and grazed cattle and sheep. From the 1860s through the 1880s, reclamation spread
agriculture from alluvium lands upstream into the peat lands of the central Delta. With water
access to a growing urban market in San Francisco, Delta agriculture boomed and crops were
diversified (Lokke and Simmons 1980; Rawls and Bean 2002; Thompson 1957; Thompson
2006).
An ethnically diverse population farmed land created by large‐scale speculative
reclamation through time. These large land holdings were divided into smaller plots with a
resident superintendent. Chinese, Italian, and Portuguese tenant farmers often specialized in
garden or truck farming. Chinese agricultural laborers also became associated with row crops,
especially nineteenth‐century potato cultivation. In the twentieth century, Japanese farmers
frequently engaged in potato and asparagus production. Beginning in the 1920s, Filipino and
Mexican day laborers also worked Delta lands (Azuma 1994; Miller 1995; Thompson 1957).
Modern industrial farming in the Delta region began after World War I. Fuel-powered
tractors became commonplace in the Delta, particularly among the large land companies.
Although large acreage continued to be reclaimed, a good deal of island land was improved
through the introduction of electric pumps. The sale of field crops by consignment to wholesale
markets or shippers nurtured the rise of canneries and wholesale produce houses with product
standards and field buyers. Urban factories were developed in the Delta during this period,
which often employed ethnic laborers to help make sugar out of sugar beets or can fruit,
asparagus, and other vegetables (Armentrout‐Ma 1981; Thompson 1957).

Transportation Development
During the Gold Rush, most Americans who encountered the Delta did so as passengers
of sailboats and steamers en route between San Francisco and the mines east of the Delta. A few
trails and later roadways complemented the water traffic. Only after the start of the twentieth
century did roads begin to dominate traffic in the Delta with the introduction of the automobile
and truck. Ferries connected roads with agriculture on remote islands. Early trails evolved into
roads traveled by stages hauling freight back and forth between the farms and the small towns
that took shape behind recently constructed levees. Railroads also played an important role in
the development of agriculture, especially after the beginning of the twentieth century. After
1900, county and state investment nurtured bridge construction, which in turn enabled the
development of year‐round roads serving Delta residents and visitors. During the 1910s and
early 1920s, additional bridge construction and road development connected the era’s increasing
automobile traffic from the earlier established roads to new routes extending to Isleton and Rio
Vista. No longer extant electric interurban railroads also extended into portions of the Delta
during the early twentieth century (Blow 1920; Caltrans 1990; Thompson 1980).
Water Management
The Delta became a focal point of increasingly large‐scale water engineering and
management during the early twentieth century. Pressure to ameliorate ongoing flood threats
due to the legacies of hydraulic mining led to 1917 legislation creating the first Federal flood
control project. The plan included nearly two hundred miles of levees, several hundred miles of
bypass channels, and ultimately the rerouting of floodwaters of the Sacramento, Yuba, and
American Rivers. Large dredges in use in the Delta for decades were now employed to build
new levees and create channels for flood control.
Numerous canals and straightened and widened river channels were by‐products of the
islands and levees created by Delta reclamation. These functioned as an important water source
for irrigation and provided both recreational boating waterway and dredge access for levee
construction and maintenance. Most Delta canals appear to have been opportunistically created
rather than being formally engineered, hence no design or “as‐built” drawings for early canals
and levees have been located. Nevertheless, with Federal involvement in flood control after
1917, and especially in the 1920s, plans were drawn and implemented for standard levees and
canals for the Sacramento Delta (Pisani 2002).
At the end of the 1920s, state engineer Edward Hyatt developed a State Water Plan to
respond to growing water problems. In 1928 the state’s voters approved a constitutional
amendment that limited the holders of riparian water rights to reasonable use of their water,
which opened the way for the state legislature to pass the Central Valley Project Act in 1933.
Most of the CVP was completed by the early 1950s, including more than 500 miles of canals and
20 dams and reservoirs.

Final Report

After World War II, the SWRCB began planning for additional large‐scale water
management projects. Then state engineer Arthur D. Edmonston developed a state water plan
entailing major new water impoundment and conveyance development. Known as the SWP,
Edmonston’s plan promised to augment flows to the Delta during dry years and develop state‐
funded canals to convey additional water to the San Joaquin Valley and new supplies to Santa
Clara and Alameda Counties. The plan also called for the development of pumps to transmit
Delta water to what would become known as San Luis Reservoir and to a huge aqueduct
conveying water south to be pumped over the Tehachapi Mountains into Southern California. In
1960, voters approved the financing for the project, and the first phase was implemented between
1962 and 1971 (Cooper 1968; Kahrl 1979; Rarick 2005).
Recreation
By the first decades of the twentieth century the Delta became a haven for sportsmen and
by the 1920s, with the construction of year‐round roads, bridges, hotels, and campsites, it had
become a destination for the recreational driver, the car camper, and the sightseer. In the post‐
World War II era, the widespread development of tract housing bypassed the Delta, primarily
due to land ownership patterns, limited transportation options, and the overabundance of water.
At the same time, those factors helped to foster an increased demand for recreational
opportunities and the proliferation of house and party boats. Recently, wetlands restoration has
made the Delta a destination for bird watchers as several communities have embraced rare and
endangered birds (Schell 1979; Gardner 1964; Steienstra 2012; Thompson 1957; Young 1969).
History of Big Break
The area currently known as Big Break was most likely occupied by peoples of the
Julpun tribelet of the Plains or Eastern or Bay Miwok (Busby 2001) and is just east of what is
considered to be the tribelet center of Chupcan at what is now Antioch (Bennyhoff 1977, Levy
1978). This village was first noted by Europeans visiting the area, including Captain Pedro
Fages and Fray Juan Crespi in 1772, and Juan Bautista de Anza, Lt. Jose Moraga and Fray Pedro
Font in 1776. A map by Jose de Carnizares noted that this village was abandoned in 1776
(Busby 2001). The Julpunes are thought to have occupied the islands and west bank of the San
Joaquin River and may have moved their main village to the islands due to mission contact
(Bennyhoff 1977). The Bay Miwok were among the earliest American Indians to be missionized
and were primarily taken to Mission San Jose, although some were taken to Mission San
Francisco (Beck and Haase 1974; Levy 1978; Milliken 1995).

Final Report

Dredging along Dutch Slough between 1904 and 1910 connected Dutch Slough,
Sandmound Slough, Taylor Slough and Piper Slough. The building of levees along the southern
shore of Dutch Slough is largely undocumented in the available literature, but inferences can be
made. Levees were built along the mouth of Marsh Creek, which forms the eastern boundary of
the Big Break Regional Shoreline, as early as 1859, but the unleveed land south of Jersey Island
was flooded by Marsh Creek in 1876 (Thompson 1957). The1910 Jersey Island USGS 7.5’
topographic map shows levees along the southern shore of Dutch Slough. Therefore, it can be
surmised that they were constructed between 1876 and 1910, and probably between 1904 and
1910 when Dutch Slough was being dredged. A clamshell dredge was likely used as they had
come into widespread use during that time.
Agriculture was originally pursued in the APE; but not much is known about crops grown
at Big Break, however, asparagus is reported to have been grown there (EBRPD 2014).
According to a letter report prepared by Ward Hill for the EBRPD (2000), the property known as
Big Break flooded in 1921 (Little Break). The levees broke again in 1928, flooding a 2.5 square
mile area, which was never reclaimed, effectively ending any agricultural pursuits.
Howard Lauritzen acquired a 40 acre parcel of remaining uplands and the flooded area
near Oakley in the 1930s through a trade with Pittsburg Steel. During the 1930s and 1940s,
Lauritzen used this area to dismantle Navy pontoons and target barges as part of a scrap metal
business. As many as 30 to 40 hulls are still present within the open water of the park area and
along the San Joaquin River shoreline (Hill 2000; Moran 2013).
The property was most recently acquired by the East Bay Regional Parks District and
currently is operated as the Big Break Regional Shoreline.
Methods for Resource Identification
In 2012, a record search for the entire Delta was completed at California Historic
Resources Information Centers for the BDCP (ICF 2012b). A second search to update this
information and retrieve survey data was completed in March 2014 at the North Central
Information Center and the Northwest Information Center. Additional research was undertaken
using in house records and those held by the East Bay Regional Park System, the State Lands
Commission, and the NRHP.
For the original study the APE was almost completely submerged, and no pedestrian
survey could be undertaken. However, a reconnaissance survey in the form of boat trips which
included photographing the remnant levees and other features was undertaken to document the
current condition of these resources.

Final Report

The updated Area of Potential Effect now includes work on Jersey Island. A small
section where a pipeline and road will cross Jersey Island requires pedestrian survey and updated
consultation with the California SHPO and interested tribes. We are currently in compliance
because 36 CFR 800.4 [b][2] allows for phased identification and evaluation if access to
properties is not available. The survey will be conducted prior to project implementation, once
access to the property is provided.
Known Cultural Resources
USACE has not surveyed the entire APE due to access limitations, but a records search
and partial survey of the APE has identified one cultural resource within the APE: the remnant
levee surrounding Big Break. The levee is described and evaluated for its eligibility for listing in
the NRHP separately, below.
Big Break
The levee surrounding Big Break were recorded and evaluated by USACE in November
of 2013. The levee is currently very degraded. Current (2012) aerial photos show that
approximately 20,741 feet (3.9 miles) remains of the levee in at least 13 segments. As discussed
above, the levees surrounding Big Break breached in 1928 and the land was never reclaimed.
USACE has determined that while the levee was peripherally related to the themes of
reclamation and agricultural development in the Delta, it does not retain enough integrity of
location, setting, feeling, association, workmanship, materials, and design to be eligible under
Criterion A. It is not associated with any person or persons significant to history (Criterion B).
The levee likewise does not embody the distinct characteristics of a type, period, nor method of
construction, nor represent the work of a master, nor do they possess high artistic values, or
represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual
distinction (Criterion C). The levee has not yielded, nor is it likely to yield, information
important in prehistory or history (Criterion D). Therefore, USACE has determined the levee is
not eligible for listing in the NRHP.
Areas not Surveyed
Materials from existing dredge spoils locations are proposed to be piped from the
Stockton DWSC, over Jersey Island, to the work area at Big Break. Because the alignment of
this pipe was unknown, only a record search of potential alignments was performed. The Corps
has not yet received permission to access Jersey Island so it has not been surveyed to date. The
record search showed that only one known cultural resource is in the project APE: the Big Break
remnant levee described above.

Consultation
Native American
Native American Tribes with interests in the Delta were contacted by USACE in May
2013. USACE received one response from the Wilton Rancheria with a request for more
information and stated desire to continue to be involved. More detailed information was sent to
every Tribe in March 2014. The Corps has consulted on the surveyed portions of the APE. 36
CFR 800.4 [b][2] allows for phased identification if access to a property is not possible. Once
access limitations for Jersey Island are resolved, and a pedestrian survey of Jersey Island has
been completed, the Corps will update tribal consultation for the project.
State Historic Preservation Officer
USACE determined that the proposed undertaking would result in no historic properties
affected. Consultation with the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) was initiated on May
15, 2014 and USACE received concurrence with their findings on May 29, 2014. Copies of the
correspondence can be seen in Appendix J. The Corps will update SHPO consultation for the

5.0 – ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES
5.1

Introduction

This chapter discusses the potential effects of the alternative plans on the significant
environmental resources described in Chapter 4. The present condition of each resource
analyzed in this chapter is compared with the estimated future condition of the resource after the
following alternative plans are in place:
•

Alternative 1 – No Action

•

Alternative 2 – 160 Acres of Intertidal Marsh Restoration

•

Alternative 3 – 340 Acres of Intertidal Marsh Restoration

Project effects on these significant environmental resources are measurable over the
entire restoration footprint or over specific project areas depending upon the configuration of
each resource.
Both beneficial and adverse effects are considered, including direct effects during
construction and indirect effects resulting from the alternatives. Each section, where appropriate,
contains a discussion of the methods used to analyze effects. In addition, the bases of
significance (criteria) for each resource are identified to provide a basis for evaluation of the
significance of any adverse effects. Finally, avoidance and minimization measures are proposed
to reduce any significant adverse effects for each resource. A summary of the effects and their
level of significance is included in Section 5.7, Irreversible and Irretrievable Commitment of
Resources.
Engineer Regulation 1105-2-100, “Planning Guidance Notebook,” April 2000,
establishes the following significance criteria:
•

Significance based on institutional recognition means that the importance of the
effects is acknowledged in the laws, adopted plans, and other policy statements of
public agencies and private groups. Institutional recognition is often in the form of
specific criteria.

•

Significance based on public recognition means that some segment of the general
public recognized the importance of the effect. Public recognition may take the form
of controversy, support, conflict, or opposition expressed formally or informally.

•

Significance based on technical recognition means that the importance of an effect is
based on the technical or scientific criteria related to critical resource characteristics.

Final Report

For this EIS, the above three NEPA criteria apply to all resources and are not repeated
under each resource section. The term “significant”, as used in NEPA, requires considerations of
both context and intensity:
•

(a) Context. This means that the significance of an action must be analyzed in several
contexts such as society as a whole (human, national), the affected region, the
affected interests, and the locality. Significance varies with the setting of the proposed
action. For instance, in the case of a site-specific action, significance would usually
depend upon the effects in the locale rather than in the world as a whole. Both shortand long-term effects are relevant.

•

(b) Intensity. This refers to the severity of impact. Responsible officials must bear in
mind that more than one agency may make decisions about partial aspects of a major
action. The following should be considered in evaluating intensity:
o (1) Impacts that may be both beneficial and adverse. A significant effect may
exist even if the Federal agency believes that on balance the effect will be
beneficial.
o (2) The degree to which the proposed action affects public health or safety.
o (3) Unique characteristics of the geographic area such as proximity to historic
or cultural resources, park lands, prime farmlands, wetlands, wild and scenic
rivers, or ecologically critical areas.
o (4) The degree to which the effects on the quality of the human environment
are likely to be highly controversial.
o (5) The degree to which the possible effects on the human environment are
highly uncertain or involve unique or unknown risks.
o (6) The degree to which the action may establish a precedent for future actions
with significant effects or represents a decision in principle about a future
consideration.
o (7) Whether the action is related to other actions with individually
insignificant but cumulatively significant impacts. Significance exists if it is
reasonable to anticipate a cumulatively significant impact on the environment.
Significance cannot be avoided by terming an action temporary or by breaking
it down into small component parts.
o (8) The degree to which the action may adversely affect districts, sites,
highways, structures, or objects listed in or eligible for listing in the NRHP or
may cause loss or destruction of significant scientific, cultural, or historical
resources.
o (9) The degree to which the action may adversely affect an endangered or
threatened species or its habitat that has been determined to be critical under
the FESA of 1973.

o (10) Whether the action threatens a violation of Federal, State, or local law or
requirements imposed for the protection of the environment.

Geologic Resources

This section evaluates the construction-related effects of the alternatives on geologic
resources. This analysis considers short-term restoration effects within the project area at Big
Break and discusses long-term beneficial effects.

5.2.1

Methodology and Basis of Significance

Methodology
As a part of feasibility level design, sediment sampling data from the Stockton O&M
Dredging project was reviewed from the last decade to confirm the content of the sediment
proposed for use. Additionally, historic data was reviewed and considered in this analysis. Two
primary resources used included the Flooded Islands Feasibility Study Baseline Report prepared
by DWR (DWR 2005) and the USACE Cultural Resources Survey Report (USACE 2014).
Basis of Significance
Adverse effects on topography were considered significant if implementation of an
alternative plan would result in any of the following:
•

Rupture of a known earthquake fault, strong seismic shaking, or seismic‐related ground
failure, including liquefaction;

•

Landslides, substantial soil erosion, or permanent loss of topsoil;

•

Locating the project on an unstable geologic unit, or on a geologic unit that would
become unstable as a result of the project; and/or,

•

Locating the project on expansive soil, as defined in the Uniform Building Code.

The proposed alternatives would not expose people or structures to substantial effects
involving earthquakes, landslides, and expansive soils. Additionally, the proposed measures
would not be located on unstable geographic units. As a result, these criteria are not discussed
further in this section.

5.2.2

Final Report

Alternative 1 – No Action

Under the no action alternative, USACE would not participate in the construction of the
proposed project and the geologic resources encompassing Big Break would remain undisturbed.
The no action alternative assumes that no action would be taken by USACE to restore intertidal
marsh habitat at Big Break. Big Break would remain in its current state and no sediment would
be placed to reverse the existing subsidence occurring in the study area. As a result, Big Break
would remain a sunken island and the open water condition would remain unchanged.
Subsidence would continue, and over time the water would continue to get deeper as the soils
compress, which would make it less likely that future restoration work could occur.
5.2.3

Alternative 2 – 160 Acres of Intertidal Marsh Restoration

Under Alternative 2, 160 acres of intertidal marsh restoration is proposed at Big Break.
Restoration would be accomplished by placing dredged material to reverse subsidence and raise
the elevation of the sunken island to promote marsh vegetation establishment.
The sediment proposed for use in reversing the impacts of subsidence would be acquired
through the annual O&M Dredging for the Stockton DWSC. Analysis of over 10 years of grain
size distribution data for the proposed dredging reaches shows the material to be virtually
completely fine sand. Ultimately, the proposed project would not be creating mounds from
outside sources or material, but rather moving sediment within the system from the engineered
channel to the subsided island.
Under this alternative, the topography would be permanently altered due to the placement
of dredged material throughout Big Break. Placement of dredged material would create a
variable topography that at times would be submerged below the tidal level and at other times
might be exposed vegetated sand mounds. The target elevations for the habitat include some
contingency to account for potential additional subsidence, sea level rise, and wave wash
erosion.
Therefore, while the proposed alternatives do involve reusing dredged materials to raise
the elevation of these sunken islands, the purpose of the action is to restore these islands to
historic conditions. As a result, the proposed alternatives would have effects due to the
placement of sediment and change in topography throughout Big Break, but ultimately effects on
geologic resources would be beneficial, because the project would be restoring the area to its
historic condition.

Final Report

Alternative 3 – 340 Acres of Intertidal Marsh Restoration

Under Alternative 3, 340 acres of open water habitat would be converted to a
combination of freshwater intertidal marsh habitat and shallow water habitat via the direct
placement of dredged material, as described in Section 3.9.2. The material placement and
planting would all be consistent with the description for Alternative 2, with the exception that
project construction would occur over a 10 year period rather than a 5 year period and there
would be an increase in acreage. Effects to geologic resources would be consistent with those
described for Alternative 2.

5.2.5

Avoidance and Minimization Measures

Since the effects to geologic resources would be beneficial, there would be no avoidance
or minimization measures are required.

5.3

Aesthetics

This section evaluates the construction-related effects of the alternatives on aesthetics.
This analysis considers short-term restoration effects within the project area at Big Break and
discusses long-term beneficial effects to aesthetics.

5.3.1

Methodology and Basis of Significance

Methodology
Evaluation of the potential impacts on aesthetics was based on a review of scenic vistas
and landscapes that could be affected by project related activities. Changes to the visual resource
are assessed by factoring the degree of change to the visual resource affected and viewer
response to that change. Other elements, such as natural screening by vegetation or landforms,
placement of project components in relation to existing structures, and likely viewer groups were
also considered.
Basis of Significance
Adverse effects on aesthetics were considered significant if implementation of an
alternative plan would:
•

Have a substantial adverse effect on a scenic vista.

•

Substantially damage scenic resources, including but not limited to, trees, rock
outcroppings, and historic buildings.
160

Final Report

•

Substantially degrade the existing visual character or quality of the site and its
surroundings.

•

Create a new source of substantial light or glare that would adversely affect day or
nighttime views in the area.

5.3.2

Alternative 1 – No Action

Under the no action alternative, USACE would not participate in construction of the
proposed project and the visual character of Big Break would remain unchanged. The no action
alternative assumes that no action would be taken by USACE to restore intertidal marsh habitat
at Big Break. As a result, Big Break would remain a sunken island and the open water condition
would remain unchanged. It is assumed that restoration actions currently proposed under
California EcoRestore and other projects would still be constructed, but not at Big Break.
Therefore, overall, aesthetics in the study area would remain similar to existing conditions.

5.3.3

Alternative 2 – 160 Acres of Intertidal Marsh Restoration

Construction of Alternative 2 would create temporary and permanent changes in views of
and from the Big Break restoration site. Construction would require staging of heavy equipment
on Jersey Island and the use of a pipe that is large in size for adequate transport of dredged
material into Big Break. Construction activities within the proposed action area would
temporarily affect the local view due to the brief presence of various construction equipment and
supplies and changes to the topography during the course of construction activities. Big Break is
in a remote location with few surrounding residences or businesses, therefore the primary people
that would be subjected to these temporary impacts would be intermittent recreational fisherman
and kayakers using the area, wildlife viewers at Big Break Regional Park, and possibly drivers
viewing Big Break from the Highway 160/Antioch Bridge.
Presence of construction equipment and pipe would temporarily degrade the visual
quality of Jersey Island and the closely surrounding area. However, after the placement of
dredged material is completed each season, the pipe and construction equipment would be
removed from the project area, making this impact temporary, lasting approximately 2 weeks per
year for 5 years.
Following construction, there would be a temporary impact to the visual character of the
landscape that would last approximately 1 year, as the dredged material settles. During this time,
the tops of the sand mounds would be exposed at low tide, which would be visible by the
receptors discussed above. After the settlement period, vegetation would be planted at the
restoration site, and the visual character would improve to a beneficial, natural-looking intertidal
marsh habitat. This habitat would be a permanent change in the visual character of Big Break;
161

Final Report

however, the changes would restore the area to a functional intertidal marsh habitat. The
permanent change to the viewshed would improve the visual character of the restoration site,
including the views of the restoration site from Jersey Island, Big Break Regional Park, and the
Highway 160/Antioch Bridge, rendering this permanent change to aesthetics beneficial.

5.3.4

Alternative 3 – 340 Acres of Intertidal Marsh Restoration

Under Alternative 3, 340 acres of open water habitat would be converted to a
combination of freshwater intertidal marsh habitat and shallow water habitat via the direct
placement of dredged material, as described in Section 3.9.2. The material placement and
planting would all be consistent with the description for Alternative 2, with the exception that
project construction would occur over a 10 year period rather than a 5 year period and there
would be an increase in acreage. Effects to aesthetics under Alternative 3 would be consistent
with those described for Alternative 2.

5.3.5

Avoidance and Minimization Measures

USACE would implement the following minimization measure to reduce potential
impacts to aesthetics:
•

5.4

Restore staging areas to pre-construction conditions to the degree practicable
following each construction season and hydroseed the disturbed area with native
grasses and forbs.

Vegetation and Wildlife

This section evaluates the effects of the proposed alternatives on vegetation and wildlife
resources in the project area. Effects of the proposed alternatives were analyzed during
coordination with the USFWS under the Federal FWCA and a final Coordination Act Report
(CAR) was received on June 26, 2018 (Appendix L). Biological field surveys were conducted in
the project vicinity by USFWS, NMFS, and USACE in November of 2013 to assess vegetation
cover types, existing habitat for special status and wildlife species, and the presence of special
status species and invasive plant species. A HEP analysis was conducted to quantify the
ecological benefits of the proposed alternatives. A summary of the HEP analysis is included in
Chapter 3 under the Plan Formulation discussion. The HEP analysis is included with the
document as Appendix F.

5.4.1

Final Report

Methodology and Basis of Significance
Methodology

Under NEPA, the significance of project impacts is a function of context and intensity.
For biological resources, context refers to the importance (ecological, commercial, scientific,
recreational, etc.) or regulatory (i.e. legally protected) status of the resource, and intensity refers
to the magnitude – scale and duration – of the impact. Both beneficial and adverse impacts are
recognized; either can be significant.
In the study area, the habitats of greatest importance are open water, tidal marsh, and tidal
freshwater emergent wetlands. These habitats are most important because of their scarcity and
high value to fish and wildlife species. Substantial long-term net reductions in the acreage
and/or value of these habitats would represent significant adverse impacts, underscoring the
importance to the ecosystem of the project’s contribution of new intertidal marsh converted from
lesser-valued open water or grassland habitat. Losses or gains of population and habitat for
special status species may also be significant, depending on the magnitude of the impact relative
to the population size and distribution of the species in the region. Finally, any impact leading to
new introductions or the expansion of invasive species would also be considered significant in
terms of potential far-reaching effects on the ecosystem of the project area.
Because the purpose of the project is habitat restoration, the habitat functions and values
that would be provided upon maturity of the habitats proposed for restoration are also described.
The project is designed to establish intertidal marsh habitat at the proposed restoration sites and
that context was considered in evaluating the impacts to vegetation and wildlife.
Basis of Significance
Adverse effects on vegetation and wildlife were considered significant if implementation
of an alternative plan would result in any of the following:
•

Result in a substantial loss of native vegetation or species.

•

Removal, or substantial disturbance of a sensitive natural community (wetlands, tidal
marsh)

•

Substantial reduction in the quality and quantity of important habitat or access to such
habitat for wildlife species.

5.4.2

Alternative 1 – No Action

Under the no action alternative, USACE would not participate in the construction of the
proposed project and the habitat condition of Big Break would remain unchanged. The no action
alternative assumes that no action would be taken by USACE to restore intertidal marsh habitat
at Big Break. As a result, Big Break would remain a sunken island and the open water condition
163

Final Report

would remain unchanged. It is assumed that restoration actions currently proposed under
California EcoRestore and other projects would still be constructed, but not at Big Break.
Therefore, overall, vegetation and wildlife in the study area are expected to remain similar to
existing conditions.

5.4.3

Alternative 2 – 160 Acres of Intertidal Marsh Restoration

Under Alternative 2, 160 acres of open water habitat would be converted to a
combination of freshwater intertidal marsh habitat and shallow water intertidal marsh habitat via
the direct placement of O&M dredged material, as described in Section 3.9.2. It is anticipated
that sensitive vegetative habitat types located on the periphery of Big Break such as existing tidal
marsh and riparian vegetation, would eventually be improved by removing the existing invasive
plant species on the remnant levee and replanting the levee with native riparian species.
Placement of dredged material would not directly affect the tidal marsh or riparian vegetation
because those construction activities would be restricted to open water, outside these habitats.
Habitat growth at Big Break would occur gradually over time as dredged material
placement occurs. Because dredged material placement is dependent on annual O&M dredging,
which is estimated to produce 100,000 cubic yards per year, project construction would require
approximately 5 years. Only clean dredged material found suitable for direct placement for the
purpose of habitat restoration, would be accepted at the project site. As the restoration site
progresses over time, the restored intertidal marsh would become established in 2 to 3 years and
provide valuable new habitat for fish and wildlife species.
The gain of higher value intertidal marsh habitat would more than offset the loss of open
water habitat (Table 5-1). Accordingly, permanent loss of open water habitat would result in a
less-than-significant impact. Because of uncertainties regarding the rate of intertidal marsh
vegetation development to offset the temporary loss of habitat values, a monitoring plan is
proposed as part the project to measure the establishment rate and the quality and quantity of
habitat gained. No avoidance or minimization measures would be required because the project’s
conversion of open water habitat to intertidal marsh habitat would result in a net increase in
ecological benefits over the life of the project, which is a positive environmental effect, and is
consistent with the San Francisco Estuary Project Comprehensive Conservation and
Management Plan, the Delta Plan, and other local land use plans in the Delta region. See Table
5-1 for net changes to habitat types.
Invasive plants are already present throughout the habitat types in the project area (Table
5-1). Construction activities could introduce new invasive plants to the project area or contribute
to the spread of existing invasive plants to uninfested areas outside the project area. Invasive
plants or their seeds may be dispersed by construction equipment if appropriate prevention
measures are not implemented. The introduction or spread of invasive plants as a result of the
project could have a significant effect on sensitive natural communities within and outside the
project area by displacing native flora. However, there would be two separate actions taking

place to deter the spread of invasive plants: aquatic vegetation plantings on the intertidal marsh

After dredged material placement and settlement, aquatic vegetation would be planted in
the sand mounds that would make up the new intertidal marsh habitat placed throughout the open
water area in Big Break. Plant material for the aquatic vegetation would be nursery grown or
collected from acceptable nearby sources to be directly planted on the sand mounds, encouraging
colonization before undesirable invasive/exotic vegetation to develop.
Prior to construction, removal of invasive plant species would occur on the remnant levee
using a gas-powered hedger. The cuttings would immediately be chipped, spread over the
ground as mulch, and exposed rootstock would then be treated with three treatments of herbicide
(approximately a month apart) in order to ensure the native plantings could be established
without competition. Riparian vegetation would be planted in place of the invasive plant species
that are currently occupying the area. The purpose of the new riparian vegetation plantings
would be to avoid the spread of invasive species into the newly created marsh habitat in Big
Break.
In addition to the creation of aquatic vegetation and riparian habitat, implementation of
the appropriate measures to avoid or minimize the spread or introduction of invasive plants
would ensure that the proposed alternative would not have a significant adverse effect on
sensitive natural communities from the introduction or spread of invasive plants. With
implementation of the measures listed in Section 5.2.5 below to avoid and minimize the spread
or introduction of invasive plant species, this would be a less-than-significant effect.
The permanent conversion of open water habitat to intertidal marsh habitat would result
in a substantial improvement to the wetland functions and values on the project site for fish and
wildlife, including special status species. The creation of intertidal marsh habitat within Big
165
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,

Delta Island and Levees Feasibility Study

Final Report

Break would likely create high-quality habitat for common species of amphibians, reptiles, birds,
and mammals. Common fish and wildlife species present within the study area may be directly
or indirectly affected by construction. Direct impacts may include mortality or injury to wildlife
present within the proposed sites due to dredged material placement, movement of heavy
equipment, and construction noise. Indirect impacts would include alteration of habitat
conditions after the completion of construction. The risk of a potential increase in the
bioavailability of contaminants carried in dredged materials is addressed in the water quality
section. Because the proposed restoration would benefit fish and wildlife species long-term, and
because avoidance and minimization measures would be implemented to reduce the potential
impacts associated with invasive species, the resulting effect is considered less than significant.

5.2.4

Alternative 3 – 340 Acres of Intertidal Marsh Restoration

Under Alternative 3, 340 acres of open water habitat would be converted to a
combination of freshwater intertidal marsh habitat and shallow water habitat via the direct
placement of dredged material, as described in Section 3.9.2. The material placement and
planting would all be consistent with the description for Alternative 2, with the exception that
project construction would occur over a 10 year period rather than a 5 year period and there
would be an increase in acreage. The change in acreages is displayed in Table 5-1 and compared
to the no action and Alternative 2 scenarios. Effects to vegetation and wildlife under Alternative
3 would be consistent with those described for Alternative 2, with greater long-term benefits
occurring over the life of the project.

5.2.5

Avoidance and Minimization Measures

The following measures would be implemented to reduce potential short-term impacts
that could result from the introduction or spread of invasive plant species as a result of project
construction:
•

The adjacent remnant levee would be treated to remove invasive species and riparian
vegetation would be established to prevent terrestrial invasive species from
populating and out-competing the intertidal marsh restoration.

•

Mowing and spraying would be implemented on the remnant levee to control and
reduce continued weed growth.

•

Invasive, noxious and/exotic plant species will be hand or mechanically collected
from the intertidal marsh restoration area, removed from the site, and properly
disposed.

•

The Monitoring and Adaptive Management Plan (Appendix D) would be
implemented to ensure restoration is successful.

Special Status Species

This section evaluates the effects of the proposed alternatives on special status species in
the project area. Initial evaluation determined that several species have the potential to occur, or
that suitable habitat exists, in the project area.

5.3.1

Methodology and Basis of Significance

Methodology
Special-status species are defined as animals that are legally protected under the FESA.
Based on the USFWS (2018) species list and CNDDB (California Department of Fish and
Wildlife 2018) records search in Contra Costa County for the affected area, eight special-status
plant and wildlife species were identified as having potential to occur in the affected area, which
are also included in Appendix G and Table 4-1:
•

Antioch Dunes evening-primrose;

•

Valley Elderberry Longhorn Beetle;

•

Giant Garter Snake;

•

North American green sturgeon southern DPS;

•

Delta Smelt;

•

Central Valley Steelhead DPS;

•

Chinook salmon, Central Valley spring-run ESU; and

•

Chinook salmon, Sacramento River winter-run.

Basis of Significance
Adverse effects on special status species were considered significant if implementation of
an alternative plan would:
•

Directly or indirectly reduce the growth, survival, or reproductive success of species
listed or proposed for listing as threatened or endangered under the FESA.

•

Directly or indirectly reduce the growth survival, or reproductive success of
substantial populations of Federal concern.

Alternative 1 – No Action

Under the no action alternative, USACE would not participate in the construction of the
proposed project and the habitat condition of Big Break would remain unchanged. The no action
alternative assumes that no action would be taken by USACE to restore intertidal marsh habitat
at Big Break. As a result, Big Break would remain a sunken island and the open water condition
would remain unchanged. It is assumed that restoration actions currently proposed under
California EcoRestore and other projects would still be constructed, but not at Big Break.
Therefore, overall, conditions for special status species in the study area are expected to remain
similar to existing conditions, and no long-term benefits would be realized from the restoration
of intertidal marsh habitat at Big Break.

5.3.3

Alternative 2 – 160 Acres of Intertidal Marsh Restoration

Special Status Plant Species
The construction disturbance areas would be largely confined to open water, therefore
there is a low potential for impacts to special‐status plants, including the Antioch Dunes eveningprimrose. However if this species is present on Jersey Island at the proposed staging area, or on
the remnant levee, project construction could result in its removal. If there happen to be
populations of the Antioch Dunes evening-primrose present on the remnant levee, invasive
species removal activities has the potential to remove special status plants as well. However,
removal of the existing invasive species would then provide more open habitat available for
potential use by the native plantings that would be implemented. This newly created open
habitat that is free of invasive species would create 50 acres of habitat, reducing competition for
the native species and providing more suitable opportunities for special status plants to remain
established. While there could be a potential negative effect to the Antioch Dunes eveningprimrose during invasive plant removal, there would ultimately be a beneficial effect to special
status plant species once existing invasive species are removed and native species are planted.
USACE would conduct surveys of the study area to document the presence of special
status plants before project implementation. Qualified botanists would conduct a floristic survey
that follows the CDFW botanical survey guidelines. If special status plant populations are
detected where construction would have unavoidable impacts, USACE will modify the project
design to avoid indirect or direct effects and/or prepare and implement avoidance and
minimization coordination with USFWS or CDFW. Such plans may include salvage,
propagation, on-site reintroduction in restored habitats, and monitoring. If there are no special
status plant populations detected during the preconstruction surveys, then there would be no
effects to special status plant species from implementation of Alternative 2.

Delta Island and Levees Feasibility Study

Final Report

Special-Status Fish Species
Effects of the proposed Project on special-status fish include both short- and long-term
effects. Short-term effects include direct impacts from construction activities (e.g., increased
suspended sediment and turbidity). Long-term or permanent impacts would result from the
conversion of open water habitat to higher value intertidal marsh habitat.
Short-term Effects on Fish Habitat and EFH
Construction would occur over a 5-year period during the summer and fall of each year, a
time when green sturgeon, delta smelt, and salmonid juveniles/smolts may be rearing and
outmigrating through the Delta, and when adult fish are likely to be moving upstream through
the Delta. Adult and juvenile fish primarily migrate upstream and downstream within the mainstem Sacramento and San Joaquin River. Juvenile fish may migrate from the Sacramento and
San Joaquin River to the central Delta during their downstream migration and may also inhabit
flooded islands as a temporary foraging area and migration pathway during the winter and early
spring migration period. The occurrence of any of the listed fish species in the Delta would be
expected to occur during late fall through early spring when Delta water temperatures would be
suitable for migration. Most notably, Delta smelt could be present in Big Break year-round.
Effects to juveniles and smolts during construction would be short-term during the two week
construction period. These effects are described in detail in the paragraphs below. The project
area is very small in comparison to the overall central Delta, and there is significant rearing and
feeding habitat present in adjacent aquatic areas.
The majority of adult Chinook salmon migrate upstream in the Sacramento River, there is
a probability, although low, that adults may migrate into the central Delta. The occurrence of
Chinook salmon in the central Delta, including Big Break would be limited to winter and early
spring adult upstream migration. Adult sDPS green sturgeon are not expected to be affected by
construction activity, since sDPS green sturgeon are believed to migrate in the deepest portions
of the channel (greater than 5 meters) and typically emigrate to the sea during the autumn and
winter (Erickson et al. 2002). Although the likelihood of sDPS green sturgeon occurring in the
Delta area low, every observation of green sturgeon juveniles or unidentified sturgeon larvae
have been in the Delta downstream from Old River (Beamesderfer et al., 2004).
When fish migration timing coincides with the in-water work window, the presence of
overhead equipment and the sound generated by construction activities could temporarily disrupt
essential behavior patterns (e.g., feeding, escape from predators, migration) of adult and juvenile
fish at the construction sites and the surrounding areas. Direct mortality of individuals could
occur to fish present during construction during the direct placement of dredged material into the
open water of Big Break. Placement of dredged sediment may also potentially disturb, injure, or
kill any fish migrating though the area of the construction sites during construction. Noise
effects may occur at the project site and general vicinity. Construction could result in elevated
levels of suspended sediment, causing increased turbidity and potential sedimentation of benthic
(bottom) habitat used by juvenile and adult fish for feeding, cover, and other essential behaviors.
However, 10 years of dredged material sampling has shown that the material is primarily fine
169
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
Sacramento District

September 2018

Delta Island and Levees Feasibility Study

Final Report

sand, which is known to settle without significant sedimentation, so it is unlikely that turbidity
would occur at levels that would harm green sturgeon and salmonid species. Due to material
characteristics (nearly all fine sand) turbidity would be limited (see Appendix C). An increase in
turbidity and decrease in water clarity would have potential beneficial effects if delta smelt
species are present. However, any turbidity effects would likely be minor in scope and
addressed through proposed BMPs and the Section 401 Water Quality Certification process.
Slower moving benthic organisms that are food sources for fish would be buried by
dredged material and potentially from placement and anchoring of the dredge pipelines. These
areas affected should recover quickly after placement of the dredged material and removal of the
pipelines as these areas are recolonized by benthic organisms. Survival studies at the nearby
Donlon Island project demonstrated that benthic organisms recolonized within a two year period,
providing sufficient primary productivity (food web) benefits (USACE and USFWS 1990).
Resulting short-term effects could include reduced feeding success, and compromised
ability to escape from predators. Toxic substances used by construction equipment including
gasoline and diesel, lubricants, and other petroleum-based products, could enter the waterways
adjacent to the project site as a result of spills or leakage from machinery or storage containers.
The contractor would be required to submit and adhere to a Storm Water Pollution Prevention
Plan (SWPPP) and an in-water work plan subject to approval by the Central Valley RWQCB.
The SWPPP and associated BMPs are discussed further in the Water Quality section (Section
5.4.5). Mortality or physiological impairment of fish or disruption of essential behavior patterns
is possible if exposure to sufficient concentrations occurs.
Essential fish habitat encompasses all types of aquatic habitat where fish spawn, breed,
feed, or grow to maturity. The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) works with regional
fishery management councils to identify EFH of every federally listed species and it has
currently been identified for approximately 1,000 fish species (NMFS, 2018). The proposed
project would be converting approximately 160 acres of open water habitat in Big Break to
intertidal marsh habitat. Approximately 112 acres would become more shallow water habitat
and the remaining acreage would be used for riparian habitat. The shallow water habitat would
be created by coarse grained dredge slurry in the form of sand mounds throughout the open
water. Shallow water habitat resulting from the sand mounds would range from the existing
sediment bed currently existing at Big Break to the mean water elevation for 4 to 8 feet,
depending on tides and outflows. Following dredged material placement and the creation of the
sand mounds, vegetation would be plated to provide locations for native emergent marsh
vegetation. The combination of sand mounds and vegetation would provide more habitat
diversity and stability for juvenile Chinook salmon to continue their life cycles. Fish would be
able to use the shallow waters for spawning and the vegetation as cover for increased protection.
While there is the potential for short-term adverse effects, but long-term benefits to Pacific
Salmon EFH, NMFS has indicated in their concurrence letter on June 15, 2018 that the proposed
restoration is not likely to adversely affect Pacific salmon EFH.

Final Report

Short-term direct impacts to special status fish would be considered significant, if
construction were to occur outside of the species work windows. However, USACE would
adhere to the specified species work windows from USFWS and NMFS for fish species. As a
result, the project may affect, but not likely to adversely affect short term effects on fish habitat
and EFH, as all work would be occurring outside of the species migration season.
Long-term Effects on Fish Habitat and EFH
The restoration of intertidal marsh habitat would increase instream structure and aquatic
habitat complexity and the quality of EFH. Planted marsh vegetation would begin to colonize
the shallow water habitat created by dredged material placement and gradually cover the site.
These combined factors would provide high quality habitat for all life stages of all species
present in the study area and most life stages of special status fishes. The intertidal marsh habitat
would provide escape cover, creating ideal refugia from large predators for small larval and
juvenile fishes. The intertidal marsh habitat would be especially valuable as holding and rearing
habitat for all life stages of all special-status species. Inundated intertidal marsh habitat should
also provide an increase in potential delta smelt spawning habitat. Overall, the proposed
alternative would have a net long-term benefit for all life stages of all special-status species,
which would result in less-than-significant long-term impacts.
Special Status Wildlife Species
A small number of special status wildlife species could occur on Jersey Island that have
the potential to be affected by the pipeline crossing and staging area. Effects to special status
wildlife species are discussed in the subsections below.
Effects to Migratory Bird Species
Noise, vibration, visual, and proximity-related disturbances associated with construction
could adversely affect special status bird species if they are nesting on or adjacent to the
restoration site during construction. Since construction would occur in the August 1 through
October 31 time period outside of the spring nesting season, it is unlikely that nesting birds
would be present. However, if individuals of these species nest during the construction period,
construction disturbances could cause them to abandon their nests or young. The breeding
success of these species could be diminished if disturbances reduce ability of adults to properly
care for their young. Therefore this impact is considered significant. To reduce this impact to a
less-than-significant level, avoidance and minimization measures, as discussed in Section 5.3.5
below, would be implemented.
Emergent intertidal marsh habitat, riparian habitat, and shallow water (less than 6 inches
deep) are important foraging and resting habitat areas for both shorebirds and migratory bird
species. The project has the potential to create mudflat habitat by the placement of dredged
material before intertidal marsh vegetation becomes established, but the existing open water
habitat and the newly created tidal marsh and riparian habitat would provide a beneficial impact
171
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
Sacramento District

September 2018

Delta Island and Levees Feasibility Study

Final Report

to affected birds. The benthic organisms that colonize the potential mudflat and shallow open
water areas would become prey for shorebirds and some migratory birds that use the open water
for foraging aquatic species. With the creation of new intertidal marsh habitat from dredge
placement and riparian habitat located on the remnant levee, there would be a long-term increase
in diversity of all types of wildlife. This diversity would create an environment that harbors
more prey for birds to forage and more habitat for birds to nest. Although there would not be
any effects to migratory bird species long-term, the proposed project has the potential to have
short-term negative effects to both shorebird and migratory bird species while construction
activities are occurring. However, construction activities only occur for two weeks out of the
year and overall there would be a beneficial long-term effect to bird species utilizing Jersey
Island and Big Break once construction is completed.
Effects to Special Status Reptiles
Project activities on Jersey Island could potentially affect the Federally threatened giant
garter snake. While this portion of the Delta has been considered to be a gap between giant
garter snake populations in the past, in 2015 multiple giant garter snakes were observed on the
east end of Jersey Island, as noted in the USFWS Biological Opinion (Appendix G). While there
is the potential for occurrences of giant garter snake, no giant garter snake habitat would be
affected by project implementation and no compensatory mitigation would be required.
Construction of the marsh restoration will be annually timed in accordance to the
proposed dredging operation. The dredging schedule is heavily influenced by special status fish
species work windows, locations of sediment that requires dredging, and scheduling the timing
of the operation based on location within the channel (i.e., dredging operation begins
downstream and moves upstream). Additionally, if there is a single contractor for both ship
channels, the Sacramento DWSC must be dredged first due to Delta smelt entrainment concerns.
As a result, it is not possible to schedule construction to incorporate the typical giant garter snake
active window. However, there would be no ground disturbing activities (i.e.,
digging/excavation) associated with this action and work occurring outside of the active period
would likely be less impactful to snakes. During the inactive period, snakes are expected to be
hibernating in their burrows and would not be affected by project activities. If work occurs
within the active window, there is the potential for construction-related effects to giant garter
snakes.
Activities on Jersey Island that could potentially affect giant garter snake include
construction of road improvements for hauling and vehicular access and installation and removal
of the dredging pipeline alongside the edge of the haul road. These activities could potentially
disturb, injure, or kill any snakes using the drainage ditches, staging area, or roadways on Jersey
Island. Additionally, noise effects may occur in these areas to disturb any giant garter snakes
that may be present. Installation and removal of the pipeline each year could potentially crush
snakes that are present along the edge of the roadway.

Delta Island and Levees Feasibility Study

Final Report

Prior to each construction season, the roadway and staging area would be surveyed to
ensure that no snakes are present. With preconstruction surveys and the other minimization
measures discussed below, the project would reduce impacts to giant garter snakes to less than
significant.

5.3.4

Alternative 3 – 340 Acres of Intertidal Marsh Restoration

Under Alternative 3, 340 acres of open water habitat would be converted to a
combination of freshwater intertidal marsh habitat and shallow water habitat via the direct
placement of dredged material, as described in Section 3.9.2. The material placement and
planting would all be consistent with the description for Alternative 2, with the exception that
project construction would occur over a 10 year period rather than a 5 year period and there
would be an increase by 180 acres. Effects to special status species under Alternative 3 would be
consistent with those described for Alternative 2, with greater long-term benefits occurring over
the life of the project.

5.3.5

Avoidance and Minimization Measures

Special Status Fish Species
The following measures would be implemented to reduce short-term impacts to special
status fish species, from construction of the proposed alternatives:
•

During construction, stockpiling of construction materials, portable equipment,
vehicles, and supplies would be restricted to the designated construction staging
areas.

•

A qualified biologist shall provide worker environmental awareness training to
contractors and construction crews regarding all special status fish species known to
potentially occur near the construction sites.

•

A representative (onsite monitor) shall be appointed by USACE to be the point of
contact for any worker who observes a dead, injured, or entrapped special status fish.
Dead or injured fish shall be photographed and the photographs provided to USACE,
NMFS, and USFWS. If a live specimen is captured in good condition, and a positive
identification cannot be made in the field because of size or lack of other
distinguishing characteristics, the fish shall be immediately returned to the river
downstream of the construction site.

•

Sacrificial straw bales would be placed to provide barriers to the predominant flow
paths allowing for sediment to settle and sand mounds to stabilize. Straw bales are
anticipated to persist for 1 to 2 years, giving sufficient time for vegetative
establishment.
173

U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,

Delta Island and Levees Feasibility Study

Final Report

•

No aquatic pesticides would be used to treat aquatic invasive species.

•

Construction would occur within the scheduled work windows as much as practicable
in order to avoid adverse impacts to special status species.

Migratory Bird Species
USACE would conduct surveys to locate nest sites for migratory bird species in suitable
breeding habitats in the spring of each construction year. Surveys will be conducted by a
qualified biologist using survey methods approved by USFWS. Survey results will be submitted
to USFWS before construction is initiated. If nests or young of these species are not located,
construction may proceed. If nest sites or young are located, USACE will consult with USFWS
and CDFW to determine what avoidance and minimization measures could be implemented to
avoid or reduce potential disturbance-related impacts to these species. Measures could include a
no-disturbance buffer zone established around the nest site. The width of the buffer zone would
be determined by a qualified biologist in coordination with the USFWS. No construction
activities would occur within the buffer zone. The buffer zone would be maintained until the
young have fledged (as determined by a qualified biologist).
Special Status Reptile Species
The following avoidance and minimization measures are proposed for the protection of
the giant garter snake and its aquatic habitat:

5.4

•

The construction area will be surveyed for giant garter snakes 24 hours prior to
construction activities by a qualified biologist each construction season. Survey of the
project area would be repeated if a lapse in construction activity of two weeks or greater
occurs. If a giant garter snake is encountered during construction, then activities would
cease until appropriate corrective measures have been completed or it has been
determined that the snake would not be harmed.

•

Construction personnel would receive environmental awareness training to instruct
workers on how to recognize giant garter snakes and their habitat.
Water Quality

This section evaluates the effects of the proposed alternatives on the water resources,
surface and ground water quality conditions, and jurisdictional wetlands in the project area.
Qualitative effects on water quality were estimated based on construction practices and
materials, location, and duration of construction. Standard pollution prevention measures
including erosion and sediment control measures, proper control of non-stormwater discharges,
and hazardous spill prevention and response measures would be implemented as part of the
project design.

Final Report

Methodology and Basis of Significance

Methodology
Effects on water quality resources were analyzed qualitatively based on existing water
quality monitoring data associated with the annual Stockton DWSC O&M dredging project.
Coordination with the CVRWQCB would occur prior to placement to determine if additional
testing would be required. This coordination would evaluate the source material for hazardous
substance thresholds as applied to in-water fill material and determine if project placement
activities would affect water quality. In addition to reviewing water quality monitoring data,
USACE reviewed sediment sampling data and determined that the dredged material primarily
consists of fine sand, which is expected to result in less turbidity than previously anticipated
during the draft EIS. As a result, the Corps has reassessed the water quality analysis and
proposed BMPs since the draft report phase and adjusted accordingly.
Basis of Significance
Adverse effects on water quality were considered significant if implementation of an
alternative plan would:
•

Substantially degrade surface water quality such that it would violate criteria or
objectives identified in the CVRWQCB basin plan or otherwise substantially degrade
water quality to the detriment of beneficial uses.

•

Adversely affect salinity flow patterns at water conveyance facilities (affect the X2
line).

•

Disturb existing channel banks, channel beds, or levees to the extent that erosion and
sedimentation could be accelerated.

•

Remove, fill, or substantially disturb a jurisdictional wetland.

5.4.2

Alternative 1 – No Action

Under the no action alternative, USACE would not participate in the construction of the
proposed project and the water quality condition of Big Break would remain unchanged. The no
action alternative assumes that no action would be taken by USACE to restore intertidal marsh
habitat at Big Break. As a result, Big Break would remain a sunken island and the open water
condition would remain unchanged. It is assumed that restoration actions currently proposed
under California EcoRestore and other projects would still be constructed, but not at Big Break.
Additionally, other proposed actions such as the California WaterFix would likely still be
constructed and could affect the water quality conditions in the Delta, rendering uncertainty in
the future condition of the Delta. No long-term benefits would be realized from the restoration
of intertidal marsh habitat at Big Break.

Final Report

Alternative 2 – 160 Acres of Intertidal Marsh Restoration

At the restoration site silt curtains, hay bales, or similar tools would be used to keep the
dredged material contained within the placement zone and to direct flows, as needed, to best
support the restoration. Prior to construction USACE would obtain a CWA Section 401
Certification from the CVRWQCB. The conditions set forth in the certification would be
followed to prevent adverse effects to water quality. Water quality monitoring would occur
during construction activities to ensure that the project is in compliance with the terms of the
Section 401 Water Quality Certification. Section 401 Certifications for similar projects included
monitoring to comply with the Basin Plan, reporting monitoring results, and maintaining low
turbidity, pH, and DO levels. In addition, it would be likely be a requirement of the Section 401
Certification to monitor the 303(d) list pollutants for the area.
Coordination with the CVRWQCB would establish construction requirements to prevent
violation of water quality standards set forth in the Basin Plan and to ensure that water quality is
not substantially degraded through project activities. Standard dredging protocol for testing of
material prior to dredging activities will be followed. This protocol includes the testing of
materials before dredging begins to determine if they meet standards for placement in water and
upland areas. If material being dredged meets the criteria, it would be used to create the
intertidal marsh habitat. If material does not meet the water quality standards, it would be
processed under the dredging standards and not used for this project. The placement of material
to restore intertidal marsh habitat at Big Break would not affect salinity in the study area and
would not affect the X2 line, which is typically downstream of the project area. Sediment
acquired from the DWSC Dredging program would not contain salinity levels that would affect
or adjust the salinity in the Big Break area or elsewhere in the Delta. No channel banks, channel
beds, or levees would be altered in a way that would cause additional erosion. As a result,
effects to water quality from implementation of Alternative 2 would be less than significant, with
the implementation of the conditions of the Section 401 Certification.

5.4.4

Alternative 3 – 340 Acres of Intertidal Marsh Restoration

Under Alternative 3, 340 acres of open water habitat would be converted to a
combination of freshwater intertidal marsh habitat and shallow water habitat via the direct
placement of dredged material, as described in Section 3.9.2. The material placement and
planting would all be consistent with the description for Alternative 2, with the exception that
project construction would occur over a 10 year period rather than a 5 year period and there
would be an increase in acreage. Effects to water quality under Alternative 3 would be
consistent with those described for Alternative 2.

Final Report

Avoidance and Minimization Measures

The contractor would be required to obtain a Construction General Permit and prepare
and implement Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) for upland work areas and an
in-water work plan. The SWPPP and in-water work plan details actions that would be taken
during construction to reduce the risk of discharge into waterway and avoidance and
minimization measures that would be taken in the event of an unforeseen spill. The Section 401
Certification permit would be issued by the CVRWQCB prior to construction. USACE will
review the terms and conditions of the 401 Certification and will implement them if they are
within the authority of USACE to implement. The SWPPP and an in-water work plan would be
implemented to minimize water quality impacts.

5.5

Air Quality

This section evaluates the effects of the proposed alternatives on air quality in the project
vicinity. Both construction and operation emissions were estimated and then compared with
Federal air quality criteria for the area. Based on the results of the comparison, avoidance and
minimization measures are identified to offset and/or reduce air quality emissions from the
project. Big Break is within the San Francisco Bay Area Air Basin, which is regulated by the
Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD).

5.5.1

Methodology and Basis of Significance

Methodology
To complete the analysis, information was collected on projected construction activities,
duration, and timing, equipment use, and activities for the first construction year. Only the first
construction year was modeled because, due to the addition of invasive plant treatment and
riparian planting on the remnant levee, the first construction year would have a greater total
output of emissions than any other construction year. As a result, since air quality impacts are
considered on an annual basis, if the proposed alternatives are in compliance in year one, they
would be in compliance for all construction years.
Emissions associated with vehicle exhaust for employee commute vehicles and delivery
trucks were estimated using the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District
(SMAQMD) Road Construction Emission Model Version 8.1 (May 2016) (Appendix I).
Emissions associated with marine equipment such as boats were estimated using the SMAQMD
Harborcraft, Dredge, and Barge Emission Factor Calculator Version 1.0 (July 2017). Though the
proposed alternatives are located in the BAAQMD, the SMAQMD tools were selected for use
because the proposed construction is a linear, short-term action that is better suited for the Road
Construction Emission Model. The Harborcraft Emission Calculator is a new tool recently
developed by SMAQMD that is specifically geared toward construction projects involving boats,
177

Final Report

dredges, and barges, therefore since the majority of the study area is aquatic, it was ideal for this
proposed construction scenario.
Construction equipment usage from similar projects was analyzed to estimate daily and
annual exhaust emissions. Emissions are considered significant if emissions exceed the
thresholds established by the applicable air quality agencies. Modeling assumptions for each
project alternative and methodology are provided in Appendix I.
The following emission sources and activities were analyzed:
•

On-site construction off-road equipment emissions (all criteria pollutants).

•

Off-site worker vehicle emissions (all criteria pollutants.

•

On-site pickup trucks and off-site worker vehicles entrained fugitive dust emissions
for paved and unpaved road entrained dust (PM10 and PM2.5).

•

Emissions from marine vessels such as boats for construction and site access during
post construction monitoring.

Basis of Significance
Adverse effects on air quality were considered significant if implementation of an
alternative plan would:
•

Conflict with or obstruct implementation of an applicable air quality plan.

•

Violate any air quality standard or contributes substantially to an existing or projected
air quality violation.

•

Result in a cumulatively considerable net increase of any criteria pollutant for which
the project is in nonattainment under applicable Federal ambient air quality standards
(including releasing emissions which exceed quantitative thresholds for ozone
precursors).

•

Expose sensitive receptors to substantial pollutant concentrations.

•

Create objectionable odors affecting a substantial number of people.

State Implementation Plan and General Conformity De Minimis Thresholds
The USEPA developed the General Conformity Rule, which became effective on January
31, 1994, to implement Section 176c of the Federal CCA. The underlying principle of the
General Conformity Rule is that Federal actions must not cause or contribute to any violation of
a NAAQS. A conformity determination is required for each pollutant where the total of direct
and indirect emissions caused by a Federal action in a nonattainment area could exceed de
minimis threshold levels listed in the General Conformity Rule (40 CFR 93.153). If the total

direct emissions associated with the project are below the de minimis levels indicated in Table 52, general conformity requirements do not apply, and the project is considered in conformity and
would not result in an adverse effect.

Federal actions need to demonstrate conformity to any SIPs of the regional air basin.
Each action must be reviewed to determine whether it: 1) qualifies for an exemption listed in the
General Conformity Rule (GCR); 2) results in emissions that are below GCR de minimis
emissions thresholds; or 3) would produce emissions above the GCR de minimis thresholds
applicable to the specific area. The General Conformity de minimis levels for this project are
shown below (Table 5-2). These thresholds were applied to the project’s estimated emissions and
used to determine effect significance as detailed below.
Because the project region is in attainment for the criteria pollutants indicated in Table 52 except ozone (serious), PM10 (moderate), and PM2.5 a conformity assessment must be
completed. That assessment will evaluate whether the project’s construction or operational
emissions would exceed 25 tons per year of ROG or NOX, or 100 tons per year of PM10 or PM2.5.
BAAQMD Thresholds
The BAAQMD thresholds of significance were obtained from the CEQA Guide to Air
Quality Assessment, which lists a threshold of 54 pounds per day or 10 tons per year for ROG,
NOX, and PM2.5 construction emissions and a PM10 threshold of 82 pounds per day or 15 tons per
year (BAAQMD 2010). Table 5.3 shows the thresholds for criteria pollutants for the BAAQMD.
There are no quantitative thresholds for construction dust emissions; instead, impacts are
considered less than significant if the BAAQMD Best Management Practices are employed to
control dust during construction activities, including excavation.
The BAAQMD TAC threshold is an increased cancer risk of more than 10 in 1,000,000
for a person with maximum exposure potential and increased non-cancer risk of 1.0 Hazard
Index (chronic or acute). The BAAQMD also has a concentration threshold of 0.3 μg/m3 for
PM2.5. These thresholds are applicable to both construction emissions and operations emissions.
Unlike the volume-based thresholds for criteria air pollutants, the TAC thresholds are used for
179

Final Report

specific receptor locations when a risk analysis is required for specific project components, such
as stationary sources or the use of diesel-powered equipment, including construction equipment.
There are no sensitive receptors located in the vicinity of the Delta Study alternatives, therefore
there would be no impacts associated with TAC exposures due to implementation of this project.
The 2010 BAAQMD CEQA Guidelines recommend analyzing localized CO
concentrations for projects that would increase traffic volumes at affected intersections to more
than 44,000 vehicles per hour. However, given the minimal increase in vehicle trips due to newly
required maintenance activities, the proposed project would not affect local CO concentrations
during operations. Therefore, CO concentrations have not been quantified in this analysis.
BAAQMD considers projects that exceed these criteria air pollutant standards also to
result in a cumulatively considerable air quality impact upon the region. According to
BAAQMD, no further cumulative analysis should be required beyond the analysis of whether a
proposed project’s impacts would contribute considerably to ambient levels of pollutants or
GHGs. Analysis of effects from GHGs is included in the Climate Change section below (Section
5.6).

Alternative 1 – No Action

Under the no action alternative, USACE would not participate in the construction of the
proposed project and the air quality condition would remain unchanged. The no action
alternative assumes that no action would be taken by USACE to restore intertidal marsh habitat
at Big Break. It is assumed that restoration actions currently proposed under California
EcoRestore and other projects would still be constructed, but not at Big Break. Additionally,
other proposed actions such as the California WaterFix would likely still be constructed and
could affect the air quality conditions in the Delta, rendering uncertainty in the future condition
of the Delta. No long-term benefits would be realized from the restoration of intertidal marsh
habitat at Big Break.

Separate tables were not generated for Alternative 3 because emissions would remain the
same on an annual and daily basis. The only difference between alternatives is the increase in
timeframe by five years; therefore the emissions table applies to both alternatives. Based on the
emissions estimates summary in Table 5-4, Alternatives 2 and 3 would not exceed any of the
BAAQMD air quality emissions thresholds. As a result, there would be no significant impact to
air quality under either of the alternatives.

5.5.4

Alternative 3 – 340 Acres of Intertidal Marsh Restoration

Under Alternative 3, 340 acres of open water habitat would be converted to a
combination of freshwater intertidal marsh habitat and shallow water habitat via the direct
placement of dredged material, as described in Section 3.9.2. The material placement and
planting would all be consistent with the description for Alternative 2, with the exception that
project construction would occur over a 10 year period rather than a 5 year period and there
would be an increase in acreage. Effects to air quality under Alternative 3 would be consistent
with those described for Alternative 2, except that the described annual emissions would occur
for 10 years instead of 5 years. Long-term, there would be incidental benefits to air quality from
the addition of 90 acres of vegetated marsh in the project area.

5.5.5

Avoidance and Minimization Measures

Based on the estimates shown in Tables 5-5 through 5-6, construction would result in the
temporary increase in emissions of criteria pollutants. In order to reduce the emissions to less
than significant, the contractor would be required to implement the BAAQMD avoidance and
minimization measures. In addition, USACE would require the project’s contractors to

Final Report

implement the additional BMPs to further reduce the emissions from the project. The Delta
Study would not exceed any local air quality thresholds or the Federal de minimis thresholds.
BAAQMD Avoidance and Minimization Measures
In accordance with BAAQMD guidelines, all proposed projects should implement the
avoidance and minimization measures listed below, whether or not construction-related
emissions exceed applicable thresholds. These measures are expected to reduce emissions from
fugitive dust, vehicles, and equipment below the emissions estimated in Table 5-5.
•

All exposed surfaces (e.g., parking areas, staging areas, soil piles, graded areas, and
unpaved access roads) shall be watered two times per day.

•

All haul trucks transporting soil, sand, or other loose material off-site shall be
covered.

•

All visible mud or dirt track-out onto adjacent public roads shall be removed using
wet power vacuum street sweepers at least once per day. The use of dry power
sweeping is prohibited.

•

All vehicle speeds on unpaved roads shall be limited to 15 mph.

•

All roadways, driveways, and sidewalks to be paved shall be completed as soon as
possible. Building pads shall be laid as soon as possible after grading unless seeding
or soil binders are used.

•

Idling times shall be minimized either by shutting equipment off when not in use or
reducing the maximum idling time to 5 minutes (as required by the California
airborne toxics control measure Title 13, Section 2485 of California Code of
Regulations [CCR]). Clear signage shall be provided for construction workers at all
access points.

•

All construction equipment shall be maintained and properly tuned in accordance
with manufacturer’s specifications. All equipment shall be checked by a certified
visible emissions evaluator.

•

Post a publicly visible sign with the telephone number and person to contact at the
lead agency regarding dust complaints. This person shall respond and take corrective
action within 48 hours. The Air District‘s phone number shall also be visible to
ensure compliance with applicable regulations.

Recommended Exhaust Emission Avoidance and Minimization Measures
The project will ensure that emissions from all off-road diesel powered equipment used
on the project site do not exceed 40% opacity for more than three minutes in any one hour. Any
equipment found to exceed 40 percent opacity (or Ringelmann 2.0) shall be repaired
immediately. Non-compliant equipment will be documented and a summary provided to USACE
and BAAQMD monthly. A visual survey of all in-operation equipment shall be made at least
183

Delta Island and Levees Feasibility Study

Final Report

weekly, and a monthly summary of the visual survey results shall be submitted throughout the
duration of the project, except that the monthly summary shall not be required for any 30-day
period in which no construction activity occurs. The monthly summary shall include the quantity
and type of vehicles surveyed as well as the dates of each survey.
Use of Electric Equipment
Construction equipment powered by electricity, rather than diesel fuel, eliminates criteria
pollutant emissions from diesel combustion. USACE will encourage the use of electric
equipment during construction.

Climate Change

This section identifies the basis of significance for impacts to climate change, discusses
how these criteria are determined for NEPA, provides specific emissions standards, thresholds,
or other measurements for the various pollutants and, as necessary, applicable avoidance and
minimization measures.

5.6.1

Methodology and Basis of Significance

Methodology
The methods for evaluating impacts are intended to satisfy Federal and State
requirements, including NEPA. As discussed in the air quality assessment (Section 5.2.4),
emissions were estimated based on the type of equipment being used, the level of equipment
activity, and the associated construction schedules.
Emissions associated with vehicle exhaust for employee commute vehicles and delivery
trucks were estimated using the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District
(SMAQMD) Road Construction Emission Model Version 8.1 (May 2016) (Appendix I).
Emissions associated with marine equipment such as boats were estimated using the SMAQMD
Harborcraft, Dredge, and Barge Emission Factor Calculator Version 1.0 (July 2017). Though the
proposed alternatives are located in the BAAQMD, the SMAQMD tools were selected for use
because the proposed construction is a linear, short-term action that is better suited for the Road
Construction Emission Model. The Harborcraft Emission Calculator is a new tool recently
developed by SMAQMD that is specifically geared toward construction projects involving boats,
dredges, and barges, therefore since the majority of the study area is aquatic, it was ideal for this
proposed construction scenario.
In addition, the following four criteria were considered and incorporated into the GHG
analysis:

184
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,

Delta Island and Levees Feasibility Study

Final Report

•

Is the design of the proposed project inherently energy efficient?

•

Are all applicable BMPs that would reduce GHG emissions incorporated into the
design of the proposed project?

•

Would the proposed project implement or fund its fair share of a mitigation strategy
designed to alleviate climate change?

•

Would implementing the proposed project improve processes or efficiency, resulting
in a net reduction of GHG emissions?

Basis of Significance
BAAQMD has established a GHG emissions threshold for land use development projects
of 1,100 metric tons per year of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions and for stationary
source projects of 10,000 metric tons per year of CO2e. Additionally, the proposed project could
result in significant impacts if it would:
•

Generate GHG emissions, either directly or indirectly, that may have a significant
impact on the environment.

•

Conflict with an applicable plan, policy, or regulation adopted for the purpose of
reducing the emissions of GHGs.

No existing threshold levels for GHGs have been developed at the Federal level for
NEPA projects. USEPA has established a reporting threshold of 25,000 metric tons of CO2 that
applies to stationary sources that emit more than 25,000 metric tons per year. On February 18,
2010, the White House CEQ released draft guidance regarding the consideration of GHGs in
NEPA documents for Federal actions. The draft guidelines include a presumptive threshold of
25,000 metric tons of CO2e emissions from a proposed action to trigger a quantitative analysis.
Sea Level Rise
A sea level rise assessment is included in the Engineering Appendix (Appendix C) and
includes an assessment on how sea level rise would affect the future with project condition. The
emergent marsh habitat constructed in the Recommended Plan is anticipated to be sustainable
and resilient to sea level rise. Emergent marsh habitat accrues sediment through lowering flow
velocities; as sea level and thus Delta water levels slowly rise, vegetation should adjust to the
new water levels and continue to recruit sediments over time, raising the marsh level, and so on.
ESA PWA and AECOM (2010) cite Orr et al. (2003) accretion rates for restored freshwater
wetlands (low and mid marsh) in the Delta of 9 to 18 mm/yr across several decades.
Based on the sea level rise analysis (Appendix C Attachment HH-A) 50 yr and 100 yr sea
level rise rates can be compared to the Orr et al. accretion rates.

Analysis of Table 5-7 shows that the low to high sea level rise rates in the 50 year
planning horizon are less than the reference accretion rates, thus sea level rise is not expected to
adversely affect project performance in the planning horizon. Table 5-7 also shows that only the
high rate of SLR approaches the high accretion estimate for the 100 year horizon. If 1.

accretion rates occurred such that accretion did not outpace or match relative changes in water
surface elevation, then the zone currently attributed to Marsh Wren habitat would slowly
transition to shallow water habitat for other species.
The existing condition of the site is open water with degraded habitat value provided in
the varying elevation zones. The future with project habitat will provide significant variation
and improvement upon the future without project throughout the different elevation zones. The
future without project condition with sea level rise would be deeper open water with degraded
habitat value, as the future without project conditions do not include the necessary parameters
(i.e., restoration of marsh vegetation) to function as a sediment trap and organic material source.
Research indicates that the future with project condition with sea level rise will result in
sediment accretion rates of 9 to 18 mm/yr sustained over several decades (Orr et al., 2003; DWR
186
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
Sacramento District

Delta Island and Levees Feasibility Study

Final Report

2010). Since sediment accretion is expected to occur at a sustained rate, the functional habitat in
each elevation zone is also expected to be sustainable over the life of the project. As a result, the
future with project condition will provide increased habitat value over the future without project
condition.
5.6.2

Alternative 1 – No Action

Under the no action alternative, USACE would not participate in the construction of the
proposed project and the climate change conditions would remain unchanged. The no action
alternative assumes that no action would be taken by USACE to restore intertidal marsh habitat
at Big Break. It is assumed that restoration actions currently proposed under California
EcoRestore and other projects would still be constructed, but not at Big Break. Additionally,
other proposed actions such as the California WaterFix would likely still be constructed and
could affect the climate change conditions in the Delta, rendering uncertainty in the future
condition of the Delta. No long-term benefits would be realized from the restoration of intertidal
marsh habitat at Big Break.

5.6.3

Alternative 2 – 160 Acres of Intertidal Marsh Restoration

During construction, GHG emissions would be emitted from the project due to fuel
combustion from marine vessels and construction equipment, and workforce vehicles. Workers
would commute from their homes to the construction site and park in one of the staging areas.
While the emissions associated with this alternative would not violate the local GHG
reporting threshold of 1,100 metric tons per year, these emissions would still contribute to the
overall cumulative GHG emissions, as discussed in the cumulative analysis discussion below
(Section 5.10). As a result, USACE would implement avoidance and minimization measures, as
discussed below, to increase this alternative’s energy efficiency and further reduce the GHG
emissions from this alternative. Consequently, this alternative’s GHG emissions, with avoidance
and minimization measures, would be reduced from the estimated emission levels.
Marshes are widely recognized as some of the most productive ecosystems on earth, with
primary productivity that rivals industrialized agriculture (Mitch and Gosselink, 2000). Mature
tidal marshes can produce up to 8,000 metric tons of plant material per year (Mitch and
Gosselink 2000), a process by which plants continually remove CO2 from the atmosphere and
convert it to plant material. Marsh grasses and other macrophytes, microalgae on the mud
surface, and phytoplankton are the three primary components of the natural community that
remove CO2. While some of this annual productivity will be consumed or decompose and
therefore not stored for the long-term, some percentage of this carbon accumulates and is
sequestered in tidal marsh soils. When stored in the soil, the carbon is taken out of the system as
decomposition rates under anaerobic conditions are low. As a result, wetland soils are wellknown as major carbon-storing ecosystems (Brigham, et al. 2006, Chmura, et al. 2003).
Experiments on Twitchell Island resulted in the sequestration of an estimated 3 metric tons of
CO2 per acre of mature tidal marsh per year (USGS 2007). As a result, Alternative 2 has the
187
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
Sacramento District

September 2018

Delta Island and Levees Feasibility Study

Final Report

potential to remove 135 metric tons of CO2 per year following vegetation establishment to the
point of maturity.
Carbon sequestration associated with the restoration of tidal marsh habitat would result in
net avoided GHG emissions since the project is schedule to be constructed over 5 years. Based
on a review of this alternative, the following can be determined:
•

The construction-related and operational GHG emissions would not conflict with or be
inconsistent with any current plan to reduce or mitigate GHGs.

•

Emissions would not exceed 25,000 metric tons of CO2e per year.

•

Implementation of the project has the potential to contribute to a lower carbon future.

Based on this evaluation, Alternative 2 emissions would likely be offset to a substantial
degree by avoided future GHG emissions by a lower carbon future. This impact would be less
than significant under NEPA especially with the application of avoidance and minimization
measures.

5.6.4

Alternative 3 – 340 Acres of Intertidal Marsh Restoration

Under Alternative 3, 340 acres of open water habitat would be converted to a
combination of freshwater intertidal marsh habitat and shallow water habitat via the direct
placement of dredged material, as described in Section 3.9.2. The material placement and
planting would all be consistent with the description for Alternative 2, with the exception that
project construction would occur over a 10 year period rather than a 5 year period and there
would be an increase in acreage. Effects to climate change under Alternative 3 would be
consistent with those described for Alternative 2, except that the described annual emissions
would occur for 10 years instead of 5 years. Long-term, there would be incidental benefits to
climate change from the addition of 90 acres of vegetated marsh in the project area. As
described in the study of sequestered CO2 above (USGS 2007), Alternative 3 has the potential to
remove approximately 270 metric tons of CO2 per year following vegetation establishment to the
point of maturity for the full footprint.
As stated in Alternative 2, carbon sequestration associated with the restoration of tidal
marsh habitat has the potential to offset GHG emissions produced from construction activities
since the project is scheduled to be constructed over 10 years. Alternative 3 would not conflict
with current plans to reduce GHG emissions, it would not exceed the local or federal threshold
for GHG emissions, and it has the potential to contribute to a lower carbon future due to
sequestration. Based on this evaluation, GHG impacts from the construction of Alternative 3
would be less than significant.
A sea level rise assessment describing how SLR would affect the future with project
condition for the Recommended Plan is included in the Engineering Appendix (Appendix C).

Delta Island and Levees Feasibility Study

Final Report

The intertidal marsh habitat proposed for construction under the Recommended Plan (Alternative
3) is anticipated to be sustainable and resilient to sea level rise. Intertidal marsh habitat accrues
sediment through lowering flow velocities; as sea level, and thus Delta water levels, slowly rise,
vegetation should adjust to the new water levels and continue to recruit sediments over time,
raising the marsh level. The non-Federal Partner, DWR, conducted a study regarding sediment
accretion of tidal marsh habitat for the Dutch Slough Tidal Restoration Project and documented
the results in their Revised Conceptual Plan (DWR 2010); the referenced 9 mm to 18 mm per
year accretion rates thus give the project a continuum of adaptive capacity so that there is no
threshold that affects performance. This study was used as a baseline reference for sediment
accretion expected over the life of the project. DWR cites Orr et al. (2003) accretion rates for
restored freshwater wetlands in the Delta of 9 to 18 mm/yr across several decades. Based on the
sea level rise analysis (Appendix C Attachment HH-A) 50 yr and 100 yr sea level rise rates can
be compared to the Orr et al. accretion rates (Table 5-7).
Additionally, SLR is not anticipated to degrade the Recommended Plan’s habitat value
beyond the future without project condition. The existing condition of the site is open water with
degraded habitat value in the varying elevation zones. The future with project habitat under
Alternative 3 would provide significant variation and improvement in habitat value throughout
the elevation zones. Accounting for SLR under the future without project condition would result
in deeper open water with continued degraded habitat value, as the existing condition does not
include the necessary habitat parameters to function as a sediment trap and organic material
source. As described above, the future condition with SLR of the Recommended Plan is
anticipated to result in sediment accretion rates of 9 to 18 mm/yr sustained over several decades
(Orr et al., 2003; DWR 2010). Since sediment accretion is expected to occur at a sustained rate,
the functional habitat in each elevation zone is also expected to be sustainable over the life of the
project. As a result, the Recommended Plan would provide increased habitat value over the
future without project condition even under future SLR scenarios; therefore effects to the project
from SLR would be less than significant.

5.6.5

Avoidance and Minimization Measures

USACE would implement the following avoidance and minimization measures to reduce
potential impacts to climate change:
•

Improve fuel efficiency of construction equipment by minimizing idling time either
by shutting equipment off when not in use or reducing the time of idling to no more
than 3 minutes (5 minute limit is required by the state airborne toxics control measure
[Title 13, sections 2449(d)(3) and 2485 of the California Code of Regulations].
Provide clear signage that posts this requirement for workers at the entrances to the
site.

The following avoidance and minimization measures are relevant to impacts, but will
likely not be required by USACE due to the limited amount of hauling associated with the
189

proposed construction. However the selected contractor will be encouraged to implement these
measures where practical:

5.7

•

Maintain all construction equipment in proper working condition according to
manufacturer’s specifications. The equipment must be checked by a certified
mechanic and determined to be running in proper condition before it is operated.

•

Train equipment operators in proper use of equipment.

•

Use the proper equipment size for the job.

•

Use equipment with new technologies (repowered engines, electric drive trains).

•

Perform on-site material hauling with trucks equipped with on-road engines (if
determined to be less emissive than the off-road engines).

•

Use a CARB approved low carbon fuel for construction equipment. (NOX emissions
from the use of low carbon fuel must be reviewed and increases mitigated.)

•

Encourage and provide carpools, shuttle vans, transit passes and/or secure bicycle
parking for construction worker commutes.

•

Use SmartWay certified trucks for deliveries and equipment transport.

•

Develop a plan to efficiently use water for adequate dust control.

•

Disruptions to any deep water ship channel commerce activities;

•

Increase or creation of safety hazards; and

•

Disruption of the DWSC O&M activities.

5.7.2

Alternative 1 – No Action

Under the no action alternative, USACE would not participate in the construction of the
proposed project and the transportation and navigation conditions would remain unchanged. The
no action alternative assumes that no action would be taken by USACE to restore intertidal
marsh habitat at Big Break. It is assumed that restoration actions currently proposed under
California EcoRestore and other projects would still be constructed, but not at Big Break.
Additionally, other proposed actions such as the California WaterFix would likely still be
constructed and could affect the transportation and navigation conditions in the Delta, rendering
uncertainty in the future condition of the Delta. No effects would occur from the restoration of
intertidal marsh habitat at Big Break.

5.7.3

Alternative 2 – 160 Acres of Intertidal Marsh Restoration

Transportation
Limited hauling would occur associated with the installation of the pipe on Jersey Island.
Prior to installing the pipeline across the island, the contractor would place gravel to improve the
roadway and provide access to the proposed staging area on the southern edge of Jersey Island
adjacent to the restoration site. Access to the staging area would be via Jersey Island Road to the
Jersey Island north levee road. Vehicles would then use a farm road to cross the island to the
staging area. This route would be used for any worker vehicles and construction equipment
necessary for pipe installation and vegetation planting. The work crew for this constructed is
very small (no more than eight workers), and only a limited amount of off-road construction
equipment is required (see Table 5-5 in Air Quality). Additionally, there are very few residents
on Jersey Island and the roadways are very sparsely traveled. As a result, effects on
transportation under this alternative would be less than significant.

Final Report

Navigation
In order to create intertidal marsh habitat, material from O&M dredging would be
pumped to the restoration site and placed to raise the submerged surface of portions of Big
Break, as described in Section 3.9 and shown on Figure 3-14. On the northern edge of Jersey
Island, a floating pump station would be installed on the edge of the Stockton DWSC to push the
material across Jersey Island and to the Big Break restoration site. This location will also be
where the dredging contractor would deliver the dredged material to the restoration project. The
dredge pipe would be tied into the restoration pipeline on the edge of the DWSC at Jersey Island.
The restoration pipeline would not encroach on the navigation corridor or the right-of-way of the
Stockton DWSC.
A temporary, short term impact would occur during the annual two-week construction
period due to the restoration pipeline floating across the Dutch Slough channel between Jersey
Island and the Big Break remnant levee. Dutch Slough, in this location, is primarily used for
recreational boating and is not a formal navigation channel. During the two-week construction
period each year, boats would be detoured around the Big Break restoration area to the south, or
to the east through Dutch Slough to Taylor Slough. Avoidance and minimization measures are
discussed below that would reduce this impact to a less-than-significant level.

5.7.4

Alternative 3 – 340 Acres of Intertidal Marsh Restoration

Under Alternative 3, 340 acres of open water habitat would be converted to a
combination of freshwater intertidal marsh habitat and shallow water habitat via the direct
placement of dredged material, as described in Section 3.9.2. The material placement and
planting would all be consistent with the description for Alternative 2, with the exception that
project construction would occur over a 10 year period rather than a 5 year period and there
would be an increase in acreage. Effects to transportation and navigation under Alternative 3
would be consistent with those described for Alternative 2, except that the described effects
would occur for 10 years instead of 5 years.

5.7.5

Avoidance and Minimization Measures

Transportation
Given that the proposed project would not impede on highways, streets, or official
roadways of any kind, there would not be avoidance or minimization measures required for
human transportation on land and a traffic control plan would not be required. Upon completion
of construction, the restoration pipeline, the dredge pipe, and the floating pump station would be
removed, restoring pre-construction conditions for the DWSC to the degree practicable. After
construction is completed, all construction equipment would be removed and ecosystem
restoration measures would be implemented as planned.

Final Report

Navigation
All obstacles and hazards to recreational boaters would be clearly identified with U.S.
Coast Guard approved markers and buoys. Coordination with the U.S. Coast Guard to ensure
that boaters can safely pass along the rivers in the project area would occur prior to the start of
any restoration activities. Any detours would be coordinated with the U.S. Coast Guard, the
EBRPD, and any other required regulatory agencies in the area.
Prior to construction, additional coordination would occur with the EBRPD to:
•

Inform boaters and anglers of project activities;

•

Provide project safety information including maps of any restricted access areas; and

•

Maps would be updated, as needed, to identify the new intertidal marsh restoration
areas.

Coordination with recreational boaters, as described above, would ensure that impacts
associated with construction of the project would be reduced to less than significant.

Recreation

5.8.1

Methodology and Basis of Significance

Methodology
This section evaluates the construction-related effects of the alternatives on recreation
resources. This analysis considers short-term recreation effects within the project area at Big
Break and discusses long-term beneficial effects to recreation. None of the alternatives would
affect recreation associated with local marinas because access to these recreational facilities and
opportunities would not be affected by implementation of any of the alternatives.
Basis of Significance
Adverse effects on recreation were considered significant if implementation of an
alternative plan would:
•

Substantially disrupt any institutionally recognized recreational facility or activity.

•

Preclude existing recreational users from long-term use of existing recreation
resources within and around Big Break.

Under the no action alternative, USACE would not participate in the construction of the

at Big Break. It is assumed that restoration actions currently proposed under California

other proposed actions such as the California WaterFix would likely still be constructed and
could affect the recreation conditions in the Delta, rendering uncertainty in the future condition
of the Delta. No effects would occur from the restoration of intertidal marsh habitat at Big
Break.

5.8.3

Alternative 2 – 160 Acres of Intertidal Marsh Restoration

In order to create intertidal marsh habitat, material from O&M dredging would be
pumped to the restoration site and placed to raise the submerged surface of portions of Big
Break, as described in Section 3.9 and shown on Figure 3-9.
The restoration of intertidal marsh habitat at Big Break would not require the closure of
any local recreation facilities such as harbors, parks, marinas, or resorts. Many people use the
area around the project for multiple recreation activities, and would continue to use these areas
during construction and once restoration has been completed. Therefore, impacts to recreation
facilities are less than significant.
A temporary, short term impact would occur during the annual two-week construction
period due to the restoration pipeline floating across the Dutch Slough channel between Jersey
Island and the Big Break remnant levee. Dutch Slough, in this location, is primarily used for
recreational boating. During the two-week construction period each year, boats would be
detoured around the Big Break restoration area to the south, or to the east through Dutch Slough
to Taylor Slough. Avoidance and minimization measures are discussed below that would reduce
this impact to a less-than-significant level. After construction is completed, the new intertidal
marsh habitat would provide a long-term beneficial impacts to recreational kayaking and
canoeing. The mounds dispersed throughout the open water would provide new channel
formations in approximately 112 acres of converted habitat.
The shallow waters of Big Break provide prime bass fishing habitat, like many areas
throughout the Delta. The creation of intertidal marsh habitat could be controversial with bass
fisherman due to the reduction of prime bass habitat in the project area. However, extensive bass
habitat remains throughout adjacent shallow water areas, both in Big Break and elsewhere in the
Delta, providing ample opportunities for anglers. Once the project is complete, a more diverse
habitat would be created due to newly implemented intertidal marsh habitat and interconnected
waterways between mounds. Therefore, with the coordination actions discussed in Section 5.8.5
below, effects to recreation would be less than significant.

combination of freshwater intertidal marsh habitat and shallow water habitat via the direct
placement of dredged material, as described in Section 3.9.2. The material placement and
planting would all be consistent with the description for Alternative 2, with the exception that
project construction would occur over a 10 year period rather than a 5 year period and there
would be an increase in acreage. Effects to recreation under Alternative 3 would be consistent
with those described for Alternative 2, except that the described effects would occur for 10 years
instead of 5 years.

5.8.5

Avoidance and Minimization Measures

All obstacles and hazards to recreational boaters would be clearly identified with U.S.
Coast Guard approved markers and buoys. Coordination with the U.S. Coast Guard to ensure
that boaters can safely pass along the rivers in the project area would occur prior to the start of
any restoration activities. Any detours would be coordinated with the U.S. Coast Guard, the
EBRPD, and any other required regulatory agencies in the area.
Prior to construction, additional coordination would occur with the EBRPD to:
•

Inform boaters and anglers of project activities;

•

Provide project safety information including maps of any restricted access areas; and

•

Maps would be updated, as needed, to identify the new intertidal marsh restoration
areas.

As an additional minimization measure, the USACE would ensure that kayaking
opportunities are provided in the marsh restoration site. A “kayak trail” will be designed through
the site as a part of the final design to reduce impacts to the EBRPD.
Coordination with recreational fisherman and boaters, as described above, and the
proposed design refinements would ensure that impacts associated with construction of the
project would be reduced to less than significant.

Cultural Resources

5.9.1

Methodology and Basis of Significance

Methodology
Analysis of the impacts was based on evaluation of the changes to the existing historic
properties that would result from implementation of the project. The term “historic property”
refers to any cultural resource that has been found eligible for listing, or is listed, in the NRHP.
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (NHPA), outlines the
process in which Federal agencies are required to determine the effects of their undertakings on
historic properties. In making a determination of the effects to historic properties, consideration
was given to:
•

Specific changes in the characteristics of historic properties in the study area.

•

The temporary or permanent nature of changes to historic properties and the visual
study area around the historic properties.

•

The existing integrity considerations of historic properties in the study area and how
the integrity was related to the specific criterion that makes a historic property
eligible for listing in the NRHP.

Basis of Significance
Any adverse effects on cultural resources that are listed or eligible for listing in the
NRHP (i.e., historic properties) are considered to be significant. Effects are considered to be
adverse if they:
•

Alter, directly or indirectly, any of the characteristics of a cultural resource that
qualify that resource for the NRHP so that the integrity of the resource's location,
design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, or association is diminished.

5.9.2

Alternative 1 –

Under the no action alternative, USACE would not participate in the construction of the
proposed project and the cultural and historic conditions would remain unchanged. The no
action alternative assumes that no action would be taken by USACE to restore intertidal marsh
habitat at Big Break. It is assumed that restoration actions currently proposed under California
EcoRestore and other projects would still be constructed, but not at Big Break. Additionally,
other proposed actions such as the California WaterFix would likely still be constructed and
could affect the cultural and historic conditions in the Delta, rendering uncertainty in the future

condition of the Delta. No effects would occur from the restoration of intertidal marsh habitat at
Big Break.

5.9.3

Alternative 2 – 160 Acres of Intertidal Marsh Restoration

In order to create intertidal marsh habitat, material from O&M dredging would be
pumped to the restoration site and placed to raise the submerged surface of portions of Big
Break, as described in Section 3.9 and shown on Figure 3-9. O&M dredging and the piping of
material to the placement site is an ongoing USACE operation that is covered under the San
Francisco Bay to Stockton (John F Baldwin and Stockton Ship Channels) Final Environmental
Impact Statement from September 1980. As no historic properties have been identified within
the APE, no effects to historic properties would occur. A small section of Jersey Island where a
pipeline will be placed and a road will be improved requires pedestrian survey. We do not
currently have access to this property, but 36 CFR 800.4 [b][2] allows for phased identification
and evaluation if access to properties is not available. Therefore, the survey will be conducted
prior to project implementation once rights of entry have been granted.

5.9.4

Alternative 3 – 340 Acres of Intertidal Marsh Restoration

Under the Preferred Alternative, Alternative 3, 340 acres of open water habitat would be
converted to a combination of freshwater intertidal marsh habitat and shallow water habitat via
the direct placement of O&M dredged material, as described in Section 3.9.2. Out of the 340
acres, approximately 90 acres would be planted with riparian and aquatic vegetation. The
remaining 245 acres would be shallow water habitat for aquatic fauna species inhabiting Big
Break. It is anticipated that sensitive vegetative habitat types located on the periphery of Big
Break such as existing tidal marsh and riparian vegetation, would be avoided because placement
of dredged material would be restricted to open water, outside these habitats. The O&M
dredging, material placement, and planting would all be consistent with the description for
Alternative 2 with the exception that project construction would occur over a 10 year period
rather than a 5 year period with an increase in acreage. Therefore, impacts can be referenced in
the section above for reference.

5.9.5

Avoidance and Minimization Measures

USACE has determined that no historic properties exist within the APE of the project.
Therefore, none of the alternatives considered will result in an adverse effect to historic
properties. If unanticipated discoveries are made USACE will follow 36 CFR §800.13.

Final Report

Growth-Inducing Effects

NEPA regulations require an EIS to consider the potential indirect effects of a proposed
action. These indirect effects occur later in time or farther away in distance, but are still
reasonably foreseeable, and “may include growth inducing effects and other effects related to
induced changes in the pattern of land use, population density or growth rate” (40 CFR Section
1508.8[b]). For this project, any growth-inducing effects would be related to: (1) the relative
magnitude of temporary and permanent jobs created by the project; (2) the need for new workers
in the project area; (3) the need for additional housing to accommodate new workers and
families; and (4) the economic stimulus or growth due to an increase in population, recreational
demand, and/or tourist-oriented land development.
However, based on the small size and type of project, the restoration work would be not
expected to induce any growth in or near the project area. The regional work force would be
adequate to provide sufficient workers for the relatively small number of temporary construction
jobs created by the project. No new temporary or permanent jobs would be needed to maintain
or monitor the restored habitat once construction is completed. As a result, no additional
housing would be needed. Since the project would only restore wildlife habitat in a rural part of
the Delta, no increase in population, recreational demand, and/or tourist-oriented land
development is expected to result from the proposed restoration. Consequently indirect project
effects for Alternative 2 or Alternative 3, if measurable at all, would be extremely minor and
well below any reasonable threshold of significance. Therefore, growth-inducing effects would
be less than significant and no avoidance or minimization measures are required.

5.11

Cumulative Impacts

The CEQ’s regulations for implementing NEPA define a cumulative effect as “the impact
on the environment which results from the incremental impact of the action when added to other
past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what agency (Federal or
nonfederal) or person undertakes such other actions. Cumulative impacts can result from
individually minor but collectively significant actions taking place over a period of time” (40
CFR 1508.7).
This section discusses the potential cumulative effects of the Delta Study when added to
other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions. As presented in Section 5.1, eight
resources (vegetation and wildlife, special status species, water quality, air quality, climate
change, transportation and navigation, recreation, and cultural resources) are identified as
potentially impacted by the project. These resources could experience a cumulative effect
related to the project, and are therefore evaluated below. As described in Section 4.1, other
resources (hazardous and toxic waste, hydrology and hydraulics, land use, socioeconomics,
utilities and services, and geology) would not be affected, and are therefore not evaluated below.

5.11.1 Methodology and Geographic Scope of the Analysis
Methodology
The cumulative effects analysis determines the combined effect of the proposed project
with other closely related, reasonably foreseeable projects. Cumulative effects were evaluated
by identifying projects in and around the Delta region that could have significant adverse or
beneficial effects. These potential effects are compared to the potential adverse or beneficial
effects of the proposed alternatives to determine the type, length, and magnitude of potential
combined cumulative effects of the proposed project, together with the other related reasonable
foreseeable projects. Significance of cumulative effects is determined by meeting Federal and
State mandates and specific criteria identified in this document for the affected resources.
Geographic Scope
The geographic area that could be affected by the project varies depending on the type of
environmental resource being considered. Potentially affected air and water resources extend
beyond the confines of the project footprint due to the dynamic nature of these resources. Table
5-8 presents the general geographic areas associated with the different resources addressed in
this cumulative effects analysis.

projects in the Oakley area and ongoing dredging operations. Present and reasonably foreseeable
future projects were primarily focused on ongoing construction actions, or planning studies for
future construction that have a released NEPA or CEQA document. If there is significant
uncertainty about the future of an action, it was not considered, such as the Sacramento DWSC
Deepening Project, which is currently inactive.

5.11.2 Past, Present, and Reasonably Foreseeable Future Projects
This section briefly describes other projects in the project area. The exact construction
timing and sequencing of these projects are not yet determined or may depend on uncertain
funding sources. All of these projects are required to evaluate the effects of the proposed project
features on environmental resources in the area. In addition, avoidance and minimization
measures must be developed to avoid or reduce any adverse effects to less than significant based
on Federal and local agency criteria. Those effects that cannot be avoided or reduced to less than
significant are more likely to contribute to significant cumulative effects in the area.
The Delta Islands and Levees Feasibility Study and Related Projects would be located
in a rapidly growing area of eastern Contra Costa County. Relevant projects are projects that are
related or similar projects that are reasonably foreseeable, and have the potential to affect the
same resources and fall within the same geographic scope. A cumulative impact refers to two or
more individual effects which, when considered together, are significant or compound or
increase other environmental impacts. The individual effects may be changes resulting from a
single project or a number of separate projects.
U.S Army Corps of Engineers Projects
Sacramento Deep Water Ship Channel Operations and Maintenance (Port of
Sacramento)
USACE and the Port of Sacramento conduct annual maintenance dredging of the
Sacramento DWSC in the summer or autumn. Fine sediments cause shoaling, which must be
removed to maintain adequate depth for commercial shipping traffic using the navigation
channels. Failure to perform maintenance dredging would result in unsafe conditions and a
restriction to access to the Port of Sacramento from the San Francisco Bay. Failing to dredge the
channel poses both a substantial risk to human safety, as well as an economic harm to the Port
and the commercial activities that use the Port’s facilities.
Dredged materials are removed by using a hydraulic cutter head suction dredge for
dredging, and a dragline and clamshell crane are used for rock placement. The material is then
deposited at previously authorized terrestrial dredged material placement (DMP) sites. Dredge
slurry is routed to the DMP sites via pipelines. DMP sites are diked and dredge slurry is allowed
to settle and consolidate at these sites. Decant water is then discharged back into the waterway,
from some sites, as determined during annual coordination. Dredged spoils are allowed to dry
and remain stockpiled at the sites for periodic use for levee repairs, livestock grazing, and other
purposes.

Delta Island and Levees Feasibility Study

Final Report

Generally, impacts associated with the DWSC dredging include direct impacts due to fish
entrainment, water quality, and some terrestrial impacts associated with use of the land-based
dredged material placement sites, such as stormwater runoff containment, potential effects to
giant garter snake, and presence of odors.
San Francisco Bay to Stockton Deep Water Ship Channel Operations and
Maintenance (San Joaquin River)
USACE and the Port of Stockton, conduct annual maintenance dredging of the Stockton
DWSC in the summer or autumn. Annual maintenance dredging is performed in the same
general manner as described above for the Sacramento DWSC.
In addition, maintenance bank protection work is needed to maintain the integrity of
existing bank protection placed to prevent erosion of the ship channel levees. Such bank erosion
usually occurs due to wave action caused by ship traffic. Maintenance bank stabilization, in the
form of rock replenishment, would stabilize the channel alignment and preserve the general
uniformity of the bank lines. The levees protect ship channel traffic from adverse crosscurrents
during the occurrence of flood flows in the Yolo Bypass and also protect adjacent lands from
flooding during high flows. Implementation of the Delta Study is highly dependent upon the
availability of dredged material from O&M operations within the Stockton DWSC. The
availability of dredged material could affect the timing and completion of the Delta Study.
The effects associated with the Stockton DWSC operation is similar to those described
for the Sacramento DWSC above.
Department of Water Resources/State of California Projects
Bay Delta Conservation Plan/California WaterFix/California EcoRestore
The BDCP was a part of California’s overall water management portfolio. It was being
developed as a 50-year habitat conservation plan with the goals of restoring the Sacramento-San
Joaquin Delta (Delta) ecosystem and securing California water supplies. The BDCP would
secure California’s water supply by building new water delivery infrastructure and operating the
system to improve the ecological health of the Delta. The BDCP also would restore or protect
approximately 150,000 acres of habitat to address the Delta’s environmental challenges.
On April 30, 2015, the State announced that they would separate the BDCP’s conveyance
facility and habitat restoration measures into two separate efforts: California WaterFix and
California EcoRestore.
The California WaterFix focuses on the State Water Project water delivery system
infrastructure in the Central Valley and is part of California’s overall water management
portfolio. The Governor’s WaterFix planning effort is overseen by the California Natural
Resources Agency and DWR. California EcoRestore, the habitat restoration program is overseen

by the California Natural Resources Agency and implemented under the California Water Action
Plan. California EcoRestore is a California Natural Resources Agency initiative implemented in
coordination with State and Federal agencies to advance the restoration of at least 30,000 acres
of Delta habitat by 2020. Concurrently, the CDFW is working with Federal, State and local
agencies, and Delta stakeholders to develop a 25-year, high-level conservation framework for the
Delta, Yolo Bypass and Suisun Marsh. The Delta Conservation Framework will serve as the
long-term continuation of the California EcoRestore program focused on accelerating
conservation actions by 2020. These efforts are a direct reflection of public comments and fulfill
the requirement of the 2009 Delta Reform Act to meet the co-equal goals of water supply
reliability and ecosystem restoration.
DWR and the USBR prepared a partially Recirculated Draft Environmental Impact
Report/Supplemental Draft Environmental Impact Statement (RDEIR/SDEIS) that addresses the
impacts of the California Water Fix. The RDEIR/SDEIS includes those portions of the
DEIR/DEIS (for the BDCP) that were amended or supplemented based on comments received
and changes in impact analysis warranting another public review prior to publication of final
documents. On July 21, 2017 DWR certified the California WaterFix Final EIR/EIS, which was
released on December 22, 2016, and on January 23, 2018 submitted a CEQA Addendum to the
Final EIR/EIS. The California Water Fix preferred alternative includes the construction and
operation of Delta intakes and tunnel conveyance facilities. It also provides responses to all
substantive comments received on the 2013 Draft EIR/EIS and 2015 RDEIR/SDEIS.
Delta Research Station
The USFWS and DWR jointly propose to construct two research stations within the Delta
to consolidate and support ongoing studies by the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP). The
facilities are proposed for construction along the Sacramento River in Rio Vista and along the
San Joaquin River in Stockton. The Delta Research Station – ERS and FTC Final EIR/EIS was
certified in March 2017. The current construction schedule is unknown. Potential effects that
could result from construction include soil disturbance and potential increases in turbidity since
both of the proposed construction sites are adjacent to the waterways. Operation of the facilities
could result in additional take for listed fish species for research purposes.
Delta Flood Emergency Facilities Improvement Project
Recovery from catastrophic failure of Delta levees will be undertaken by the State of
California, if necessary, to manage salinity for the environment and human use, which will also
protect the brackish Suisun Marsh. As described in DWR’s Delta Flood Emergency Facilities
Improvement Project, the State is working to ensure that it has the appropriate infrastructure and
supplies in the Delta to respond to and recover quickly and effectively from, major flood or
earthquake disasters in the Delta. Locations of storage and transfer sites for stockpiled flood fight
materials are identified:
•

Establish two new material storage and transfer facility sites in Stockton and at
Brannan Island State Park.

Final Report

•

Modify an existing material storage 5.23.3 facility at Rio Vista.

•

Establish new flood fight supply facilities at all three locations.

•

Make site preparations to support Incident Command Posts at Stockton West, Weber
Avenue and Brannan Island State Recreation Area.

•

In addition to the 223,000 tons of quarry rock stockpiled by DWR at Rio Vista and
within the Port of Stockton, DWR would also stockpile up to 40,000 tons of quarry
rock material of variable gradations less than 24-inch-minus at Stockton West, Weber
Avenue and Brannan Island and 20,000 tons of sand in Rio Vista for a total additional
increment of 100,000 tons.

Effects associated with these actions primarily involve ground disturbance and increased
turbidity, as the majority of these proposals involve stockpile areas and other related storage
facilities near the Delta waterways.
The Delta Plan
The Delta Plan was developed by the Delta Stewardship Council (DSC) and adopted on
May 16, 2013. It became effective, with legally-enforceable regulations, on September 1, 2013.
It is a long-term, comprehensive management plan designed to meet the co-equal goals of
providing a more reliable water supply for California and protecting, restoring and enhancing the
Delta ecosystem. The Delta Plan generally covers five topic areas and goals: (1) increased water
supply reliability; (2) restoration of the Delta ecosystem; (3) improved water quality; (4) reduced
risks of flooding in the Delta; and (5) protection and enhancement of the Delta. The DSC does
not propose constructing, owning or operating any facilities related to these topic areas. Rather,
the Delta Plan sets forth regulatory policies and recommendations that seek to influence the
actions, activities and projects of cities, counties, State, Federal, regional and local agencies
toward meeting the goals in the 5 topic areas.
The Delta Plan could contribute to beneficial cumulative effects by setting forth
regulatory policies and recommendations that influence projects in a manner that would improve
water quality, water supply reliability, FRM and increase habitat for fish and wildlife.
Dutch Slough Tidal Marsh Restoration Project
The Dutch Slough Tidal Marsh Restoration Project, in an area formerly slated for urban
development, will soon become 1,178 acres of critically needed habitat for fish and wildlife in
the Delta. The project is a cooperative effort between State, Federal, and private agencies,
including DWR, CDFW, State Coastal Conservancy, Reclamation Districts, Natural Heritage
Institute, City of Oakley, Ironhouse Sanitary District, and private consultants. The project's
location in the western Delta offers the opportunity, soil types, and lack of subsidence to create a
large area of tidal marsh and complex intertidal channels favored by native Delta species.
Shaded channels, native grasslands, and riparian forests will be restored in the upland portions of
the site. The habitats to be restored are like those that historically dominated the Delta, and their
203

Final Report

restoration is considered a critical action to increase numbers of native sensitive species and
improve general ecological health of the Delta. This project will not only provide critical habitat
for native plants, fish, and wildlife that are in rapid decline in the Delta, but will also provide
outdoor recreation and resources for the residents of the Delta and Bay Area. Construction of the
habitat restoration is anticipated to begin in 2018.
Local Projects
The local development projects discussed below all involve residential improvements to
the populated areas in the vicinity of Big Break, most notably in the city of Oakley and on Bethel
Island. All of these projects would involve ground disturbance and the use of heavy construction
equipment, which could result in air quality, water quality, and noise effects on the local
community. Additionally, the development projects would result in an increased population,
which could have increased socioeconomic benefits, but also increased traffic, noise, and air
quality effects. These development projects are discussed below.
City of Oakley Community Park
The City of Oakley is proposing a Community Park and Public Access Conceptual
Master Plan (City Community Park Project) for 55 acres adjacent to the Dutch Slough
Restoration Project and four miles of levee trails on the perimeter of the project lands. The City
Community Park will provide parking and trailheads for the public access components of the
Dutch Slough Restoration Project. The project is currently under design.
Cypress Grove
The Cypress Grove EIR was certified by the City of Oakley in 2003. This development
consisted of 637 new residential units on approximately 147 acres. The project is adjacent to and
south of the Contra Costa Canal and adjacent to and east of Marsh Creek.
East Cypress Corridor Specific Plan and Summer Lake
The City of Oakley prepared a Supplemental EIR for the East Cypress Corridor Specific
Plan which was finalized in February 2009. The specific plan proposed the development of up to
5,759 residential units on an approximately 2,500-acre site adjacent to 1.5 miles of the Contra
Costa Canal, from the Rock Slough trash rack to Cypress Road. The specific plan area is within
the City of Oakley's sphere of influence. The City of Oakley proposed to annex the entire
specific plan area. Approximately 500 homes are in the East Cypress Corridor Specific Plan
area. Most of the existing homes are along Sand Mound and Dutch Sloughs.
Dutch Slough Properties Development
The City of Oakley has approved plans to develop approximately 1,342 residential units
on approximately 300 acres immediately south of the Dutch Slough Restoration Project site
between the Contra Costa Canal and Cypress Road. The development area south of the Contra
204

Costa Canal consists of 140 acres of the Emerson property, which is estimated to have
approximately 662 residential units. The City certified an EIR and approved a tentative map in
November of 2007 for 506 residential units on 120 acres of the Gilbert property and 44 acres of
the Burroughs property, which is anticipated to have approximately 174 residential units. The
project was completed in 2012.
Delta Coves Development Project
The Delta Coves Development Project is a 310 acre waterfront marina community under
development on Bethel Island. The community will feature 560 waterfront residences, 416 of
which will have provide boat docks. The development has been planned since the 1970s, with
construction beginning in the early 2000s, and halted in 2008. SunCal real estate development
company purchased the project in 2012, and reinitiated the construction in 2015.

5.11.3 Cumulative Impacts Analysis
Vegetation and Wildlife
Implementation of the proposed alternatives would contribute to restoration of sensitive
marsh habitat and would benefit aquatic and wildlife species in decline due to the steady loss of
historical tidal marsh habitat in the Delta. Measures would be implemented during construction
to minimize impacts to biological resources by preventing the spread of non-native plant species
to the greatest extent practicable. As a result, the Delta Study would not contribute to a
cumulative impact on vegetation and wildlife. The Delta Study, in combination with other
restoration projects discussed in Section 5.11.2, such as the Dutch Slough Restoration Project,
would contribute to the overall future health of the Delta and would improve overall habitat
conditions. Any cumulative impacts associated with the Delta Study would be beneficial.
Special Status Species
By creating new intertidal marsh habitat, the Delta Study would bring significant
ecosystem benefits to special status fish species, such as delta smelt, salmon, CCV steelhead,
and sDPS green sturgeon. In conjunction with the restoration actions proposed by other
projects, such as the Dutch Slough Restoration Project, the proposed restoration project will
assist in recovery of listed species by creating new nearshore habitat for these species and
improving the overall health of the Delta’s ecosystem.
Other projects in the Big Break area could have potential impacts on Delta smelt and
other listed fish species in the greater project vicinity. The new housing developments would
increase the human population in the area, potentially leading to more recreation pressure at the
site (boating, fishing, and litter). The increased volume of municipal sewage from the new
developments would likely introduce more pollutants to the waters. In the context of these
adverse development pressures on Delta ecosystems, implementation of the project, together
with other regional marsh and wetlands restoration projects, would provide long-term net
205
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
Sacramento District

September 2018

Delta Island and Levees Feasibility Study

Final Report

benefits to the Delta ecosystem that would assist with listed fish species recovery through the
construction of primary productivity habitats.
The Delta Study is not likely to significantly impact other listed species in the region,
including the giant garter snake and therefore would not contribute to a cumulative impact on
these species.
Water Quality
Construction activities have the potential to temporarily degrade water quality through the
direct release of dredged material into water bodies or the indirect release of contaminants into
water bodies through placement activities. Related projects, including the San Joaquin River
DWSC O&M, the Dutch Slough Tidal Marsh Restoration Project, and the Dutch Slough
Properties Development could be under construction during the same timeframe as this project.
If construction occurs during the same timeframe water quality could be diminished primarily
due to increased turbidity.
Further urban development could increase runoff as the amount of impervious surfaces is
increased. The new housing developments may cause more stormwater runoff laden with
contaminants common in urban/suburban areas (i.e. pesticides, lawn fertilizers, hydrocarbons).
The increased volume of municipal sewage from the new developments could also introduce
more pollutants to Delta waters. The method by which treated wastewater is discharged would
determine the severity of the impact to water quality from new and proposed residential
subdivisions near the study area. All projects would be required to coordinate with the
CVRWQCB and overall water quality will be required to meet the Basin Plan objectives.
Degradation of water quality from the Delta Study would be short term and limited to the
construction period. These short-term impacts would contribute to cumulative effects from the
other related projects discussed above, however, the restoration would result in long-term
benefits to water quality in the Big Break area partially due to the presence of vegetation and
other related benefits from marsh habitat.
Air Quality
All of the related projects discussed above would cumulatively contribute to emissions of
criteria pollutants throughout the region, particularly if projects are constructed concurrently,
which could have a significant cumulative effect on air quality. It is anticipated that each of
these projects would implement separate avoidance and minimization measures, as required by
air quality control agencies, to reduce the emissions to below significance levels. Construction
of the Delta Study is tentatively scheduled for 2020 through 2029, depending upon
Congressional authorization and appropriation. Emissions from the Delta Study restoration
would be below all local threshold levels, and additional BMPs would be applied to further
reduce these levels. The annual two week construction window would not significantly
contribute to the cumulative impact of all of the other long-term development projects occurring
in the Oakley area and the Delta region.

Climate Change
It is unlikely that any single project by itself could have a significant impact on the
environment with respect to GHGs. However, the cumulative effect of human activities has been
linked to quantifiable changes in the composition of the atmosphere, which, in turn, have been
shown to be the main cause of global climate change (IPCC 2007). Therefore, the analysis of the
environmental effects of GHG emissions is inherently a cumulative impact issue. While the
emissions of one single project will not cause global climate change, GHG emissions from
multiple projects throughout the world have a cumulative effect on global climate change.
It is expected that the primary GHG impacts from present and planned Delta area projects
would arise from their construction phases. On an individual basis, each of these projects,
including the Delta Study, would be required by BAAQMD to implement BMPs to reduce GHG
emissions to the maximum extent practicable. However, on a global scale, the emissions
associated with these projects would not significantly contribute to global climate change, when
added to the emissions associated with major stationary GHG emitters.
Transportation and Navigation
The Delta Study would not have a significant impact on local roadways in the study area.
There is the potential for a cumulative impact due to worker vehicles and vehicles associated
with the local development projects using similar access routes through the city of Oakley,
however the vehicles associated with the local development projects would far outnumber the
eight worker vehicles and one haul truck associated with the Delta Study. Additionally, any
increase in traffic in the local area over the ten year construction period would likely be a result
of the local development projects and not the Delta Study. While the Delta Study would
contribute to traffic in the area, the impact would be insignificant compared to other actions
going on in the area.
USACE does not anticipate any cumulative effects as a result of the dredging and
placement activities of the Sacramento DWSC, the operations and maintenance activities on the
Stockton DWSC along the San Joaquin River, and the Delta Study. The operations and
maintenance activities on the Stockton DWSC are essential to the proposed alternatives. The
Delta Study would not impact the Sacramento DWSC at all, and would not interfere with ship
movement on the Stockton DWSC, since dredging and pumping equipment would remain on the
edge of the channel adjacent to Jersey Island. Overall cumulative effects to navigation would not
be significant.

Recreation

development projects could increase use of Big Break and the local marinas due to increased
population. However, there is currently an expansion of passive recreation opportunities
occurring through the various local Delta restoration projects, which would increase habitat for
shore birds and provide opportunities for bird watching. There would be a reduction in bass
fishing acreage at Big Break due to the project; however, other local projects would not
contribute to this effect.
Cultural Resources
Cumulative impacts to cultural resources would be primarily related to other construction
projects that could occur during the same timeframe as those considered for this study and within
the same vicinity as this study. A cumulative impact to cultural resources is not likely as all
accessible areas of the APE have been inventoried. The historic levee within the project
footprint were found not eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places. Based
on our previous research it is unlikely that the small, currently inaccessible section where a
pipeline and road crossing on Jersey Island will be placed will impact cultural resources.

5.12

Unavoidable Significant Effects

The CEQ’s NEPA Compliance Guide states that any significant adverse environmental
effects that cannot be avoided if the project is implemented must be described. This description
includes significant adverse effects that can be mitigated, but not reduced to a level of
insignificance. No unavoidable significant effects were identified in the analysis that could not
be mitigated to less than significant.

5.13

Relationship Between Short-Term Uses and Long-Term Productivity

In accordance with NEPA (40 CFR 1502.16), this section discusses the relationship
between local short-term uses of the human environment and maintenance of long-term
productivity for the project. Short-term effects on vegetation and wildlife, water quality,
recreation, and air quality would be limited to the construction phase of the project. No shortterm uses of the environment are expected after the project is placed in operation. In addition,
the long-term productivity of the environment in the Delta would be increased by restoring
aquatic, riparian, and adjacent terrestrial habitats for native plants and wildlife, including special
status species.

Final Report

Irreversible and Irretrievable Commitment of Resources

In accordance with NEPA (40 CFR 1502.16), this EIS discusses any irreversible and
irretrievable commitment of resources that would be involved in the alternative plans. Significant
irreversible environmental changes are defined as uses of nonrenewable resources during the
initial and continued phases of the alternatives that cannot be undone.
The alternatives would result in the irreversible conversion open water habitat to
intertidal marsh habitat. However, this conversion is restoring the environment to its historic
condition and would be beneficial to the environment long-term.
In addition, the proposed alternatives would result in the irretrievable commitment of
construction materials, fossil fuels, and other energy resources needed to construct the project.
Operation and maintenance are not expected to increase the use of construction materials or
fossil fuels.

Final Report

CHAPTER 6. COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND
REGULATIONS
The status of the proposed action’s compliance with applicable Federal environmental
requirements is summarized below. Prior to initiation of construction, the work would be in
compliance with all applicable Federal laws and Executive Orders.
The following typical laws and regulations are not applicable to these proposed
alternatives:

6.1

•

Federal Wild and Scenic Rivers Act: There are no designated wild and scenic rivers in
the study area.

•

Advisory Circular (AC) 150/5200-33A – Hazardous Wildlife Attractants on Near
Airports: This AC establishes Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) buffer zones
surrounding airports. The study area is outside of the designated buffer zones for the
Byron Airport, which is approximately 20 miles away.

•

Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972: The study area is in a freshwater zone,
therefore it is unlikely that marine mammals would be present.

Federal Laws

Clean Air Act, as amended, PL 91-604; 42 U.S.C. 1857h-7, et seq. Full Compliance.
The USEPA is the Federal agency responsible for managing the Nation’s air quality. USEPA
establishes national ambient air quality standards, and oversees the air quality plans developed
and implemented by the states. BAAQMD is responsible for developing local district air quality
management plans and enforcing regulations pertaining to air emissions in the study area. As
discussed in Section 5.2.5, the proposed action would not exceed national air quality standards
based on modeled estimates of emission rates during construction of the project.
On November 30, 1993, the USEPA promulgated final general conformity regulations at
40 CFR 93B for Federal activities. These regulations apply to a Federal action in a nonattainment or maintenance area if the total emissions of the criteria pollutants and precursor
pollutants caused by the action equal or exceed certain de minimis amounts, thus requiring the
Federal agency to make a determination of general conformity. As discussed in Section 4.2.5, at
least part of the Delta is in non-attainment for ozone, PM10, and PM2.5. As discussed in Section
5.5, the proposed action would not exceed de minimis thresholds based on modeled estimates of
emission rates during construction of the project, and would be in full compliance with the CAA.
Clean Water Act, PL 92-500; 33 U.S.C. 1251, et seq. Full Compliance. The USEPA
is the Federal agency responsible for managing the Nation’s water quality. USEPA establishes
national water quality standards and oversees the water quality plans developed and implemented
by the states. The CVRWQCB is responsible for developing local district water quality
210

Final Report

management plans, issuing permits, and enforcing regulations pertaining to water quality in the
Delta. In addition, USACE is responsible for issuing Section 404 permits for projects that
involve discharge of fill material into Waters of the U.S.
The proposed action would involve discharge of fill material into Waters of the U.S. in
the Delta. Although USACE does not issue permits for their own projects, USACE does comply
with the guidelines and substantive requirements of Section 404, including Section 404(b)(1).
As discussed in Section 5.2.4, a Section 404(b)(1) analysis was conducted on the TSP and is
included in Appendix H. The analysis concluded that the project would not result in significant
effects to water quality. The construction contractor would be required to implement the
measures listed in the analysis to avoid or minimize adverse effects on the aquatic ecosystem.
The proposed action would also require a Construction General Permit since it would
disturb one or more acres of land and involve possible storm water discharges to surface waters.
Prior to initiation of construction, the contractor would be required to prepare a Storm Water
Pollution Prevention Plan and then submit a NOI form to the CVRWQCB, requesting approval
of the work. This storm water plan and an In-Water work plan would identify the measures to be
implemented by the contractor to avoid or minimize any adverse effects of construction on
surface waters.
Additional regulatory requirements of the Clean Water Act include Section 303 and
Section 401. These Sections require coordination with the CVRWQCB prior to construction to
ensure that the project is complying with established TMDLs and other required thresholds
established in the Basin Plan. Feasibility level of design is not at a detailed enough level to
initiate consultation with the CVRWQCB, therefore, under the Delta Study this coordination
would occur prior to construction once designs have been refined to a 65% level during PED.
With the receipt of the Section 401 Water Quality Certification from the CVRWQCB and all
other required construction permits, the proposed restoration would be in full compliance with
the Clean Water Act and could proceed with construction. For the purposes of the study phase,
the documentation included in Appendix H provides USACE with full compliance for
Congressional authorization purposes.
Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, as amended, PL 93-612; 16 U.S.C. 14511464). Full Compliance. The regulated Coastal Zone for the San Francisco Bay and Delta
extends only to the mouth of the Sacramento River, which is approximately 11 river miles
downstream of Big Break. As a result, USACE is not required to consult under the Coastal Zone
Management Act and the Delta Study is in full compliance with this Act.
Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended, PL 93-205; 16 U.S.C. 1531, et seq.
Full Compliance. USACE obtained a list of the Federally threatened, endangered, proposed, and
candidate species that have the potential to occur in the Delta via the USFWS website in March
2018. Based on the locations of the proposed work, the listed species that could be affected by
the proposed action include the Delta smelt and the giant garter snake under the jurisdiction of
the USFWS and green sturgeon, Central Valley steelhead, Central Valley spring-run Chinook
salmon, and Sacramento River winter-run Chinook salmon under the jurisdiction of NMFS.

Delta Island and Levees Feasibility Study

Final Report

USACE has determined that the proposed alternatives may affect, but are not likely to adversely
affect these species in the short-term due to construction-related effects associated with the
placement of dredged material in-water, and the installation and removal of the pipeline across
Jersey Island. Additionally, USACE has determined that the proposed intertidal marsh
restoration would have long term beneficial impacts for listed species. Biological Assessments
were prepared and submitted to USFWS and NMFS on October 12, 2017. USACE requested
formal consultation with the USFWS on the Delta smelt, which resulted in a Biological Opinion
issued to the Corps on Delta smelt and giant garter snake on June 14, 2018. USACE requested
informal consultation with NMFS on May 17, 2018 and NMFS concurred with USACE’s
determination of may affect, not likely to adversely affect in a letter dated June 15, 2018. With
this documentation included in Appendix G of the FR/EIS, the study is in full compliance with
this Act.
Farmland Protection Policy Act, PL 97-98; 7 U.S.C. 4201, et seq. Full Compliance.
The NRCS is the Federal agency responsible for administering this act, which requires Federal
agencies to coordinate a Farmland Conversion Impact form with the NRCS whenever their
projects or programs would affect land designated as prime or unique farmland. The proposed
action would not remove or alter any land that is protected under this Act. As a result the project
is in full compliance with this Act.
Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act of 1958, as amended, PL 85-624; 16 U.S.C. 661,
et seq. Full Compliance. The USFWS is the Federal agency responsible for administering this
Act, which requires Federal agencies to coordinate with USFWS and State wildlife agencies
during the planning of projects that would result in the control or modification of a natural
stream or body of water. The FWCA intends that wildlife conservation be given equal
consideration with other features of these projects. Because of the sensitivity of the Delta,
USACE initiated coordination with USFWS early in the planning process.
USFWS prepared a draft Coordination Act Report (CAR) in May 2014. This report
details the vegetation, wildlife, and fisheries resources in the project area; evaluates the potential
effects of the proposed action on those resources; determines required mitigation for adverse
effects; and provides recommendations for consideration by USACE. Although adoption of the
recommendations is not required by the Act, USACE usually adopts the recommendations unless
there is an overriding consideration not to do so. On June 26, 2018, the USFWS provided
USACE with a letter updating the project description and the recommendations from the 2014
draft CAR. This letter serves as the USFWS’s Final CAR for the Delta Study. USACE is in
agreement with the revised recommendations, as described in the 2018 Final CAR and will
implement the recommendations, as appropriate. As a result, the Delta Study is in full
compliance with the FWCA. Both the draft and final CARs are included with the FR/EIS as
Appendix L.

Final Report

Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1996, as
amended, PL 104-267; 16 U.S.C. 1801, et seq. Full Compliance. The Magnuson-Stevens Act
(MSA) establishes a management system for national marine and estuarine fishery resources.
This legislation requires that all Federal agencies consult with NMFS regarding all actions or
proposed actions permitted, funded, or undertaken that may adversely affect EFH. Under the
MSA, effects on habitat managed under the Pacific Salmon Fishery Management Plan must also
be considered. In the June 15, 2018 ESA concurrence letter, NMFS identified that the proposed
project would not adversely affect EFH, therefore the Delta Study is in full compliance with the
MSA. The concurrence letter is included in Appendix G.
Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1928, as amended; 16 U.S.C. 715, et seq. Full
Compliance. USFWS is the Federal agency responsible for administering this Act, which
implements a treaty between the U.S. and Great Britain (for Canada), Mexico, Japan, and the
Soviet Union (now Russia) for the protection of migratory birds. Unless permitted by
regulations, this law prohibits anyone to "pursue, hunt, take, capture, kill, attempt to take, capture
or kill … any migratory bird …or any part, nest, or egg of any such bird" (16 U.S.C. 703).
Areas in the Delta have foraging, resting, nesting, and breeding habitat for numerous migratory
birds. To the extent possible, USACE would schedule construction outside periods of migration
or nesting to avoid or minimize effects on migratory birds. In any case, prior to initiation of
construction, surveys would be conducted by a USFWS-approved biologist to determine the
presence of migratory birds and/or their nests in or around the Jersey Island pipeline route. If
active nests are found, the USFWS would be contacted for advice and recommendations for how
to avoid disturbance and whether a permit is necessary. With the implementation of these
actions, the Delta Study would be in full compliance with this Act.
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, PL 91-190; 42 U.S.C.
4321, et seq. Partial Compliance. The CEQ is responsible for ensuring that Federal agencies
operate in accordance with NEPA, which requires full disclosure of the environmental effects,
alternatives, potential mitigation, and environmental compliance procedures of most Federal
management, regulation, or funding activities that affect the environment. NEPA requires the
preparation of an environmental document to ensure that Federal agencies accomplish the law’s
purposes. This EIS is in partial compliance with NEPA. Full compliance will be achieved when
the final EIS has been filed with the USEPA and the Record of Decision has been signed.
National Estuary Program. Full Compliance. The National Estuary Program was
created by Congress in the 1987 amendments to the Clean Water Act. The Program consists of
28 local estuary programs, managed Federally by the USEPA, with a focus of improving the
waters, habitats, and living resources of estuaries of national significance. The National Estuary
Program is a non-regulatory program. The San Francisco Estuary, consisting of the San
Francisco and Suisun Bays, the Suisun Marsh, and the Sacramento and San Joaquin River Delta,
is one such estuary. The San Francisco Estuary program is managed by the USEPA, State of
California, and locally by the San Francisco Estuary Partnership. Management of the estuary is
guided by the San Francisco Estuary Project Comprehensive Conservation and Management
Plan (CCMP). Since the purpose of the Delta Study is to restore historically lost tidal wetlands

Final Report

and reverse the effects of subsidence, which is included as one of the restoration goals of the
CCMP, the Recommended Plan is in full compliance with the intent of this Program.
National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, PL 89-655; 16 U.S.C. 470a,
et seq. Full Compliance. The SHPO in each state is responsible for ensuring that Federal
agencies comply with Section 106 of this Act, which requires that they consider the effects of a
proposed undertaking on properties that have been determined to be eligible for, or included in,
the NRHP. The Section 106 review process consists of four steps: (1) identification and
evaluation of historic properties; (2) assessments of the effects of the undertaking on historic
properties; (3) consultation with the SHPO and appropriate agencies to develop a plan to address
the treatment of historic properties; and (4) concurrence from the SHPO regarding the agreement
or results of consultation.
As discussed in Section 4.2.12, both archeological and historic sites are found in the
Delta. USACE has reviewed records for the Project areas, which includes all proposed work
areas for this study. No cultural or historic sites were identified during document research or
during a site inspection by water craft. Correspondence with interested Tribes regarding the
study was initiated via letter dated April 2013. Based on this documentary research, previous
consultation with local Indian Tribes, and field work, the project is in compliance with the
National Historic Preservation Act of 1966. During PED, a small section of Jersey Island where
a pipeline and road will cross will require pedestrian survey. The survey will be conducted prior
to project implementation, following 36 CFR 800.4 [b][2]. Once the survey has been completed
consultation will be updated with the SHPO and interested tribes. Based on our work to date, we
do not anticipate any changes to our finding of No Historic Properties Effected (36 CFR 800.4
[d][1]) for this project..

6.2

Executive Orders

Executive Order 13112, Invasive Species, February 3, 1999. Full Compliance. This
EO directs Federal agencies to prevent the introduction of invasive species, provide for their
control, and minimize their economic, ecological, and human health effects. As discussed in
Section 4.2.1, invasive species, including aquatics and weed species, are found throughout the
Delta. Prior to construction, the construction contractor would be required to prepare an invasive
species control plan to be approved by USACE and acceptable to appropriate Federal and State
resource agencies. Existing invasive species in the project area would be treated and removed
prior to construction, and native vegetation would be planted as part of project construction. The
Monitoring and Adaptive Management Plan (Appendix M) includes measures designed for
ensuring success of native vegetation. The Delta Study is in full compliance with this order.
Executive Order 12898, Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in
Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations, February 11, 1994. Full Compliance.
This EO directs Federal agencies not to exclude persons from participation in, deny persons the
benefits of, or subject persons to discrimination under their programs, policies, and activities
because of their race, color, or national origin. As discussed in Section 4.1.3, the proposed
214
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,

Delta Island and Levees Feasibility Study

Final Report

action would have no disproportionate effects on minority or low-income populations in the
Delta, as there are no populations of this kind in the project area. Therefore, the Delta Study is in
full compliance with this order.
Executive Order 11988, Floodplain Management, May 24, 1977. Full Compliance.
This EO directs Federal agencies to avoid, to the extent possible, long- and short-term adverse
effects associated with the occupancy or modification of the base flood plain (1% annual event),
as well as to avoid direct and indirect support of development in the base flood plain, wherever
there is a practicable alternative. As discussed in Section 4.1.1, the proposed action would have
no measurable effect on the (FEMA’s 100-year) floodplain in the Delta. In addition, because of
the nature of the proposed work, the proposed action would not directly or indirectly support
development in the floodplain. The Delta Study would be in full compliance with this order.
Executive Order 11990, Protection of Wetlands, May 24, 1977. Full Compliance.
This EO directs Federal agencies to minimize the destruction, loss, or degradation of wetlands,
and to preserve and enhance their natural and beneficial values. As discussed in Section 5.2.4,
the proposed action would have a net positive effect on Delta wetland by adding approximately
340 acres of new intertidal marsh to the aquatic ecosystem. Consequently the Delta Study would
be in full compliance with this order.

Final Report

The meeting locations were chosen because they are central to the region. The meeting
times were chosen to accommodate both the workday schedules of public agency representatives
and the general public, including residents and business owners.
The meetings were open-house style workshops in which attendees could read and view
the information about the proposed alternatives and interact with project staff, including
representatives of USACE and DWR. The views expressed in the scoping meeting are
summarized in Section 7.4 below.
For more detail on comments received, information available at the meetings, and a
summary of key issues that were raised, see Appendix A which contains a scoping report. A
similar open-house format will be used for the public feasibility study draft report and EIS.
USACE will ensure all agencies, organizations, and individuals who provide comments will be
provided a copy of the final integrated report.

7.3

Comments on the NOI

Under NEPA, no time limit exists to receive written comments in response to the NOI.
Appendix A contains the NOI and the comments received at the February 2013 scoping
meetings. The views expressed in the scoping meeting are summarized as follows:

7.4

•

Clarifications on data and history of the Delta;

•

Concerns of siltation in Delta channels;

•

Recommendation for coordination with other agencies and efforts in the Delta; and

•

Recommendation to evaluate environmental effects of alternatives to water supply,
water quality, and aquatic and terrestrial biology.

Public Review and Comments on the Draft Report

This draft Integrated Report was circulated for a 45 day review from April 18 to June 2,
2014 by Federal, State, and local agencies; organizations; and individuals who have an interest in
the project. A notice of availability of the draft EIS was published in the Federal Register
following distribution for public review. Public workshops were held during the public review
period to provide additional opportunities for comments on the draft document. These meetings
were held at the following times and places:
•

Wednesday May 7, 2014, 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. at the Old Sugar Mill in Clarksburg,
California.

•

Friday May 9, 2014, 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. at the Sheraton Grand Hotel in Sacramento,
California.

Delta Island and Levees Feasibility Study

Final Report

During public review of the draft report, a total of 7 comments were received from the
public, including 2 Federal agencies, 3 State agencies and 2 local agencies and organizations.
Comments received were primarily focused on: (1) consistency with Delta land use plans; (2)
permitting requirements; (3) air quality considerations; and (4) salinity and water quality
modeling. All comments received during the public review period were considered and
incorporated into the final EIS, as appropriate.

7.5

Major Areas of Controversy

Based on the comments received, USACE did not identify any major areas of
controversy; however, there were many comments expressing public concern about salinity and
water quality, and associated potential impacts on drinking water.

7.6

Next Steps in the Environmental Review Process

Following the completion of Feasibility Level Design, USACE reviewed the revised
FR/EIS to assess the need for an additional level of public review prior to finalizing the report.
Typically, USACE recommends recirculation of a draft EIS if there is a significant change in the
proposed action between the draft and final EIS, or if there is a change in significance
determination for any resource. In the case of the Delta Study, there is a significant change in
the size of the footprint for the proposed alternative; however, the action itself has not changed
from what was analyzed under Alternative 2 in the draft FR/EIS. Additionally, while the
footprint has increased, the majority of the effects described in the draft FR/EIS have reduced in
significance. There are two major factors that led to this change: (1) the removal of excavation
and pumping from dredged material placement sites; and (2) the determination that the dredged
material would be primarily sand, which is expected to only have minor amounts of turbidity
associated with its placement. Due these factors, USACE determined that it was reasonable to
solicit comments on the final FR/EIS rather than recirculating a revised draft FR/EIS.
A Notice of Availability will be published in the Federal Register indicating that the
FR/EIS will be available for a 30-day review period before USACE makes a final decision on the
Recommended Plan. Additionally, the FR/EIS will be distributed to all individuals and agencies
who commented on the draft document, and other members of the interested public. After
considering any comments received, USACE will prepare a Record of Decision (ROD) for the
project. The ROD is a written, public record explaining why USACE chose the course of action.
The Recommended Plan and any applicable mitigation measures will be identified in the ROD.
In addition, since the Recommended Plan has been revised, USACE will respond to any
significant public comments in the ROD. The Recommended Plan cannot be initiated before the
ROD is signed and Congressional Authorization and appropriations are obtained.

Final Report

CHAPTER 8 – RECOMMENDED PLAN
This chapter describes the RP as well as procedures and cost sharing required for
implementation if it is authorized and funded by Congress. A schedule and list of further studies
are also included. Section 8.3 describes additional recommendations to be carried out under
existing authorities and/or by others.

8.1

Recommended Plan

The plan identified as the RP is Alternative 3 (see Figures 8-1 and 8-2). The RP is
described in detail below.

8.1.1

Features and Accomplishments

The principle feature of the RP is the placement of 1,000,000 cubic yards of fill material
into Big Break from maintenance dredging of the Stockton DWSC to restore intertidal habitat
elevations. A Monitoring and Adaptive Management Plan has been developed and included in
the final report. Monitoring and Adaptive Management costs are included in first costs. The
total first project cost of the RP is $25 million.
The RP provides a unique opportunity to restore 340 acres of intertidal marsh in the
Delta, habitat which is now largely non-existent in this ecosystem of national significance.
Prior to levee construction in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Delta was comprised
almost solely of tidal marsh. As levees were constructed, floodplains were disconnected from
the waterways and land began to subside and compact as it was farmed and developed for human
use. Delta lands are now as much as 20 feet below sea level, much too low for intertidal marsh
habitat without incorporation of subsidence reversal, which is typically cost prohibitive. For this
reason, restoration of tidal marsh has been very limited throughout the central Delta in particular,
where subsidence is most extensive and also where tidal marsh was historically most prevalent.
The RP links the proposed ER actions to an ongoing USACE navigation project, providing a cost
effective mechanism to implement otherwise costly subsidence reversal, resulting in restoration
of habitat for multiple federally listed species, notably salmonids and Delta smelt. The restored
habitat would also benefit the millions of migratory fowl on the Pacific Flyway as they travel
through the Delta, part of the largest estuary on the West Coast. The RP would not conflict with
any existing plans for dredged material reuse or restoration sites. The benefits of the RP are
further described below in Section 8.1.2.
For an estimated period of ten years, material from Operations and Maintenance dredging
in the Stockton DWSC will be directly placed via pipeline into a 340 acre area of Big Break
adjacent to the north remnant levee. The area would be bound on the east and west by sacrificial
hay bales to serve as a velocity dissipation measure and, if needed, turbidity curtains to contain
the suspended material and minimize turbidity. A raised outflow manifold with baffle plate will

Final Report

be utilized to reduce the horizontal spreading of dredged material during placement so that
mounds are constructed as symmetrically (and thus efficiently) as practicable. Material would be
placed in the area until a target elevation of 3 ft (NAVD 88) is achieved, which would require
approximately 1,000,000 cubic yards of material. Bulrush (Schoenoplectus spp.) will be planted
over the area (10% coverage) to develop intertidal marsh habitat since it is slow to colonize but
will spread over time. Additional native plants including cattails (Typha spp.) will naturally
establish. It is expected that many of the initial channels between mounds will gradually
accumulate sediment, organic material, and vegetation, while some channels will persist as a
dendritic network of tidal marsh channels (Figure 8-2). Any potential impacts of the
recommended plan on the overall conveyance area of delta outflows is extremely small and
impacts to stage and flow are probably not measurable. The impacts to flow conveyance area
would be less for larger floods because water depths are greater and the proposed sand mounds
will become less of a percentage of the total conveyance area.
The restored marsh will include at least one permanent tidal channel that can incidentally
be used as a kayak trail. The permanent channel will be formed by leaving additional unfilled
space between dredged material mounds. The specific location of the channel/kayak trail will be
determined in collaboration with the East Bay Regional Park District during detailed design.
The national significance of the Delta has been demonstrated many times through
decades of Federal authorizations and partnerships. The CALFED Bay-Delta Program, which
emerged from water crises of the 1990s, was a unique collaboration among 25 State and Federal
agencies to improve California’s water supply and the ecological health of the Bay-Delta. The
San Francisco Estuary Partnership is a coalition of resource agencies, non-profits, citizens, and
scientists working to protect, restore, and enhance water quality and fish and wildlife habitat in
the Bay-Delta. Most recently, the 2009 California Bay-Delta Memorandum of Understanding
Among Federal Agencies named the Bay-Delta “among the most important estuary ecosystems
in the Nation” and committed the Federal agencies to work in partnership with the State and
stakeholders to carry out the vision of “a healthy and sustainable Bay-Delta ecosystem that
provides for a high-quality, reliable, and sustainable long-term water supply for California, and
restores the environmental integrity and sustainability of the system.” The RP recommends
Federal action to restore 340 acres intertidal marsh, one of the most sought after habitat types in
this unique, important estuary.
Specific features of the RP include:
The RP includes Big Break increments 1a and 1b using O&M dredging over a ten year
period to create approximately 340 acres of intertidal marsh habitat. Of the 340 acres,
approximately 95 acres would be planted with aquatic vegetation, and the remaining 245 acres
would be shallow water habitat for aquatic fauna species. Dredged material would be acquired
from O&M activities in the San Francisco Bay to Stockton DWSC between approximately
station points 300+00 and 900+00 (see Appendix C). Big Break is owned and managed by the
East Bay Regional Park District as part of Big Break Regional Shoreline. Dredged material
would be directly pumped to the restoration site, rather than the usual land-based dredged

material placement sites. A chemical and granular composition analysis of the materials would
be conducted in advance of placement.

Direct Placement of O&M Dredged Material
A pipeline hydraulic suction dredge would be used to acquire material under the existing
O&M Dredging Project. Dredging rates vary depending on the type of material being dredged,
but production rates of 300 to 600 cubic yards per operational hour are typical. It is estimated
that approximately 100,000 cubic yards of material would be available each year, for a total of
approximately 1,000,000 cubic yards over the estimated 10 year construction period. If a
different quantity of material is available in any given year, the overall construction schedule and
footprint would be adjusted accordingly.
The dredging operations are expected to be conducted 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.
Typically, approximately 18 hours per day are considered ‘operational,’ during which dredging
occurs. Placement would occur over a five year period in the timeframe of August 1 to
November 30, consistent with the current avoidance work windows for Delta smelt and
salmonids established in the Biological Opinions for the O&M Dredging Project. Placement at
Big Break is estimated to occur over approximately 15 days per work year.
Dredged material would be pumped from the dredging vessel directly to Big Break.
Materials would be pumped to the proposed project areas through a floating 18 inch double wall
high density plastic extrusion (HDPE) pipe (see Appendix C). The piping system would be
placed along the shoreline of the Stockton DWSC in the San Joaquin River. The pipeline would
be submerged and anchored to the bottom to avoid navigation hazards. A floating diesel repeater
pump station would be positioned every 3 miles as necessary to aid slurry flow; pump(s) would
be installed on a floating platform with stakes to secure its position. Work boats would install
and maintain the floating pipeline. An additional work boat and crew would tender the position
of the outfall slurry pipe during pumping operations to ensure correct placement of materials.
The pipeline would access Big Break from the DWSC via a land-based crossing at Jersey
Island. There is one dirt farm road running north/south on Jersey Island; the pipeline would be
placed adjacent to the road above ground. Prior to installation of the pipeline, the dirt road
would be improved for vehicular access and hauling. Gravel would be placed on the road at a
width of 25 feet. After the haul road is improved, the pipe would be installed by placing 60-foot
segments of pipe and welding the segments together. The pipeline would take 1 day to install
each construction season and 1 day to remove. The removal process would be the same as the
installation process. A 12 person work crew could complete this task in a 12 hour work day.
The pipeline would cross one farm road running east/west, in addition to two levee roads
on the north and south shore of the island. Above-ground, culvert-style crossings would be
installed at these intersections in order to avoid impacts to the farm fields. The proposed crossing
location is shown on Figure 3-14 above. The Jersey Island crossing is not anticipated to need a
booster pump on the island; however, a floating booster pump station would likely be installed
adjacent to the north shore of Jersey Island.

Delta Island and Levees Feasibility Study

Final Report

In addition, a 1-acre staging area would be used each year on Jersey Island. The staging
area would be located on the south shore of Jersey Island at the end of the haul road and pipeline
crossing. The staging area would be improved, as needed, by placing gravel for vehicular use.
Material Placement
The hydraulic slurry would be discharged at the restoration sites at an assumed average
rate of 450 cubic yards per hour or 8,100 cubic yards per day. Placement of the material will
occur using baffle plates to dispel the energy and direct the sediment downward to create quasisymmetrical sand mounds. Analysis of over 10 years of grain size distribution data for the
400+00 to 850+00 dredging reaches shows the material to be virtually completely fine sand.
Since this sand will be falling in a hydraulic slurry, the sand is assumed to settle to a 1 on 20
slope below the mean tide level (MTL, which is 2 feet higher than the mean lower low water
[MLLW] level) and to a 1 on 10 slope above the MTL. This placement process is similar
enough to sand depositing in the navigation channel that no bulking of the placed dredged
material is assumed and no consolidation of the placed material is assumed (i.e. one cubic yard
taken from the channel is equal in volume to one cubic yard of a placed sand mound).
Sand mounds would be placed so that the mound toes do not overlap, leaving channels of
varying sizes between the mounds. The intent is to ensure that the channel centerlines are never
shallower than the existing condition (-3 to -4 feet MLLW). The goal of this placement plan is
to create a diverse habitat that provides value to both shallow water aquatic fauna that require
varying depths of soft bottom habitat, as well as terrestrial marsh species such as shore birds. In
addition, based on lessons learned from Donlon Island, this design is intended to provide
sufficient flow through the site to maintain water quality. A larger channel will be identified
through the restoration site in the preconstruction engineering and design phase to provide a
kayak trail to minimize the loss of recreational opportunities in the restoration footprint.
The bed material at Big Break is former agricultural land that was prone to subsidence
upon drying, thus the material is assumed to be highly compressible. Chapter 3 describes the
assumptions that are thought to be reasonable but conservative for the compression of Big Break
bed materials beneath hydraulically placed sand.
Sacrificial hay bales will be placed to provide barriers to the predominant flow paths to
allow for sediment settling and sand mound stability. Hay bales are anticipated to persist 1 to 2
years, giving sufficient time for vegetative establishment, after which vegetation is assumed to
provide adequate erosion resistance. Sacrificial hay bales would be used to aid in compliance
with water quality requirements. Hay bale lines are not anticipated to be fully enclosing;
however, should enclosure become a possibility, the top of the sacrificial hay bale line would be
set at mean low tide level to allow fish an opportunity to escape the work area. If unanticipated
quantities of fine-grained material are present in dredged sediments, turbidity curtains can be
used in combination with sacrificial hay bales and would float slightly above the bottom
allowing aquatic species to escape entrapment.

228

Delta Island and Levees Feasibility Study

Final Report

The bed level within the proposed footprint varies from -3 to -4 feet MLLW; mean tides
within Big Break range from 0 feet MLLW to +4 feet MLLW. As a result, bed depths in the
restoration area range from 3 feet during a mean lower low water tide to 8 feet during a mean
higher high water tide. The proposed sand mounds would be constructed with a target elevation
of +3 feet MLLW. Thus at high tide, sand mounds will be approximately 1 foot below the water
surface level; and at low tide, the top of the vegetated sand mounds would be exposed.
Construction of the sand mounds would require approximately six workers.
Approximately 12 employee trips per day of 20 miles each way would be typical for access to
and from the site. Equipment anticipated for construction includes three generators/motors, one
lift pump, and two work boats.
Plantings
Plantings would be installed during two separate periods: the aquatic vegetation would be
installed in the spring and the terrestrial vegetation would be installed in the fall. Following
planting is the initial establishment period, which starts when all the plants have been installed
and accepted. The establishment period would be for three continuous years. Seed collection
would occur in the spring or summer. The seeds would then be propagated in a nursery for
approximately 1 year prior to installation. Chapter 3 identifies species generally conductive to
the project region.
Riparian Planting
Prior to construction, the existing remnant levee would be treated to remove existing
invasive vegetation. Invasive vegetation would be removed using a gas-powered hedger. The
cuttings would be raked-up using pitchforks, and the cuttings would be chipped. The chips
would be spread over the ground as mulch. The exposed residue rootstock would be treated with
three treatments of herbicide, spaced one month apart. The herbicide would be approved for use
near water bodies. This treatment is necessary to ensure the desirable planted grass and terrestrial
vegetation would establish without competition. This would give the desirable vegetation a head
start, and make it harder for the undesirable vegetation to return. Native grass would be seeded
following initial invasive removal to provide both habitat and soil stabilization while the remnant
levee is being monitored to ensure that the invasive treatment is successful. Invasive treatment
of the remnant levee is anticipated to occur the summer before the first dredged placement
occurs.
Terrestrial riparian species would be planted in the fall of the first construction season on
the remnant levee at 235 plants per acre, protected and maintained for 3 years until their roots
have established. Ground water is relatively close to the ground level, so survival is expected to
be high and would easily achieve a goal of 141 plants per acre, or 60% of all installed plants.
The ultimate goal is to promote root growth and enable the plants to achieve self-sufficiency by
the end of the 3 year establishment period. The plantings are considered self-sufficient when a
plant is developed and adapted sufficiently to its setting and is able to sustain itself in its current
environment without artificial or human support.
229
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
Sacramento District

Delta Island and Levees Feasibility Study

Final Report

Terrestrial riparian planting would be installed by a crew of up to eight workers for 12
hour work days. Equipment needs for riparian planting, establishment, and monitoring is
estimated to include a boat, a truck, a hedger, a tractor, and a weed whacker.
Aquatic Planting
Following dredged material placement and the 10-month settlement period, vegetation
would be installed on the sand mounds. Based on experience from the nearby Donlon Island
restoration project, the plantable zone on the placed sand mounds is assumed to be from -2.5 to +
1 feet MTL (or, -0.5 to +3 MLLW). Desirable aquatic vegetation would be planted to pioneer a
source for colonization before undesirable exotic vegetation could develop. The plant material
may be nursery grown or collected from nearby sources and directly planted at the site. For the
purposes of this analysis, it is assumed that the plant material would be nursery grown.
Bulrush (Schoenoplectus spp.) and cattail (Typha spp.) are two desirable prominent
aquatic species that are expected to colonize the mounds. Other aquatic species to be planted are
rushes, sedges and spike rushes. However, since cattail is a dominate colonizer and bulrush is
slow to colonize, bulrush will be planted to give it a head start. Ten percent of the target area
would be planted with bulrush spaced at 3 feet on center, which averages out to approximately
45 plants per acre, with natural recruitment assumed over time. Bulrush will be installed in the
mid elevation of the aquatic planting elevation zone.
Aquatic plant installation would be conducted using a crew of approximately 4 workers.
Equipment needs are estimated to require 2 boats and a truck for approximately 11 days of work
(standard daylight work hours) each planting year.
Monitoring & Adaptive Management
Riparian Plant Monitoring & Adaptive Management
Maintenance activities as part of the riparian plant establishment process would begin
after all installation is complete and would continue through the duration of the 3-year
establishment period. Watering and weeding would ensure that individual plants are kept moist
and free from competition. Mowing would ensure that the site and plants are accessible while
minimizing undesirable seedhead development and potential fire danger. Spraying would reduce
undesirable herbaceous competition, allowing the native grasses a greater opportunity to
establish. Any herbicides used would be in compliance with water quality standards.
During the establishment period, all riparian plants would be surveyed in the fall before
they lose their leaves. All dead terrestrial plants would be identified and replaced that same fall
for the first two years of establishment. Based on historical data, it is expected that mortality
would be below 20% for each of the first two years. Replacement plants would be with the same
species that it is replacing, using the same size container as was originally planted, unless it is
determined that another species would be more appropriate to the site. Where it becomes evident
230

Final Report

a particular species is not conducive to the site, a different species would be substituted to ensure
success.
A riparian plant survival survey would be performed at the end of each establishment
year and a report would be prepared. The report would include the monthly maintenance
records, plant survey totals, and observations and recommendations of how to improve the site.
As-builts would be prepared and kept current of what was planted, how much was planted, and
where it was planted.
A monitoring and adaptive management plan is included as Appendix D. The monitoring
plan establishes the methods and data that would be collected annually in order to determine
restoration success. In addition, adaptive management measures are proposed to address
challenges in meeting restoration success (i.e., lack of vegetative growth, increased turbidity,
etc.) Monitoring reports and records would be required to document planting processes and
progress. Since the purpose of the riparian restoration on the remnant levee is to reduce the
potential for invasive species to overtake the marsh habitat, the riparian plantings would be
monitored for the percent cover of invasive plant species versus native plant species. This
process begins at the completion of the establishment period.
Aquatic Plant Monitoring and Adaptive Management
It is anticipated that the aquatic plantings would not require maintenance. Based on past
experience on similar marsh restoration projects, the vegetation has established very quickly,
typically within one year. During the 10 year construction period, the Corps would monitor the
marsh habitat to ensure that it is performing as expected. If needed, adjustments would be made
to the construction techniques on a year-to-year basis to apply lessons learned and adapt the plan
to achieve maximum success.
The marsh habitat would be monitored following construction of each segment for 5
years to ensure success via percent cover of aquatic species. If needed, invasive plant species
would be removed during the annual monitoring period. If the habitat is not meeting the success
criteria in the timeframe anticipated, then contingency measures would be applied in order to
ensure success. This could include the installation of more plantings, or an adjustment in the
plant selection if the selected species are not conducive to the site.
Monitoring reports documenting the restoration effort would be prepared following the
first monitoring period and would continue annually until the site has met the success criteria.
These reports would include photos, the timing of the completion of the restoration, what
materials were used in the restoration, and plantings (if specified). The reports would also
document the results of the percent cover measurements, the proportional abundance of different
habitat types, and the estimated natural recruitment versus planted habitats. Recommendations
for additional adaptive management measures, as needed, would also be identified in the reports.

Final Report

Operation and Maintenance
Following the establishment period, the project would be turned over to the non-Federal
sponsor for long-term operation and maintenance. The restoration site would not require
significant long-term maintenance beyond the establishment period. Soil accretion and
vegetative recruitment have historically aided plantings on restored intertidal marsh habitats.
Plantings typically survive and reach desired density within 2 years. Long term maintenance
would primarily consist of replacement of any lost habitat due to damage; however, such a
scenario is not considered to be highly likely, and it is anticipated that the habitat would be
independently successful in perpetuity.
8.1.2

Regional Benefits

Although designed to stand alone, the RP complements other efforts underway in the
California Bay-Delta. The State of California, U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, resource agencies,
and other agencies are undertaking the California Water Fix and EcoRestore (formerly BDCP) to
achieve the co-equal goals of providing a more reliable water supply for California and
protecting, restoring, and enhancing the Delta ecosystem. The RP was formulated to not impede
or be dependent upon the State’s California WaterFix/EcoRestore initiatives; however, the RP
does contribute to the goal of restoring the Delta ecosystem. Specifically, restoration of
intertidal marsh is a high priority for the Delta as less than 5% of the historic tidal marsh remains
throughout the Delta, due to agricultural and urban development. The only successful restoration
of this lost habitat has been realized in relatively small areas. While it is difficult to fully restore
connectivity through a small-projects approach, incremental improvements to connectivity can
be made by selecting strategic locations for restoration. For example, Big Break is adjacent to
Dutch Slough, an area currently being restored to tidal marsh habitat by the State of California.
Additionally, across the San Joaquin River lies Donlon Island, an important reference site for this
study, which USACE similarly restored to tidal marsh using dredged material in the early
1990’s. As a result, restoring the proposed tidal marsh at Big Break would increase connectivity
between these currently isolated habitat restoration actions.
The RP provides a variety of environmental and ecosystem benefits to the Delta Region.
USACE has quantified ecological benefits of the intertidal marsh restoration using the marsh
wren blue book model, with the marsh wren acting as an indicator species for assessing this
habitat type. The modeled benefits for marsh wren resulted in 111.44 average annual habitat
units (AAHUs) over the period of analysis (50 years). However, in addition to providing 90
acres of plantable intertidal marsh habitat, the RP also includes 250 acres of shallow water
habitat. It should be noted that the reason for the per acre reduction in quantified Marsh Wren
benefits is because the shallow water channels are not measured by the Marsh Wren model.
However, the channels will provide additional habitat benefits to more valuable, Federally listed
species, as well as contributing a more complex and successful restoration site based on lessons
learned from other restoration actions. There was no Eco-PCX certified model available to
quantify the benefits associated with the shallow water channels at the time that this analysis was
completed, therefore the benefits must be described qualitatively.
232
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
Sacramento District

September 2018

Delta Island and Levees Feasibility Study

Final Report

Because the material is expected to be sandy, it will form into mounds when placed via
hydraulic dredging, which will allow the design of the RP to incorporate varying topography and
interwoven channels. This design would provide benefits for sensitive fish species of National
importance in the Delta, including Delta smelt, juvenile salmonids, and sturgeon. The channels
will provide foraging habitat for juvenile fish species, in addition to spawning habitat for Delta
smelt. Aquatic vegetation would provide a food source for fish species, as well as nesting habitat
for marsh wren and foraging habitat for other migratory birds. This project will result in more
productive wetland and channel habitat that will enhance the food web and biodiversity in the
vicinity, including food organisms used by Delta smelt and other pelagic fish species. These
assumed benefits synergistically improve the overall ecosystem of the Delta region.
The RP presents opportunities for the beneficial use of dredged material to restore
intertidal marsh. An opportunity exists to create a partnership between regional commercial
deep water shipping maintenance activities and ER. Although 340 acres is relatively small given
the expanse of the Delta, the created intertidal marsh would create primary productivity for listed
and non-listed species and contribute to the migratory bird pathway. The project could serve as a
pilot model for future intertidal marsh restoration throughout the Delta allowing other projects to
follow the Delta Islands and Levees Feasibility Study.

8.1.3

Monitoring and Adaptive Management

After each construction season, the restoration site would be monitored until success
criteria are met as specified in the Monitoring and Adaptive Management Plan (MAMP) and in
the Terms and Conditions of the Biological Opinion (see Appendix D and Appendix G). The
MAMP estimates 5 years of monitoring for each construction segment, which would be used to
determine whether adaptive construction is necessary to apply lessons learned over the 10 year
construction period. Additionally, monitoring would ensure that the success criteria for aquatic
and riparian vegetation are met. Since construction is proposed for 10 years, with 5 years of
monitoring for each segment, it is estimated that monitoring could occur for a maximum of 15
years, or less if success is achieved. Monitoring would be both quantitative and qualitative and
would be conducted by a qualified ecologist, botanist, or biologist. The monitor would be
objective and independent from the contractor responsible for maintenance of the site.
Monitoring for endangered species would be performed in accordance with USFWS and NMFS
guidelines. An annual report will document the monitoring results. Estimated monitoring costs
are shown in Table 8-1 below.
If the monitoring results shows that the restoration site is not meeting its success criteria,
as established in the MAMP, then adaptive management measures may be required. These
measures are established and described in the MAMP, and include replanting of vegetation,
adaptive construction of sand mounds, recontouring of previously constructed sand mounds,
additional hay bale placement to adjust the flow regime, and removal of nonnative vegetation.
Estimated adaptive management costs are shown in Table 8-1 below.

8.1.4 Operation, Maintenance, Repair, Replacement, and Rehabilitation
(OMRR&R)
Once construction of each functional portion of the project is complete, that functional
portion would be turned over to the non-Federal sponsor. The non-Federal sponsor would then
be responsible for the OMRR&R of the completed functional portions of the project in
accordance with the interim or final OMRR&R manual.
Maintenance requirements will be discussed in detail in the OMRR&R manual. Based on
the high rate of vegetative success at the nearby Donlon Island reference site, the restoration
plantings are expected to be self-sufficient, therefore requiring no maintenance. A minimal
amount of maintenance of signs, containment barriers, and other items that protect the restoration
areas could be required. Also, periodic checklist type inspections on an annual or biannual basis
would be required to monitor the site for severe adverse effects. A description of monitoring
activities is included in the Monitoring and Adaptive Management Plan, which includes criteria
for ecosystem restoration success, as well as the estimated cost and duration of the monitoring.
Monitoring will continue until criteria for ER success have been met. Monitoring activities will
be cost shared for a period of up to ten years; however, if monitoring is required beyond the ten
year period, the cost of monitoring will be a non-Federal sponsor responsibility, per Section 2039
of WRDA 2007. The EBRPD will continue to manage public recreational use of Big Break
consistent with their resource protection mandate.
OMRR&R costs are included in Table 8-3. During construction, draft and interim
OMRR&R manuals would be prepared in coordination with the non-Federal sponsor and
affected agencies. A final OMRR&R manual would be prepared after the completion of
construction and provided to the non-Federal sponsor.

8.1.4

Real Estate

Acquisition of four property parcels will be required for the RP: two tracts of shallow
open water and levee remnants owned in fee by the EBRPD (the restoration area), and two
nearby parcels of marsh and fast lands on Jersey Island owned in fee by the Ironhouse Sanitary
District, a sewage treatment and water purification agency serving Oakley and Bethel Island.
Because the non-federal sponsor, DWR, is not the primary landowner, USACE has
coordinated the recommended plan with the EBRPD. The EBRPD has stated its willingness to
234
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
Sacramento District

Final Report

become an additional project sponsor for the purpose of providing their lands and has provided a
letter of support for the project.
Installation and operation of a submerged pipeline crossing the slough between the south
bank of Jersey Island and levee remnant of Big Break will also require a lease from the
California State Lands Commission, the authority governing all sovereign tidal lands. USACE
and DWR are in discussions with the State Lands Commission to define the scope of such a lease
and to prepare an application for issuance of an appropriate agreement.
On Jersey Island, DWR will need to obtain a 10-year right to run a temporary pipeline
alongside an agricultural ditch, a 10-year right to create and use a one-acre temporary
construction and laydown yard at the south end of this pipeline for storage of project equipment
and materials during each annual dredging cycle (a period of about two months each year), and a
10-year right of vehicular use of existing unpaved private roads on Jersey Island for delivery of
materials and construction equipment (also for about two months each year). Further details are
located in Appendix K: Real Estate.

Plan Economics

The project first cost was estimated on the basis of October 2018 price levels and
amounts to $25,041,000. This cost estimate includes all additional costs for placement of
dredged material at the restoration site compared to the costs for routine disposal at existing land
disposal sites. Table 8-2 shows this cost by primary project feature. Estimated average annual
costs were based on a 2.75 percent interest rate, a period of analysis of 50 years, and physical
construction ending in 2029. Table 8-3 shows the average annual costs and outputs.

Risk and Uncertainty

In general, the ability of the RP to provide the expected accomplishments depends on the
validity of pertinent assumptions, base data, and analytical techniques used in this study; the
successful completion of future studies, designs, and construction; and appropriate operation and
maintenance after construction.
Other risks include constructability and resiliency to sea level rise. Subsidence reversal
techniques have several factors that could affect constructability, such as estimated volumes of
available material and containment of sediments in open water; however, successful
implementation of similar projects (Donlon Island and Venice Cut) in the vicinity of Big Break
indicate these risks are low. A study of marshes around the San Francisco Bay (Callaway 2015)
showed mean accretion rates over the last 50 years to be between 3-4 mm/year, with nearby
Browns Island having an accretion rate of 4.5 mm/year. This demonstrates that the marshes in
the region are keeping up with sea level rise and are likely to continue being resilient to future
changes. A sea level rise sensitivity analysis and inland hydrology analysis were done for a 100year period in accordance with ER 1100-2-8162 and ECB 2018-3. The proposed project is
expected to be self-correcting in relation to climate change over time, as accretion of sediment
and organic material would exceed the impacts of sea level rise as a result of climate change.
However, changing climate conditions and sea level rise could impact both the tide levels and the
salinity conditions at Big Break. The project would be designed to accommodate both sea level
rise and a variety of hydrological runoff and water management scenarios to address this risk.
The sea level rise assessment for the proposed project is included as Appendix C.

Final Report

The HEP, used to quantify ER benefits, provides a reasonable representation of the
outputs of the project for plan comparison and selection. The use of the well documented,
successful reference sites for the basis of the with-project assumptions for the HEP increases the
certainty of expected benefits. A Monitoring and Adaptive Management Plan (Appendix D) has
been developed to address and reduce implementation risks.

8.1.8

Environmental Operating Principles

The RP supports each of the seven USACE Environmental Operating Principles (EOPs).
The EOPs are:
1. Foster sustainability as a way of life throughout the organization.
2. Proactively consider environmental consequences of all USACE activities and act
accordingly.
3. Create mutually supporting economic and environmentally sustainable solutions.
4. Continue to meet our responsibility and accountability under the law for activities
undertaken by USACE, which may impact human and natural environments.
5. Consider the environment in employing a risk management and systems approach
throughout the life cycles of projects and programs.
6. Leverage scientific, economic, and social knowledge to understand the environmental
context and effects of USACE actions in a collaborative manner.
7. Employ an open, transparent process that respects views of individuals and groups
interested in USACE activities.
The environmental operating principles are met in the following ways:
Environmental balance and sustainability (EOP 1, 2, 3, &4)
•

Project avoids or minimizes environmental impacts while maximizing ecosystem
restoration benefits.

Planning with the environment (EOP 1, 2, 4, and 5)
•

Worked with local resource agencies during planning phase to minimize impacts
to the environment.

Integrate scientific, economic, and social knowledge base (EOP 6)
•

All pertinent, best available information was used during plan formulation and
selection.

8.2

Plan Implementation

This section describes the remaining steps to potential authorization of the project by
Congress and implementation by USACE and the sponsor.

8.2.1

Report Completion

The draft FR/EIS was circulated for public and agency review from April 18, 2014
through June 2, 2014. Public meetings were held on May 7, 2014 and May 9, 2014 to obtain
comments from the public, agencies, and other interested parties. Comments were considered
and incorporated into the FR/EIS, as appropriate. Comments received during the public and
agency review, as well as responses, are included as an appendix to the final report. The final
FR/EIS will be provided to any public agency that provided comments on the draft report.
As required by NEPA, USACE will issue a notice of availability of the final report and
file the report with the USEPA. The USEPA notice of availability published in the Federal
Register starts a 30-day public review period. This final FR/EIS will be circulated to agencies,
organizations, and individuals who have an interest in the proposed project. All comments
received will be considered and incorporated into the final FR/EIS, as appropriate. USACE HQ
will receive comments from Federal and State agencies and the public, and complete its policy
review of the final report.

Final Report

Report Approval

After USACE HQ review of the final FR/EIS, including consideration of public, state and
agency comments, the Chief of Engineers makes a recommendation on project implementation
and authorization by Congress through a Report of the Chief of Engineers. This report will be
submitted to the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works [ASA(CW)], who will review
and approve the NEPA Record of Decision (ROD). Following the ROD, the ASA(CW)’s office
will coordinate with the Office of Management and Budget and submit the report to Congress.
8.2.3

Project Authorization and Construction

If the project is authorized by Congress, construction funds must be appropriated for the
project by Congress before a Project Partnership Agreement (PPA) can be signed by USACE and
the non-Federal sponsor and before project design and construction could begin.

8.2.4

Division of Responsibilities

Federal Responsibilities. USACE would conduct PED studies. After the PPA is signed
and the non-Federal sponsor provides the required cash contribution, lands, easements, rights-ofway, relocations, and disposal areas, the Federal Government would construct the project.
Non-Federal Responsibilities. Under the PPA, the non-Federal sponsor would be
responsible to USACE for all non-Federal costs and maintenance requirements.
Views of Non-Federal Sponsor. The non-Federal sponsor supports the RP.
Financial Capability of Sponsor. The non-Federal sponsor has indicated that it intends
to fund the project, pending further development through the final report and supporting
documents.
Project Cost-Sharing Agreements. After congressional approval, a Design Agreement
must be executed between USACE and the non-Federal sponsor in order to cost share the
development of detailed plans and specifications. Before construction is started, the Federal
Government and the non-Federal sponsor would execute a PPA. The PPA defines the
responsibilities of the parties throughout the project’s design, construction and operational
phases and specifies the non-Federal sponsor’s required financial and real estate contributions.

Further Studies

During PED, some additional studies would be undertaken as part of developing detailed
designs for the project. Upon initiation of PED, any new information that has been collected by
others would be considered before undertaking these additional studies. These studies include:

8.3

•

Hydraulic modeling as required for project design;

•

Topographic surveys for project design; and

•

Cultural resource surveys.

Additional Recommendations

In addition to the above, USACE recommends continued flood risk communication and
flood warning and preparedness planning efforts, as described in Chapter 3. This can be
accomplished through local and state efforts or through USACE programs such as Flood Plain
Management Services and Silver Jackets Programs. Future action for implementing nonstructural
flood risk management measures by other Federal, State, and local agencies will be important for
managing flood risk in the Delta.

CHAPTER 9 – RECOMMENDATIONS
This chapter describes the Items of Cooperation for an Ecosystem Restoration (Single Purpose)
Project that will be specifically authorized. I recommend that the Recommended Plan (RP)
(Alternative 3) be authorized for implementation, as a Federal project, with such modifications
thereof as in the discretion of the Commander, USACE, may be advisable. The estimated first
cost (2018 price levels) of the RP is $25,041,000 with an estimated Federal cost of $16,277,000
and an estimated non-Federal cost of $8,764,000. The estimated annual OMRR&R cost is
$5,000 (2018 price levels) Federal implementation of the RP would be subject to the non-Federal
sponsor complying with applicable Federal laws and policies, including but not limited to:
a. Provide 35 percent of total project costs as further specified below:
1. Provide 35 percent of design costs in accordance with the terms of a design
agreement entered into prior to commencement of design work;

Final Report

However, for lands that the Federal Government determines to be subject to the
navigation servitude, only the Federal Government shall perform such investigations
unless the Federal Government provides the non-Federal sponsor with prior specific
written direction, in which case the non-Federal sponsor shall perform such investigations
in accordance with such written direction;
l. Assume, as between the Federal Government and the non-Federal sponsor, complete
financial responsibility for all necessary cleanup and response costs of any hazardous
substances regulated under CERCLA that are located in, on, or under lands, easements,
or rights-of-way that the Federal Government determines to be required for construction,
operation, and maintenance of the project;
m. Agree, as between the Federal Government and the non-Federal sponsor, that the
non-Federal sponsor shall be considered the operator of the project for the purpose of
CERCLA liability, and to the maximum extent practicable, operate, maintain, repair,
rehabilitate, and replace the project in a manner that will not cause liability to arise under
CERCLA; and
n. Comply with Section 221 of Public Law 91-611, Flood Control Act of 1970, as amended
(42 U.S.C. 1962d-5b), and Section 103(j) of the Water Resources Development Act of
1986, Public Law 99-662, as amended (33 U.S.C. 2213[j]), which provides that the
Secretary of the Army shall not commence the construction of any water resources
project or separable element thereof, until each non-Federal interest has entered into a
written agreement to furnish its required cooperation for the project or separable element.
The recommendations contained herein reflect the information available at this time and current
Departmental policies governing formulation of individual projects. They do not reflect program
and budgeting priorities inherent in the formulation of a national civil works construction
program nor the perspective of higher review levels within the Executive Branch. Consequently,
the recommendations may be modified before they are transmitted to Congress as proposals for
authorization and implementation funding. However, prior to transmittal to Congress, the
sponsor, the State, interested Federal agencies, and other parties will be advised of any
modifications and will be afforded an opportunity to comment further.
