It is located about a mile northeast of the TH 53 realignment (see attached maps). Modificatons of this area for snow storage will be minimal, including removal of sparse foliage and construction of an access road. There are no known archaeological sites in the area. A review of maps and aerials but our project archaeological consultant, Michelle Terrell, indicates that the area was formerly excavated for a tailings pond. As a consequence, there is a no potential for any unknown or undisturbed archaeological sites. Our arhitectural historian, Carole Zellie, feels that it may be on part of a mine dump for the Julia or Wyoming mine.

This is roughly a one-mile segment of US 53, from approximately 2nd Avenue West to Cuyuna Drive in the City of Virginia, St. Louis County, Minnesota. This segment of roadway is subject to iron ore mining rights held by RGGS and Cliffs Natural Resources (United Taconite Division), the mine's owner and operator, respectively. At its east end, the US 53 easement segment connects with MN Trunk Highway 135 (MN 135), which provides the inter-regional link toward Gilbert and other communities to the east. Under the 1960 easement terms, MnDOT agreed to relocate US 53 upon notice from the mine owner/operator. On May 5, 2010, United Taconite (UTAC) provided notice to MnDOT that the 1960 easement rights would be terminated. Under the original easement terms, MnDOT must vacate the US 53 easement within three years. In response to the notice, MnDOT requested a seven-year timeframe for relocation of US 53. The two parties have signed an agreement to modify the easement vacation date as May 2017. L egond ~ l! .. l .. tlr•U un 8~ r: .. ~ .. n•-•tAur""""""e"l A~ .. .., c.::.:-J •-tu nlc lpd..l• l • • S.P. 6918-80, Trunk Highway 53, St. Louis County Minnesota Section 7 Consultation -Request for Concurrence February 17, 2015 Figure -1. 3 --t L ocal Conn ectio ns US H /(}11\Vf:IY IJ.3 Vlrolnla to Evololll Drnfl Ellvlro.tunonln/IIIIJ.Jnct Slnlotnn t~l United States Department of the Interior FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE Twin Cities Field Office 4101 American Blvd E.

The Minnesota Department of Transportation (MNDOT), on behalf of Federal Highway Administration (FHW A), requested concurrence on its "may affect, not likely to adversely affect" determination for gray wolf in accordance with Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.). MNDOT, on behalf ofFHWA, has also made a "no jeopardy" determination for NLEB. The gray wolf was re-listed as a threatened species under the ESA on December 19, 2014, and NLEB was proposed as federally-endangered on October 2, 2013, resulting in the MNDOT's reinitiation of informal consultation for this Project. The Service originally provided a letter of concurrence for this Project (Service No. 03E19002013-l-0038) on February 21, 2013, covering Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis). The proposed action has been modified slightly since this concurrence, but will continue to involve the same construction activities. Alternative E-2 has been selected as the preferred alternative and MNDOT will now have until May 2017 to vacate the easement on the original US53 alignment. A complete administrative record of this consultation is on file in this office. Canada Lynx Your February 21, 2013 letter assessed the effects of the proposed Project on the federallythreatened Canada lynx. We concur with your determination that the proposed project may affect but will not likely adversely affect the Canada lynx. Our concurrence is based on Highway 53 retaining the same speed limit as the old alignment and the likelihood that the proposed project will not result in increased traffic. Approximately 40 acres of trees are located within the project footprint; however, this area has been identified as a highly disturbed area that lacks boreal forests suitable for Canada lynx. Road density will not increase in the area since the original alignment will be removed. The abandoned portion of the highway will be incorporated into the United Taconite mine pit. The proposed action area is located outside of designated Canada lynx critical habitat. Gray wolf We concur with your determination that the Project may affect, but is not likely to adversely affect gray wolf. Our concurrence is based on Highway 53 retaining the same speed limit as the old alignment and the likelihood that the proposed project will not result in increased traffic. Approximately 40 acres of trees are located within the project footprint; however, this area has been identified as a highly disturbed area that lacks high quality habitat suitable for gray wolf. Road density will not increase in the area since the original alignment will be removed. The abandoned portion of the highway will be incorporated into the United Taconite mine pit. The proposed action area is located outside of designated gray wolf critical habitat. Northern long-eared bat The NLEB was proposed for federal listing under the ESA (87 Stat. 884, as amended; 16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) on October 2, 2013. No critical habitat has been proposed at this time. Pursuant to Section 7(a)(4) of the ESA, federal action agencies are required to confer with the Service if they determine that the proposed federal action is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the NLEB (50 CFR 402.10(a)). Action agencies may also voluntarily confer with the Service if the proposed action may affect a proposed species. To conference on a species that is proposed for listing is similar to "consultation" on species that is listed under the ESA. Although species proposed for listing are not afforded protection under the ESA, when a species is listed, the prohibitions against jeopardizing its continued existence and unauthorized "take" are effective immediately, regardless of an action's stage of completion. Therefore, if implementation of the proposed project occurs after a northern long-eared bat final listing decision is made (a final listing decision is expected by April2, 2015), consultation will likely be required under Section 7 of the Act. If the NLEB is listed as federally-threatened or endangered under the Act, and the proposed action "may affect" northern long-eared bat, consultation will be required under Section 7 ofthe Act. Northern long-eared bat Conference Report Your February 17, 2015, letter provided rationale for your determination that the proposed Project is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of this species. This letter also included Minnesota Department of Natural Resources' (MDNR) Final Report on northern longeared bat Surveys in the TH 53 Project Area. The report identified NLEB utilizing the project area at all 12 acoustical monitor locations, but could not confirm fall swarming outside of suspected hibernacula for the species. Only little brown bat was identified at the entrance of suspected hibernacula, although the report suggests that it is possible that NLEB also hibernate at the location approximately 0.13 miles from Alternative E-2 and the existing Landfill Road. Based on the following information, the Service does not believe that this project is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of this species. • The proposed Project area does contain known bat hibemacula; however, use by NLEB has not been confirmed. The closest known NLEB hibernaculum is more than 25 miles from the project area. • MNDOT has determined that Alternative E-2 will not directly impact any of the four potential wintering sites identified in the MDNR report. • MNDOT has committed to conducting tree clearing outside of the summer roost season. The species is not anticipated to be present within the action area between October 15'h and March 30'h and the clearing of trees during this time would not result in direct take. • Approximately 40 acres of forested habitat would be removed as a result of this project and a small percentage of this is anticipated to be suitable summer roosting habitat (trees of>3 inches in diameter at breast height). The total acres of potential summer roosting habitat would represent a small percentage of potential suitable summer habitat available in the surrounding landscape. Loss of this habitat is not expected to have significant impact on current population levels. • White-nose syndrome (WNS) has not been confirmed in Minnesota; however, Soudan Mine and Mystery Cave are known to harbor the fungus that causes white nose syndrome (Pseudogymnoascus destructans). To our knowledge, the fungus has not caused WNS in bats in Minnesota, and we conclude that the local population of northern long-eared bats in the action area is not yet impacted by WNS. This concludes consultation under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, as amended, for the gray wolf, Canada lynx and informal conferencing for the NLEB. Please contact the Service if the project changes or new information reveals effects of the action to proposed or listed species or critical habitat to an extent not covered in your Biological Assessment. We will continue our coordination with your office once a final listing decision for NLEB has been reached to provide any additional guidance, if necessary. If you have questions, please contact Mr. Andrew Horton, Fish and Wildlife Biologist, at 612-725-3548 (extension 2208), or via email at andrew_ horton@fws.gov. Sincerely, ~ Peter Fasbender Field Supervisor cc (email only): Nancy Frick, Minnesota Department of Transportation Northern long-eared bat -Determination of May Affect, but is not Likely to Adversely Affect Minnesota Department of Natural Resources -Northern long-eared bat -Summer/Winter Surveys MnDOT contracted with the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) to conduct summer and winter surveys in an attempt to determine if northern long-eared bats NLEB) were present within the action area as well as potential wintering sites for this species. Note: the project will be constructed well within the summer foraging range of the large hibernaculum which is located approximately 25 miles away at the Tower-Sudan Mine complex. Northern long-eared bat-Tree Removal As indicated in the Northern Long-Eared Bat Interim Conference and Planning Guidance issued by the Service on January 6, 2014, the northern long-eared bat uses a variety of tree species during its summer roosting and foraging activities. As a result, any action that requires the removal of trees during this summer period, which is approximately, April 1-October 1, could potentially result in some form of take, either direct or indirect or potentially both. In order to minimize the potential for impacts. the Service recommends that tree removal occur during the winter season which is approximately October 1-April 1. MnDOT has commented to follow Service's recommended tree removal schedule. Northern long-eared bat -Potential Wintering Sites The MNDNR reviewed four potential fall swarming sites which were surveyed between 2 September and 8 October 2014 (see the attached MNDNR survey report). Detectors were set out twice at each site and run for 2-3 days. NLEB were detected at each site by identification software, but were not confirmed by MNDNR biologist for site 165 (which is shown on the figure below). While all sites showed bat activity in September, only site 165 showed a substantial number of call files for October. This site was the potential portal originally identified by MnDOT (see below) and suggests that fall swarming activity was taking place there. The majority of calls at this site were Little Brown Bats. While it is expected that this species would be the most abundant occupant of any hibernaculum at this site, it is possible that NLEB also hibernate here. None of the alternatives analyzed. including the preferred, will directly impact any for the four potential wintering sites. Northern long-eared bat -Determination The potential project impacts were reviewed with the Service. MnDOT on behalf of FHWA initially determined that the project impacts were not of a magnitude that would result in jeopardizing the continued existence of this species. However, since the change in the species status in May of 2015 to threatened, updated consultation and a new determination of effect is now required. Based on further coordination with the Service, it was determined that by following the winter tree removal schedule and due to the lack of direct impacts to the identified potential wintering sites, a determination of may affect, but is not likely to adversely affect is the appropriate consultation path. Therefore, MnDOT, on behalf of FHWA, has determined that the proposed action may affect, but is not likely to adversely affect the northern long-eared bat. Currently there is no critical habitat proposed for this species. S.P. 6918-80, Trunk Highway 53, St. Louis County Minnesota Section 7 Consultation -Request for Concurrence July 15, 2015 Piping Plover-Detennination of No Effect There are no known occurrences of this species within the action area. In addition, the project area does not contain habitat preferred by the species and is well outside of any designated critical habitat. Therefore, MnDOT on behalf of the FHWA has made a determination of no effect for this species. Rufa red knot -Detennination of No Effect There are no known occurrences of this species within the action area. In addition, the project area does not contain habitat preferred by the species. Currently there is no critical habitat proposed for this species. Therefore, MnDOT, on behalf of the FWHA, has made a determination of no effect for this species. Canada lynx I Gray Wolf-Detennination of May Affect, but is not Likely to Adversely Affect The project location is within the distribution range of both the gray wolf and the Canada lynx but outside of the respective designated critical habitat areas for these species (see critical habitat maps on the below). However, since this project involves the relocation of a four-lane roadway, the Service was contacted to help detennine the appropriate consultation path in accordance with Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as Amended. After reviewing the proposed project, the extent of previous and current mining activity in the area which has resulted in major landscape level alterations and the lack of designated critical habitat in the project area, it was decided that a determination of may affect, but is not likely to adversely affect was the most appropriate consultation path. S.P. 6918-80, Trunk Highway 53, St. Louis County Minnesota Section 7 Consultation -Request for Concurrence July 15, 2015 Concurrence Request-Based on the information and coordination provided above, MnDOT acting as the nonfederal representative for the FHWA, has determined that the proposed action may affect, but is not likely to adversely affect the Canada lynx, gray wolf, or the northern long-eared bat.

Minnesota Power has reviewed the Final EIS and commends the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT), as joint lead agencies, and the numerous cooperating and participating agencies for their thorough environmental review and analysis of the many facets of this project. The planning, public communication and input associated with the review of this project will significantly and appropriately advance the environmental assessment process to the benefit of all Minnesotans. As outlined in the Final EIS, the Relocation Project is required to address the termination of easements rights for the segment of Highway 53 that crosses lands and associated minerals that are owned by RGGS and leased by United Taconite. The involved agencies have thoroughly reviewed multiple alternatives, and associated environment impacts, before selecting a preferred alternative. The Final EIS, as proposed, appropriately addresses environmental concerns related to the preferred alternative route for the project. Minnesota Power recognizes the mining industry's positive socioeconomic impact on the economy of Northern Minnesota and this project's impact will enrich the region's economy for years to come. Access to the iron ore under the existing Highway 53 will allow United Taconite to remain viable for many years in the future. Continued mining operations at United Taconite will greatly enhance the economy as these jobs provide stability, not only for miners and their families, but for those in supporting industries as well. Minnesota Power wholeheartedly supports this project. We look forward to the completion of the permitting process and the subsequent commencement of the actual project. In closing, I'd like to thank you again for the opportunity to comment in this crucial permitting process, and we look forward to the opportunity to give our input on the permitting of similar projects in the future. Sincerely, -~ c:--2-· --David J.

Cultural Resources, attached, for locations of alignments). This project area is within the winter and summer range of the Northern Long-eared Bat (Myotis septentrionalis; NLEB; Figures 1, 2). Thus, any of these alternatives, except perhaps the "No Build" alternative, has the potential to impact this species through removal of roosting trees, destruction of winter habitat and inadvertent taking of bats. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) is currently evaluating this species for federal listing under the Endangered Species Act. Figure 1. (above) Northern Long-eared Bat. Photo: New York Dept. of Environ. Cons. Figure 2. (right) Range of Northern Long-eared Bat in the eastern United States. Source: U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Northern Long-eared Bat Surveys in the TH 53 Project Area MnDOT Contract No. 06453 page2 Final determination is scheduled for spring 2015. In the meantime, the USFWS has issued guidance and recommendations for consideration of NLEB in project planning (Northern Longeared Bat Interim Conference and Planning Guidance, January 6, 2014; http://www.fws.gov/midwest/endangered/mammals/nlba/pdf/NLEBinterimGuidance6Jan2014 :.ru!f). The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) entered into an agreement with MNDOT to assess the TH 53 project area for the summer presence and potential winter presence of NLEB. Methods Protocol and survey methods employed followed those described in the NLEB Interim Conference and Planning Guidance and the 2014 Rangewide Indiana Bat Summer Survey Guidelines, January 13, 2014; http://www.fws.gov/Midwest/endangered/mammals/inba/surveys/pdf/20141BatSummerSurve yGuidelines13Jan2014.pdf). Assessment of the presence of N LEB in the TH 53 project area included: 1. Review of existing information on the presence on NLEB in the project area. 2. Assessment of suitable summer habitat in the project area through aerial photography and ground surveys. 3. Assessment of potential winter hibernacula in the project area through aerial photography and ground surveys. 4. Acoustic surveys for summer presence. Ana Bat SD2 bat detectors were set along the alternative alignments; one detector set for every kilometer (0.6 mile) of potential roadway and operated for a minimum of 2 nights. All summer presence/absence surveys were completed before August 15. The presence of NLEB was determined by first processing call files through two identification software programs, approved by the USFWS (refer to Acoustic Bat Identification Software Testing Criteria-Draft January 2013; http://www.fws.gov/midwest/endangered/mammals/inba/surveys/pdf/AcousticPrgrmDrftTest Criteria3Jan13.pdf). All high frequency myotid calls identified by the software programs were then visually evaluated by a skilled biologist. 5. Acoustic surveys for fall swarming activity outside mine portals and other features. Evidence of bat swarming activity may indicate that winter hibernacula exist. Ana Bat SD2 bat detectors were set outside voids and rock crevices that could be portals to potential winter hibernacula. Detectors were operated a minimum of 2 nights at each site. This was repeated at least 2 Northern Long-eared Bat Surveys in the TH 53 Project Area MnDOT Contract No. 06453 page3 weeks later; both survey bouts were conducted between September 1 and October 31. Calls were identified according to the procedure described for summer presence surveys (#4, above). Results and Discussion Call File Analysis Approved software programs selected for bat call identification were BC/0 East (Version 2.5c, Ryan Allen, Bat Call Identification, Inc.) and EchoC/ass (Version 2.0, Eric Britzke, U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center). A total of 25,547 call files were recorded from all sites and time periods. Of that total, BCID identified approximately 14,700 files as bats, EchoCiass identified 15,784, and the remaining files were rejected as "noise." Both programs identified many high frequency myotid calls (~35 kHz) at all sites. Although the software programs provide an automated analysis of large datasets, hence saving a great deal of time, they have their limitations. Bat calls can be quite variable depending on foraging habitat and behavior of the bats. The detectors do not always record clear or complete calls. This variation in calls is difficult for software programs to accommodate and results in a degree of error that may be unsatisfactory for some assessments. Determination of the presence of NLEB should never rely solely on the results of identification software. The resulting call analyses by these two programs differed greatly in the species identified and their relative abundance. Because of this, it was decided that an individual, skilled in bat call identification, would review all call files, paying particular attention to any potential NLEB calls. Assessment of Northern Long-eared Bats 1. Existing information. The nearest known occurrences of NLEB during summer and winter from the Soudan Underground Mine/Lake Vermillion area, approximately 25 miles from the TH 53 project area. 2. Suitable summer habitat. Based on aerial photography and ground surveys, suitable forest habitat and foraging openings along forest edges and near water were identified. 3. Potential winter habitat. Based on a map of the old mine drifts provided by MNDOT (Figure 3) and ground surveys (Figure 4), several potential locations for winter hibernacula were tentatively identified. 4. Summer presence surveys. Twelve sites were surveyed between 24 July and 8 August 2014 along the alternative alignments (sites 1-12, Figure 5). Detectors were run 3-4 nights and habitat of the site and nearby trees were described (Appendix 1). Northern Long-eared Bat Surveys in the TH 53 Project Area MnDOT Contract No. 06453 page 4 NLEB were detected at each site by identification software and verified by MNDNR biologist. All bat species identified at each site are summarized in Table 1. Relative abundance of bat species at each site, and a comparison of results from the two software programs, is illustrated in Appendix 2. Both software programs showed sites 2 and 3 had the most calls identified as NLEB, however, after review by MNDNR, site 5 actually had more NLEB calls (Figure 6). While higher numbers or percentages indicate more NLEB activity at these sites, they do not confirm the presence of maternity roost trees. Survey results showed that NLEB are widespread throughout the project area and are definitely foraging here. Proof that bats are using trees in the area for maternity roosts can only be confirmed with telemetry studies. Based on NLEB telemetry work conducted in June 2014, female NLEB may fly as far as 1.5 miles between foraging and roosting areas, but generally fly 0.5 miles. Trees chosen for roost sites varied by species and size--trembling aspen were the most common tree used, but also red oak, red maple, basswood, black ash and jack pine. Tree size varied from 5 to 24 em dbh (diameter breast height) and included living trees and snags (Catton, T. J. 2014. Summary of the 2014 Minnesota Northern long-eared bat summer habitat use in Minnesota project {preliminary report). Considering the presence of suitable roost trees, the size of the project area and the average distance traveled by female NLEB, it should be expected that female NLEB roost on the project area. 5. Potential hibernacula. Four potential fall swarming sites were surveyed between 2 September and 8 October 2014 (sites 165, 168-170, Figure 5). Detectors were set out twice at each site and run for 2-3 days (Appendix 1). NLEB were detected at each site by identification software, but were not confirmed by MNDNR biologist for site 165. Figure 7 compares the average number of bat calls/detector night identified by the two software programs. While all sites showed bat activity in September, only site 165 showed a substantial number of call files for October (n=1150 for BCID and n=999 for EchoCiass). This site was the potential portal originally identified by MnDOT (Figures 3, 4) and suggests that fall swarming activity was taking place there. The majority of calls at this site were Little Brown Bats. While it is expected that this species would be the most abundant occupant of any hibernaculum at this site, it is possible that NLEB also hibernate here. Northern Long-eared Bat Surveys in the TH 53 Proj ect Area MnDOT Contract No. 06453 pageS ....

The resources are presented in the order they are addressed in the Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). The commitments referenced in this document (starting on page 4) pertain to the specific obligations agreed upon for this action during the pre-design/NEPA phases of the project development process. The intention of this Green Sheet list and the accompanying chain of custody on page 3 is to provide a mechanism for tracking transfer and completion of project commitments from the NEPA process through final design and permitting, development of plans and specifications, construction, and, if applicable, post-construction/maintenance. The NEPA commitments are listed in this document and include information on when it is anticipated that they would be implemented (i.e., which phase of construction). However, this is a living document, and as additional information on how the project will be designed, bid, and constructed is decided, some of the implementation assumptions may change. Also, additional (non-routine) commitments may be added as a result of permit conditions, etc. As changes or additions are made during future stages of project development, they must be tracked by the MnDOT Project Manager in a way that completion of the original NEPA commitments can be tracked and documented. Throughout the future project development stages, the chain of custody table will be used to track transfer of responsibility for ensuring commitments are being conveyed and implemented. Also, as commitments are completed, the date of completion and the party/person documenting completion of the commitment should be noted – see the columns provided for status, completion date, and sign off in the table starting on page 4. NOTE: Measures that will be taken in accordance with standard construction specifications or as part of various routine permit requirements are listed in a separate table at the end of this document since they require less detailed description and tracking than project-specific commitments. NOTE: If a contractor chooses to pursue temporary easements for staging areas that are not identified in the Final EIS, standard erosion control and site management best management practices (BMPs) will also apply to those areas. Project Description The Draft EIS identified Alternative E-2 as the preferred alternative based on its ability to meet the project Purpose and Need and minimize impacts to social, economic, and environmental resources, and on the basis of a number of technical and cost considerations, as described below. As identified in the Draft EIS, the Interchange Option was selected for the preferred alternative over the Intersection Option. These options have similar social and environmental impacts; however, the Interchange Option would maintain the current access provided at US 53 and MN 135 and would provide safer approach grades from the east (two percent compared to six percent with an intersection), resulting in less potential semi-truck/vehicle conflict. This reduction in grade would also reduce the earthwork and rock cut quantities required for construction. After publication of the Draft EIS, the Straight Option was selected (over the Curved Setback Option) as part of the preferred alternative based on public and agency comment, refinement of the design, and less environmental impact. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS Benefits of the preferred alternative include: ■ Mineral Rights: Avoids the permit to mine/environmental setting boundary ■ Business Risks: Has no risk for air quality compliance to impact mine operations ■ Water Supply: Avoids the major dewatering that would be required for the Alternative E-1 RSS Option ■ Wetlands: Has fewer wetland impacts than Alternative E-1A and Alternative M-1 ■ Noise: A noise wall is preliminarily cost effective at affected residential locations ■ Right-of-Way: Impacts the fewest number of parcels of any Build Alternative ■ Engineering and Constructability Considerations: ■ Shorter bridge than the Alternative E-1A Bridge Option ■ Only two pier foundations required, compared to up to eight for the Alternative E-1A Bridge Option ■ Less work required to construct in the water/ice of the Rouchleau Pit ■ Avoids 40 mph curve needed for Alternative E-1A ■ Has a better sight distance northbound from the bridge to the 2nd Avenue traffic signal than Alternative E-1A ■ Piers to be constructed in less than 30 feet of mine waste fill as compared to Alternative E-1A that would have up to 100 feet of mine waste fill ■ Schedule: Has the least schedule risk due to engineering constructability considerations noted above as well as considerations related to owner and operator property interests ■ Cost: Costs significantly less than the Existing US 53 Alternative and Alternative M-1, and the upper range of the cost estimate is less than that for either the Alternative E-1A RSS Option or Bridge Option Construction for the project is to be divided into three work packages. Work package one (WP1) includes early steel acquisition, work package two (WP2) includes all bridge related construction over the Rouchleau Pit, and work package three (WP3) includes all other construction activities (i.e., roadway, utilities, interchange, and trail). Mitigation measures identified in the following tables will not apply to WP1 since it does not include any on-site activities but may apply to WP2 and WP3, as noted in the tables. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS Chain of Custody Action  Name  Date  Expectation  Prepared by:  To the best of my knowledge all commitments made in environmental documents and public discussions have been captured here  Received in Detail Design by:  Commitments documented here will be honored or renegotiated  Updated in Detail Design by:  To the best of my knowledge all commitments specified in the Green Sheets have been incorporated into the plans or renegotiated and any new commitments have been added  Received in Construction by:  Commitments documented here will be honored or renegotiated  Completed in Construction:  To the best of my knowledge all commitments specified in the Green Sheets have been constructed or renegotiated and any new commitments have been added  Received Post-Construction:  Commitments documented here will be honored or renegotiated  Completed Post-Construction:  All commitments have been fulfilled or renegotiated  September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS Plan Review Stage  Agencies  Status Update  Date  Completion Date  Completion Signed Off By  Design  Construction  Post-Construction  No Further Work Required  Standard Mitigation Measures Mitigation Measure  MnDOT Specification Number  WP11  WP22  WP33  Status Update Description  Status Update Date  Completion Date  Signed Off By  Economics and Business  Manage traffic control to minimize business impacts during construction  2563  N/A  X  X  Utilities  Provide early notice to utility operators and facilitate coordination  2545  N/A  X  X  Water Supply/Water Body Modification  Standard erosion control/construction BMPs  2573  N/A  X  X  Turbidity controls during construction  2573  N/A  X  X  Stormwater conveyance/treatment and spill containment provisions  2503  N/A  X  X  Surface Water/Water Quality and Quantity  Comply with NPDES permit for construction activity throughout construction  2573  N/A  X  X  Noise  Follow standard MnDOT construction noise practices  2422  N/A  X  X  Vegetation and Cover Types  Revegetation and stabilization of disturbed areas  2575  N/A  X  X  Air Quality  Implement dust control BMPs such as watering  2013  N/A  X  X  Hazardous and Regulated Materials  Handle regulated materials/wastes per management plan, Response Action Plan, demolition plan, and MnDOT Guidance documents  2013  N/A  X  X  Follow standard BMPs for handling taconite-containing materials and spills  2013  N/A  X  X  Excess Materials  Dispose of excess material per approved disposal plan  2013, 2105  N/A  X  X  1 Work Package 1 (WP1) includes early steel acquisition 2 Work Package 2 (WP2) includes all bridge related construction over Rouchleau Pit 3 Work Package 3 (WP3) includes all other construction activities including roads, utilities, interchange, and trail September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS Project Specific Mitigation Mitigation Measure  WP11  WP22  WP33  Status Update Description  Status Update Date  Completion Date  Signed Off By  Water Supply/Water Body Modification  Specify the source and nature of any fill material used (e.g., use of clean fill, prohibiting the use of taconite tailings as fill within the Rouchleau Pit)  N/A  X  X  Follow additional BMPs to prevent any potential transfers of aquatic invasive species (AIS) into the water (e.g., having any equipment or material used for dewatering or construction exposed to dry conditions for at least five days before coming into contact with the waterbody)  N/A  X  X  Follow mitigation measures in DNR water appropriation permit  N/A  X  X  Wetlands  Withdraw 9.96 acres of wetland replacement credit from account #1595 to cover wetland impacts regulated by USACE and under WCA  N/A  X  X  Follow conditions set forth in wetland permits issued by USACE and WCA LGU  N/A  X  X  Surface Water/Water Quality and Quantity  Follow SWPPP BMPs addressing barge use during construction  N/A  X  Follow BMPs for control of weeds and invasive species near sensitive areas  N/A  X  Fish and Wildlife/Threatened and Endangered Species  If peregrine falcons are observed during construction, contact the MnDOT biologist for coordination  N/A  X  X  Conduct tree removal  between October and April;

Applicants for Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) Public Waters permits MUST use the MPARS online permitting system for submitting applications to the DNR. Applicants can use the information entered into MPARS to substitute for completing parts of this joint application form (see the paragraph on MPARS at the end of the joint application form instructions for additional information). This form is only applicable to the water resource aspects of proposed projects under state and federal regulatory programs; other local applications and approvals may be required. Depending on the nature of the project and the location and type of water resources impacted, multiple authorizations may be required as different regulatory programs have different types of jurisdiction over different types of resources. Regulatory Review Structure Federal The St. Paul District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) is the federal agency that regulates discharges of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States (wetlands, tributaries, lakes, etc.) under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) and regulates work in navigable waters under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act. Applications are assigned to Corps project managers who are responsible for implementing the Corps regulatory program within a particular geographic area. State There are three state regulatory programs that regulate activities affecting water resources. The Wetland Conservation Act (WCA) regulates most activities affecting wetlands. It is administered by local government units (LGUs) which can be counties, townships, cities, watershed districts, watershed management organizations or state agencies (on state-owned land). The Minnesota DNR Division of Ecological and Water Resources issues permits for work in specially-designated public waters via the Public Waters Work Permit Program (DNR Public Waters Permits). The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act certifies that discharges of dredged or fill material authorized by a federal permit or license comply with state water quality standards. One or more of these regulatory programs may be applicable to any one project. Required Information Prior to submitting an application, applicants are strongly encouraged to seek input from the Corps Project Manager and LGU staff to identify regulatory issues and required application materials for their proposed project. Project proponents can request a preapplication consultation with the Corps and LGU to discuss their proposed project by providing the information required in Sections 1 through 5 of this joint application form to facilitate a meaningful discussion about their project. Many LGUs provide a venue (such as regularly scheduled technical evaluation panel meetings) for potential applicants to discuss their projects with multiple agencies prior to submitting an application. Contact information is provided below. The following bullets outline the information generally required for several common types of determinations/authorizations. • For delineation approvals and/or jurisdictional determinations, submit Parts 1, 2 and 5, and Attachment A. • For activities involving CWA/WCA exemptions, WCA no-loss determinations, and activities not requiring mitigation, submit Parts 1 through 5, and Attachment B. • For activities requiring compensatory mitigation/replacement plan, submit Parts 1 thru 5, and Attachments C and D. • For local road authority activities that qualify for the state’s local road wetland replacement program, submit Parts 1 through 5, and Attachments C, D (if applicable), and E to both the Corps and the LGU. Minnesota Interagency Water Resource Application Form February 2014 Page 1 of 12 Submission Instructions Send the completed joint application form and all required attachments to: U.SArmy Corps of Engineers. Applications may be sent directly to the appropriate Corps Office. For a current listing of areas of responsibilities and contact information, visit the St. Paul District’s website at: http://www.mvp.usace.army.mil/Missions/Regulatory.aspx and select “Minnesota” from the contact Information box. Alternatively, applications may be sent directly to the St. Paul District Headquarters and the Corps will forward them to the appropriate field office. Section 401 Water Quality Certification: Applicants do not need to submit the joint application form to the MPCA unless specifically requested. The MPCA will request a copy of the completed joint application form directly from an applicant when they determine an individual 401 water quality certification is required for a proposed project. Wetland Conservation Act Local Government Unit: Send to the appropriate Local Government Unit. If necessary, contact your county Soil and Water Conservation District (SWCD) office or visit the Board of Water and Soil Resources (BWSR) web site (www.bwsr.state.mn.us) to determine the appropriate LGU. DNR Public Waters Permitting: In 2014 the DNR will begin using the Minnesota DNR Permitting and Reporting System (MPARS) for submission of Public Waters permit applications (https://webapps11.dnr.state.mn.us/mpars/public/authentication/login). Applicants for Public Waters permits MUST use the MPARS online permitting system for submitting applications to the DNR.  To avoid duplication and to streamline the application process among the various resource agencies, applicants can use the information entered into MPARS to substitute for completing parts of this joint application form.  The MPARS print/save function will provide the applicant with a copy of the Public Waters permit application which, at a minimum, will satisfy Parts one and two of this joint application.  For certain types of activities, the MPARS application may also provide all of the necessary information required under Parts three and four of the joint application.  However, it is the responsibility of the Applicant to make sure that the joint application contains all of the required information, including identification of all aquatic resources impacted by the project (see Part four of the joint application).  After confirming that the MPARS application contains all of the required information in Parts one and two the Applicant may attach a copy to the joint application and fill in any missing information in the remainder of the joint application. Minnesota Interagency Water Resource Application Form February 2014 Page 2 of 12 Project Name and/or Number: TH 53 Relocation PART ONE: Applicant Information If applicant is an entity (company, government entity, partnership, etc.), an authorized contact person must be identified.

For example, a project with a temporary access fill that would be removed after 220 days would be entered “T (220)”. 2Impacts less than 0.01 acre should be reported in square feet. Impacts 0.01 acre or greater should be reported as acres and rounded to the nearest 0.01 acre.  Tributary impacts must be reported in linear feet of impact and an area of impact by indicating first the linear feet of impact along the flowline of the stream followed by the area impact in parentheses).  For example, a project that impacts 50 feet of a stream that is 6 feet wide would be reported as 50 ft (300 square feet). 3This is generally only applicable if you are applying for a de minimis exemption under MN Rules 8420.0420 Subp. 8, otherwise enter “N/A”. 4Use Wetland Plants and Plant Community Types of Minnesota and Wisconsin 3rd Ed. as modified in MN Rules 8420.0405 Subp. 2. 5Refer to Major Watershed and Bank Service Area maps in MN Rules 8420.0522 Subp. 7. If any of the above identified impacts have already occurred, identify which impacts they are and the circumstances associated with each: N/A PART FIVE: Applicant Signature 1 The term “impact” as used in this joint application form is a generic term used for disclosure purposes to identify activities that may require approval from one or more regulatory agencies.  For purposes of this form it is not meant to indicate whether or not those activities may require mitigation/replacement. Minnesota Interagency Water Resource Application Form February 2014 Page 4 of 12 Project Name and/or Number: TH 53 Relocation Attachment A Request for Delineation Review, Wetland Type Determination, or Jurisdictional Determination By submission of the enclosed wetland delineation report, I am requesting that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, St. Paul District (Corps) and/or the Wetland Conservation Act Local Government Unit (LGU) provide me with the following (check all that apply): Wetland Type Confirmation Delineation Concurrence.  Concurrence with a delineation is a written notification from the Corps and a decision from the LGU concurring, not concurring, or commenting on the boundaries of the aquatic resources delineated on the property. Delineation concurrences are generally valid for five years unless site conditions change. Under this request alone, the Corps will not address the jurisdictional status of the aquatic resources on the property, only the boundaries of the resources within the review area (including wetlands, tributaries, lakes, etc.). PreliminaryJurisdictional Determination. A preliminary jurisdictional determination (PJD) is a non-binding written indication from the Corps that waters, including wetlands, identified on a parcel may be waters of the United States. For purposes of computation of impacts and compensatory mitigation requirements, a permit decision made on the basis of a PJD will treat all waters and wetlands in the review area as if they are jurisdictional waters of the U.S. PJDs are advisory in nature and may not be appealed. ApprovedJurisdictional Determination. An approved jurisdictional determination (AJD) is an official Corps determination that jurisdictional waters of the United States are either present or absent on the property. AJDs can generally be relied upon by the affected party for five years. An AJD may be appealed through the Corps administrative appeal process. In order for the Corps and LGU to process your request, the wetland delineation must be prepared in accordance with the 1987 Corps of Engineers Wetland Delineation Manual, any approved Regional Supplements to the 1987 Manual, and the Guidelines for Submitting Wetland Delineations in Minnesota (2013). http://www.mvp.usace.army.mil/Missions/Regulatory/DelineationJDGuidance.aspx Minnesota Interagency Water Resource Application Form February 2014 Page 6 of 12 Project Name and/or Number: TH 53 Relocation Attachment B Supporting Information for Applications Involving Exemptions, No Loss Determinations, and Activities Not Requiring Mitigation Complete this part if you maintain that the identified aquatic resource impacts in Part Four do not require wetland replacement/compensatory mitigation OR if you are seeking verification that the proposed water resource impacts are either exempt from replacement or are not under CWA/WCA jurisdiction. Identify the specific exemption or no-loss provision for which you believe your project or site qualifies: We anticipate several wetlands are isolated and not under CWA jurisdiction (see Section 5.4.2 of the attached narrative). A request for an approved jurisdictional determination will be submitted under separate cover. We anticipate several wetlands have developed in roadside ditches cut in upland, and are out of scope of the WCA (see Sections 5.4.2 and 5.5.1.2 of the attached narrative). Provide a detailed explanation of how your project or site qualifies for the above. Be specific and provide and refer to attachments and exhibits that support your contention. Applicants should refer to rules (e.g. WCA rules), guidance documents (e.g. BWSR guidance, Corps guidance letters/public notices), and permit conditions (e.g. Corps General Permit conditions) to determine the necessary information to support the application. Applicants are strongly encouraged to contact the WCA LGU and Corps Project Manager prior to submitting an application if they are unsure of what type of information to provide: See Sections 5.4.2 and 5.5.1.2 of the attached narrative. A request for an approved jurisdictional determination with additional supporting information will be submitted under separate cover. Minnesota Interagency Water Resource Application Form February 2014 Page 7 of 12 Project Name and/or Number: TH 53 Relocation Attachment C Avoidance and Minimization Project Purpose, Need, and Requirements. Clearly state the purpose of your project and need for your project.  Also include a description of any specific requirements of the project as they relate to project location, project footprint, water management, and any other applicable requirements. Attach an overhead plan sheet showing all relevant features of the project (buildings, roads, etc.), aquatic resource features (impact areas noted) and construction details (grading plans, storm water management plans, etc.), referencing these as necessary: See Section 2.3 of attached narrative Avoidance. Both the CWA and the WCA require that impacts to aquatic resources be avoided if practicable alternatives exist. Clearly describe all on-site measures considered to avoid impacts to aquatic resources and discuss at least two project alternatives that avoid all impacts to aquatic resources on the site. These alternatives may include alternative site plans, alternate sites, and/or not doing the project. Alternatives should be feasible and prudent (see MN Rules 8420.0520 Subp. 2 C). Applicants are encouraged to attach drawings and plans to support their analysis: See Section 5.4.1 of attached narrative Minimization. Both the CWA and the WCA require that all unavoidable impacts to aquatic resources be minimized to the greatest extent practicable. Discuss all features of the proposed project that have been modified to minimize the impacts to water resources (see MN Rules 8420.0520 Subp. 4): See Section 5.4.1 of attached narrative Off-Site Alternatives.  An off-site alternatives analysis is not required for all permit applications. If you know that your proposal will require an individual permit (standard permit or letter of permission) from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, you may be required to provide an off-site alternatives analysis. The alternatives analysis is not required for a complete application but must be provided during the review process in order for the Corps to complete the evaluation of your application and reach a final decision. Applicants with questions about when an off-site alternatives analysis is required should contact their Corps Project Manager. Alternative alignments of the project are discussed in Section 3.2 of the attached narrative Minnesota Interagency Water Resource Application Form February 2014 Page 8 of 12 Project Name and/or Number: TH 53 Relocation Attachment D Replacement/Compensatory Mitigation Complete this part if your application involves wetland replacement/compensatory mitigation not associated with the local road wetland replacement program.

(hereafter referred to as “RGGS”) and Cliffs Natural Resources Inc.-owned, United Taconite, LLC (herein referred to as “UTAC”). UTAC leases the surrounding mine property from RGGS, the land and mineral owner. The existing highway corridor easement crosses UTAC’s open pit mine, which extends a distance of about five (5) miles between the cities of Virginia and Eveleth (Figure 1). The demonstration of wetland impact avoidance and minimization in this application follows the sequencing process of the Minnesota Wetland Conservation Act (WCA) of 1991 and the federal Clean Water Act. These procedures require that projects that may result in the draining or filling of wetland habitat should demonstrate avoidance and minimization of such impacts. Wetland impacts that cannot be feasibly avoided or minimized must be replaced by compensatory mitigation. The proposed project will result in permanent impacts to wetland habitat for construction of realigned roadway. This application contains preliminary wetland impacts that were estimated using Level 1 delineation methods for the purposes of evaluating project alternatives to support the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) being completed for the project. In spring 2015, MnDOT has contracted with Short Elliott Hendrickson Inc. (SEH) to complete Level 2 wetland delineation of the project area. These data collected by SEH and resulting wetland boundaries will be used to refine the proposed wetland and aquatic resource impacts described and quantified herein. These data are anticipated to be available and submitted to the wetland regulatory agencies by the end of May 2015. This project may be eligible for a Letter of Permission under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. Although there are Level 2 wetland delineation results pending submittal May 2015, sufficient information is provided herein for public noticing of the project. For this reason, this permit application is requesting a Public Notice of the permit application and review of the project sequencing, and avoidance/minimization standards for wetlands and aquatic resources, and eligibility for a Letter of Permission. A supplemental submittal with the Level 2 delineation data, and where necessary, any adjustments to the estimated wetland and aquatic resources impacts based on the Level 2 delineation, will be provided to the USACE for consideration of a Letter of Permission for the project. MNT01 130641 Page 1 Under the Minnesota Wetland Conservation Act (WCA), this project is eligible for a preliminary sequencing decision prior to approval of a replacement plan application for permanent impacts to wetlands. This application is a request for a Preliminary Sequencing Decision under Minnesota Rule 8420.0325. Upon completion of a Level 2 delineation in the project area, supplemental data will be provided to complete this application and request a Replacement Plan Decision under Minnesota Rule 8420.0330. 1.1 Combined NEPA and Clean Water Act Section 404 Permitting Process The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and MnDOT have coordinated with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to merge the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and Clean Water Act Section 404 Permitting processes into one process (see correspondence in Appendix A). The proposed project is currently being reviewed through a federal Environmental Impact Statement (EIS); the Draft EIS was published for a 45-day agency and public comment on December 22, 2014. The end of the Draft EIS comment period is February 5, 2015. A copy of the Draft EIS is provided in Appendix B (selected figures, with text on CD). The intent of the merged NEPA-Clean Water Act process is to preclude the need for revisiting decisions that have already been agreed upon earlier in the NEPA process, to encourage early substantive participation by the agencies, and to ensure that the information is adequate to address each agency’s regulatory requirements. Through this coordination, MnDOT and the FHWA will coordinate with the USACE and USEPA to gain concurrence at different points in the process. This coordination process, as listed below, is structured around four (4) concurrence points to establish progress on the following steps. The concurrence points are: 1) Purpose and Need, 2) Range of Alternatives Considered, 3) Preferred Alternative, and 4) Mitigation of Impacts. Written concurrence was received in September 2011 from USEPA and February 2012 from USACE on Concurrence Point #1 (Purpose and Need). Written concurrence was received in July 2012 from USEPA and USACE on Concurrence Point #2 (Range of Alternatives Considered) and in September 2013 (USACE) and October 2013 (USEPA) for Concurrence Point #2 as amended to include a new alternative (Alternative E-1A). Written concurrence on the Concurrence Point #3 (Preferred Alternative) was received February 2, 2015 in conjunction with the USACE formal agency review and public comment period for the Draft EIS. Concurrence on Point #4 (proposed mitigation) is anticipated as part of the WCA/USACE Joint Permit Application review process and would occur as part of Final EIS and Record of Decision (ROD). The following sections summarize the Concurrence Points relative to the comprehensive data provided in the Draft EIS currently under public and agency review. 1.1.1 Concurrence Point 1: Purpose and Need The need for undertaking this project is derived from the following transportation system needs: • Respond to the roadway easement terms; address the requirements set forth in agreements between the State of Minnesota and the land owner. • Provide a facility that meets regional and inter-regional system connectivity needs and inter-regional highway corridor performance targets. MNT01 130641 Wetland Permit Application Page 2 MnDOT District 1 • Maintain local connectivity to the regional system and maintain efficiency of local connections. • Provide a facility that serves current and future capacity needs, while maintaining system mobility and safety. 1.1.2 Concurrence Point 2: Range of Alternatives Considered MnDOT initiated Scoping of alternatives in 2011, and the process was ongoing in 2012 and 2013. Ultimately, five alternatives were carried forward for study in the Draft EIS: • No-build Alternative (Existing Easement Agreement Area Closed) • Existing TH 53 Alternative (Existing Easement Agreement Area Remains Open) • Alternative M-1 (New Alignment through Active Mine) • Alternative E-1A (New Alignment through Permit to Mine Boundary) • Alternative E-2 (New Alignment around Permit to Mine Boundary) These alternatives are discussed in more detail in Section 3.0 below. 1.1.3 Concurrence Point 3: Preferred Alternative The Preferred Alternative is Alternative E-2, which routes TH 53 around the UTAC permit to mine1 and environmental setting2 boundaries, and across the Rouchleau Pit. These resources are described in more detail in Section 2.1 below. 1.1.4 Concurrence Point 4 (Pending): Mitigation Mitigation for project impacts to wetlands and aquatic resources is proposed in the form of withdrawal of wetland mitigation bank credits from the MnDOT’s state road transportation wetland bank. Proposed mitigation is described in more detail in Section 5.4.2.1 below. 2.0 Project Description 2.1 Project Location Approximate project termini are located at 2nd Avenue West and TH 53 and Cuyuna Drive and TH 53 in the City of Virginia, St. Louis County, Minnesota (see Figure 1). Arterial routes that intersect TH 53 nearby are TH 169, TH 37, and TH 135. These roadways provide connectivity within the regional area known as the “Quad Cities” – Virginia, Eveleth, Mountain Iron, and Gilbert – to the broader portions of northeastern Minnesota, and beyond. TH 53 is also the local connection to the “Midway” neighborhood, an area of the City of Virginia that is located just off TH 53, but is geographically separated from the rest of the city by the mining easement area. The project will take place in portions of Sections 8, 9, 16, 17, 20, and 21, Township 58 North, Range 17 West. The site is located in the St. Louis River watershed, Lake Superior basin, and Bank Service Area 1. 1 The permit to mine boundary refers to the extent of permit limits for UTAC mine operations, as approved by the MNDNR. 2 The environmental setting boundary extends beyond the permit to mine area and includes additional areas that may be directly or indirectly affected by mine activity. This boundary is closely aligned with the area leased by the mine operator. Wetland Permit Application MNT01 130641 MnDOT District 1 Page 3 The project is proposed to cross the Rouchleau Pit, a manmade waterbody that has developed in the Mesabi/Rouchleau Pits post mining activity. This groundwater-fed waterbody does not have any public access and is not identified by the MNDNR as a public water. 2.2 Existing Conditions Since 1960, MnDOT has operated this segment of TH 53 on an easement granted by United States Steel Corporation (now held by RGGS). The segment is subject to iron ore mining rights held by RGGS, and UTAC, the mine owner and operator. Under the 1960 easement terms, MnDOT agreed to relocate TH 53 upon notice from the mine owner/operator that continued mine operations were to proceed in this area. On May 5, 2010, UTAC and RGGS provided notice to MnDOT that the 1960 easement rights would be terminated. Under the original easement terms, MnDOT must vacate the TH 53 easement within three years of notification. In response to the notice, MnDOT requested a seven-year timeframe for relocation of TH 53. The parties have signed an agreement to modify the easement vacation date to May 2017. TH 53 is a primary north-south route in the upper Midwest. Within Minnesota, this corridor links Virginia, a secondary regional trade center, to Duluth, a primary regional trade center about 60 miles to the south. International Falls, a shopping trade center and an international Port of Entry between the U.S. and Canada, is located on TH 53 about 100 miles north of Virginia. The TH 53 easement segment also connects the main/larger portion of the City of Virginia to the city’s Midway neighborhood on the east side of the UTAC mine (see Figure 1 for location of the Midway neighborhood). The existing corridor also enables public and private utility service through the corridor, particularly to the Midway area. 2.3 Purpose and Need The purpose of the project is to address the termination of the 1960 easement agreement that affects the current highway location in order to continue to provide a transportation facility that will safely maintain adequate roadway capacity and mobility as well as local, regional, and inter-regional connectivity. The need for the project can be described in four elements, as outlined below. Together, these needs support taking action to address the anticipated transportation system problem arising from the termination of the existing easement agreement. 2.3.1 Respond to the roadway easement terms MnDOT must address the requirements set forth in agreements between the State of Minnesota and the landowner and mine operator. The May 2010 termination of the state’s surface transportation easement rights is the primary need for action, requiring MnDOT to address the future of TH 53 at this location. Under the easement terms, MnDOT must vacate the above-noted portion of TH 53. The timeframe for response to the easement compliance, formalized through written agreement between MnDOT and RGGS/UTAC, is May 2017. 2.3.2 Provide a facility that meets system connectivity needs There is a need for a roadway that meets regional and inter-regional system connectivity needs and inter-regional highway corridor performance targets. TH 53 is a High Priority Corridor on the National Highway System, linking Virginia to Duluth and International Falls. MNT01 130641 Wetland Permit Application Page 4 MnDOT District 1 The TH 53 easement segment provides an important link along this and other inter-regional routes, supporting these long-distance trips. TH 53, TH 135, and TH 169 are also designated constitutional routes in Minnesota’s trunk highway system, meaning that any proposed route relocation must closely evaluate connectivity to and between various communities. These routes and intersections are shown on Figure 3.1-1 of the DEIS, (DEIS figures referenced are included in Appendix B of this application). In the TH 53 project area, constitutional routes are intended to provide the cities of Eveleth, Virginia, Gilbert, and Mountain Iron “…a reasonable means of communication, each with the other and other places in the state…” (Minnesota Statutes, Section 161). Similarly, TH 37 between Gilbert and Eveleth is designated as a constitutional route. 2.3.3 Maintain local connections and connectivity to the regional transportation system The highway system must have connectivity both to the regional system, as well as maintaining efficient local connections. There is a need to maintain highway system linkages and route continuity, even with the possible removal of the segment of TH 53 through the existing easement agreement area. The original easement location decision recognized: • The need for a direct highway connection to serve many regional and local highway trips. • The need to cross future mineral reserves and anticipate conflicts with future mining (the issue now being addressed). The transportation effectiveness of the original TH 53 route in serving both local and regional trips is evidenced by existing and forecast traffic volumes. This segment of the surface transportation easement carries more traffic (more than 22,000 vehicles per day) than any other segment of TH 53 in the study area, which encompassed TH 53 and connecting routes in the vicinity of Virginia, Mountain Iron, Gilbert, and Eveleth (traffic study area outlined in Figure 3.1-1 of the DEIS, included in Appendix B). While such focused heavy demand on about 1-½ miles of highway is remarkable, it is not surprising given the route’s strategic location to these four communities and to the region. In fact, from a highway network perspective, the TH 53 easement segment is comparable to a major river crossing, as there are limited opportunities to cross through the mineral reserves. Now, as compliance with the surface transportation easement terms necessitates a new alignment, travelers continue to need an efficient and effective connection for many trip purposes. 2.3.4 Provide a facility that serves capacity needs TH 53 must serve current and future capacity needs while maintaining system mobility and safety. In 2009, traffic volumes on TH 53 within the study area ranged from 12,000 vehicles per day (vpd) to more than 22,000 vpd. The highest average annual daily traffic (AADT) volumes, both current and projected, occur on the easement segment of TH 53. The 2009 traffic volume on TH 53 was 22,400 vpd between 2nd Avenue West and TH 135 in Virginia (Figure 3.1-1 of Appendix B). This segment is expected to carry over 24,000 vpd by 2017 and over 28,600 vpd by 2037. There is a need for TH 53 to convey the existing and forecast traffic demands while addressing inter-regional corridor performance standards and efficient connections, as described in Sections 2.3.2 and 2.3.3 above. 3.0 Project Alternatives A number of design alternatives were considered for how well each alternative met the project Purpose and Need, potential for social, economic, and/or environmental impacts, and Wetland Permit Application MNT01 130641 MnDOT District 1 Page 5 practicability including relative estimated costs, and potential engineering feasibility issues. A number of alternatives were eliminated from consideration in the scoping period of the NEPA process, due to greater environmental and other impacts. For example, one alternative (W-1A) proposed a re-route of TH 53 on existing two-lane roads, which would be upgraded to four-lane highways. This alignment would route TH 53 around Eveleth, the Midway neighborhood, and part of the business district of Virginia. Alternative W-1A had much higher resource impacts (estimated at 95 acres of wetland) and socioeconomic impacts due to the bypass of business districts and potential of disconnecting the communities of Eveleth and Gilbert from public safety and emergency services. Due to these greatly increased impacts, this alternative was not carried forward for more detailed study. Five alternatives were carried forward and studied in detail in the DEIS. Descriptions of these alternatives follow. Potential wetland impacts for the alternatives were calculated using data from the Level 1 (desktop resource review, no routine onsite delineation conducted) wetland assessment described in more detail in Section 5.1. A Level 2 onsite delineation is planned for spring 2015; wetland impact amounts will be updated as necessary after the field delineation. 3.1 No-build Alternative The no-build alternative was divided into two scenarios for the purpose of evaluating impacts: closing the highway in the easement area, and keeping the existing highway open in the easement area. 3.1.1 No-build Alternative (Existing Easement Agreement Area Closed) This no-build alternative would respond to the easement terms by closing the segment of TH 53 within the existing easement agreement area and reroute traffic to existing highways. Signage would officially mark the reroute following existing TH 37, CSAH 7, and TH 169. The existing roadways include mostly two-lane segments (with the exception of a 0.4 mile segment of four-lane TH 169), at-grade railroad crossings, and signalized intersections. A transportation analysis was conducted for the alternatives, and the result for the this no-build alternative indicated that the anticipated Level of Service (LOS) for roadways in the re-route would drop from A/B/C (stable to free flow of traffic) at all segments at the time of the study to LOS E/F (highly congested) in 2017 at four of the segments. The anticipated 2037 LOS would be F (most congested) at all of the segments. Travel distances and travel times would more than double under this no-build alternative from Virginia to either Eveleth or Gilbert compared to existing conditions. Local travel time increases would range from 6.5 to 21.2 minutes per trip. This would negatively impact the connectivity of the Iron Range communities. This alternative, using existing roadways, would have no wetland or waterway impacts. However, because of the limitations of the reroute as described above, this alternative does not meet the project purpose and need as it relates to adequate travel times, connectivity, and traffic capacity. 3.1.2 No-build Alternative (Existing Easement Agreement Area Remains Open) This no-build alternative, though not in compliance with terms of the existing easement agreement, would keep TH 53 in place and open to traffic by addressing the economic, legal, and engineering issues associated with resolving the terms of the existing surface transportation easement agreement. The State of Minnesota would not vacate TH 53 but would keep the highway open. Keeping the highway open in its current location would require MNT01 130641 Wetland Permit Application Page 6 MnDOT District 1 condemnation by the State of Minnesota to oppose termination of the existing easement agreement knowing that the owner and lessee are not willing sellers. Even with the use of eminent domain, this alternative may require a large payment from the State of Minnesota to the owners and operators of the mineral rights and mining lease (i.e., RGGS and UTAC, respectively). If the eminent domain action were successful, the buyout cost of the land could equal or exceed the cost of the ferrous resource reserves (estimated in the DEIS at $400 million to $600 million) in which UTAC intends to mine. This alternative, using the existing alignment, would have no wetland or waterway impacts. However, using the existing easement area has the highest cost of the alternatives considered at $400-$600 million compared to the other alternatives carried forward in the DEIS. [M-1 is the next most costly alternative, with a total capital cost for construction of $315-$450 million. Alternative E-2 (the preferred alternative) is anticipated to cost $180-240 million. These alternatives are summarized in more detail in Section 3.2, “Design and Location Alternatives”, below.] Continuing to use the existing surface transportation easement agreement area also presents an engineering risk, as the UTAC permit to mine and environmental setting boundaries would continue to extend across the surface transportation easement area, and mining would eventually take place on both sides of the highway. This has potential for conflicts with the mine business for a number of reasons. Air emissions from vehicle traffic pose a business risk to UTAC, whereas emissions from vehicle traffic on TH 53 could cause exceedances of air quality standards in the environmental setting boundary for the mine. Blasting setbacks from the road through the mine may encumber mineral resources outside the surface transportation easement area. Mining activity would also result in a deep pit on both sides of the roadway, posing engineering challenges for safe roadway side slopes as well as access problems for mining equipment to work on both sides of the roadway. Due to cost, legal, and engineering issues, this alternative was rejected as not practicable. 3.2 Design and Location Alternatives Three alternative alignments of the TH 53 relocation were considered in the DEIS. 3.2.1 Alternative M-1 (New Alignment through Active Mine) This alternative considers construction of a new four-lane TH 53 alignment. Alternative M-1 would be routed through the active UTAC mine (Figure 2.1-5 of the DEIS, in Appendix B). Approximately one mile of new four-lane roadway would be constructed through the partially-backfilled Auburn Pit (within the mine). The alignment design would have to allow for mine operations on both sides of the new highway. A seismic study determined that engineered fill could be used across most of the mine, with bridges constructed in two locations to accommodate mining access needs. The TH 135 connection with TH 53 would have to change from an interchange to a signalized intersection under this alternative, as there is not adequate space above the mine wall without involving substantial business and residential relocations in the Midway neighborhood of Virginia. Alternative M-1 would cross a mine area that will remain active for many years. In order to reduce the potential conflict with remaining ferrous resource reserves, a constrained highway cross section was assumed for the roadway through the mine. A constrained cross section would use a median barrier rather than a median with a ditch and 1:4 side slopes, saving approximately 30 feet in width of the roadway. Standard blasting best practices by the mine include a 300 foot setback from the edge of right-of-way. If this setback encumbers ferrous Wetland Permit Application MNT01 130641 MnDOT District 1 Page 7 resources, the loss of access to these resources would be expected to be included in the negotiation for acquisition of right-of-way for this alternative. The engineered fill for the road alignment could be constructed with 1:2 slopes, minimizing the footprint of the fill section in the mine. The depth of the active mine south of this alignment currently ranges from 100 to 200 feet deep. Future mining along the west side of the mine may extend down 500 feet or more. This alternative was recognized as presenting compliance risks for the mine, based on air emissions measurements taken at the environmental setting boundary. Vehicle emissions from a route through the mine could contribute to these measurements exceeding standards. In order to address the potential mine business risks due to these air quality compliance issues, a covering over a portion of the Auburn Pit crossing (an elevated tunnel concept) was evaluated as a potential mitigation strategy. This tunnel could be constructed with concrete barrier walls on each side supporting a three-sided concrete box structure to enclose the road and air handling equipment. Alternative M-1 is a higher cost alternative compared to the other build alternatives. Approximate cost of construction for Alternative M-1 is $315-$450 million, compared to $175$300 million for Alternative E-1A and $180-$240 million for Alternative E-2. Potential wetland impacts for this alternative were estimated at 8.8 acres, which is greater than the wetland impacts estimated for the preferred alternative (approximately 6.03 acres, as described in Section 5.4 below). Due to considerations of cost, potential conflict with mining, and increased wetland impacts, this alternative was rejected because it is impracticable. 3.2.2 Alternative E-1A (New Alignment through Permit to Mine Boundary) Alternative E-1A is routed through the UTAC permit to mine and environmental setting boundaries, north of existing TH 53 (see Figure 2.2-1 of the DEIS, in Appendix B). This alternative routes TH 53 across the Rouchleau Pit along an existing submerged haul road embankment. After crossing the pit, the alignment turns to the southwest to reconnect with existing TH 53 near 2nd Avenue West. The road cross section was assumed to be constrained across the Rouchleau Pit (four lanes with a two-foot wide median barrier). Two design options for crossing the pit on this alignment were evaluated, a causeway/fill option and a bridge option. The bridge option would allow for future mine access to the north of TH 53, but may restrict distance from the bridge that mining/blasting activity could occur. A causeway/fill design may require a future bridge to be constructed east of the pit to allow for mining access. Either option would have increased right-of-way costs compared to the preferred alternative, due to the alignment within the environmental setting and permit to mine boundaries. Construction costs would also be increased due to the crossing of the Rouchleau Pit at the widest section. Potential wetland impacts for this alternative are estimated at 10.5 acres, which is greater than the wetland impacts for the preferred alternative (approximately 6.03 acres, as described in Section 5.4 below). Due to considerations of engineering and constructability concerns and increased wetland impacts, this alternative was rejected because it is impracticable. 3.3 Preferred Alternative – Alternative E-2 (New Alignment around Permit to Mine Boundary) Alternative E-2 is routed around the UTAC permit to mine and environmental setting boundaries. Under this alternative, the new TH 53 alignment follows a northeasterly track on the present day Landfill Road corridor before turning to the west to cross over the Rouchleau MNT01 130641 Wetland Permit Application Page 8 MnDOT District 1 Pit. The preferred alignment is shown in Figures 1 and 2. Upon crossing the pit, Alternative E-2 turns to the southwest following an abandoned railroad corridor that runs between the pit and residential neighborhoods before reconnecting to existing TH 53 at 2nd Avenue West. In the DEIS, two options are considered for Alternative E-2: the “straight” option and the “curved setback” option. These options refer to the alignment of TH 53 south of the interchange with TH 135. The straight option follows the existing alignment, and the curved setback option would curve to the east before turning back to the interchange with TH 135. Since production of the DEIS, updated project layouts developed by the road design team use the straight option. Impacts considered in this application are due to the straight option of Alternative E-2. The most feasible pit crossing method for this alternative was determined to be a bridge; a fill option was eliminated based on constructability issues. A fill section across the pit is not expected to be feasible due to the depth of water and the depth of the pit itself, and the width of the fill footprint at this location. At 1:2 slopes the fill footprint at the bottom of the fill would be at least 950 feet wide and require nearly 10 million cubic yards of fill material; with more reasonable slopes of 1:4, the footprint and fill material needed would double. Additionally, given the depth of water to be contained on the north side of the fill (125 feet currently), the fill would require engineering for a dam to support the water pressure as well as blasting vibration. The dam design would also need to consider future water level fluctuations as dewatering changes occur. Given the extent of constructability concerns and costs compared to a bridge, the fill option was dropped from further consideration for this alternative. Instead, a proposed bridge would span 1,350 feet across the Rouchleau Pit. The pit is approximately 250 feet deep at the crossing location. Alternative E-2 provides a direct route between communities comparable to existing conditions. This alternative has only minor potential impacts to the business community and local traffic, while potentially allowing for the provision of utilities between Virginia’s central business district and the Midway area. In addition, Alternative E-2 could avoid the UTAC environmental setting boundary, which could eliminate the business risk to UTAC regarding air quality compliance. This alternative, although outside the UTAC permit to mine and environmental setting boundaries, does cross over known ferrous and non-ferrous metallic resources. This could lead to future mining conflicts. However, at this time there is no known effort to mine this area. Because the Rouchleau Pit is the municipal water source for the City of Virginia, snow removal for the new highway alignment is planned to transport snow to a designated snow dump area that does not drain to the Pit. The location of the planned snow dump area is shown on Figure 3. This area was evaluated by SEH using GIS remote sensing and desktop review for wetland habitat. No wetlands were identified in the snow dump area. This finding will be field verified in spring 2015. Costs for Alternative E-2 are estimated at $180-$240 million. Potential wetland impacts for the preferred alternative are approximately 6.03 acres, as described in Section 5.4 below. This is the smallest potential impact of the build alternatives. Alternative E-2 was selected as the preferred alternative because it meets the project purpose and need by responding to the easement terms, meets system connectivity needs, maintains local connections, and serves capacity needs. Alternative E-2 was determined the most practicable solution from a cost and engineering standpoint, and minimizes wetland and aquatic resource impacts to the greatest extent practicable. Wetland Permit Application MNT01 130641 MnDOT District 1 Page 9 4.0 General Public Interest Factors The following summary describes the effects and potential consequences due to the preferred alternative on several general factors considered to be in the public interest, which may be helpful in preparing the wetland permit decision(s) and evaluation of potential effects for the local, state, and federal wetland permits needed for the project. 1. Noise Levels: Minor adverse effect. State noise standards would be exceeded at residential locations along the project corridor, specifically in a residential area north of TH 53 and east of 2nd Avenue West. Mitigation in the form of a noise wall is preliminarily cost effective at this area. 2. Aesthetic Values: Minor adverse effect. The project would open up new views of open space from TH 53. There would be a change in views to/from UTAC and of the Rouchleau Pit. Views to and from the highway would be partially blocked by median and safety barriers. MnDOT will develop visual quality guidelines for the project and take input from a Visual Quality Review Committee. 3. Recreation: Minor adverse effect. The preferred alternative introduces new crossings of the Mesabi State Trail and snowmobile trails. Trails would continue to be used in their current form until UTAC/RGGS removes them. Safe crossings of the trails would be provided, as long as the trails persist. The project impacts 4.3 acres of land along the west edge of an Off-Highway Vehicle Recreation Area (OHVRA), and would have negligible impacts to OHVRA activities. Impacts to the OHVRA have been minimized to the extent practicable, and mitigation measures have been coordinated with the FHWA and MNDNR. 4. Transportation: Negligible effect. Daily traffic volumes are expected to be similar to the traffic volumes on the easement segment. The new intersections/interchanges would operate at an acceptable Level of Service (LOS) through 2037. There would be a negligible change in travel times. 5. Public Health: Minor adverse effect. There would be a slight increase in dust and noise during the construction period. 6. Safety: No effect. Traffic volumes and road capacity will not change. 7. Community Growth: Negligible effect. A new interchange at TH 135 may increase access to TH 53 compared to the existing interchange. 8. Business/Home Relocations: Minor adverse effect. Right-of-way will be required from eight (8) parcels, with one (1) relocation. Access modification would be necessary on up to three (3) parcels. Most acquisition would be from RGGS and State of Minnesota property. Landowners would be compensated via the federal Uniform Relocation Act, and a constrained roadway footprint would be used where possible to minimize the impacts. 9. Existing/Potential Land Use: There is a potential for an adverse effect to future mining. Potential future conflicts with ferrous and non-ferrous metallic resources could occur due to the alignment crossing over known resources. A constrained roadway footprint would be used where practicable to minimize the impacts in resource-rich areas. However, at this time, there is no known effort to mine this area of the preferred alternative. MNT01 130641 Wetland Permit Application Page 10 MnDOT District 1 10. Property Values: Negligible effect. Property value was considered in decisions about right-of-way acquisition, i.e., if a property would be made uneconomical or non-compliant through a partial acquisition, it would become a total acquisition. Minimal changes to businesses along TH 53 would be expected given that the traffic patterns would not change substantially under the preferred alternative. 11. Tax Revenues: Negligible effect. Most right-of-way acquisition would be from RGGS and State of Minnesota property. Negligible effect to revenues from the Taconite Production Tax, collected by the state and paid by mines in lieu of property taxes. This tax is based on the amount of taconite produced annually, and mine operations are anticipated to continue under the preferred alternative. 12. Public Facilities and Services: Minor adverse effect. Existing utility permits would be terminated and utilities would need to relocate. MnDOT will coordinate with utility owners to find alternate utility routes. 13. Employment: Minor beneficial effect. The project would increase employment opportunities during construction. 14. Business Activity: Potential for an adverse effect to future mining. The proposed project would have no conflict with the permit to mine or environmental setting boundaries of the UTAC mine. Potential for future conflict with ferrous and nonferrous metallic resources exists due to the alignment crossing over known resources. However, at this time, there is no known effort to mine this area of the preferred alternative. A constrained roadway footprint would be used where practicable to minimize the impacts in resource-rich areas. The proposed alignment outside of the UTAC environmental setting boundary poses no risk for air quality compliance impacts to UTAC mine operations. 15. Farmland/Food Supply: No effect. 16. Flooding: No effect. No floodplain in the vicinity of the project. 17. Energy: Minor adverse effect. There would be an increase in fossil fuel utilization during construction. 18. Mineral Needs: Potential for adverse effect to future mining. The project has potential for future conflict with ferrous and non-ferrous metallic resources, due to the alignment crossing over known resources. However, at this time, there is no known effort to mine this area of the preferred alternative. A constrained cross-section design will be used where practicable to minimize the roadway footprint in resource-rich areas. 19. Air Quality: Minor adverse effect. There would be an increase in dust and fossil fuel emissions during construction. These air effects should return to normal circumstances after the construction period. 20. Terrestrial Habitat: Minor adverse effect. The preferred alternative converts approximately 37 acres of forest to right-of-way. The habitat type impacted consists primarily of early successional forest previously disturbed by mining activities. This habitat is neither unique nor rare in the region. BMPs for control of weeds and invasive species would be followed. Wetland Permit Application MNT01 130641 MnDOT District 1 Page 11 21. Aquatic Habitat: Minor adverse effect. The preferred alternative has impacts to approximately 6.03 acres of impact to wetlands. Mitigation for loss of wetlands, which provide habitat for aquatic flora and fauna, is proposed in the form of debit of mitigation bank credits. 22. Habitat Diversity and Interspersion: Minor adverse effect. The proposed alignment isolates some forest and wetland habitat between the new alignment and the Rouchleau Pit. The habitat type impacted consists primarily of early successional forest and shrub-carr previously disturbed by mining activities. This habitat is neither unique nor rare in the region. Mitigation for loss of shrub-carr and forested wetland is proposed in the form of debit of mitigation bank credits. 23. Water Quality: No overall effect. The preferred alternative has no net change in impervious surface from the existing condition. Per National Pollutant Discharge Elimination Systems (NPDES) requirements, treatment of stormwater is not required based on the net change in impervious surface area for the project. However, water quality treatment of the stormwater runoff from the constrained cross section would be included to maintain water quality of the Rouchleau Pit (City of Virginia’s water supply). Construction erosion and sediment control would be provided in accordance with Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) and NPDES requirements. 24. Water Supply: No overall effect. The preferred alternative alignment is within the Virginia Inner Emergency Response Area of the public water supply source (the area in which contaminant releases would present an acute health concern to water users). For this reason, roadway runoff and spill containment are important considerations in design to prevent water quality impacts to the City of Virginia water supply. Turbidity controls will be used during construction to mitigate impacts, as well as implementation of spill containment provisions and specifications for the source and nature of any fill material used. 25. Groundwater: There is potential for construction-related adverse effects. A management plan would be developed for properly handling, treating, storing, and disposing of wastes and other regulated materials with potential to contaminate groundwater. The plan would also establish protocol to minimize impacts in the event a release of hazardous substances occurs during construction. A Phase I ESA identified nine (9) sites with potential contamination along the preferred alternative route, and further evaluation identified three of these sites as needing further investigation or consideration by MnDOT. Construction activities on those sites would need to consider potential for encountering contaminated soil. A Response Action Plan (RAP) will be completed, as necessary, prior to any right-of-way acquisition or construction by MnDOT. A RAP would set a protocol for properly handling and treating contaminated soil and/or groundwater that could be encountered during construction as identified in the contract special provisions or the RAP. 26. Soils: Minor adverse effect. There are slope stability and erosion issues associated with bridge abutments at the edge of the Rouchleau Pit. Erosion and stability impacts will be mitigated through implementation of erosion control BMPs within the project area. 27. Shoreline Processes: No adverse effect. There would be placement of fill along limited areas of the Rouchleau Pit wall for placement of abutments for the bridge crossing, but the pit walls are manmade, steep side slopes. The preferred alternative will have no impacts to the open water area of the pit. MNT01 130641 Wetland Permit Application Page 12 MnDOT District 1 28. Wetlands: Adverse effect. Fill/excavation impacts to approximately 6.03 acres of wetland within 14 individual wetland areas. Mitigation is proposed through the purchase of bank credits at a minimum 1:1 replacement ratio. This permit application contains additional detail on affected wetlands, wetland impacts, and proposed mitigation. Wetland impact is minimized compared to the other build alternatives. 29. Secondary and Cumulative Effects: Minor adverse effect. Future projects with potential to impact wetlands include general development proposed by the City of Gilbert, existing and potential future mining and mining-related activities at the UTAC mine, expansion of the Minntac mine in Mountain Iron, and expansion of the Iron Range OHVRA. Future projects would be subject to local, state, and/or federal regulatory permits that would likely require compensatory mitigation to offset adverse impacts. 30. Navigation: No effect. The Rouchleau Pit has no public access. 31. Endangered Species: MnDOT is coordinating with the USFWS and MNDNR to assess the potential for impacts to the northern long-eared bat, which is proposed for listing as an endangered species. Based on current information, the impacts of the preferred alternative are not anticipated to jeopardize the continued existence of the species (as discussed in Section 5.11.2 of the DEIS). There are documented occurrences of Canada lynx within 10 miles of the project area; however, the highway is proposed to remain outside of Canada lynx critical habitat. The USFWS has concurred with the determination that the project may affect but is not likely to adversely affect the Canada lynx (as discussed in Section 5.11.2 of the DEIS). There are occurrences of gray wolf near the project area. Wolves have once again become listed as a federally threatened in Minnesota as of December 2014. The gray wolf is associated with wooded habitat that is present within the project area; however, this habitat is neither unique nor rare in the region. The scale of the proposed project should have an insignificant effect on wolf habitat, and therefore effects to gray wolf are anticipated to be negligible. It is anticipated that comments provided from the USFWS during review of the Draft EIS will further inform the environmental analysis of potential effects to gray wolf. Efforts have been made to minimize impacts to wildlife through minimization of vegetation (habitat) removal to the extent practicable by following previously disturbed areas (roads and mined lands). 32. Historical/Archaeological: No effect. The project will not impact any sites or properties of historical or cultural significance. The Minnesota State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) provided concurrence with the finding of no historic properties affected by the preferred alternative (as discussed in Section 4.4 of the DEIS). 33. Wild and Scenic Rivers: No effect. There are no designated Wild and Scenic Rivers within the project area. 34. Tribal Trust Resources: No effect. There are no Tribal Trust Resources in the project area. Wetland Permit Application MNT01 130641 MnDOT District 1 Page 13 35. State-listed Impaired Section 303(d) Waters: No effect. No state-listed impaired waters are stormwater receiving waters for this project. 5.0 Wetlands and Aquatic Resources 5.1 Wetland Delineation Wetlands within the project area were preliminarily identified by Kimley-Horn as part of the development of the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS). This wetland review was based on a Level 1 assessment that utilized current digital data from the US Geological Survey (USGS), US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) (Figure 4), MNDNR Public Waters Inventory (PWI) (Figure 5), US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) hydric soils data (Figure 6), and a visual inspection of selected wetlands. Topography of the project area is shown in light detection and ranging (Lidar) generated 10-foot contours on Figure 7. A Level 1 delineation does not incorporate onsite assessment including upland-wetland transects and soil profiles, as outlined in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Wetlands Delineation Manual (USACE 1987). Wetland boundaries were verified by photointerpretation, review of digital data, and a solely visual inspection of wetland areas for general wetland types and characteristics conducted on June 20-21, 2012. A Level 2 (routine onsite) delineation is planned for spring 2015. Updated wetland impact information will be available after the Level 2 delineation is complete. 5.2 Results The preliminary assessment identified, delineated, and classified wetlands within corridors adequate to evaluate all of the alternatives considered in detail in the DEIS. The assessment identified 34 wetlands within or nearby the alignment of the preferred alternative, as shown in Figure 8. Table 1, below, provides a summary of the Level 1 delineated wetlands including community type and typical characteristics. Wetlands in the project area are generally medium to low quality (based on review of aerial photos and visual inspection), in an area largely previously disturbed for mining activities. Descriptions of wetland community type and an assessment of quality for the wetland basins can be found in the Water Resources Technical Report in Appendix C. Table 1 Summary of Level 1 Delineated Wetlands Basin ID Natura11  Eggers and Reed1 Classification l Wetlands Fresh (Wet) Meadow  Cowardin2 Classification PEMB  Circular 393 Classification Type 2  Size (acres) 3.70  Notes No change due to project  12  Fresh (Wet) Meadow / Shallow Marsh  PEMB/F  Type 2/3  0.96  Located within cloverleaf of existing exit ramp  13  Fresh (Wet) Meadow / Shrub-Carr / Floodplain Forest  PEMC/SS/FO  Type 1/2/6  5.24  Basin adjacent TH 53 exit ramp  MNT01 130641 Wetland Permit Application Page 14 MnDOT District 1 Table 1 (Continued) Summary of Level 1 Delineated Wetlands 14  Fresh (Wet) Meadow  PEMB  Type 2  0.30  No change due to project  15  Fresh (Wet) Meadow  PEMB  Type 2  0.60  No change due to project  16  Fresh (Wet) Meadow / Shrub-Carr  PEM/SSB  Type 2/6  6.43  Basin adjacent TH 53 entrance ramp  17  Shallow Marsh / Fresh (Wet) Meadow  PEMB/F  Type 2/3  1.10  No change due to project  19  Shallow Marsh / Sedge Meadow  PEMB/F  Type 2/3  3.50  No change due to project  20  Shallow Marsh / Sedge Meadow  PEMB/F  Type 2/3  11.3  Large basin adjacent Landfill Road  21  Fresh (wet) Meadow  PEMB  Type 2  0.05  No change due to project  22  Shallow Marsh  PEMF  Type 3  0.75  Linear basin along Landfill Road surrounded by mine dumps  23  Sedge Meadow / Shrub-Carr  PEM/SSB  Type 2/3  0.70  Linear basin between Landfill Road and unnamed road surrounded by mine dumps  24  Shallow Marsh / Sedge Meadow  PEMB/F  Type 2/3  3.42  Linear basin between Landfill Road and unnamed road, surrounded by mine dumps  25  Fresh (wet) Meadow  PEMB  Type 2  0.39  Linear basin along unnamed road surrounded by mine dumps  26  Fresh (wet) Meadow  PEMB  Type 2  0.94  Basin near interchange and unnamed road, surrounded by mine dumps  27  Shallow Marsh / Sedge Meadow  PEMB/F  Type 2/3  6.20  No change due to project  28  Fresh (wet) Meadow  PEMB  Type 2  0.03  Linear basin along unnamed surrounded by mine dumps  29  Sedge Meadow  PEMB  Type 2  0.36  Linear basin along Landfill Road surrounded by mine dumps  31  Shallow Marsh  PEMF  Type 3  0.33  Linear basin along TH 53 roadside  32  Shallow Marsh / Sedge Meadow  PEMB/F  Type 2/3  11.76  Large wet basin along TH 53 roadside  33  Fresh (wet) Meadow  PEMB  Type 2  0.93  Located within median of existing highway  44  Fresh (wet) Meadow  PEMB  Type 2  0.27  Basin along unnamed road surrounded by mine dumps  Roadside Ditches Cut in Uplands, but Having Developed Wetland Characteristics  30  Seasonally Flooded Basin  PEMC  Type 1  0.20  Wet bottom of a roadside ditch on the east of Landfill Road  43  Fresh (wet) Meadow  PEMB  Type 2  0.18  Wet bottom of a ditch along the Mesabi Trail  1 Wetland Plants and Plant Communities of Minnesota and Wisconsin (Eggers and Reed, 2011). 2 Classification of Wetlands and Deepwater Habitats of the United States.

(Shaw and Fredine, United States Fish and Wildlife Service, 1956).  Wetland Permit Application MNT01 130641 MnDOT District 1 Page 15 5.3 Regulatory Jurisdiction Wetlands in the project area are regulated by several agencies at the local, state, and federal levels including the USACE and the EPA at the federal level; the Minnesota Board of Water and Soil Resources (BWSR) and the MPCA at the state level; and MnDOT at the local level. MnDOT has accepted the responsibility for the administration of the Minnesota Wetland Conservation Act (WCA) of 1991. 5.4 Sequencing 5.4.1 Avoidance and Minimization Efforts were made during alternatives development and preliminary engineering to minimize wetland fill impacts to the extent practicable by following previously disturbed areas (e.g., roads, mined lands). Much larger areas of wetland impacts have been avoided as part of the Scoping process; by eliminating the West Corridor alternatives (see discussion of Alternative W-1A in Section 3.0) from further consideration, dozens of acres of wetland impact have been avoided. A constrained cross section was assumed in some locations for the build alternatives to avoid various resource impacts, resulting in some additional minimization of wetland impacts. The straight option was selected for the preferred alternative (discussed in Section 3.3 above), further reducing wetland impacts by approximately 2.40 acres compared to the curved setback option. 5.4.2 Wetland and Aquatic Resource Impacts The preferred alternative has potential to impact approximately 6.03 acres of wetland. Impacts are summarized in Table 2 below, and impact locations shown on Figure 9. Of the total impact amount (6.03 acres), approximately 3.47 acres of wetland may be regulated under the CWA. A request for a jurisdictional determination on 2.56 acres of wetland in the project area has been submitted to the USACE under separate cover. In regard to the Minnesota WCA, of the total wetland impact amount (6.03 acres), approximately 5.67 acres of wetland within the project area are anticipated to be within the scope of the WCA. The remaining 0.35 acres of wetland in the project area would be considered incidental because these wetland areas developed in roadside ditches originally cut in uplands. See Table 2 below. Project plan sheets and representative cross sections of wetland impact areas will be developed after the Level 2 wetland delineation is conducted in spring 2015, and then provided to USACE and the WCA LGU. Wetland impact numbers will be refined based on the Level 2 delineation, and divided into permanent fill impacts, permanent cut impacts, and temporary impacts. Generalized surface water flow paths for the project area were shown in Figure 5.1-1 of the DEIS (included in Appendix B). In preparation for a request for an approved jurisdictional determination, additional flow path analysis was conducted in order to identify the hydrologic catchment area for each wetland (summarized in Table 2 below). The analysis included review of Lidar contours, culvert location and flow path information provided by MnDOT and the road design team, and culvert location and flow path information provided by the City of Virginia. Flow paths showing connectivity of wetlands to either the Rouchleau Pit or Manganika Lake are shown on Figure 10. Based on more detail provided by the engineering team preparing final layouts, the depiction of flow direction for wetlands in the project area has been modified from what was presented MNT01 130641 Wetland Permit Application Page 16 MnDOT District 1 in the DEIS. Specifically, the area of flow near the Mesabi Trail and Landfill Road was analyzed in more detail. A zoomed-in view of flow paths near the intersection of the Mesabi Trail and Landfill Road is shown in Figure 10-1. Lidar contours indicate that the location of the Mesabi Trail near Wetlands 23, 25, and 28 provides a physical divide between the two major catchment areas (i.e., the Rouchleau Pit and Manganika Lake). What results is that Wetlands 23, 28, 29, and 30 outlet to the north into the Rouchleau Pit; Wetlands 25 and 26 outlet to the west to Manganika Lake. Visual inspection by the roadway design team confirmed there are no culverts or other surficial connections under or across the trail between Wetlands 23 and 25 that would indicate that Wetlands 23, 28, 29, and 30 flow toward Manganika Lake. Wetland Permit Application MNT01 130641 MnDOT District 1 Page 17 Table 2 Preliminary Wetland and Aquatic Resource Impacts Basin ID  Eggers and Reed Classification  Hydrologic Catchment Area1  Size of Impact (acres)  Basins within the Manganika Lake Hydrologic Catchment Area  12  Fresh (Wet) Meadow / Shallow Marsh  Manganika Lake  0.00 2  13  Fresh (Wet) Meadow / Shrub-Carr / Seasonally Flooded Basin  Manganika Lake  1.04  16  Fresh (Wet) Meadow / Shrub-Carr  Manganika Lake  1.09  25  Fresh (Wet) Meadow  Manganika Lake  0.11  26  Fresh (Wet) Meadow  Manganika Lake  0.70  31  Shallow Marsh  Manganika Lake  0.06  32  Shallow Marsh / Sedge Meadow  Manganika Lake  0.29  33  Fresh (Wet) Meadow  Manganika Lake  0.00 2  43  Fresh (Wet) Meadow – Wet Ditch 3  Manganika Lake  0.18  Basins within the Rouchleau Pit Hydrologic Catchment Area  17  Shallow Marsh / Fresh (Wet) Meadow  Rouchleau Pit  0.00 2  22  Shallow Marsh  Rouchleau Pit  0.06  23  Sedge Meadow / Shrub-Carr  Rouchleau Pit  0.45  24  Shallow Marsh / Sedge Meadow  Rouchleau Pit  1.71  28  Fresh (Wet) Meadow  Rouchleau Pit  0.02  29  Sedge Meadow  Rouchleau Pit  0.05  30  Seasonally Flooded Basin – Wet Ditch 3  Rouchleau Pit  0.19  44  Fresh (Wet) Meadow  Rouchleau Pit  0.09  Total  6.03 acres 4, 5  1 Wetlands draining to the Rouchleau Pit with no surficial connection to other waters of the U.S. are not anticipated to be regulated by the USACE. 2 Although within the project limits, Wetlands 12 and 33 are in areas where nearby pavement will be obliterated only. Wetland 17 is nearby the project limits. No impacts are proposed to these wetlands. 3 Wetlands 30 and 43 that developed in the bottom of roadside ditches originally cut in upland may be incidental and are anticipated to be out of the scope of the WCA. 4 Of the total impact amount, 3.47 acres of wetland may be regulated under the CWA; a request for a jurisdictional determination on 2.56 acres of wetland in the project area has been submitted to the USACE. 5 Of the total wetland impact amount, 5.67 acres of wetland within the project area are anticipated to be within the scope of the WCA; the remaining 0.35 acres of wetland in the project area may be considered incidental.  MNT01 130641 Wetland Permit Application Page 18 MnDOT District 1 5.4.2.1 Source of Fill The source of fill material will be determined by the successful contractor. The type of fill material is clean granular soils for embankment and salvaged topsoil from within the project limits. If fill material is needed beyond what is available on site, special provisions 1602 and 1701 apply, as described in Appendix D. 5.5 Proposed Mitigation Compensatory mitigation for impacts to wetlands is proposed through debit of credits from an established wetland mitigation bank. The preliminary amount of credit to be withdrawn is 5.67 credits; this amount will be refined after the Level 2 wetland delineation is complete in spring 2015. This is a state project for which MnDOT is providing replacement using wetland credits already in the MnDOT Wetland Banks already established for MnDOT-specific projects. Credits would be debited from BSA 1 as a first priority. If sufficient credits are not available in BSA 1, the remainder of credits would be debited from established wetland mitigation banks in other bank service areas. MnDOT anticipates that the MnDOT WCA administrator will notice the TEP and USACE with proposed mitigation banks. A summary of wetland replacement needs is included in Table 3 below. The current minimum wetland replacement ratio for wetland credits is 1:1 for WCA regulated impacts and 1:1 for USACE regulated impacts on MnDOT road projects in the greater than 80% pre-settlement wetlands remaining area of the state. This minimum ratio applies if replacement is in the same Bank Service Area (BSA) as the impact, and would increase to 1.25:1 for the USACE and 1.5:1 for WCA if replaced outside the BSA. At the time of permitting, it is MnDOT’s intent to use the closest appropriate USACE-approved MnDOT wetland bank credits for the wetland mitigation requirement. 5.5.1 Agency Requirements 5.5.1.1 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers A total of eight (8) wetlands in the project area may not to be under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, because of their eventual connectivity and outlet to the Rouchleau Pit, which may not be considered a waters of the U.S. A request for an approved jurisdictional determination was submitted to the USACE under separate cover. Wetland replacement is proposed for wetlands within the USACE jurisdiction. For the remaining 10 wetlands in the project area that have surficial connectivity to Manganika Lake, it is presumed these wetlands would be jurisdictional by the USACE. It is estimated that 3.47 acres of these 10 wetlands would be impacted by the project, and therefore would require replacement. MnDOT anticipates wetland replacement for impacts within the >80% area of the state would be replaced within the same BSA as the impacts if credits are available; this would allow for the project to be eligible for a replacement ratio of 1:1. However, if MnDOT Wetland Bank credits are not available in BSA 1 at the time credits are debited, the replacement ratio could increase to 1.25:1. The amount of wetland credits that will be required for the Clean Water Act Section 404 permit will be determined following review and approval of the Jurisdictional Determination request, which is being submitted under separate cover. Wetland replacement proposed to fulfill USACE requirements is summarized in Table 3 below. Wetland Permit Application MNT01 130641 MnDOT District 1 Page 19 5.5.1.2 Wetland Conservation Act – MnDOT Wetlands in the project area are under the jurisdiction of the WCA, with the exception of two basins (Wetlands 30 and 43) totaling 0.38 acres of roadside ditch. Areas of roadside ditch cut wholly in upland and having upland backslopes, but have since developed wetland characteristics have been considered “incidental wetlands” in other transportation projects, and therefore outside the scope of the WCA (MN Administrative Rule, 8420.0105 Subp. 2.D). Therefore, no replacement is proposed for these wetlands under the WCA. MnDOT anticipates that 5.67 acres of wetland impact will require replacement under the WCA. For replacement of impacts within the >80% area of the state, and replacement within the same BSA as the impacts, the project is eligible for a replacement ratio of 1:1. If MnDOT Wetland Bank credits are not available in BSA 1 at the time credits are debited, the replacement ratio would increase to 1.5:1, requiring a debit of 8.51 credits. Wetland replacement proposed to fulfill WCA requirements is summarized in Table 3 below. 5.5.1.3 Wetland Replacement Summary Proposed wetland replacement to fulfill both WCA and USACE requirements is summarized in Table 3 below. It is anticipated that a debit of 5.67 to 8.51 credits (depending on availability of credits within the same BSA as the impact) would satisfy requirements of the USACE and the WCA. Table 3 Proposed Wetland Mitigation Summary Wetland Regulatory Authority  Preliminary Quantity of Wetland Impacts by Regulatory Authority  Proposed Mitigation Ratio 1  Total Credits to be Debited (Proposed)  USACE jurisdiction  3.47 acres 2  1:1 to 1.25:1  3.47 to 4.34  WCA jurisdiction  5.67 acres 3  1:1 to 1.5:1  5.67 to 8.51  1 The lower mitigation ratio presented here applies to bank credits debited within the same BSA as the impact. If credits are not available within the same BSA, the ratio is anticipated to increase. 2 Of the total wetland impact amount, 3.47 acres of wetland may be regulated under the CWA; a request for a jurisdictional determination on 2.56 acres of wetland in the project area has been submitted to the USACE. 3 Of the total wetland impact amount, 5.67 acres of wetland within the project area are anticipated to be within the scope of the WCA; the remaining 0.35 acres of wetland in the project area may be considered incidental.  5.5.2 Erosion Control and Best Management Practices Best Management Practices (BMPs) will be employed throughout the project to ensure that erosion and sedimentation are minimized and are confined within the project limits. These practices are required to ensure that the proposed impacts are accurate, and that there are no unintended discharges of material outside of the construction limits. 5.6 Permitting 5.6.1 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers This permit application is a request for issuance of a Public Notice of the project for a transportation road. A copy of the Joint Application Form for Activities Affecting Water Resources in Minnesota is included at the front of this report. MNT01 130641 Wetland Permit Application Page 20 MnDOT District 1 This project may be eligible for a Clean Water Act Letter of Permission for impacts to less than five (5) acres of jurisdictional wetlands and/or aquatic resources for a transportation project in Minnesota. A request for a Jurisdictional Determination for select wetlands/aquatic resources in the project area has been submitted to the USACE under separate cover. Upon completion of the Level 2 wetland delineation in spring 2015, a supplemental submittal will be provided that refines the wetland impacts to jurisdictional wetlands and/or aquatic resources to support a request for a Letter of Permission for the project. 5.6.2 Wetland Conservation Act – MnDOT MnDOT is responsible for administration of the WCA in the project area. This permit application is a request for preliminary sequencing decision under the rules of the Minnesota Wetland Conservation Act of 1991. A copy of the Minnesota Local/State/Federal Application Form for Water/Wetland Projects is included at the beginning of this document. . Upon completion of the Level 2 wetland delineation in spring 2015, a supplemental submittal will be provided that refines the wetland impacts in anticipation of a request for a replacement plan decision for the project. Wetland Permit Application MNT01 130641 MnDOT District 1 Page 21 List of Figures Figure 1 – Project Overview Map Figure 2 – Project Location Map (USGS) Figure 3 – Snow Dump Area Figure 4 – National Wetlands Inventory Figure 5 – MNDNR PWI Figure 6 – Soil Survey (SSURGO) Map Figure 7 – 2009 MNDNR Lidar (10-ft Contours) Figure 8 – Wetland Delineation Results Figure 9 – Preliminary Wetland Impacts Figure 10 – Flow Paths Figure 10-1 – Flow Path Analysis East Area iniaGilbVirgert Alternative E-2 (Preferred) Proposed Design U102V ?A 935BVirginia Lake U Silver 7V Lake £¤ 169U103V Rouchl Pi eau t £¤ 53 S657T Auburn Pit S921T ?A 135Manganika Midway Neighborhood Lake UTAC Mine Mud LakeLegend S372T Construction Limit ³ U142V Bridge Pavement Edge 0 0.5 1 Sidewalk Miles UV145 Path: S:\KO\M\Mnt01\130641\3-env-stud-reg\GIS\maps\fig01_overview.mxd Project: MNT01 130641 418 W.

Concurrence with a delineation is a written notification from the Corps and a decision from the LGU concurring, not concurring, or commenting on the boundaries of the aquatic resources delineated on the property. Delineation concurrences are generally valid for five years unless site conditions change. Under this request alone, the Corps will not address the jurisdictional status of the aquatic resources on the property, only the boundaries of the resources within the review area (including wetlands, tributaries, lakes, etc.). FOR WCA TEP CONCURRENCE (Concurrence from USACE – St. Paul District received June 1, 2015) PreliminaryJurisdictional Determination. A preliminary jurisdictional determination (PJD) is a non-binding written indication from the Corps that waters, including wetlands, identified on a parcel may be waters of the United States. For purposes of computation of impacts and compensatory mitigation requirements, a permit decision made on the basis of a PJD will treat all waters and wetlands in the review area as if they are jurisdictional waters of the U.S. PJDs are advisory in nature and may not be appealed. ApprovedJurisdictional Determination. An approved jurisdictional determination (AJD) is an official Corps determination that jurisdictional waters of the United States are either present or absent on the property. AJDs can generally be relied upon by the affected party for five years. An AJD may be appealed through the Corps administrative appeal process. In order for the Corps and LGU to process your request, the wetland delineation must be prepared in accordance with the 1987 Corps of Engineers Wetland Delineation Manual, any approved Regional Supplements to the 1987 Manual, and the Guidelines for Submitting Wetland Delineations in Minnesota (2013). http://www.mvp.usace.army.mil/Missions/Regulatory/DelineationJDGuidance.aspx Minnesota Interagency Water Resource Application Form February 2014 Page 4 of 7 Project Name and/or Number: TH 53 Relocation -State Project No. 6918-80 Attachment B Supporting Information for Applications Involving Exemptions, No Loss Determinations, and Activities Not Requiring Mitigation Complete this part if you maintain that the identified aquatic resource impacts in Part Four do not require wetland replacement/compensatory mitigation OR if you are seeking verification that the proposed water resource impacts are either exempt from replacement or are not under CWA/WCA jurisdiction. Identify the specific exemption or no-loss provision for which you believe your project or site qualifies: We anticipate several wetlands are isolated and not under CWA jurisdiction (see Section 3.2 on Page 4 of the attached narrative). A request to the USACE – St. Paul District for an approved jurisdictional determination has been submitted under separate cover. We anticipate several wetlands have developed due to human disturbance not intended to create wetlands (e.g., wetlands developed on old mine tailings basins or in roadside ditches cut in upland) and are out of scope of the WCA (see Sections 3.1 on Page 3 of the attached narrative). (M.R. 8420.0105, Subp. 2.D.) We anticipate several wetlands will have temporary disturbance when existing utilities and culverts/storm sewer along the roadway are removed as part of the road obliteration. The roadway to be removed in the existing roadway easement area will have pavement obliteration only; no permanent wetland impacts are proposed by this project in the existing easement area. Trenches excavated for utility removal will be closed and stabilized. Trenches excavated for culvert/storm sewer removal will remain open and be stabilized with seeding. Erosion control blanket will be installed on areas with slopes greater than 4:1. It is anticipated that no loss of wetlands will occur due to temporary disturbance for utility and culvert/storm sewer removal. (M.R. 8420.0415, F.) Provide a detailed explanation of how your project or site qualifies for the above. Be specific and provide and refer to attachments and exhibits that support your contention. Applicants should refer to rules (e.g. WCA rules), guidance documents (e.g. BWSR guidance, Corps guidance letters/public notices), and permit conditions (e.g. Corps General Permit conditions) to determine the necessary information to support the application. Applicants are strongly encouraged to contact the WCA LGU and Corps Project Manager prior to submitting an application if they are unsure of what type of information to provide: See Sections 3.2 on Page 4 of the attached narrative.

Wetland Permit Application MNT01 130641 TH 53 Relocation Project Page i June 29, 2015 Wetland Permit Application Volume II:  Replacement Plan TH 53 Relocation Project Prepared for MnDOT District 1 1.0 Introduction Volume II of this Wetland Permit Application is submitted on behalf of the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) District 1. The application has been prepared to describe the mitigation of wetland impacts resulting from the construction of the relocated Trunk Highway 53 (TH 53) due to the termination of the existing roadway easement agreement that allows TH 53 to cross mineral rights held by RGGS Land and Minerals Co. (hereafter referred to as “RGGS”) and Cliffs Natural Resources Inc.-owned, United Taconite, LLC (herein referred to as “UTAC”). The existing roadway easement area is located between the Virginia’s “Midway” neighborhood and the remainder of the city. The project location is shown in Figure 1. The project is described and evaluated in the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), which was published in December 2014. The Final EIS was published on June 22, 2015 and comments are currently being accepted through July 6, 2015. The initial Wetland Permit Application, without Replacement Plan, was submitted in March 2015 and described the project purpose and need, alternatives considered, and wetland impact avoidance and minimization. For purposes of clarity in this document, we refer to this initial March 2015 submittal of the Wetland Permit Application as “Volume I”. It contained an application for a Preliminary Sequencing Determination under Minnesota Rules (M.R. 8420.0325) for the Minnesota Wetland Conservation Act (WCA). It also served as the application for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to issue a Public Notice of the project following their procedures in administering Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. Volume I of the Wetland Permit Application (March 2015) included estimated wetland impacts based on Level 1 delineation (remote sensing with visual review of selected wetlands) used for preparation of the Draft EIS. In April and May 2015, Level 2 field delineation of all wetlands in the project area has since been completed (Appendix A). Unavoidable wetland impacts are now estimated based on the results of the Level 2 delineation. This Wetland Replacement Plan (Volume II) summarizes the delineated wetlands, describes the unavoidable wetland and aquatic resource impacts, and proposed replacement for these impacts. The proposed project will result in temporary and permanent impacts to wetland habitat for construction of the new roadway alignment. This permit application will be used to request an Individual Permit under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act and a Wetland Conservation Act (WCA) Replacement Plan approval for temporary and permanent impacts to wetlands. MNT01 130641 Page 1 1.1 Combined NEPA and Clean Water Act Section 404 Permitting Process The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and MnDOT have coordinated with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to merge the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and Clean Water Act Section 404 Permitting processes into one process. Concurrence has been reached on Points #1 through #3, as described in Volume 1 (March 2015) of this permit application. Concurrence on Point #4 (proposed mitigation) is anticipated through review of this proposed replacement plan for wetland impacts and will follow the Record of Decision (ROD) for the Final EIS. Proposed mitigation for wetlands impacted by the TH 53 Relocation Project is discussed in more detail in Section 4.1 below. 2.0 Wetland 2.1 Wetlands Definition and Delineation Methodology Wetlands are defined in federal Executive Order 11990 as “areas that are inundated or saturated by surface water or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances, do support a prevalence of vegetation or aquatic life typically adapted for saturated soil conditions.” Field delineation to determine presence of wetlands in the project area was performed on April 30, May 1, May 4-8, and May 13, 2015 to identify and delineate any areas meeting the wetland criteria in accordance with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Wetlands Delineation Manual (USACE 1987) and Regional Supplement to the Corps of Engineers Wetland Delineation Manual: Northcentral and Northeast Region (USACE 2012). One positive indicator (except in certain situations) from each of three elements must be present in order to make a positive wetland determination, which are as follows:  Greater than 50 percent dominance of hydrophytic plant species.  Presence of hydric soil.  The area is either permanently or periodically inundated, or soil is saturated to the surface during the growing season of the dominant vegetation. The Routine Onsite Determination Method was applied for this delineation, in combination with available data from the Level 1 delineations. A more detailed discussion of the delineation methodology is included in the Wetland Delineation Report, included as Appendix A (on CD). The delineation identified 80 wetland basins within the project area and three (3) deep, water filled pits associated with past mining activity (Appendix A). The delineated wetland boundaries for the project are shown on Figure 2 (overview) and Figures 2-1 through 2-17 (details). The following section describes the wetland delineation results in the project area. 2.2 Results A total of 80 wetland basins comprised of a variety of wetland plant communities were found in the project area. Two (2) deep-water pits in the project area also had some fringe areas of wetland (see the Wetland Delineation Report, Appendix A). A third deep water documented is the Rouchleau Pit – a deep, water-filled depression that has developed due to past mining activities. A summary of wetland and aquatic resources by wetland type is included in Table 1 and Table 2 below. Site meetings with agency representatives took place on May 28, 2015 and June 3, 2015. Representatives from the USACE and WCA TEP verbally approved the wetland boundaries as marked in the field and submitted in a draft wetland delineation report. Written concurrence on the wetland boundaries and classification was provided by the MNT01 130641 Wetland Permit Application Page 2 TH 53 Relocation Project USACE on June 1, 2015. Correspondence regarding wetland boundary reviews and/or approvals is included in the Wetland Delineation Report (Appendix A). Table 1 Wetland Characteristics Size Eggers & Reed Classification Circular 39 / Cowardin Classification (acres)1 Fresh (Wet) Meadow Type 2 / PEMB 6.24 Sedge Meadow Type 2 / PEMB 0.07 Shallow Marsh Type 3 / PEMC 8.14 Shallow Open Water Type 5 / PUBF 0.94 Shrub-Carr Type 6 / PSS1B 44.81 Alder Thicket Type 6 / PSS1B 0.21 Hardwood Swamp Type 7 / PFO1B 7.95 Coniferous Swamp Type 7 / PFO4B 1.27 Total Wetland Area Delineated within Project Limits (acres) 69.64 1 Size includes areas of wetland within the area of investigation only.

Wetlands may extend beyond the limits of the area investigated and actual wetland size may be larger than that indicated.  3.0 Regulatory Jurisdiction Wetlands in the project area are regulated by several agencies at the local, regional, state, and federal levels including the USACE and the EPA at the federal level; the Minnesota Board of Water and Soil Resources (BWSR) and the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) at the state level.  3.1 Minnesota Wetland Conservation Act The City of Virginia is the Local Government Unit (LGU) for the WCA at the local level for lands not within MnDOT ROW or otherwise administered by the state. The City of Virginia WCA representative has indicated that it is acceptable for MnDOT to assume WCA administration in areas of the project currently under private ownership, where the City of Virginia would otherwise administer the WCA (see correspondence related to MnDOT assumption of WCA administration dated June 26, 2015, Appendix A).  Wetland Permit Application MNT01 130641 TH 53 Relocation Project Page 3 MnDOT accepts responsibility for administration of the Minnesota Wetland Conservation Act (WCA) of 1991 in areas of MnDOT ROW. MnDOT will acquire the necessary ROW for this transportation project. MnDOT will work with the MNDNR on WCA administration duties for those portions of the project on school trust land or otherwise “state land” that will eventually become MnDOT ROW.  Historical aerial photographs were reviewed for details of past land use in the vicinity of the project. Wetlands in areas of extensive ground disturbance such as past mine dumps, mine excavations, rail yards, and tailings basins have developed due to human activity not intended to create wetlands, and may therefore be determined to be incidental and out of the scope of the WCA (M.R. 8420.0105, Subp. 2.D.). A total of 43 wetlands appear to have developed in such landscape features, or in the bottom of roadside ditches excavated in upland habitat. The remaining 37 wetland basins (of which 28 are proposed for impact) within the project area are presumed to be regulated in whole or in part by the WCA.  Historical aerial photographs showing past landscape disturbance are included as Appendix B. Some of these features are also visible on the USGS topographic map (Figure 3). A table summarizing the historical land use and landscape position of each basin, as well as the historical land use as assessed by the historical aerial photo review, is attached as Appendix C. 3.2 Clean Water Act Section 404 The USACE has determined that the Rouchleau Pit itself is not jurisdictional under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA). The Approved Jurisdictional Determination (AJD) for the Rouchleau Pit was issued on June 16, 2015 (see correspondence in Appendix B). MnDOT has since submitted an amended request for an AJD on those wetlands in the project area that are either 1) isolated; 2) have surficial connectivity (i.e., flow toward) the Rouchleau Pit; or, 3) have surficial connectivity (i.e., flow toward) to the Thunderbird Mine/Auburn Pit. This request for an AJD was submitted to the USACE – St. Paul District on June 22, 2015. The USACE – St. Paul District is currently reviewing this request. A total of 36 wetlands (of which 27 are proposed for impacts) within the project area have surficial connectivity to Manganika and Mud Lakes outside of the project area, and are anticipated to be regulated by Section 404 of the CWA. A table summarizing the hydrologic catchment area and landscape position of each wetland and aquatic resource is attached as Appendix C.  4.0 Wetland Impacts Wetlands in the project area are proposed to be impacted for permanent roadway fill and excavation on the new TH 53 alignment and permanent fill to provide connections to the Mesabi Trail (a multi-use trail operated by the St. Louis County Regional Rail Authority). Temporary wetland impacts will occur due to excavation for removing existing utilities and culverts/storm sewer in the existing roadway easement area. Proposed impacts for trail connections consist of permanent fill. Eventual reroute of the Mesabi Trail is a separate and complete project to be undertaken by others. The proposed TH 53 alignment has been designed considering eventual trail connections by others, so these connections are not made impossible or impractical by the new TH 53 design. At the eastern trail connection, the proposed project will complete a section of trail in order to connect to existing paved trail. This will replace the connection that will be removed by the MNT01 130641 Wetland Permit Application Page 4 TH 53 Relocation Project TH 53 relocation project. Further relocation of the trail itself will be necessary due to mining activities – this trail project has separate utility and will be designed and built by others. The roadway to be removed in the existing roadway easement area will have pavement obliteration only; no permanent wetland impacts are proposed by this project in the existing easement area. Trenches excavated for utility removal will be closed and stabilized. Trenches excavated for culvert/storm sewer removal will remain open and be stabilized with seeding. Erosion control blanket will be installed on areas with slopes greater than 4:1. It is anticipated that no loss of wetlands will occur due to temporary disturbance for utility and culvert/storm sewer removal. Wetland and aquatic resource impact locations are shown in overview on Figure 4 and detail on Figures 4-1 through 4-17, and are summarized in Table 3 below. Impacts are also shown on typical cross sections for each wetland, divided into impacts due to cut or fill (Appendix D).  Wetland Permit Application MNT01 130641 TH 53 Relocation Project Page 5 MNT01 130641 Wetland Permit Application Page 6 TH 53 Relocation Project Table 3 Wetland and Aquatic Resource Impact Summary Basin ID1  Wetland Classification (Eggers and Reed)  Landscape Position2  Duration of Impact  Type of Impact  Wetland Impact Area(acres)  Wetland Impact Summary(acres) by Jurisdiction WCA  USACE  1  Shrub-Carr  Portions incidental (wet roadside ditch inpart); drains to Rouchleau Pit  Permanent  Cut  0.28  0.28  --  3  Shrub-Carr  Drains to Rouchleau Pit  Permanent  Cut  0.26  0.26  --  4  Shrub-Carr, Shallow Marsh  Incidental (manmade ravine near old minedump); drains to Rouchleau Pit  Permanent  Cut  0.12  --  --  5  Fresh (Wet) Meadow  Portions incidental (wet roadside ditch inpart); drains to Rouchleau Pit  Temporary  Cut  0.002(76 ft2 )  0.002(76 ft2 )  --  6  Hardwood Swamp  Drains to Rouchleau Pit  Permanent  Cut  0.12  0.12  --  7  Hardwood Swamp  Isolated  Permanent  Cut  0.02  0.02  --  8  Shrub-Carr  Drains to Rouchleau Pit  Permanent  Cut  0.65  0.65  --  Temporary  Cut  0.22  0.22  --  9  Shrub-Carr  Incidental (wet roadside ditch); drains to Rouchleau Pit  Permanent  Fill  0.06  --  --  10  Shrub-Carr  Incidental (linear basin between road and mine dump); drains to Rouchleau Pit  Permanent  Fill  0.04  --  --  11  Shrub-Carr, Shallow Marsh  Incidental (wetland developed at margin of deep water pit pond); drains to Rouchleau Pit  Permanent  Fill  0.21  --  --  12  Shrub-Carr  Incidental (wetland developed at margin of deep water pit pond); drains to Rouchleau Pit  Permanent  Fill  0.10  --  --  14  Shrub-Carr  Incidental (tailings basin); drains to Rouchleau Pit  Permanent  Fill  0.04  --  --  Permanent  Cut  0.40  --  --  1 All basins in project area are within St. Louis County, Major Watershed #3, and Bank Service Area #1. 2 “Incidental” landscape position indicates basins created by human activity not intended to create wetlands, and anticipated to be outside the scope of the WCA.

MnDOT proposes to debit 9.03 credits from wetland bank #1595 (U of M Fens) located in St. Louis County, Major Watershed #3, Bank Service Area #1. Proposed wetland replacement is summarized by regulatory agency in Table 6 below.  Because the debit of wetland credits is “in-place” (the wetland bank is in the same BSA as the impacts), “in-advance” (as a debit from an established wetland bank), and the project is within the >80% of pre-settlement wetland remaining area of the state, the impacts should be eligible for a mitigation ratio of 1:1. We presume that a debit of 9.03 credits will satisfy requirements of both the USACE (7.43 credits necessary at a 1:1 mitigation ratio) and the WCA (9.03 credits necessary at a 1:1 mitigation ratio). Wetland Permit Application MNT01 130641 TH 53 Relocation Project Page 11 Table 6 Summary of Wetland and Aquatic Resource Replacement Needs Wetland  Regulatory Authority  Quantity of Wetland Impacts by Regulatory Authority  Proposed Mitigation  Ratio   Total Credits to be Debited (Proposed)  USACE Jurisdiction 1  7.43 Acres Permanent  1:1  7.43  0.57 Acres Temporary  No Replacement  WCA Jurisdiction 2  9.03 Acres Permanent  1:1  9.03  0.74 Acres Temporary  No Replacement  1 Wetlands that are isolated have no connectivity to waters of the U.S. Wetlands that flow to the Rouchleau Pit, a non-regulated waters per the Approved JD (June 16, 2015), are not anticipated to be regulated under the Clean Water Act. Wetlands that flow to the active Thunderbird Mine are not anticipated to be regulated under the Clean Water Act. 2 Wetlands created in non-wetland areas solely by actions, the purpose of which was not to create wetland, are anticipated to be determined “incidental” under the Minnesota WCA, and therefore outside the scope of the WCA (MR 8420.0105, Subp. 2.D.).  4.1.1 Agency Requirements Approvals/permits for impacting wetlands and aquatic resources in the project area are required by Minnesota WCA and federal Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. Agency-specific approval/permit requests and proposed compensatory replacement are outlined below. 4.1.1.1 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers The project proposes 7.43 acres of permanent wetland impact and 0.57 acres of temporary wetland impact to 33 wetland basins within the project area. The proposed project is eligible for an Individual Permit for projects with impacts greater than five (5) acres. This permit application is a request for an Individual Permit. A copy of the Joint Application Form for Activities Affecting Water Resources in Minnesota is included at the front of this report. Mitigation for permanent wetland impacts is proposed in the form of a debit of credits from an established wetland bank (see Section 4.1 above). 4.1.1.2 Wetland Conservation Act The project proposes 9.03 acres of permanent wetland impact and 0.74 acres of temporary wetland impact to 33 basins within the project area. MnDOT accepts responsibility for administration of the Minnesota WCA areas of MnDOT ROW (see Section 3.1 above). MnDOT will work with the MNDNR on WCA administration duties for those portions of the project on school trust land or otherwise “state land” that will eventually become MnDOT ROW. This permit application will be used to request a Replacement Plan Approval under the rules of the Minnesota Wetland Conservation Act of 1991. This application will also be used to request a Wetland Boundary and Type Concurrence for wetlands delineated in the project area. A copy of the Joint Application Form for Activities Affecting Water Resources in Minnesota is included at the beginning of this document. Mitigation for permanent wetland impacts is proposed in the form of a debit of credits from an established wetland bank (see Section 4.1 above). MNT01 130641 Wetland Permit Application Page 12 TH 53 Relocation Project List of Figures Figure 1 – Site Location Map Figure 2 – Delineated Wetland Boundary Map Figure 3 – USGS 7.5-Minute Quadrangle Figure 4 – Wetland Impacts Map This map is neither a legally recorded map nor a survey map and is not intended to be used as one.

(]oro ~ .. E.,,, .. , V\'·Jrl-:1 l~ t' AI 1..11 U·, MEMORANDUM TO:  Daryl Wierzbinski, USACE Regulatory Project Manager Sarma Straumanis, MnDOT WCA Administrator  FROM:  Natalie White, SEH Biologist  DATE:  August 24, 2015  RE:  Supplemental Information for TH53 Relocation Wetland Permit Application – Volume II Tables 3, 3A, 3B SEH No. MNT01 130641 14.00  The purpose of this memorandum is to provide supplemental information for the TH 53 Relocation Project Wetland Permit Application, Volume II (Replacement Plan Application). Tables provided below are intended to replace Table 3, 3A, and 3B of the application document and supplemental memo dated July 24, 2015. Changes in wetland impact amounts reflect updates due to refined construction limits as the project progresses from 30% to 60% design. There are also additional permanent cut and fill impacts to Wetland 23 for construction of a storm water pond (see sheets EC05 and EC06 in the attached erosion control plans and Figures 4-8 and 4-11 of the attached mapbook). This pond must be located within the road premises easement, as well as sited topographically to receive storm water. Untreated storm water must not be allowed to flow into the Rouchleau Pit, as the pit is source water for the City of Virginia municipal supply. Additional temporary fill impacts are proposed to Wetland 59 for removal of highway bridges above the wetland (see sheet EC19 and Figure 4-4). Bridge material dropped into the wetland will be removed, and the area will be stabilized with seeding. Erosion control blanket will be installed on areas with slopes greater than 4:1. The updated limits and impact areas are detailed on the attached figures and erosion control plan sheets. Updates to wetland impacts will also change the proposed compensatory mitigation amounts for the project. As described in Section 4.1 of the Wetland Permit Application Volume II, compensatory mitigation for permanent impacts to wetlands is proposed through debit of credits from wetland bank #1595 (U of M Fens) located in St. Louis County, Major Watershed #3, Bank Service Area #1. We presume that a debit of 9.96 credits will satisfy requirements of both the USACE (7.90 credits necessary at a 1:1 mitigation ratio) and the WCA (9.96 credits necessary at a 1:1 mitigation ratio). Table 3 below identifies all updated wetland impacts due to the proposed project. Tables 3A and 3B separate wetland impacts into the respective regulatory programs. These tables supplement updated figures (attached) that show the location of all wetland impacts. Areas where wetland impacts have changed from previous submittals are identified in the tables in highlight text. Wierzbinski/Straumanis August 24, 2015 Page 2  Table 3  Wetland and Aquatic Resource Impact Summary  Basin ID1 / Page in Mapbook (Figure 4-x)  Wetland Classification (Eggers and Reed)  Landscape Position2  Duration of Impact  Type of Impact  Aquatic Resource Impact Area (acres)  Wetland Impact Summary (acres) by Jurisdiction  WCA  USACE  1 (Fig 4-2)  Shrub-Carr  Portions incidental (wet roadside ditch in part);

We have determined that we do not have jurisdiction for this project under the following sections of WCA rules: 8420.0200 Subpart D - This is a highway project that does not require a Permit to Mine. 8420.0200 Subpart F - You have provided documentation that MNDOT has jurisdiction over a majority of the wetland impacts. MNDOT will also be obtaining an easement from the DNR for state  owned land where TH 53 will be located. Therefore, we agree that it is appropriate that MNDOT fulfills the Wetland Conservation Act LGU duties for this project. We do appreciate continued interaction with the project as it is, as you are aware, in close proximity to a currently permitted facility likely to request a permit to mine amendment for expansion in the near future. If you have any questions or would like to discuss any aspect of the project, please let me know. Thanks, Jennifer Jennifer Engstrom Mineland Reclamation Section Manager Division of Lands and Minerals Minnesota Department of Natural Resources 500 Lafayette Rod, Box 45 St. Paul, MN 55155-4045 Office: 651-259-5385 Email: jennifer.engstrom@state.mn.us From: Allen, Colleen (DNR) Sent: Monday, June 29, 2015 8:26 AM To: Engstrom, Jennifer N (DNR) Cc: Jordan, Julie E (DNR); Oberhelman, Rory (DNR) Subject: FW: TH 53 Relocation project in Virginia FYI From: Straumanis, Sarma (DOT) Sent: Sunday, June 28, 2015 5:19 PM To: Allen, Colleen (DNR) Subject: TH 53 Relocation project in Virginia Hi Colleen, It’s taken some more time, but I wanted to assemble as much information as I could for you to share with staff in your Division. I have attached: 1 – Instructions for the link to SEH’s temporary FTP site that containing the final wetland delineation report & cover letter (Word file) th rd 2 – meeting minutes for the April 28 and June 3 TEP field reviews (pdf) 3 – an ownership map of the project area (pdf) 4 – email from SEH, Inc. re the acreage breakdown by ownership (pdf) Unfortunately there’s a problem with the table that was imbedded in the email and I’ll ask for a better copy on Monday. 5 – WCA Sequencing Decision (pdf) 6 – MnDOT letter to City of Virginia (Bill Hennis) regarding MnDOT’s WCA responsibilities (pdf) History of actions so far: MnDOT approved a WCA Sequencing Application in May 2015 (see attached pdf). Normally we wouldn’t process a stand-alone Sequencing Application, but we felt it was needed to mirror the parallel Corps point of concurrence in the federal process. The selection of the preferred alternative was based on a level 1 delineation. A wetland delineation report (using a level 2 delineation with field work done in April) , was prepared th rd by SEH, Inc. Field reviews were held May 28 and June 3 (two days were used to accommodate people’s busy schedules). The Corps has since approved the wetland delineation report. The WCA Wetland Boundary & Type and Replacement Plan applications are pending while consensus is reached regarding MnDOT’s role as WCA LGU. The City of Virginia (the local LGU for City and RGGS mining company property) is in agreement that MnDOT undertake WCA Administrative responsibilities on its behalf (see attached letter to Bill Hennis, as pdf). Regarding wetland replacement, the applicant (MnDOT Duluth District) will propose to use wetland bank credits from the U of M Fens site in St. Louis County. Let me know if you are interested in additional information (a revised ownership breakdown table is forthcoming ASAP). Thanks! TRANSMITTAL To: Ms. Sarma Straumanis Date: March 3, 2015 Wetland Program Coordinator SEH File No.: MNT01 130641 30.90 Minnesota Department of Transportation Office of Environmental Stewardship State Project No.: 6918-80 395 John Ireland Blvd., MS 620 St. Paul, MN  55155 Re: TH53 Relocation Project Wetland Permit Application We are: Enclosing Sending under separate cover Sending as requested One (1) printed copy of the Wetland Permit Application and supplemental materials for the TH53 Relocation Project.

RHA SECTION 10 DETERMINATION OF JURISDICTION. There are no “navigable waters of the U.S.” within Rivers and Harbors Act (RHA) jurisdiction (as defined by 33 CFR part 329) in the review area. B. CWA SECTION 404 DETERMINATION OF JURISDICTION. There are no“waters of the U.S.” within Clean Water Act (CWA) jurisdiction (as defined by 33 CFR part 328) in the review area. 1. Waters of the U.S.: N/A 2. Non-regulated waters/wetlands (check if applicable):1 Potentiallyjurisdictional waters and/or wetlands were assessed within the review area and determined to be not jurisdictional. Explain: The preamble to the 1986 Final Rule for Regulatory Programs of the Corps of Engineers includes several categories of waters generally not considered to be waters of the United States, including “waterfilled depressions created in dry land incidental to construction activity and pits excavated in dry land for the purpose of obtaining fill, sand, or gravel unless and until the construction or excavation operation is abandoned and the resulting body of water meets the definition of waters of the United States.” For this exclusion to apply such water must have been created in dry land as a result of construction or mining activities and currently used for that purpose. The Rouchleau Pit is an approximately 300-acre waterfilled depression created as a result of mining activities at the site. It has no inlets or outlets connecting it to other waters. After cessation of pumping the pit filled with water to its present condition. A review of historic information suggests that the pit was excavated in dry land. The pit is currently subject to mining uses by Cliffs United Taconite and has not been abandoned. The pit is located next to current mining facilities and within Cliffs United Taconite’s permit to mine -meaning that the area could be mined under state law without additional permitting. For these reasons, it is determined the Rouchleau Pit is not a water of the United States. SECTION III:  CWA ANALYSIS A. TNWs AND WETLANDS ADJACENT TO TNWs: N/A B.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS TO SUPPORT JD: APPLICANT: Minnesota Department of Public Notice Transportation ISSUED: 24 March 2015 District 1: SP 6918-80 EXPIRES: 23 April 2015 SECTION: 404 -Clean Water Act REFER TO: 2011-00769-DWW 1. APPLICATION FOR PERMIT TO discharge dredged and fill materials into 6.04 acres of wetlands adjacent to unnamed tributaries to the St. Louis River for the purpose of addressing the termination of the 1960 easement agreement granted by United States Steel Corporation (now held by RGGS) that affects the current 1.5-mile Trunk Highway (TH) 53 segment between 2nd Avenue West and Cuyuna Drive in the City of Virginia, Minnesota.  2. SPECIFIC INFORMATION. APPLICANT'S ADDRESS: AGENT:  Short, Elliott, Hendrickson (SEH) Minnesota Department of Transportation Incorporated, 418 West Superior Street, District 1, 1123 Mesaba Avenue, Duluth, Suite 200, Duluth, Minnesota 55802 Minnesota 55811 PROJECT LOCATION:  The project site is located in Sec(s). 8, 9, 16, 17, 20, 21, T. 58N., R. 17 W., St. Louis County, Minnesota. UTM 15 with the approximate Lat/Long (decimal degrees) is 47.5026°, -925177°. OTHER FEDERAL AGENCY INVOLVEMENT: This project is being funded by Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). As such, FHWA is the lead Federal agency responsible for compliance with applicable laws and regulations. This includes the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. An Environmental Impact Statement is being prepared to satisfy the agency’s responsibility under NEPA. The Corps has entered into an agreement with FHWA to cooperate in preparation of the EIS to streamline review for both agencies. The Draft EIS (DEIS) was published for public comment in early 2015; the period for submitting comments on the DEIS has ended. However, the DEIS and other, more detailed information on the project can be found at http://www.dot.state.mn.us/d1/projects/hwy53relocation/. This public notice is to solicit public comments on the permit application submitted by the Minnesota Department of Transportation for discharges of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States associated with this project. Operations -Regulatory (2011-00769-DWW) SUBJECT:  Notice of Application for TH 53 Relocation Project DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT:  The application was prepared to describe the MnDOT proposed relocation and realignment of Trunk Highway (TH) 53 from a segment of roadway that operates on an easement subject to mineral rights held by RGGS Land and Minerals Company, and Cliffs Natural Resources Incorporated, United Taconite, LLC (UTAC). Since 1960, MnDOT has operated a 1.5-mile segment of TH 53 on an easement granted by United States Steel Corporation (now held by RGGS).  The segment is subject to iron ore mining rights held by RGGS, and UTAC, the mine owner and operator.  Under the 1960 easement agreement terms, MnDOT agreed to relocate the segment of TH 53 upon notice from the mine owner/operator that continued mine operations were to proceed in the subject area. On May 5, 2010, UTAC and RGGS provided notice to MnDOT that the 1960 easement rights would be terminated.  Under the original easement terms, MnDOT must vacate the TH 53 easement within three years of notification.  In response to the notice, MnDOT requested a seven-year timeframe for the relocation of TH 53.  The parties have signed an agreement to modify the easement vacation date to May 2017. The purpose of the project is to address the termination of the 1960 easement agreement that affects the current highway location in order to continue to provide a transportation facility that would safely maintain an adequate roadway capacity and mobility as well as local, regional, and inter-regional connectivity. PROJECT ALTERNATIVES:  Five alternatives were identified in the DEIS. A brief description of these alternatives is listed below.  1. No-build Alternative (Existing Easement Agreement Area Closed) would respond to the easement terms by closing the segment of TH 53 within the existing easement agreement area and reroute traffic to existing highways.  No-build Alternative (Existing Easement Agreement Area Remains Open), although not in compliance with terms of the existing agreement, would keep TH 53 in place and open to traffic by addressing the economic, legal, and engineering issues associated with resolving the terms of the existing surface transportation easement agreement.  The State of Minnesota would not vacate TH 53, but would keep the highway segment open.  2. Alternative M-1 (New Alignment through Active Mine) would consider construction of a new four-lane TH 53 alignment through the active UTAC mine.  3. Alternative E-1A (New Alignment through Permit to Mine Boundary) would consider construction of a new four-lane TH 53 alignment through the UTAC permit to mine area.  This alternative routes TH 53 across the Rouchleau Pit along an existing submerged haul road embankment.  4. Alternative E-2 (Preferred: New Alignment around UTAC Permit to Mine Boundary)would be routed around the UTAC permit to mine and environmental setting boundaries.  The proposed alignment would follow a northeasterly track on the present 2 Operations -Regulatory (2011-00769-DWW) SUBJECT:  Notice of Application for TH 53 Relocation Project day Landfill Road corridor before turning to the west to cross over the Rouchleau Pit.  Upon crossing the pit, the alignment turns to the southwest following an abandoned railroad corridor that runs between the pit and residential neighborhoods before reconnecting to existing TH 53 at 2nd Avenue West.  A bridge would be built along the corridor across the Rouchleau Pit. VEGETATION IN AFFECTED AREA:  The project would result in the discharge of dredged and fill material into 6.04 acres of wetlands:  1.1 acres of fresh wet meadow; 2.13 acres fresh wet meadow/shrub-carr; 0.05 acre sedge meadow; 2.0 acres sedge meadow/shallow marsh; 0.12 acre shallow marsh; 0.45 acre shallow marsh/shrub-carr; and 0.19 acre seasonally flooded basin.  The wetland review was based on a Level 1 assessment that utilized current digital data from the U.S. Geological Survey, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) National Wetlands Inventory, MnDNR Public Waters Inventory, U.S. Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service hydric soils data, and a visual inspection of selected wetlands.  Wetland boundaries were verified by photo interpretation, review of digital data, and visual inspection of wetland areas for general wetland types and characteristics. A Level 2 wetland delineation is planned for spring 2015.  Updated wetland impact information would be available after the Level 2 delineation is complete. SOURCE OF FILL MATERIAL:  The source of fill material would be determined by the contractor.  The type of fill material would be clean granular soils for embankment and salvaged topsoil from within the project limits.  If fill material would be needed beyond what is available on site, MnDOT’s special provisions 1602 and 1701 would apply. SURROUNDING LAND USE:  Taconite Mining, City of Virginia’s business district DESCRIPTION OF STRUCTURE:  A bridge structure would be built across the Rouchleau Pit.  The structure would not require fill to be discharged in the pit below the water surface. There would be placement of fill along limited areas of the pit wall for placement of abutments for the bridge crossing.   DESCRIPTION OF DREDGING OR EXCAVATION:  There would be excavation activities for the construction of the road bed along the project corridor and retention/detention ponds. THE FOLLOWING PRECAUTIONS TO PROTECT WATER QUALITY HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED BY THE APPLICANT:  The preferred alternative would have no net change in impervious surface from the existing condition.  Per National Pollutant Discharge Elimination Systems (NPDES) requirements, treatment of stormwater is not required based on the net change in impervious surface area for the project.  However, water quality treatment of the stormwater runoff from the constrained cross section would be included to maintain water quality of the Rouchleau Pit.  Construction erosion and sediment control would be provided in accordance with Minnesota Pollution Control Agency and NPDES requirements. 3 Operations -Regulatory (2011-00769-DWW) SUBJECT:  Notice of Application for TH 53 Relocation Project MITIGATION: Compensatory mitigation for impacts to wetlands is proposed through debit of credits from an established wetland mitigation bank.  The preliminary amount of credit to be withdrawn by the applicant would be 5.67 credits; the credit amount would be refined after the Level 2 wetland delineation would be complete in spring 2015.  It was estimated by MnDOT that 0.37 acre of wetlands in ditch systems are non-jurisdictional within the project corridor. This is a state project for which MnDOT would be providing replacement using wetland credits already in the MnDOT Wetland Banks already established for MnDOT-specific projects.  Credits would be debited from Bank Service Area (BSA) 1 as a first priority. If sufficient credits are not available in BSA 1, the credits would be debited from established wetland mitigation banks in other bank service areas at an increased debit ratio. 3. REPLIES/COMMENTS. Interested parties are invited to submit to this office written facts, arguments, or objections within 30 days of the date of this notice.  These statements should bear upon the suitability of the location and the adequacy of the project and should, if appropriate, suggest any changes believed to be desirable.  Comments received may be forwarded to the applicant. Replies may be addressed to Regulatory Branch, St. Paul District, Corps of Engineers, 180 Fifth Street East, Suite 700, Saint Paul, MN 55101-1678. Or, IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PROJECT, call Daryl W.

FEDERALLY-LISTED THREATENED OR ENDANGERED WILDLIFE OR PLANTS OR THEIR CRITICAL HABITAT. St. Louis County is within the known or historic range of the following Federally-listed threatened (T) species: Species Habitat Gray Wolf (Canis Lupus) (T) Northern forested areas Canada Lynx (Lynx Canadensis) (T) Northern forested areas This information in the application about Federally-listed threatened species is being coordinated between the FHWA and the FWS.  Any comments it may have concerning Federally-listed threatened or endangered wildlife or plants or their critical habitat will be considered in our final assessment of the described work. The Northern Long-eared Bat (proposed to be listed as threatened) is also being coordinated with the FWS for the review process. 4 Operations -Regulatory (2011-00769-DWW) SUBJECT:  Notice of Application for TH 53 Relocation Project 5. JURISDICTION. This application is being reviewed in accordance with the practices for documenting Corps jurisdiction under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act identified in Regulatory Guidance Letter 08-02. We have made an initial determination that the aquatic resources that would be impacted by the proposed project are regulated by the Corps of Engineers under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.  MnDOT had requested the Corps to prepare an approved jurisdictional determination for the Rouchleau Pit and 2.57 acres of wetlands (W17, W22, W23, W24, W28, W29, W30, W44) within the TH 53 corridor prior to making a permit decision. This may affect the amount of jurisdictional wetlands and waters under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, which in turn, could also affect the level of permitting for the overall project. Approved jurisdictional determinations are posted on the St. Paul District web page at http://www.mvp.usace.army.mil/Missions/Regulatory.aspx. 6. STATE SECTION 401 WATER QUALITY CERTIFICATION. Valid Section 404 permits cannot be issued for any activity unless state water quality certification for the activity is granted or waived pursuant to Section 401 of the Clean Water Act.  The state Section 401 authority in Minnesota is the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA).  The St. Paul District has provided this public notice and a copy of the applicant’s Section 404 permit application form to the MPCA.  If MPCA needs any additional information in order for the Section 401 application to be considered complete by MPCA, the MPCA has indicated that it will request such information from the applicant.  It is the permit applicant’s responsibility to ensure that the MPCA has received a valid, complete application for state Section 401 certification and to obtain a final Section 401 action from the MPCA. The MPCA has indicated that this public notice serves as its public notice of the application for Section 401 water quality certification under Minnesota Rules Part 7001. The MPCA has also indicated that the Section 401 process shall begin to commence upon the issuance date of this public notice unless the MPCA notifies both the St. Paul District and the permit applicant to the contrary, in writing, before the expiration date of this public notice. Any comments relative to MPCA’s Section 401 Certification for the activity proposed in this public notice may be sent to: Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, Resource Management and Assistance Division, Attention: 401 Certification, 520 Lafayette Road North, St. Paul, Minnesota  55155-4194. 7. HISTORICAL/ARCHAEOLOGICAL. The FHWA will review information on known cultural resources and/or historic properties within and adjacent to the project area.  The FHWA will also consider the potential effects of the project on any properties that have yet to be identified.  The results of this review and the FHWA’s determination of effect will be coordinated with the State Historic Preservation Officer 5 Operations -Regulatory (2011-00769-DWW) SUBJECT:  Notice of Application for TH 53 Relocation Project independent of this public notice.  Any adverse effects on historic properties will be resolved prior to the Corps authorization, or approval, of the work in connection with this project. 8. PUBLIC HEARING REQUESTS. Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public hearing be held to consider this application.  Requests for public hearings shall state, in detail, the reasons for holding a public hearing. A request may be denied if substantive reasons for holding a hearing are not provided or if there is otherwise no valid interest to be served. 9. PUBLIC INTEREST REVIEW. The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impact, including cumulative impacts, of the proposed activity on the public interest.  That decision will reflect the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources.  The benefit which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments.  All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered, including the cumulative effects.  Among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, cultural values, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.  Environmental and other documents will be available for review in the St. Paul District Office. The Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public; Federal, State, and local agencies and officials; Indian tribes; and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity.  Any comments received will be considered by the Corps of Engineers to determine whether to issue, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal.

Thus, new ballots are attached and marked for clearly distinguishing the different areas and revised ballot. The Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) is considering constructing a noise barrier along the west side of the new US 53 alignment in Virginia from approximately 10th Street S to 12th Street S (see enclosed figure) as part of the US 53 Virginia to Eveleth project. The wall is proposed to be placed on the north side of US 53 between the neighborhood and the proposed alignment. The proposed wall would be approximately 20 feet tall and 1,260 feet long. A number of properties in your neighborhood are being offered the chance to vote on this proposed noise barrier. Benefitted receivers are those properties that would receive a noise benefit (defined as a reduction of at least five decibels (dBA)) from the construction of the noise barrier. Your property has been identified as a benefitted receiver, and this is your opportunity to vote on whether or not the proposed barrier should be built. For rental properties, both the owner and the renter have the opportunity to independently express their opinions. An open house is set for Thursday, March 5th from 5:00 to 7:00 pm in the Laurentian Conference Room at MnDOT’s Virginia office (101 N Hoover Road, Virginia, MN 55792). MnDOT representatives and staff from Kimley-Horn and Associates will be in attendance to provide information and materials on the proposed noise barrier. The purpose of the open house is to solicit your input on whether or not to build the noise barrier. This is a one-time opportunity to receive a noise barrier as part of the US 53 project. This barrier will be proposed for construction unless more than 50 percent of the total eligible points are not in favor of the barrier. Please take time to make your opinion known. Your response will become part of the official project record. A short ballot is located on the back of this notice. You may bring your ballot to the open house, or you can receive one at the open house by showing a photo ID. If you are unable to attend, you may mail the ballot to Pat Huston, MnDOT Project Manager, at 1123 Mesaba Avenue, Duluth, MN 55811 (self-addressed envelope included).   This notice has been mailed to residents and owners of benefitted receivers only. If you have neighbors who did not receive this notice but are interested in the project they are welcome to attend the open house, but only benefitted receivers are eligible to vote using the ballot on the back of this notice. Opinion forms are required to be returned by March 20, 2015. Additional information on MnDOT’s noise policy can be found at http://www.dot.state.mn.us/environment/noise/index.html. Sincerely, Pat Huston Project Manager MnDOT District 1 218-725-2707 An Equal Opportunity Employer AREA C NOISE WALL (NEAR 2ND AVENUE)        Please mark one: ☐ Owner ☐ Resident ☐ Owner and Resident Name: Address: Please mark one: ☐ I want the noise barrier ☐ I do not want the noise barrier Comments: An Equal Opportunity Employer LegendUS 53 Project Alignment Proposed Noise Wall Benefitted Parcels Minnesota Department of Transportation  District 1  1123 Mesaba Avenue  101 N Hoover Road  Duluth, MN  55811-2798  Virginia, MN  55792-3412  Office Tel:  218/725-2700  Office Tel:  218/742-1100  Fax:  218/725-2800  Fax:  218/749-7709  February 24, 2015 Dear Resident or Owner, This letter is being resent due to a mix up in ballots; prior letters for the Midway area walls were sent to the 2nd Avenue neighborhood and vice versa.

The proposed wall would be 20 feet tall and 2,074 feet long. A number of properties in your neighborhood are being offered the chance to vote on this proposed noise barrier. This ballot was originally sent to 48 properties in April 2015.  Since that time, refinements of the noise analysis during the project development process show that an additional seven properties along the south end of Mesabi Drive will receive a noise benefit from the noise wall, and your property is one of them.  Benefitted receivers are those properties that would receive a noise benefit (defined as a reduction of at least five decibels (dBA)) from the construction of the noise barrier.

You are requested to submit your ballot by August 18, 2015, though MnDOT’s encourages you to do so early so that results can be incorporated into the project as soon as possible. This notice has been sent to seven benefitted residents and owners of benefitted receivers only in your immediate vicinity along the south end of Mesabi Drive. Additional information on MnDOT’s noise policy can be found at http://www.dot.state.mn.us/environment/noise/index.html. Sincerely, Pat Huston Project Manager MnDOT District 1 218-725-2707 An Equal Opportunity Employer AREA F NOISE WALL (NEAR MIDWAY) Please mark one: ☐ Owner ☐ Resident ☐ Owner and Resident Name: Address: Please mark one: ☐ I want the noise barrier ☐ I do not want the noise barrier Comments: Parcel ID # XX An Equal Opportunity Employer LegendUS 53 Project Alignment Proposed Noise Wall Noise Study AreaAdditional Benefitted Parcels Noise Wall Mailing Li Revised Benefitted Parce Feet Area F (Midway st ls) Minnesota Department of Transportation District 1 1123 Mesaba Avenue 101 N Hoover Road Duluth, MN  55811-2798 Virginia, MN 55792-3412 Office Tel:  218/725-2700 Office Tel:  218/742-1100 Fax:  218/725-2800 Fax:  218/749-7709 August 3, 2015 Dear Resident or Owner, You were notified in February 2015 that the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) is considering constructing a noise barrier along the east side of US 53 in Virginia from approximately Cuyuna Drive to Mesabi Drive as part of the US 53 Virginia to Eveleth project. The wall is proposed to be placed in the median between Midway Drive and US 53. The proposed wall would be 20 feet tall and 2,074 feet long. A ballot was originally sent to 48 properties in February 2015.  Since that time, the noise analysis has been refined during the project development process. A minimum noise reduction of 5 decibels is required in order for a property to be considered a “benefitted receptor” and enable the property to vote on the noise wall installation. As a result of the recent noise analysis refinement, four properties in the project area are no longer defined as benefitted receptors, including your property. The proposed noise wall is still predicted to provide a noise level reduction, however, predicted noise on your property has crossed a threshold from previously experiencing a reduction of more than five decibels, to a reduction of slightly less than five decibels. This change in predicted noise reduction means that your property will no longer be included in the voting process for the noise wall. Although no action is required on your part, you are invited to an informational meeting to discuss this change on August 17, from 5:00 PM to 6:30 PM.  The meeting will be held in the Laurentian Conference Room at the MnDOT office in Virginia: 101 N Hoover Road, Virginia, MN  55792. Note that only the four properties in the project area that are no longer defined as benefitted receptors have been directly invited to this meeting. If you have any questions about the process, please contact Patrick.Huston@state.mn.us, 218-7252707 or by U.S. mail to Pat Huston, MnDOT Project Manager, 1123 Mesaba Avenue, Duluth, MN 55811. Additional information on MnDOT’s noise policy can be found at http://www.dot.state.mn.us/environment/noise/index.html. Sincerely, Pat Huston Project Manager MnDOT District 1 218-725-2707 An Equal Opportunity Employer Attachment A Addendum to the Noise Technical Report July 2015 Table A-1:  Area C – Project Corridor – Noise Modeling Results Receptor1  Modeled Noise Levels (dBA)  A.

Much of Chapter 1 from the Draft EIS is repeated here, but parts have been abbreviated. Since May 1960, the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) has operated a segment of US Highway 53 (US 53) on an easement granted by United States Steel Corporation (US Steel, now RGGS Land and Minerals Co., or RGGS). This roughly one and a half mile segment of US 53, from approximately 2nd Avenue West to Cuyuna Drive in Virginia, Minnesota (see Figure 1.0-1), is subject to iron ore mining rights held by RGGS and Cliffs Natural Resources (United Taconite Division, herein referred to as UTAC), the mine’s owner and operator, respectively. At its east end, the US 53 easement segment connects with Minnesota Trunk Highway 135 (MN 135), which provides the inter-regional link toward Gilbert and other communities to the east. Under the 1960 easement terms, MnDOT agreed to relocate US 53 upon notice from the mine owner/operator. On May 5, 2010, UTAC1 and RGGS provided notice to MnDOT that the 1960 easement rights would be terminated (see copies of the 1960 easement and the letter of termination in Appendix A). Under the original easement terms, MnDOT must vacate the US 53 easement within three years of notification. In response to the notice, MnDOT requested a seven-year timeframe for relocation of US 53. The two parties have signed an agreement to modify the easement vacation date to May 2017. MnDOT is conducting this project process to make decisions on how to best address the pending termination of easement rights. The approximate project termini are on US 53 at 2nd Avenue West and Bourgin Road. 1.1 Changes Since the Draft EIS The Purpose and Need for the US 53 project has not changed since the Draft EIS was published. There were no substantive comments received on the Draft EIS that affect the Purpose and Need. Alternative E-2 with the Interchange Option and Straight Option has been selected as the preferred alternative, and design refinements have occurred since publication of the Draft EIS (see Chapter 2: Alternatives), but these changes have not altered the basic Purpose and Need for the project, which are discussed in Sections 1.2 and 1.3, respectively. The current project schedule anticipates construction will be complete in the fall of 2017. MnDOT will negotiate with RGGS and UTAC to extend the easement agreement to a date that coincides with the end of construction. In the unlikely event that negotiations are unsuccessful, traffic would be detoured along MN 37, Co. 7, and US 169. Impacts would be temporary and would be similar to the No Build Alternative while the detour is in place (see a summary of impacts for the No Build Alternative in Appendix H). MnDOT will continue outreach to the public regarding status of construction plans and detours, as necessary. 1.2 Project Purpose The purpose of the US 53 project is to address the termination of the 1960 easement agreement that affects the current highway location in order to continue to provide a transportation facility that will safely maintain adequate roadway capacity and mobility as well as local, regional, and inter-regional connectivity. 1 United Taconite (UTAC) is a division of Cliffs Natural Resources, Inc. UTAC leases the property from the land and mineral owner, RGGS Land and Minerals Co. For brevity, most references in this document will refer simply to “UTAC.” September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS 1.3 Project Needs The need for undertaking this project is derived from the following elements: ■ Respond to the roadway easement terms; address the requirements set forth in agreements between the State of Minnesota and the land owner ■ Provide a facility that meets regional and inter-regional system connectivity needs and inter-regional highway corridor performance targets ■ Maintain local connectivity to the regional system and maintain efficiency of local connections ■ Provide a facility that serves current and future capacity needs while maintaining system mobility and safety All four elements are discussed in more detail below. Together, these needs support taking action to address the anticipated transportation system problem arising from the termination of the existing easement agreement. 1.3.1 Need #1: Respond to the roadway easement terms The approximately one and a half mile segment of US 53 between 2nd Avenue West and Cuyuna Drive in Virginia operates on an easement granted to the State of Minnesota in 1960 by US Steel (RGGS is the current owner and successor to US Steel; UTAC is the mine operator). The May 2010 termination of the State’s easement rights is the primary need for action, requiring MnDOT to address the future of US 53 at this location. Under the easement terms, MnDOT must vacate the above-noted portion of US 53. The timeframe for response to the easement compliance, formalized through written agreement between MnDOT and RGGS/UTAC, is May 2017. 1.3.2 Need #2: Provide a facility that meets regional and inter-regional system connectivity needs and inter-regional corridor performance targets 1.3.2.1 Inter-regional and Regional Connectivity US 53 is a High Priority Corridor on the National Highway System. It links Virginia, Minnesota, a secondary regional trade center, to Duluth, a primary regional trade center about 60 miles to the south. International Falls, a shopping trade center and a gateway to Canada, is located on US 53 about 100 miles north of Virginia. The US 53 easement segment provides an important link along this and other inter-regional routes, supporting these long-distance trips. US 53, MN 135, and US 169 are also designated constitutional routes in Minnesota’s trunk highway system, meaning that any proposed route relocation must closely evaluate connectivity to and between various communities.2 In the US 53 project area, constitutional routes are intended to provide the cities of Eveleth, Virginia, Gilbert, and Mountain Iron “…a reasonable means of communication, each with the other and other places in the state…” (Minnesota Statutes, section 161). Similarly, MN 37 between Gilbert and Eveleth is designated as a constitutional route. 1.3.2.2 Inter-regional Corridor (IRC) Performance US 53 is also categorized in MnDOT plans as a Medium Priority Inter-regional Corridor (IRC). The focus of IRCs is on improving mobility along the corridors to facilitate connections between regional economic 2 Minnesota’s constitutionally dedicated routes “…may be relocated as provided by law but no relocation shall cause a deviation from the starting points or terminals nor cause any deviation from the various villages and cities through which the routes are to pass under the constitutional amendment adopted November 2, 1920.” (Source: Minnesota Legislature website, Article XIV, Public Highway System, accessed April 4, 2011.) September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS centers. This focus is reflected in the performance target for a Medium Priority IRC (averaging 55+ miles per hour for the entire length of the US 53 corridor). 1.3.3 Need #3: Maintain local connectivity to the regional system; maintain efficiency of local connections 1.3.3.1 Local Connections to Regional Highway System The need to maintain highway system linkages and route continuity, even with the possible removal of the segment of US 53 through the existing easement agreement area, is a challenge. This challenge is clarified when we review the original easement location decision, which recognized: ■ The need for a direct highway connection to serve many regional and local highway trips ■ The need to cross future iron ore reserves and anticipate conflicts with future mining (the issue now being addressed) The transportation effectiveness of the original US 53 route in serving both local and regional trips is further evidenced by existing and forecast traffic volumes. The easement segment carries more traffic (more than 22,000 vehicles per day) than any other segment of US 53 in the study area. While such focused heavy demand on about one and a half miles of highway is remarkable, it is not surprising given the route’s strategic location. In fact, from a highway network perspective, the US 53 easement segment is comparable to a major river crossing, as there are limited opportunities to cross through the iron formation. Now, as compliance with the easement terms necessitates a new review, travelers continue to need an efficient and effective connection for many trip purposes. 1.3.3.2 Efficient Local Connections US 53 also provides a local connection between the communities of Virginia and Eveleth and is an important link among all of the Quad Cities3 (Figure 1.3-1). The easement segment of US 53 also connects the main/larger portion of Virginia to the city’s Midway neighborhood on the east side of the UTAC mine. Therefore, the easement segment serves local connections both between the area’s communities and within the city of Virginia itself. Several roads intersect US 53 near the easement segment and provide important connections to the area’s neighborhoods and businesses. To the north of the easement within Virginia, US 169 ties into US 53 as do several local streets, including 12th Avenue and 2nd Avenue. MN 135 connects to the easement segment of US 53 on its east, providing a direct link to/from Gilbert. To the south, in Eveleth, MN 37 and County Road (Co.) 101 tie into US 53 from the east and west, respectively. Further south, MN 37 connects to the west side of US 53 (US 53 and MN 37 share the same segment of highway between Eveleth and the western section of MN 37). With a combined population of about 17,100 (Table 1.3-1), the Quad Cities is a major population sub-area in (2010 US Census) the Iron Range. There is a need to preserve at least the same level of network connectivity and community access as is currently provided. The need for daily east-west connections is illustrated with about 60 to 65 percent of the area’s population located west of the easement segment and 35 to 40 percent located east. In Virginia, the connectivity need includes maintaining a link to 2nd Avenue, which connects the central business district to US 53, to the Midway neighborhood and other points east via the easement segment. Table 1.3-1. Quad Cities Populations City  2010 Population  Virginia  8,712  Eveleth  3,718  Mountain Iron  2,869  Gilbert  1,799  TOTAL  17,098  In order to maintain or improve existing connections among the Quad Cities, including connections that currently use the US 53 easement segment as the most direct route, current travel times between local 3 The Quad Cities includes Eveleth, Gilbert, Mountain Iron, and Virginia. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS communities should be maintained or not increased substantially. Examples of community needs that depend on efficient transportation connectivity include the local economy, emergency service providers, and school transportation. Increases in travel time between communities would impair emergency response time, such as police, fire, and ambulance, which is an issue of concern that has often been noted by stakeholders in the project area. In addition to the general concerns, Essentia Health-Virginia is located on Virginia’s north side (on 9th Street) and serves as the region’s main trauma center and hospital. Also, the Mountain Iron/Buhl, Eveleth, and Virginia school districts rely on the US 53 easement segment to transport students throughout the school year. 1.3.4 Need #4: Provide a facility that serves current and future capacity needs while maintaining mobility and safety US 53 must continue to safely and efficiently meet the current travel demand, and continue to do so for projected demand. Chapter 3: Transportation Analysis shows the actual 2009 traffic volumes on US 53 (the most current year for traffic count data) (see Figure 3.1-1) as well as forecasts for: ■ 2017, the year when a long-term plan for US 53 should be fully implemented, based on the background/needs above ■ 2037, the project’s target design year (20 years after 2017) Annual average daily traffic (AADT) volumes are shown for US 53 and intersecting roads within the study 4area. In 2009, traffic volumes on US 53 within the study area ranged from 12,000 vehicles per day (vpd) to more than 22,000 vpd. The highest AADTs, both current and projected, occur on the easement segment of US 53, as shown in Figure 3.1-1, where the 2009 traffic volume on US 53 was 22,400 vpd between 2nd Avenue and MN 135. This segment is expected to carry over 24,000 vpd by 2017 and over 28,600 vpd by 2037. There is a need for US 53 to convey the existing and forecast traffic demands while addressing IRC performance standards and efficient connections, as described in Needs 2 and 3 above. 1.4 Other Considerations In addition to the project needs outlined above, other factors that have been considered in the development and evaluation of project alternatives include: ■ Potential high cost of acquiring right-of-way due to mineral rights As described above, the segment of US 53 that is the subject of this project is located on an easement within land owned by a mining company. Since the project is located in an area where the Biwabik Iron Formation is located, much of the land in the project area has valuable mineral rights associated with it. Depending on the amount of mining that has already taken place on parcels, the quality of the ore deposits, and other factors, the value of the land varies. Overall, however, the value of mineral rights associated with parcels within the Biwabik Iron Formation can result in substantially higher acquisition costs compared to land outside the feasible mining areas. Therefore, the value of mineral rights and how they affect overall project cost is a factor that has been considered in developing and evaluating project alternatives. ■ Economic development US 53 provides an important connection within and among the Quad Cities, including providing an important route for local and regional commerce. Potential impacts to existing businesses and to future development opportunities within the cities adjacent to US 53 have been identified by project 4 The most recent traffic counts for US 53 and other trunk highways (US 169, MN 135, and MN 37) are from 2009. Traffic counts for most county and local roads were last completed in 2007. Traffic forecasts are based on a one percent annual growth rate. Figure 3.1-1 presents a baseline of 2009 for all segments, with county/local road volumes adjusted where necessary to conform to 2009 trunk highway traffic levels. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS stakeholders as an important factor to be considered in this project. Changes to methods for shipping iron ore out of the UTAC mine are not expected, as all iron ore is currently shipped out by rail. ■ Use of US 53 as a corridor for utilities The existing US 53 corridor includes permits granted for a variety of public and private utilities between Virginia and Eveleth. US 53 in particular enables utility service to Virginia’s Midway area. Relocation of US 53 and the continuation of UTAC mine operations could effectively sever important utility services in Virginia and to other areas of the Quad Cities. While MnDOT is not obligated to relocate utilities as part of this project, a new US 53 alignment could be used as a corridor for the continuation of some utility services. ■ Consideration of existing and planned pedestrian/bicycle facilities The Mesabi Trail, a non-motorized vehicle and pedestrian trail, currently provides a connection between the cities of Virginia and Gilbert within the project study area. Potential impacts to the trail and opportunities for maintaining a trail connection between these cities have been considered in conjunction with this project. ■ Provide a feasible transportation solution that is based on first avoiding and then minimizing adverse environmental impacts In addition to the resource issues discussed above, this portion of northeastern Minnesota is characterized by northern mixed hardwood and conifer forests as well as conifer bogs and wetlands. Lakes and streams surround the project area in addition to abandoned mine pits that have naturally filled with groundwater. Virginia uses an adjacent mine pit as a reservoir for its drinking water. Within the context of an open-pit mining environment and nearby location of a public highway, an additional economic concern that has been considered is the potential business impact if the mine cannot meet air quality standards adjacent to the new road alignment. Mine operations near public air space may warrant closer review against National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), which were established to protect public health and the environment. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS 169 £¤ 53 Mountain Iron 135 Gilbert £¤ Virginia Existing US 53 Easement Agreement Area 57467 Leonidas SEPTEMBER 2015 £¤53 VU101 Eveleth Eveleth-Virginia Z Municipal Airport 37 ± 0 3,000 6,000 Feet Source: Environmental Setting Boundary (DNR) Legend Pro Figure 1.0-1 Existing US 53 Easement Agreement Area ject Location UTAC Mine US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Municipalities Final Environmental Impact Statement US 53 and US 169 £¤ 53 12th Ave W2nd Ave W Virgini a £¤ 169 US 53 and 12th Avenue Midway 135 (Virginia) Gilbert Mountain Iron To Aurora US 53 and South 2nd Avenue West US 53 and MN 135 £¤53 US 53 and MN 37 (East) / Co. 101 (West) 7 Eveleth-Virginia ZMunicipal Airport Iron Junction US 53 and MN 137 (South) Leonidas Eveleth U101V SEPTEMBER 2015 ± 0 4,500 9,000 Feet Figure 1.3-1 Legend Local Connections Existing US 53 Easement Agreement Area US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Municipalities Final Environmental Impact Statement Alternatives The US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) (December 2014) is incorporated by reference and is considered part of the Final EIS. Much of Chapter 2 from the Draft EIS is repeated here, but parts have been abbreviated. This chapter describes the preferred alternative identified for the US 53 project. It first summarizes alternatives dismissed through the Scoping process, followed by alternatives analyzed in the Draft EIS and dismissed in favor of the preferred alternative. It then describes the preferred alternative and the rationale for its selection. 2.1 Alternatives Dismissed Prior to the Draft EIS Of the alternatives considered during the Scoping process, the following were dismissed from further consideration as part of the September 2012 Scoping Decision Document (SDD) or the September 2013 Amended Scoping Decision Document (ASDD). The corridors are illustrated in Figure 2.1-1 and the alternatives are shown in Figure 2.1-2. 2.1.1 West Corridor Alternatives 2.1.1.1 Alternative W-1 Alternative W-1 largely followed existing highways (Minnesota Trunk Highway 37 (MN 37) and County Road 7 (Co. 7)). It was eliminated from further consideration since other Build Alternatives (i.e., Alternatives M-1 and E-2) would meet all of the identified project needs with less severe social, economic, and environmental impacts. 2.1.1.2 Alternative W-1A Alternative W-1A was developed as part of an expanded look at alternatives in 2013 and included in the ASDD. One change to Alternative W-1 from the initial Scoping Document (SD)/SDD was the addition of a direct connection from Co. 7 to US 53 and extensive intersection improvements at Co. 7/Co. 101, MN 37/Co. 7, and MN 37/existing US 53. This alternative was not carried forward for further consideration in the Draft EIS since other Build Alternatives (i.e., M-1, E-1A, and E-2) would meet all of the identified project needs with less severe social, economic, and environmental impacts. 2.1.1.3 Alternative W-2 Alternative W-2 provided a shorter route than Alignment W-1 by diverting from MN 37 at the railroad corridor, running parallel to the railroad line, and connecting to Co. 7 north of Co. 101. It was eliminated from further consideration because, while reducing overall length, the use of new alignment would result in greater construction costs and more acres of right-of-way acquisition. 2.1.1.4 Alternative W-3 Alternative W-3 paralleled existing railroad corridors and did not use the Co. 7 corridor, in effect creating a new highway corridor parallel to Co. 7 between MN 37 and US 169. It was eliminated from further consideration because, while reducing overall length, the use of new alignment would result in greater construction costs and more acres of right-of-way acquisition. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS 2.1.1.5 Alternative W-4 (Two Options – “A” and “B”) Unlike the other West Corridor alternatives, Alternative W-4 used existing Co. 101 from US 53 through the communities of Eveleth and Leonidas to connect to Co. 7 and turn north toward Virginia. Due to the urbanized character of the corridor in Eveleth, two options were considered for the Scoping review. ■ W-4A (two lanes through Eveleth): This alternative was eliminated from further consideration because it only partially meets the project Purpose and Need. In addition, it would not substantially decrease social, economic, and environmental impacts as it would have substantial direct impacts within Eveleth, so there was no reason to retain this alternative as an approach to avoid adverse impacts. ■ W-4B (four lanes through Eveleth): This option was eliminated from further consideration because the expansion of Co. 101 to a four-lane facility through Eveleth would cause substantial community impacts for right-of-way, property relocations, and business access. This route, like the other West Corridor alternatives, would have negative impacts to access in Virginia and would not provide the benefit of avoiding conflict with ferrous resources as would other West Corridor alternatives. Additionally, Co. 101 crosses the existing UTAC permit to mine area and environmental setting boundary, and the mine operator has indicated that it would likely close Co. 101 to through traffic at a future time (estimated by 2024) when it resumes mining in this area. 2.1.2 Middle Corridor Alternative 2.1.2.1 Alternative M-2 Similar to Alternative M-1, Alternative M-2 followed the grade created by the now backfilled Auburn Pit through the UTAC mine. Alternative M-2, however, provided an option that would re-join existing US 53 closer to 2nd Avenue. This alternative was not carried forward for further consideration because its conflict with ferrous resource reserves greatly increased anticipated business impacts and related potential compensation and legal costs/risks. Furthermore, Alternative M-2 had many transportation performance and construction cost similarities to Alternative M-1 and did not avoid the potential for mine business risks. Therefore, the extra expense for the additional ferrous resource reserve conflict was not warranted. 2.1.3 East Corridor Alternatives 2.1.3.1 Alternative E-1 Alternative E-1 was the closest of the East Corridor alternatives to the existing alignment. It would maintain that straight east-west route, cross the Rouchleau Pit at one of its widest locations, and then turn south near the existing Landfill Road in order to connect back to US 53. Alternative E-1 was not carried forward for further consideration because of the potential for mine air quality compliance concerns (compared to other East Corridor alternatives), higher right-of-way costs due to conflicts with the existing UTAC permit to mine area and environmental setting boundary, and potential construction costs due to crossing the widest portion of the Rouchleau Pit. A permit to mine means legal approval has been given by the commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources to conduct a mining operation. The only permit to mine boundary (extent of permit limits) within the study area is issued to UTAC as the mine operator and is shown in Figure 2.1-2. Obtaining a permit to mine for a new mine operation requires an environmental evaluation and mining plan. Any non-mining activity proposed within the permit to mine area would potentially be in conflict with mining operations and deemed a potential business impact to the mine operator and landowner. The environmental setting boundary is beyond the permit to mine area and includes additional areas that may be directly or indirectly affected by mine activity. It is the boundary most closely aligned with the area leased by the mine operator. Therefore, the term “permit to mine” is used when describing the area of mine operations, and the term “environmental setting boundary” is used when referring to the broader, legal limits of the UTAC mine. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS 2-2 2.1.3.2 Alternative E-2A Alternative E-2A is a sub-alternative of Alternative E-2. A section of Alternative E-2 north of MN 135 was shifted further to the east in an attempt to completely avoid any encumbrance of ferrous resources and/or mining exploration (non-ferrous metallic resource leases) at the edge of the permit to mine boundary, Biwabik Iron Formation, and mineral rich stockpiles along Landfill Road. Moving the alignment further to the southeast would encroach upon the Iron Range Off-Highway Vehicle Recreation Area (OHVRA) to a greater extent than Alternative E-2, isolating a large portion of the recreation area that would be difficult to mitigate. As such, it was not carried forward for further study in the Draft EIS since it was anticipated to result in substantial impacts to the OHVRA while providing no identifiable benefits over Alternative E-2. 2.1.3.3 Alternative E-3 Alternative E-3 was similar to Alternative E-2; the primary difference was that Alternative E-3 provided a longer route to make the curve from the Midway area back into Virginia. This alternative was not carried forward for further consideration because it offered relatively few benefits compared to Alternative E-2 and would generally require more construction costs or more complex right-of-way acquisition due to greater conflicts with privately owned lands and minerals. 2.1.3.4 Alternative E-4 This was the only East Corridor alternative that did not reuse the existing 2nd Avenue interchange. Instead of connecting back to US 53 at 2nd Avenue, this alternative was routed to the north side of Virginia, where it used the 9th Street North corridor. It was not carried forward for further consideration for reasons that include the impacts to business access and community cohesion, as well as high construction costs. Potential direct impacts to Virginia’s water supply were also a concern. 2.2 Alternatives Studied in the Draft EIS and Dismissed The Draft EIS evaluated the three Build Alternatives (Alternatives M-1, E-1A, and E-2) and two No Build Alternatives (Existing US 53 Alternative and No Build Alternative). These alternatives are shown on Figure 2.2-1 and are described in detail in the Draft EIS. The Draft EIS identified Alternative E-2 with the Interchange Option as the preferred alternative, carrying forward both the Straight Option and the Curved Setback Option for further refinement. (Alternative E-2 options are described in Section 2.3 below.)The alternatives dismissed in favor of the preferred alternative are described below. Section 10.3.2 of the Draft EIS provides a more detailed discussion on the rationale for rejecting the following alternatives. 2.2.1 No Build Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Closed) The No Build Alternative responded to the easement terms by closing the segment of US 53 within the existing easement agreement area, resulting in traffic being rerouted to existing highways. Signage would have been used to officially mark the rerouting of US 53, which would follow existing MN 37, Co. 7, and US 169 (see Figure 2.2-2). No transportation systems management (TSM) elements (i.e., maintenance or operation improvements) were included in this alternative in order to represent a true No Build Alternative and because TSM improvements on the existing roadways would not provide the needed traffic capacity given the closure of the existing easement agreement area. The No Build Alternative was evaluated as the “do nothing alternative” because it was required for comparison to other alternatives. It was not identified as the preferred alternative since other Build Alternatives (i.e., M-1, E-1A, and E-2) met all of the identified project needs with less severe social, economic, and environmental impacts. 2.2.2 Existing US 53 Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Remains Open) The Existing US 53 Alternative, though not in compliance with the terms of the existing easement agreement, kept US 53 in place and open to traffic by addressing the economic, legal, and engineering September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS issues associated with resolving the terms of the existing easement agreement. The State of Minnesota would not have vacated US 53 but would have kept the highway open (Figure 2.2-3). The Existing US 53 Alternative had substantially greater uncertainty and cost than any of the Build Alternatives; therefore, it was not selected as the preferred alternative. 2.2.3 Alternative M-1 All of the Build Alternatives considered in the Draft EIS assume construction of a new four-lane US 53 alignment. Alternative M-1 was routed through the active UTAC mine. From south to north, this alternative departed from existing US 53 approximately at Cuyuna Drive in the Midway area of Virginia. Approximately one mile of new four-lane roadway would have been constructed to mostly follow the grade created by the partially-backfilled1 Auburn Pit through the UTAC mine. As shown on Figure 2.2-4, the new alignment connected back to existing US 53 approximately 1,000 feet east of the existing 12th Avenue traffic signal. Alternative M-1 had substantial feasibility issues and resulted in severe negative mine operation impacts that were not offset by the benefits in minimization; therefore, it was not identified as the preferred alternative. 2.2.4 Alternative E-1A Alternative E-1A was routed through the UTAC permit to mine and environmental setting boundaries, north of existing US 53 (see Figure 2.2-5). This alternative was added through the amended Scoping process described in Section 2.2 of the Draft EIS. From south to north, this alternative departed from existing US 53 just north of Cuyuna Drive. The alignment crossed MN 135 between the existing US 53 interchange and Bourgin Road. The new alignment continued parallel to Bourgin Road before turning to the northwest to cross the Rouchleau Pit along an existing submerged haul road embankment.2 After crossing the pit, the alignment turned to the southwest to reconnect with existing US 53 near 2nd Avenue. The road cross section was assumed to be constrained across the Rouchleau Pit (four lanes with a two-foot wide median barrier). Two construction design options for crossing the Rouchleau Pit were evaluated for this alternative. The first was a reinforced soil slope (RSS) causeway/fill section (RSS Option). The second option was a bridge crossing of the pit (Bridge Option). Both options followed the existing submerged haul road across the Rouchleau Pit. RSS Option The Alternative E-1A RSS Option had feasibility issues and resulted in severe schedule and constructability impacts (i.e., it was unlikely to meet the timeline due to dewatering, with substantial risks for additional delays due to weather, mine waste fill, and design requirements to mitigate constructability concerns) that were not offset by the benefits in minimization of environmental impacts; therefore, it was not identified as the preferred alternative. Bridge Option The Alternative E-1A Bridge Option had feasibility issues and resulted in severe negative schedule impacts (i.e., it required the greatest construction effort to meet the timeline, with substantial risks for delays due to weather, mine waste fill, and design requirements to mitigate constructability concerns) that were not offset by the benefits in minimization of environmental impacts; therefore, it was not identified as the preferred alternative. 1 Backfilled material is from local sources within the mine boundary. 2 Backfilled material in this haul road is from local sources within the mine boundary. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS 2.3 Selection of Alternative E-2 as the Preferred Alternative The Draft EIS identified Alternative E-2 with the Interchange Option as the preferred alternative, based on a variety of construction, cost, environmental, social, and economic factors, including mining operations and effects to the local economy. The Draft EIS reported that both the Straight Option and the Curved Setback Option were being carried forward for further refinement and that the selected option would be identified in the Final EIS. The Straight Option has since been identified as the selected option based on public and agency comments received during the Draft EIS comment period (see Chapter 11: Responses to Comments on the Draft Environmental Impact Statement), refinement of the design, and overall environmental impacts. The preferred alternative is shown in Figure 2.3-1. The reasoning used in selecting this alternative is described in Section 2.3.2. Chapter 8 of the Draft EIS (Consultation and Coordination) provides more information on agency and stakeholder involvement in the selection process. 2.3.1 Description of the Preferred Alternative (Alternative E-2) Alternative E-2 is routed around the UTAC permit to mine and environmental setting boundaries. The following details for this alternative reflect refinements that have occurred since the Draft EIS, including a refined area of evaluation (with areas added for staging, snow storage, and a trail connection), selection of the Straight Option, agency coordination, and additional design detail. 2.3.1.1 Alignment From south to north, Alternative E-2 generally follows existing US 53 from the south end of the Midway area to the MN 135 exit ramp for the start of new four-lane construction. As shown in Figure 2.3-1, the new alignment then continues on a northeasterly track on the present day Landfill Road corridor before turning to the west to cross over the Rouchleau Pit. Upon crossing the pit, Alternative E-2 turns to the southwest following an abandoned railroad corridor that runs between the pit and residential neighborhoods before reconnecting to existing US 53 at 2nd Avenue. MnDOT will remove all road facilities, such as pavement, bridges, and storm sewer, within the existing easement agreement area, and all utilities will be relocated by the utility operators. Areas of roadway that will be removed are shown in Appendix B. Two alignment options were considered for Alternative E-2 between Midway and roughly MN 135. Both options extend from Mesabi Drive on the south end to approximately the point where the Mesabi Trail crosses existing Landfill Road just north of the MN 135. The Straight Option, the westerly route that closely follows existing US 53 and the exit ramp to MN 135, has been selected as the preferred option. This option minimizes new disturbance by following existing roads to the extent possible. It shifts east slightly just south of MN 135 to avoid UTAC’s permit to mine/environmental setting boundary. This option also has less wetland impact than the Curved Setback Option. The Curved Setback Option shifted east of existing US 53, similar to the alignment of Alternative E-1A south of MN 135. The purpose of this option was to facilitate staging of project construction and to minimize or potentially avoid encroachment on the mine setback from the road, shifting the alignment to the east at least 300 feet. The actual alignment shift exceeded 300 feet to also minimize impacts to the wetland that is located between US 53 and the Curved Setback Option alignment. This option was dismissed due to the greater wetland and right-of-way impacts, public and agency input, and the ability of the Straight Option to avoid the permit to mine boundary. 2.3.1.2 Local Access The 2nd Avenue access will be converted from the existing partial interchange to an at-grade intersection. The existing 2nd Avenue interchange does not allow for turns from southbound US 53 to 2nd Avenue or from 2nd Avenue to northbound US 53. The new 2nd Avenue intersection will provide access to and from US 53 in all directions and will be signalized (intersection geometry shown in Figure 2.3-2). September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS The intersection access for MN 135 at US 53 will include, a compressed diamond interchange to provide full access between US 53 and MN 135, as shown in Figure 2.3-3. Access to Landfill Road will be maintained with a new at-grade connection approximately one-half mile north of the new US 53/MN 135 intersection. A median break in the US 53 corridor will allow for access to Landfill Road for travelers from both directions on US 53. Access to the Midway neighborhood at Cuyuna Drive will be modified to a right-in/right-out only access by closing the median break at that location. A new median break will be constructed at Vermillion Drive to provide southbound traffic reasonable access into the Midway area. This new access point will provide improved sight distance and safety in this area. Southbound access out of Midway will be restricted to Bourgin Road (no median opening at Cuyuna and restricted median at Vermillion). 2.3.1.3 Design Features The preferred alternative includes a constrained highway cross section in the following locations: ■ Between the MN 135 interchange and the new Landfill Road access ■ Between the new Landfill Road access and 2nd Avenue, approximately one mile (5,500 feet) long, in order to reduce the potential impacts along the west side of and across the Rouchleau Pit The constrained cross section assumes median and outside barriers and steep side slopes (Figure 2.3-4). East of the Rouchleau Pit a continuation of the existing cross section from the south is planned. The new Landfill Road access median break will be located outside of the constrained cross section. The US 53 median at Landfill Road will provide a refuge for vehicles making turning movements across US 53. The preferred alternative uses a bridge to cross the Rouchleau Pit. The pit is approximately 250 feet deep at the crossing location, and the bridge will span approximately 1,100 feet with 180-foot or taller bridge piers within the pit (a cross section of the proposed bridge is shown on Figure 4.4-1). As final design commences, design for the bridge will consider seismic effects of mining related blasting operations. 2.3.1.4 Project Elements Added Since the Draft EIS Additional project elements have been added to the preferred alternative since the publication of the Draft EIS as described below. ■ Southern Project Limit Extended: The Draft EIS identified the southern project limit for Alternative E-2 to be located between Cuyuna Drive and Vermillion Drive. MnDOT has identified an additional property, not under RGGS or MnDOT ownership, that the existing US 53 crosses over. This parcel extends between Cuyuna Drive south to approximately Mesabi Drive. The project limit has been extend to include acquisition of the portion of this parcel that the road lies within in order to secure the existing road right-of-way in perpetuity (see Figure 4.2-2). ■ Midway Area Access Change: As described in Section 2.3.1.2, the Cuyuna Drive median break on US 53 was identified as an existing traffic conflict point with poor sight distance. This project creates the opportunity to improve that condition. MnDOT will close the median at Cuyuna Drive, limiting that access point to a right-in/right-out only intersection. A new restricted median opening on US 53 at Vermillion Drive will be constructed to provide southbound traffic access into the Midway area. The southern project limit was therefore extended to Bourgin Road. ■ Mesabi Trail Connection: A segment of the existing Mesabi Trail that is on St. Louis and Lake Counties Regional Railroad Authority (SLLCRRA) easement on privately owned land (RGGS) will be impacted by expanded mine activity (not by MnDOT), which would sever the trail between its segments east and west of the mining area. During development of the US 53 relocation project, RGGS/UTAC and SLLCRRA expressed interest in relocating the Mesabi Trail concurrent with the construction of the new US 53 alignment to minimize impacts to trail users. Since the Draft EIS was published, there has been further coordination between MnDOT, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR), and SLLCRRA regarding the future Mesabi Trail September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS alignment. MnDOT has made allowance for the future Mesabi Trail to parallel the new road alignment between the new Landfill Road access and the existing trail segment west of the Rouchleau Pit (see Figure 2.3-1). Figure 4.4-1 illustrates the accommodation of trail use within the US 53 bridge cross section. With this accommodation, there would still be a gap in the trail between the new and old Landfill Road access points. Accommodating a trail connection along the new US 53 alignment between the new and old Landfill Road access point to fill this gap would have substantial impacts as the US 53 alignment in this section is severely constrained by elevation, the OHVRA boundary, existing drainageways, and mineable lands. SLLCRRA has identified an old railroad corridor under its ownership that crosses through the OHVRA and could be used make a connection between the Landfill Road end of the trail accommodated on the US 53 and the existing trail within the OHVRA, a distance of approximately 2,100 feet (see Figure 2.3-1). SLLCRRA has surface rights to the rail corridor and is willing to realign the trail to this location. This Mesabi Trail connection segment would be constructed by MnDOT but funded by state bonds through SLLCRRA. Even though the impact of the mine expansion to the Mesabi Trail would not be caused by MnDOT, an evaluation of this short segment of new trail to connect the bridge and the existing Mesabi Trail has been added to the Final EIS in order to facilitate trail continuity between the severed trail sections that would result from mining activity in the easement agreement area. ■ Potential Staging Areas Identified: Although staging areas are typically identified by the contractor, given the time sensitivity of this project, the known need for construction staging near the bridge crossing of the pit, and the difficulty that the pit topography poses, MnDOT has identified four areas for evaluation that the contractor may use for construction staging and access to the pit. One of these four areas will then be used as a snow storage area, as described below. The combined size of the two staging areas west of the Rouchleau Pit is approximately one acre, and the staging area south of the pit approximately two acres. These areas were previously disturbed by mining activities and have recently been cleared of vegetation and used for access to the pit for various data gathering and testing activities. The staging and snow storage areas are shown in Figure 2.3-1, and evaluation of potential impacts are documented in the Final EIS under respective topic areas. ■ Snow Storage Area Identified: In order to minimize winter road runoff from the constrained sections of the new roadway, MnDOT has identified an area that will be used for dumping snow from road plowing/clearing maintenance activities after project construction is complete. This area is approximately nine acres in size and is located approximately 0.8 miles northeast of the road alignment on the west side of Landfill Road in a previously disturbed area (Figure 2.3-1). It is also identified for potential use as a staging area during construction. 2.3.1.5 Area of Evaluation The Draft EIS defined an “area of evaluation” for each of the Build Alternatives. These areas of evaluation were based on general design assumptions, estimated construction limits, the potential for additional right-of-way needs, and other design factors, and were used to evaluate physical impacts where ground disturbance was likely to occur under one or more construction option. For Alternative E-2, the Draft EIS included an area of evaluation that was widened across the Rouchleau Pit in areas where there was potential for design adjustments. It was determined that, due to the consistent vegetation/cover type within the widened area of evaluation, impacts would be similar regardless of where the alignment would be oriented within the widened area. To calculate potential impacts without overestimating them due to the widened area of evaluation, a corridor averaging 150-300 feet wide (representative of a standard four-lane undivided roadway) was assumed. Since the Draft EIS, the area of evaluation has been refined to represent estimated construction limits of the refined preferred alternative. As a result, the reported impacts changed for some resources, and for others no noticeable change is noted as the refined design is consistent with the assumptions of the Draft EIS impact area (i.e., a corridor width representative of a standard four-lane undivided roadway). September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS 2.3.2 Rationale for Selection The Draft EIS identified Alternative E-2 as the preferred alternative based on its ability to meet the project Purpose and Need and minimize impacts to social, economic, and environmental resources, and on the basis of a number of technical and cost considerations, as described below. As identified in the Draft EIS, the Interchange Option was selected for the preferred alternative over the Intersection Option. These options have similar social and environmental impacts; however, the Interchange Option will maintain the current access provided at US 53 and MN 135 and will provide safer approach grades from the east (two percent compared to six percent with an intersection), resulting in less potential for semi-truck/vehicle conflict. This reduction in grade will also reduce the earthwork and rock cut quantities required for construction. After publication of the Draft EIS, the Straight Option was selected (over the Curved Setback Option) as part of the preferred alternative based on public and agency comment, refinement of the design, and less environmental impact. The Curved Setback Option would have greater impacts than the Straight Option as follows: ■ One additional parcel impacted by right-of-way acquisition ■ Two additional acres of wetland impacts ■ 10 additional acres of forest impact The Straight Option will have no greater impact than the Curved Setback Option to any resource. Benefits of the preferred alternative include: ■ Mineral Rights: Avoids the permit to mine/environmental setting boundary ■ Business Risks: Has no risk for air quality compliance to impact mine operations ■ Water Supply: Avoids the major dewatering that would be required for the Alternative E-1 RSS Option ■ Wetlands: Has fewer wetland impacts than Alternative E-1A and Alternative M-1 ■ Noise: Noise walls are preliminarily cost effective at affected residential locations ■ Right-of-Way: Impacts the fewest number of parcels of any Build Alternative ■ Engineering and Constructability Considerations: ■ Shorter bridge than the Alternative E-1A Bridge Option ■ Only two pier foundations required, compared to up to eight for the Alternative E-1A Bridge Option ■ Less work required to construct in the water/ice of the Rouchleau Pit ■ Avoids 40 mph curve needed for Alternative E-1A ■ Has a better sight distance northbound from the bridge to the 2nd Avenue traffic signal than Alternative E-1A ■ Piers to be constructed in less than 30 feet of mine waste fill as compared to Alternative E-1A that would have up to 100 feet of mine waste fill ■ Schedule: Has the least schedule risk due to engineering constructability considerations noted above as well as considerations related to owner and operator property interests ■ Cost: Costs significantly less than the Existing US 53 Alternative and Alternative M-1, and the upper range of the cost estimate is less than that for either the Alternative E-1A RSS Option or Bridge Option The negative effects of this alternative are less than other alternatives evaluated, and include: ■ Mineral Rights: More mineral encumbrance than Alternative E-1A; requires greater impact to School September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS Trust land and, therefore, has potential for greater impact to Vermillion Gold, Inc.’s lease than Alternative E-1A ■ Section 4(f): Impacts the OHVRA; however, the impact is negligible and meets the definition of de minimis ■ Vegetation/Cover Types: Impacts more acres of forest than other alternatives; however, impacts to wildlife are negligible and MnDOT has committed to conducting tree clearing outside of the summer roosting season for the northern long eared bat per US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) recommendation ■ Unknowns: Requires additional geotechnical characterization at pier locations September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS EASTERNCORRIDOR Virgini 53£¤ 169 MIDDLE Mountain Iron CORRIDOR 135 Gilbert £¤ 467 Leonidas 57 37 U101 Eveleth V 53 £¤ a WESTERNCORRIDOR SEPTEMBER 2015 Iron Junction 37 ± 0 5,000 10,000 Feet Figure 2.1-1 Studied Corridors US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final Environmental Impact Statement £¤ 169 Alternative W-1A Alternative E-4 VIRGINIA Alternative E-3 £¤ 53 Alternative E-1 MOUNTAIN IRON 135 Alternative M-2 GILBERT £¤ 64 LEONIDAS 775 U101 EVELETH V Alternative W-4 Alternative W-2 53 Alternative E-2A SEPTEMBER 2015 IRONJUNCTION Alternative W-3 Alternative W-1 37 3,000 6,000 Feet ±0 Source: Permit to Mine Boundary and Environmental Setting Boundary (DNR) LegendAlternatives Dismissed During 2012 UTAC Environmental Setting Boundary Figure 2.1-2 Scoping Process Municipalities Alternatives Dismissed During Scoping Alternatives Dismissed During 2013 Amended Scoping Process US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth UTAC Permit to Mine Boundary Final Environmental Impact Statement 3,000 6,000 Feet ±0 Source: Environmental Setting Boundary (DNR) Legend Figure 2.2-1 All Alternatives Studied No Build Alternative Alternative E-2 Existing US 53 Alternative UTAC Environmental Setting Boundary in the Draft EIS Alternative M-1 Municipalities US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Alternative E-1A Final Environmental Impact Statement VIRGINIA £¤ 169 £¤ 53 MOUNTAIN IRON 135 £¤ GILBERT 37 64 LEONIDAS 775 U101 EVELETH V 53 SEPTEMBER 2015 IRONJUNCTION 37 3,000 6,000 Feet ±0 LegendExisting US 53 Easement Agreement Area Figure 2.2-2 No Build Alternative No Build Alternative Biwabik Iron Formation US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Municipalities Final Environmental Impact Statement 750 1,500 Feet ± 0 Source: USGS Aerial 2009 LegendExisting US 53 Alternative Figure 2.2-3 Existing US 53 Easement Agreement Area Existing US 53 Alternative Existing Mesabi Trail US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Existing School Trust Land Final Environmental Impact Statement 750 1,500 Feet ±0 Source: USGS Aerial 2009 Legend Figure 2.2-4 Existing Public Recreation Land Alternative M-1 Area of Evaluation Alternative M-1 Existing US 53 Easement Existing School Trust Land Agreement Area US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Existing Mesabi Trail Final Environmental Impact Statement Note: A 200-400 foot wide corridor was assumed for impact calculations reported in the Draft EIS. 750 1,500 Feet ±0 Source: USGS Aerial 2009 Legend Existing Mesabi Trail Existing US 53 Easement Alternative E-1AArea of Evaluation Existing Public Recreation Land Agreement Area Existing School Trust Land Figure 2.2-5 Alternative E-1A US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final Environmental Impact Statement 800 1,600 Feet ±0 Source: USGS Legend Aerial 2009 Preferred Alternative Staging Areas Construction Limits Snow Storage/Staging Area Realigned Mesabi Trail Existing Access Roads Proposed Mesabi Trail Existing Public Recreation Land Connection Existing US 53 Easement Agreement Area Existing Mesabi Trail Figure 2.3-1 Preferred Alternative (Alternative E-2) US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final Environmental Impact Statement SEPTEMBER 2015 ±Not to Scale Source: Traffic Analysis Technical Report (2013) Fi 2nd Avenue gure 2.3-2 Intersection US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final Environmental Impact Statement SEPTEMBER 2015 MN 135 Figure 2.3-3 Interchange US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final Environmental Impact Statement Existing US 53 Cross Section Proposed Constrained Cross Section Without Trail SEPTEMBER 2015 Figure 2.3-4 Existing and Proposed Typical Cross SectionsUS Highway 53 Virginia to EvelethFinal Environmental Impact Statement Source: SEH Layout 11/27/20123.0 Transportation Analysis The US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) (December 2014) is incorporated by reference and is considered part of the Final EIS. Parts of Chapter 3 from the Draft EIS that relate to the preferred alternative are repeated here, but it has been abbreviated. 3.1 Changes Since the Draft EIS There have been no changes in the project setting or regulatory context or new technical studies since the Draft EIS that affect the transportation analysis. Changes in the project (described in Section 2.3.1.) that are relevant to the transportation analysis include the Midway area access change and the addition of the Mesabi Trail connection. MnDOT will close the median at Cuyuna Drive, limiting that access point to a right-in/right-out only intersection. A new restricted median opening on US 53 at Vermillion Drive will be constructed to provide southbound traffic access to the Midway area. This median break will not allow left-turn movements from Vermillion Drive onto US 53. Access to southbound US 53 from the Midway area will be restricted to Bourgin Road. This median change will not change the results of the traffic analysis. MnDOT has made allowance for the future Mesabi Trail to parallel the new road alignment between the new Landfill Road access and the existing trail segment west of the Rouchleau Pit. With this accommodation, there would still be a gap in the trail between the new and old Landfill Road access points. The St. Louis and Lake Counties Regional Railroad Authority (SLLCRRA) has identified an old railroad corridor under its ownership that crosses through the Iron Range Off-Highway Vehicle Recreation Area (OHVRA) and could be used to make a connection between the Landfill Road end of the trail accommodated on US 53 and the existing trail within the OHVRA, a distance of approximately 2,100 feet (see Figure 2.3-1). SLLCRRA has surface rights to the rail corridor and is willing to realign the trail to this location. The trail segment will be constructed by MnDOT but funded by state bonds through SLLCRRA. 3.2 Impacts of the Preferred Alternative 3.2.1 Traffic Volumes Daily traffic volumes for the preferred alternative are expected to be similar to the traffic volumes on the existing easement segment, shown on Figure 3.1-1. An at-grade intersection at US 53 and 2nd Avenue will increase access to US 53 over what is currently provided by the partial interchange at this location. Specifically, access to northbound US 53 from 2nd Avenue and to 2nd Avenue from southbound US 53 are movements that are not currently provided but will be provided with an at-grade intersection. At MN 135 and US 53 the preferred alternative will provide free-flowing access for all movements as is provided under existing conditions. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS 3.2.2 Traffic Operations Operational analysis of the existing US 53 corridor showed that the forecasted traffic volumes will be accommodated by a four-lane divided roadway and operate at acceptable level of service (LOS).1 It is assumed that the preferred alternative, which is a four-lane roadway, will also provide acceptable LOS. At 2nd Avenue the preferred alternative will have a three-legged intersection.2 Replacing the existing interchange with an at-grade intersection will introduce two movements that do not currently exist (access to northbound US 53 from 2nd Avenue and access to northbound 2nd Avenue from southbound US 53). A sensitivity analysis completed for this intersection found that operations are acceptable until peak hour turning movement volumes reach 600 vehicles. At this volume, the intersection would operate at LOS C, with some movements experiencing LOS F. Higher levels of turns may require dual left turn lanes for southbound US 53; however, turning volumes of that magnitude are not seen at adjacent intersections and are not expected at this location. At US 53 and MN 135, the interchange proposed as part of the preferred alternative will result in an acceptable LOS, both at project opening (2017) and in the future design year (2037) (Table 3.1-1). A compressed diamond interchange configuration will operate at acceptable LOS (LOS A or LOS B) at the ramp terminal intersections (see Table 3.1-1). Table 3.2-1. Intersection Level of Service – Year 2017 and 2037 2017 LOS Intersection and Volume Assumptions AM (PM)  2037 LOS AM (PM)  MN 135/US 53 Compressed Diamond InterchangeA  SB Exit Ramp Terminal NB Exit Ramp Terminal  A (A) B (B)  A (A) B (B)  2nd Avenue Intersection  2nd Avenue and US 53 (200 vehicles assumed for unknown turning volumes)  B (B)  B (C)  2nd Avenue and US 53 (400 vehicles assumed for unknown turning volumes)  C (C)  C (C)  2nd Avenue and US 53 (600 vehicles assumed for unknown turning volumes)  C (D)  D (F; with dual left turn lanes: D)  A As unsignalized intersections, the LOS shown is the LOS of the worst case approach at the intersection. 3.2.3 Travel Times Travel times for existing conditions and the preferred alternative were calculated based on the posted speed limits for all routes. Potential delays due to congestion or rail crossings were not accounted for in the calculations. Travel times for the four scenarios listed below were developed. ■ Regional Travel: travel time from just south of the southern MN 37 interchange to 18th Street north of Virginia via US 53 (via MN 37/Co.7 for the No Build Alternative) ■ Eveleth to Virginia: travel time to/from the intersection of Grant Avenue (Co. 302) and Pierce Street in Eveleth to Chestnut Street and 4th Avenue in downtown Virginia ■ Gilbert to Virginia: travel time to/from the intersection of MN 37 and MN 135 in Gilbert to the intersection of Chestnut Street and 4th Avenue in downtown Virginia ■ Interregional Travel: travel time from Duluth to International Falls via US 53 (via MN 37/Co.7 for the No Build Alternative) 1 Roadway operations were estimated using a Level of Service (LOS) measure that is based on the amount of congestion experienced by motorists. Congestion is rated from A to F, with LOS A representing free flow with no congestion and LOS F representing high levels of congestion with very long delays and slow speeds. The LOS D/LOS E boundary was used as the US 53 performance measure for LOS. 2 A three-legged intersection is an intersection with three approaches. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS Travel times will generally be slightly higher than travel times today on US 53 due to delay at the additional signalized intersection at 2nd Avenue and due to minor increases in distance; however, this delay will not be substantial (approximately one to three minutes), as shown in Table 3.2-1. Table 3.2-1. Travel Time for the Preferred AlternativeA Scenario  Distance (miles)  Travel Time (minutes)  Regional Travel  From MN 37 (South Interchange) to Virginia  10.7 (+1.5)  14.5 (+2.8)  From Virginia to MN 37 (South Interchange)  10.7 (+1.5)  14.5 (+2.8)  Eveleth to Virginia  From Eveleth to Virginia  6.4 (+1.4)  12.8 (+2.6)  From Virginia to Eveleth  6.4 (+1.4)  11.9 (+3.5)  Gilbert to Virginia  From Gilbert to Virginia  6.2 (+1.3)  10.7 (+2.2)  From Virginia to Gilbert  6.2 (+1.3)  10.2 (+2)  A Access to Chestnut Street and 4th Avenue was assumed via 2nd Avenue to 4th Street within Virginia. Note: Numbers in parentheses indicate additional time compared to the existing condition. Inter-regional travel times will be only slightly increased with the addition of a signalized intersection in place of the existing interchange at 2nd Avenue. Using delays reported in the detailed intersection analysis, the average delay for through traffic on US 53 due to the addition of a signalized intersection, depending on the direction and time of day, ranges from one to two minutes in the 2037 peak hours. Considering the total inter-regional corridor between Duluth and International Falls is 163 miles, around three hours if a 55 mph average is used, the worst-case incremental increase in delay represents a one percent increase in total inter-regional travel time. 3.2.4 Access MnDOT will close the median at Cuyuna Drive, limiting that Midway area access point to a right-in/rightout only intersection. A new restricted median opening on US 53 at Vermillion Drive will be constructed to provide southbound traffic access to the Midway area. This median break will not allow left-turn movements from Vermillion Drive onto US 53. Access to southbound US 53 from the Midway area will be restricted to Bourgin Road. This median change will not change the results of the traffic analysis. MnDOT identified a sight distance and safety concern (high crash rates) at the Cuyuna Drive area and decided it needed to correct this issue while this segment of road was being reconstructed. It held several meetings with the city of Virginia and residents to discuss access options, since closing the median at Cuyuna Drive would limit the Midway are to one full access to/from US 53. New median breaks were considered at several locations between Cuyuna Drive and Bourgin Road, Some lining up with existing streets and others mid-block. Mid-block options were met with opposition due to new impacts to residents (such as light glare from turning vehicles). Points south of Vermillion Drive were already being served by the Bourgin Road median break. The compromise solution was to break the median at Vermillion Drive for southbound US 53 traffic only, to allow reasonable access to businesses between Vermillion and Cuyuna Drives. This access change is not expected to result in any noticeable changes to traffic patterns in this area. 3.2.5 Safety The existing US 53 corridor from MN 37 (East) to 12th Avenue experienced a higher than expected number of crashes during snowy or icy conditions in 2007 to 2011. Under the preferred alternative, traffic volumes and road capacity will not change. MnDOT will continue implementation of its weather-related safety changeable message signs. In addition, an epoxy-chip friction course will be added to the bridge surface and a Road Weather Information Station (RWIS) will be replaced to help MnDOT monitor weather and roadway surface conditions in the project area. A 42-inch tall concrete barrier will separate roadway traffic from trail users on the bridge. The median modification in the Midway area will improve sight distance for turning movements to/from the Midway area. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS 3.2.6 Intermodal Transportation 3.2.6.1 Bicycles and Pedestrians MnDOT’s action of vacating its US 53 easement segment (just southwest of the Rouchleau Pit), through which the Mesabi Trail runs, will not directly impact the Mesabi Trail, which has its own separate easement. Potential trail impacts by others are discussed in Chapter 7: Cumulative Impacts. The termination of the MnDOT easement by RGGS/UTAC does not directly affect the Mesabi Trail. The preferred alternative will cross the existing Mesabi Trail at several locations. MnDOT will grant a permit along the eastern edge of the new alignment (between the new Landfill Road access and the trail on the west side of the Rouchleau Pit) to accommodate the realigned Mesabi Trail (to be reconstructed as part of the project but funded by state bonds through SLLCRRA (see Section 4.4 for more details)). East of Landfill Road, the trail connection described in Section 2.3.1.4 and Section 3.1, which is on an existing abandoned rail corridor owned by SLLCRRA, will link to the existing Mesabi Trail within the OHVRA. This alignment allows for a continued connection of the trail between Virginia and the OHVRA for pedestrians, bicycles, and snowmobiles. 3.2.6.2 Bus Transit While introducing slightly longer travel distance (approximately 1.3 to 1.5 miles) and travel times, the preferred alternative will have a minor impact on the existing transit service that is offered within the study area. 3.2.6.3 Rail Existing railroad lines and crossings will not be impacted by the preferred alternative. 3.2.6.4 Aviation The preferred alternative will not impact the Eveleth-Virginia Airport located southeast of Eveleth (Figure 1.0-1) or substantially increase local travel time to/from the airport. 3.2.6.5 Other Transportation Modes The preferred alternative will have a minor (approximately two to 3.5 minutes) increase to the travel times of school buses or emergency service vehicles. 3.3 Mitigation Measures There will be no adverse effects on traffic volumes, traffic operations, travel times, or safety due to the preferred alternative; therefore, no mitigation is proposed. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS SEPTEMBER 2015 2009 AADT Segment To Duluth 2017 AADT Figure 3.1-1Existing and Forecast Traffic Volumes on US 53 4-Lane Highway 2037 AADT Source: Traffic Analysis Technical Report (2013)Stream 2-Lane Highway Railroad 0 0.5 1 Miles US Highway 53 Virginia to EvelethFinal Environmental Impact Statement County / Local Road Community and Social Analysis The US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) (December 2014) is incorporated by reference and is considered part of the Final EIS. Parts of Chapter 4 from the Draft EIS are repeated here, but it has been abbreviated to focus only on the preferred alternative and what has changed since the Draft EIS. 4.1 Changes Since the Draft EIS There have been no changes in the project setting or regulatory context or new technical studies since the Draft EIS that affect the community and social analysis. Changes in the project are described in Section 2.3.1. Each of the following sections describes changes since the Draft EIS specific to the resource being evaluated, impacts of the preferred alternative, and mitigation measures for the preferred alternative. 4.2 Right-of-Way 4.2.1 Changes Since the Draft EIS Related to Right-of-Way The areas of right-of-way to be acquired have been refined since the publication of the Draft EIS. As the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) enters into negotiations with property owners, minor changes in the acreage to be acquired from the identified parcels for right-of-way may continue to occur. As the design of the preferred alternative has been refined, the following additional parcels have been identified as needing to be acquired: ■ One total parcel acquisition by the 2nd Avenue interchange (Parcel 15; relocation required) ■ One partial parcel acquisition (surface rights) near Midway (Parcel 206; no relocation required) ■ Total acquisition of Parcel 27 for the snow storage area located approximately 0.8 miles northeast of the road alignment on the west side of Landfill Road (Parcel 27) ■ Partial acquisition of a parcel owned by the St. Louis and Lake Counties Regional Railroad Authority (SLLCRRA) (Parcel 20) that lies within the existing Landfill Road right-of-way One parcel, Parcel 14, was identified in the Draft EIS as a total acquisition without a relocation. This parcel will require a relocation. Two commercial parcels identified in the Draft EIS as partial and total acquisitions (Parcels 24 and 207, respectively) will no longer be impacted by the preferred alternative. The following additional parcels will have permanent easements obtained for project use (see Table 4.2-2). A permanent easement is an agreement giving a designated party other than the landowner the right to use the property for a specific purpose in perpetuity. ■ The two staging areas and associated access road on the west side of the Rouchleau Pit ■ The staging area on the south side of the Rouchleau Pit (if used, this easement would be obtained by the contractor and, therefore, is not included in Table 4.2-2) Table 4.2-2 also lists a number of temporary easements that will be obtained for construction. The proposed Mesabi Trail connection is located within a parcel owned by SLLCRRA and will remain under its ownership for the new trail segment. These additional areas of acquisition or easement are shown in Figure 4.2-1. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS 4.2.2 Impacts of the Preferred Alternative Property Impacts (Surface) The preferred alternative will acquire 203 acres for right-of-way and setbacks, plus an additional six acres in temporary easements, requiring five total parcel acquisitions and three commercial relocations as shown in Tables 4.2-1 and 4.2-2. Permanent parcel impacts are shown in Figure 4.2-2. Included in the total impact is 44.6 acres of right-of-way in School Trust lands (Parcel 18). This includes approximately 5.7 acres of Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) lands within the Iron Range Off-Highway Vehicle Recreation Area (OHVRA) (see Section 4.4 for more details on the impact to the OHVRA). Table 4.2-1.

These negotiations are being informed by the in-progress studies (estimates of in-situ non-ferrous and ferrous resources) noted in the Draft EIS. The property to be acquired for most of the new road right-of-way will be from edge of shoulder to edge of shoulder of the new roadway, plus 100 feet beyond each shoulder. Property adjacent to the shoulders and back 100 feet on each side provides a minimum mining setback distance from the road and an area for slopes, utilities, noise walls, ditches, ponds, and signage. Wider mining setbacks may be required at the sides of the road adjacent to future active mining. Around the bridge, the permanent easement will extend a maximum of 580 feet on either side of the centerline to account for seismic activity and protect the integrity of the structure (based on a minimum bridge setback and pier stability analysis). These distances are dependent on the final design of the road and will be included in the negotiation process with each landowner. The preferred alternative alignment has been modified slightly in the area of the Straight Option to avoid the mine’s permit to mine boundary, thus minimizing the setback impact to the mine in this area. The preliminary design has also aligned the bridge such that the impact to the permit to mine boundary near 2nd Avenue has been minimized to the extent practicable. As a result, the impact to future mine operation has been further minimized from what was described in the Draft EIS. 4.2.3 Mitigation Relocations will be conducted in accordance with the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (Uniform Act) and its amendments. Two booklets entitled Relocation: Your Rights and Benefits and the Guidebook for Property Owners have been produced by MnDOT to provide information to property owners and persons to be displaced on their rights and benefits under the Uniform Act, including the Relocation Assistance Program. These documents are available from the MnDOT Office of Land Management. The right-of-way acquired for the project will be a permanent solution commensurate with the transportation investment. Mineral rights will be acquired for lands within the Biwabik Iron Formation to preserve the roadway in perpetuity, and all easements within the formation will place all relocation responsibilities on the owner, not MnDOT. If a contractor chooses to pursue temporary easements for staging areas not identified in this Final EIS, standard erosion control and site management best management practices (BMPs) will also apply to those areas. 4.3 Economic and Business 4.3.1 Changes Since the Draft EIS Related to Economic and Business There have been no changes since the Draft EIS that affect the economic and business analysis that was conducted. The changes in the project definition that have occurred since the Draft EIS have been considered and the following conclusions have been drawn: ■ The total acquisition of two additional parcels (Parcels 15 and 27) will not change the local economy, especially given that MnDOT will work to relocate the businesses within Virginia ■ The relocation of the business on Parcel 14 will not change the local economy, especially given that MnDOT will work to relocate this business within Virginia ■ The location of staging areas are temporary during construction and will not affect businesses ■ The acquisition of surface rights from Parcel 206, which is already in roadway use, does not change September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS its current function ■ The Mesabi Trail connection maintains a recreational connection between Gilbert and Virginia and will benefit downtown businesses ■ The closure of the median break at Cuyuna Drive may affect access to businesses along US 53. However, an alternate access will be constructed at Vermillion Drive for southbound traffic to access the businesses in the Midway area. 4.3.2 Impacts of the Preferred Alternative Areawide Economic Impacts The preferred alternative will have no measurable economic impact as a result of changes in travel times as compared to the existing condition. From an economic standpoint, the time differences are not substantial enough to change behavior. Road closures for blasting will occur at a frequency similar to the existing condition. There are a variety of property types, including commercial, industrial, and residential, in the area around the 2nd Avenue interchange, and this location provides an important connection to the east side of Virginia. The new at-grade access will offer full access to 2nd Avenue from both directions versus the current partial access. This added accessibility will be beneficial to the properties at the south end of 2nd Avenue and elsewhere in Virginia. Mine Operation Impacts The preferred alternative presents a conflict with future access to ferrous resources, as it skirts the north and south edges of the permit to mine boundary, resulting in potential mining setbacks from the new road alignment. However, it is outside of the existing UTAC permit to mine boundary. The preferred alternative also has potential to present a conflict with non-ferrous metallic resource exploration and mining of resources such as gold. Vermillion Gold, Inc. has a lease with the State of Minnesota to explore for, mine, and remove non-ferrous metallic resources near the alignment on School Trust land. The potential for a non-ferrous metallic resources mining business, and its configuration (open or underground mining), has not been identified; however, the potential for mineral resource recovery conflicts with the preferred alternative is recognized. MnDOT has evaluated the potential quantity and quality of ferrous and non-ferrous metallic resources within the path of the preferred alternative for property negotiation purposes. The results of this analysis can be made public after negotiations and the acquisition are complete. The preferred alternative is located outside the northeastern edge of the existing permit to mine boundary. Based on the location of the alignment relative to future mining activities and UTAC’s business risk assessment, the preferred alternative is not expected to result in a business risk to the existing mine operations due to the applicability of ambient air quality regulations. 4.3.3 Mitigation The preferred alternative does not avoid the future potential conflict with known ferrous resources or nonferrous mineral reserves owned by the State of Minnesota School Trust and by private interests. MnDOT has conducted a series of borings along this alignment to estimate the amount and quality of ferrous resources that are present along Landfill Road. These borings have confirmed that ferrous resources are at least 200 to 400 feet west of Landfill Road, which indicates that most of the ferrous resources will remain accessible with this alternative. Mining beyond the current permit to mine limits to the north cannot be predicted; none of the nearby mine owners or operators have this area identified in their current mining plans, and, therefore, this area is not likely to be mined for a number of decades unless a substantial shift occurs in market demand. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS 4.4 Public Park, Recreational, Wildlife Management, and Section 4(f)/6(f) Lands 4.4.1 Changes Since the Draft EIS Related to Public Park, Recreational, Wildlife Management, and Section 4(f)/6(f) Lands Recreational Lands All but one of the additional areas added to the project are located outside of recreational lands. These areas include the staging areas, snow storage area, and Parcels 15 and 206. Therefore, these areas do not impact parkland resources. The other area added to the project since the Draft EIS, the Mesabi Trail connection, is bordered by the OHVRA but is not part of the OHVRA. It has been confirmed that SLLCRRA owns the surface rights to this parcel, which is an old railroad corridor (see Appendix A for certificate of title). The DNR owns the mineral rights under the SLLCRRA parcel. Since the Draft EIS was published, there has been further coordination between MnDOT, DNR, and SLLCRRA regarding the future Mesabi Trail alignment and all-terrain vehicle (ATV) and snowmobile use of the trail. MnDOT will grant a permit along the eastern edge of the new alignment (between the new Landfill Road access and the trail on the west side of the Rouchleau Pit) to accommodate the realigned Mesabi Trail (to be reconstructed as part of the project but funded by state bonds through SLLCRRA). The trail on the bridge will be a 14-foot wide shared use trail for pedestrians and snowmobiles. The design will not preclude ATV use in the future. The Mesabi Trail connection leading to/from the bridge will be 24 feet wide, with an eight foot paved surface for pedestrians and bicycles, and a 14 foot unpaved surface for snowmobiles. See Figure 4.4-1 for a typical cross section of the road with the trail. This combined road/trail section will be constructed (trail funded by state bonds through SLLCRRA) on the new alignment between Landfill Road and the west end of the bridge. To complete the connection to the Mesabi Trail to the east, a solution outside the new road right-of-way was needed in order to not increase Section 4(f) impacts to the OHVRA (see Section 4.4.2.2 for a description of Section 4(f)). The new road alignment between MN 135 and the new Landfill Road access is severely constrained by the OHVRA boundary, existing drainageways, mineable land, and elevations. SLLCRRA identified an old railroad corridor under its ownership that crosses through the OHVRA and could be used to make a connection between the Landfill Road end of the trail accommodated on US 53 and the existing trail within the OHVRA, a distance of approximately 2,100 feet. SLLCRRA has surface rights to the rail corridor and is willing to realign the trail to this location. The trail segment will be constructed by MnDOT. This land provides a better connection to the trail without additional OHVRA impacts and has few trees within its 100-foot width. A portion of the land has an overhead power line that runs along its edge. Two box culverts are also planned to be constructed by MnDOT as part of this project to provide grade separation for the Mesabi Trail crossing at MN 135 and at Landfill Road. This Mesabi Trail connection will maintain access between Gilbert and Virginia for snowmobiles but will not connect to Eveleth. MnDOT continues to cooperatively work with SLLCRRA and the DNR as they work to define alternate snowmobile connections to Eveleth. Connections to Eveleth would be constructed by SLLCRRA. Section 4(f) Resources The OHVRA is the only Section 4(f) resource impacted by the proposed project. There has been a slight increase to the OHVRA impact as a result of refinement of the right-of-way and setback needed in this area. The OHVRA impact is 5.7 acres for the preferred alternative, compared to the 4.3 acre and 5.1 acre impact identified for Alternatives E-2 and E-1A, respectively, in the Draft EIS. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS 4.4.2 Impacts of the Preferred Alternative The preferred alternative will impact the existing Mesabi Trail, the Trail Hawks Snowmobile Club Trail Spur, and the OHVRA (see Figure 4.4-2). Recreational Lands The preferred alternative will cross over the existing Mesabi Trail (both on School Trust land and on private land) and the existing Trail Hawks Snowmobile Club Trail Spur. However, these trails will both be realigned as described in Section 4.4.1.1 (see Figure 4.4-2). Section 4(f) Resources The OHVRA has been determined to be a Section 4(f) resource under the 1966 Department of Transportation (DOT) Act (49 USC 303, 23 USC 138).1 None of the recreational resources impacted by the project have received Land and Water Conservation Fund Act (LAWCON) funds and, therefore, are not subject to provisions of Section 6(f) of the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act. Impacts to the OHVRA, the only impacted Section 4(f) resource, will total 5.7 acres on the westernmost edge of the designated public use area (see Figure 4.4-3). Table 4.4-1 summarizes the potential impacts of the preferred alternative to parkland resources. Table 4.4-1. Impacts of the Preferred Alternative to Public Park, Recreation, and Trail Resources Mesabi Trail on Public Land  Crosses the existing trail alignment near MN 135 and Landfill Road  Mesabi Trail on Private Land  Crosses the existing trail alignment on west side of the Rouchleau Pit  Trail Hawks Snowmobile  No change to trail spur; 2nd Avenue interchange bridges removed over  Club Trail Spur  trail  OHVRA – Virginia Site (east  Strip take associated with right-of-way acquisition along Landfill Road  of Landfill Road)A  (5.7 acres); negligible impact to OHVRA activities, features, or attributes  A Determined to be a Section 4(f) resource 4.4.3 Mitigation Recreational Lands MnDOT will provide a trail permit along east side of a portion of the road for the Mesabi Trail and snowmobile use (funded by state bonds through SLLCRRA). As the Mesabi Trail and Trail Hawks Snowmobile Club Trail Spur will be realigned and reconnected, as described above, no mitigation for the project’s impacts to these existing trails is required. While impacts to snowmobile trail connections to Eveleth would result from mining expansion (not MnDOT’s project) and therefore no mitigation is required, MnDOT continues to work with SLLCRRA and others to find alternate snowmobile trail connections to Eveleth. Section 4(f) Resources For the Section 4(f) impact to the OHVRA, FHWA sent notice of its intent to make a de minimis determination regarding this project to the DNR in a letter dated January 28, 2014. The DNR concurred with the proposed de minimis determination in a letter dated February 5, 2014, based on proposed construction limits. Three comments were received on FHWA’s intent to make a de minimis determination 1 In January 1983, as part of an overall reorganization of the DOT Act, Section 4(f) was amended and codified in 49 USC Section 303. However, the regulation is more commonly known as “Section 4(f).” September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS during the public comment period on the Draft EIS; all agreed with FHWA’s intent. The final determination by FHWA is included in the Record of Decision. 4.5 Cultural Resources 4.5.1 Changes Since the Draft EIS Related to Cultural Resources Since the publication of the Draft EIS, a snow storage area and Mesabi Trail connection outside of the cultural resources study area have been added as part of the preferred alternative. The other staging areas that have been identified were covered by the previous cultural resources analysis, and no resources were identified in those areas. The MnDOT Cultural Resources Unit (CRU) made a determination that no historic properties will be affected by the snow storage area or the Mesabi Trail connection, and the Minnesota State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) concurred (see correspondence in Appendix C). A summary of the cultural resources analysis conducted in the Draft EIS is summarized below with the addition of the findings regarding the snow storage and Mesabi Trail connection areas. 4.5.2 Impacts of the Preferred Alternative The cultural resources survey, evaluation, and effects analysis was conducted in compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (as amended) and its implementing regulations, 36 CFR 800. This act requires that impacts to historic properties, defined as those listed in, eligible for listing, or potentially eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), be considered before implementation of a federal undertaking. MnDOT expects to obtain federal funds for the project. Therefore, it is considered a federal undertaking and must comply with the act and its regulations. The Area of Potential Effect (APE) for archaeological resources was determined by the MnDOT Cultural Resources Unit (CRU), with concurrence from SHPO, to include the area extending 200 feet on either side of the Alternative E-2 centerline. One historic site was deemed eligible for the NRHP, the South 5th Avenue West Boulevard site. No other eligible architectural resources or archaeological sites were identified within the APE. The preferred alternative will not be visible or cause other direct or indirect effects upon the South 5th Avenue West Boulevard site. MnDOT CRU made a determination of no historic properties affected for Alternative E-2, and SHPO concurred. There will also be no Section 4(f) impact to historic resources due to the preferred alternative. 4.5.3 Mitigation The preferred alternative will have no impacts to NRHP-eligible resources. Therefore, mitigation measures will not be necessary. 4.6 Land Use 4.6.1 Changes Since the Draft EIS Related to Land Use There have been no changes since the Draft EIS that affect the land use analysis that was conducted. The changes in the project definition that have occurred since the Draft EIS (described in Section 2.3.1) have been considered, and the following conclusions have been drawn: ■ The total acquisition and relocation of Parcels 14 and 15 will change the parcel land use from commercial to right-of-way ■ The location of staging areas are temporary during construction and will not affect long term land use September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS ■ The acquisition of surface rights from Parcel 206, which is already in roadway use, does not change its current use ■ The Mesabi Trail connection maintains a recreational connection to Virginia and is consistent with the intended use of the parcel ■ The closure of the median break at Cuyuna Drive may affect access to businesses along US 53. However, an alternate access will be constructed at Vermillion Drive for southbound traffic to access the businesses in the Midway area and, therefore, land use is not expected to change. Sections 4.6.2 and 4.6.3 summarize the information reported in the Draft EIS for the preferred alternative. 4.6.2 Impacts of the Preferred Alternative The preferred alternative will introduce a new transportation corridor in the area near the existing US 53/MN 135 interchange and through the Rouchleau Pit. In the area northeast of the US 53/MN 135 interchange, the land uses surrounding the alignment and existing Landfill Road will not change as this land is owned by the State of Minnesota, is part of the OHVRA, and under management by the DNR. Additionally, the presence of the Rouchleau Pit and surrounding mineral resources anticipated to be mined in the future generally limit development potential around this portion of the alignment. The area west of the Rouchleau Pit and east of 2nd Avenue will be subject to right-of-way acquisition necessary to accommodate the new highway. As described in Section 4.2, four total parcel acquisitions are anticipated in this area. The potential for other land use changes in the 2nd Avenue area is limited, as access will be retained with limited impacts to existing conditions for surrounding properties. The preferred alternative is not expected to cause noticeable change in land use within the study area. It is not anticipated to lead to the development of any large scale commercial, industrial, residential, or other development. The project is consistent with local and/or regional comprehensive plans. 4.6.3 Mitigation No mitigation is necessary. 4.7 Environmental Justice 4.7.1 Changes Since the Draft EIS Related to Environmental Justice There have been no changes since the Draft EIS that affect the environmental justice analysis that was conducted. The added staging areas, snow storage site, and the Mesabi Trail connection are not located near any known low income or minority populations. 4.7.2 Impacts of the Preferred Alternative Low-income and minority populations were not identified along the preferred alternative corridor. The preferred alternative is not anticipated to have a direct or indirect impact on environmental justice populations. 4.7.3 Mitigation There will be no disproportionately high or adverse effects to environmental justice populations due to this project; therefore, no mitigation is required. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS 4.8 Social, Neighborhood, and Community Facility Impacts 4.8.1 Changes Since the Draft EIS Related to Social, Neighborhood, and Community Facility Impacts There have been no changes since the Draft EIS that affect the analysis that was conducted to determine social, neighborhood, and community facility impacts. The added staging areas and snow storage site will not impact any community facilities or connections between communities. The added Mesabi Trail connection will benefit community connectivity by restoring the Mesabi trail section that will be severed by future mining activities. The median closure at Cuyuna Drive in the Midway area has the potential to reduce accessibility to this part of the city; however, an alternate median access will be constructed at Vermillion Drive that will serve the same access function in a safer location. Sections 4.8.2 and 4.8.3 summarize the information reported in the Draft EIS for the preferred alternative. 4.8.2 Impacts of the Preferred Alternative Virginia The preferred alternative will provide a connection similar to the existing one between the downtown/Ridgewood areas and the Midway neighborhood. The intersection at 2nd Avenue will be modified to an at-grade, full access intersection. The new median break at Vermillion Drive will maintain access to the Midway area and provide a safer access location. ISD 706 bus routes will be modified to accommodate the different connection point between the two sections of US 53, but, overall, no major connectivity issues are anticipated. The change in fire and police response to the Midway section of the city will be minimal due to the location of the preferred alternative in relation to the existing US 53 alignment. The full access improvements at 2nd Avenue and the location of the northern connection to existing US 53 will maintain access for emergency response to transport from the Midway neighborhood to Essentia Health-Virginia. Eveleth The preferred alternative will not change the direct connection between Eveleth and Virginia’s downtown/Ridgewood areas. It will not impact the bus movements for ISD 2154 between Eveleth, Gilbert, and Leonidas. The full access improvements at 2nd Avenue and the location of the connection to existing US 53 will maintain access for emergency response to transport from Eveleth to Essentia Health-Virginia. Gilbert The preferred alternative will not change the direct connection between Gilbert and Virginia’s downtown/Ridgewood areas. It will not impact the bus movements for ISD 2154 between Eveleth, Gilbert, and Leonidas. The full access improvements at 2nd Avenue and the location of the connection to existing US 53 will provide better access for emergency response to transport from Gilbert to Essentia Health-Virginia. Mountain Iron The preferred alternative will not impact the connection between the US 169 area of Mountain Iron and the Midway neighborhood of Virginia. These alternatives will not impact the bus movements for ISD 712 between Mountain Iron, Buhl, and Kinney. These alternatives will not impact the movement of fire and emergency response between Virginia and Mountain Iron, as the fire and emergency response stations are located within the downtown area of Virginia. Leonidas The preferred alternative will not remove the direct connection between Leonidas and Virginia’s downtown area. It will not impact the bus movements for ISD 2154 between Eveleth, Gilbert, and September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS Leonidas. The change at 2nd Avenue and the location of connecting the existing US 53 in the downtown area will provide better access for emergency response to transport from Leonidas to Essentia Health-Virginia. 4.8.3 Mitigation No mitigation is required. 4.9 Visual and Aesthetic Impacts 4.9.1 Changes Since the Draft EIS Related to Visual and Aesthetic Impacts Since the publication of the Draft EIS, a Visual Quality Review Committee was formed. There are 10 committee members, representing the Laurentian Chamber of Commerce, the City of Virginia, the Iron Range Resources Rehabilitation Board (IRRRB), Cliffs Natural Resources, local businesses, and residents of Virginia, and the committee is led by MnDOT staff. The committee provided input on the visual quality aspects of the project in the areas of the US 53/MN 135 interchange, the bridge crossing the Rouchleau Pit, and the 2nd Avenue intersection. The committee met five times between January and June 2015 and produced visual quality guidelines to be used during final design. The changes in the project definition that have occurred since the Draft EIS (described in Section 2.3.1) have been considered, and the following conclusions have been drawn: ■ The total acquisition and relocation of Parcels 14 and 15 will change the views from the 2nd Avenue neighborhood with the removal of three commercial buildings ■ The location of staging areas are temporary during construction and will not affect long term views ■ The acquisition of surface rights from Parcel 206, which is already in roadway use, does not change views in this area ■ The Mesabi Trail connection maintains a recreational connection to Virginia and is consistent with the intended use of the parcel. Views from this new trail segment will be similar to the removed trail segment with views of trees and open space. ■ The closure of the median break at Cuyuna Drive and the new median break at Vermillion Drive will be a changed condition but will not substantially change the view to/from the roadway. The change in traffic pattern may result in observation of more traffic on Mesabi Drive between Cuyuna and Vermillion Drives. Sections 4.9.2 and 4.9.3 summarize the information reported in the Draft EIS for the preferred alternative. 4.9.2 Impacts of the Preferred Alternative Visual impacts are the perceived changes in visual quality of an existing scene. The discussion of visual impacts is structured according to three environments: natural environment, cultural environment, and highway environment. MnDOT guidance for assessing the degree of visual impact provides three criteria that may be used: ■ Value of a visual impact (beneficial, adverse, or unchanged) ■ Scale of impact (minor or major) ■ Extent of impact (localized or widespread) Natural Environment Crossing the Rouchleau pit will represent a minor change to that existing scene, as there are few views of the scene available currently. Open lands to the east of the pit will also have views of the new highway corridor and the large bridge structure spanning the pit. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS Cultural Environment By retaining existing access location points at 2nd Avenue and MN 135, there are no impacts to views of and from the adjacent residential and commercial areas of US 53. Highway Environment An assumed constrained cross section, including median barriers and barriers on both sides of the roadway, for US 53 through the Rouchleau Pit will have a minor, localized impact on views of the highway environment for users of US 53. The interchange at US 53/MN 135 will result in similar pavement area as today but with a new configuration that otherwise follows a similar alignment. 4.9.3 Mitigation No adverse visual and aesthetic impacts are anticipated as a result of the preferred alternative; therefore, no mitigation is required. The visual quality guidelines produced by the Visual Quality Review Committee will be used during the final design process. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS 800 1,600 Feet ±0 Source: USGS Aerial 2009 LegendPreferred Alternative Existing Mesabi Trail Additional Right-of-Way Acquisition Public Recreation Land Existing Access Roads Existing US 53 Easement Agreement Area Realigned Mesabi Trail Proposed Mesabi Trail Connection Figure 4.2-1 Additional Areas of Acquisition US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final Environmental Impact Statement SEPTEMBER 2015 ±  0  800  1,600 Feet  LegendParcel Boundaries City of Virginia (Parcels 4 & 8) RGGS (Parcels 17 & 27) State of Minnesota School Trust (Parcel 18)  Preferred Alternative Permanent Parcel Impacts Connected Parcels  Figure 4.2-2 Permanent Parcel Impacts US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final Environmental Impact Statement Proposed Constrained Cross Section with Trail Proposed Constrained Cross Section on Bridge SEPTEMBER 2015 Figure 4.4-1 Proposed Cross Sections with TrailUS Highway 53 Virginia to EvelethFinal Environmental Impact Statement 800 1,600 Feet ±0 Source: USGS Aerial 2009 LegendPreferred Alternative Proposed Mesabi Trail Connection Construction Limits Existing Mesabi Trail Staging Areas Existing Trail Hawks Snowmobile Snow Storage/Staging Area Club Trail Spur Existing Access Roads Existing School Trust Land Realigned Mesabi Trail Public Recreation Land Figure 4.4-2 Parks, Trails, and Section 4(f)Resources US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final Environmental Impact Statement Source: USGS Aerial 2009 Legend Existing Mesabi Trail Figure 4.4-3 OHVRA Impact Proposed Right-of-Way Limits Existing School Trust Land OHVRA Impact RealignedMesabiTrail OHVRA US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Proposed Mesabi Trail Connection Draft Environmental Impact Statement 5.0 Physical and Environmental Analysis The US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) (December 2014) is incorporated by reference and is considered part of the Final EIS. Parts of Chapter 5 from the Draft EIS are repeated here, but it has been abbreviated to focus only on the preferred alternative and what has changed since the Draft EIS. Water resources-related issues are discussed in a number of sections in this chapter, including 5.2 Utilities, 5.3 Water Supply, 5.4 Waterbody Modification, 5.5 Wetlands, and 5.6 Surface Water/Water Quantity and Quality. 5.1 Changes Since the Draft EIS There have been no changes in the project setting since the Draft EIS that affect the previous physical and environmental analyses. There has been one change in the regulatory context for threatened and endangered species, which is discussed in Section 5.12. There have been additional technical studies for noise, proposed threatened species, contamination, wetlands, and geotechnical investigation, which are discussed in Sections 5.8, 5.12, 5.13, and 5.15, respectively. Changes in the project are described in Section 2.3.1. In the Draft EIS, impacts were calculated based on the area of evaluation for each alternative. These “areas of evaluation” were defined based on general design assumptions, estimated construction limits, potential additional right-of-way needed for stormwater management and other related transportation functions, and other design factors. In the following sections, impacts for the preferred alternative have been recalculated based on refined construction limits, and include staging areas, a snow storage area, and a Mesabi Trail connection, which were not evaluated in the Draft EIS. Each of the following sections describes changes since the Draft EIS applicable to the resource being evaluated, impacts of the preferred alternative, and mitigation measures for the preferred alternative. 5.2 Utilities 5.2.1 Changes Since the Draft EIS Related to Utilities The additional areas added to the project (staging areas, snow storage area, and Mesabi Trail connection) do not require any changes to utilities. The Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) has continued coordination with the utility owners regarding the preferred alternative design, schedule, and right-of-way. Meetings were held in December 2014 and March, April, May, June, and July 2015 with the utility owners to discuss these topics. Owners were notified that they needed to let MnDOT know whether they wish to be accommodated on the new bridge (excluding gas) by May 1, 2015. As of the date of this document, the utilities listed below will be included on the bridge: ■ Mediacom: one four-inch duct ■ City of Virginia: water and sewer ■ Virginia Department of Public Utilities (VPU): one six-inch duct for potential future power/electrical lines ■ Enventis: one four-inch duct September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS Paul Bunyan Rural Telephone Cooperative (Paul Bunyan Communications) and CenturyLink plan to move out of the right-of-way completely. Minnesota Power also plans to relocate its facilities out of the existing easement agreement area but may have some power/electrical lines in the new right-of-way. Northeast Services Cooperative is one utility owner that is located along Co. 7, Co. 101, and Landfill Road but is not located within the existing easement agreement area. They will relocate along Landfill Road when new right-of-way is available. Utility agreements will be executed in the fall of 2015 through early 2016. Utility owners have been asked to be out of the existing easement agreement area by summer 2016 or later as authorized by MnDOT. 5.2.2 Impacts of the Preferred Alternative There are two public and four private utility operators located within the existing easement agreement area of the US 53 corridor right-of-way. The utilities are located within US 53 right-of-way by way of revocable permits issued by MnDOT. The applicable terms of all such permits make each utility responsible for costs and management of its facilities along the highway, including within the RGGS-owned existing easement agreement area. Therefore, MnDOT and RGGS are under no obligation to provide for utility relocations or other accommodations. MnDOT’s proposed action is driven by the RGGS existing easement agreement area terms, which require MnDOT to relocate US 53 from the existing easement agreement area. As a result, the direct impact to the utilities within this existing easement agreement area is the termination of the easement and subsequent termination of the utility permits. As such, MnDOT has initiated the termination notice process. MnDOT notified each of the utilities described in this section (in letters dated May 4, 2012) of the US 53 project background and stated that all utilities must relocate from the existing easement agreement area by October 2016. All utilities in the existing easement agreement area except gas lines may be accommodated on the bridge across the Rouchleau Pit. Although MnDOT’s Utility Accommodation Policy cites that under certain conditions gas lines may be accommodated on bridges, it is not recommended for this project because of the high risk a gas line poses to bridge workers and the traveling public due to the proximity to mining activity. The placement of a gas line on a high profile bridge, such as is proposed for the preferred alternative, poses homeland security concerns that would be difficult to mitigate with the level of gas line system monitoring that would be necessary. 5.2.3 Mitigation The impact to utilities within the existing easement agreement area is not caused by the US 53 relocation project; rather, it is the result of the termination of easement rights by RGGS and UTAC. However, the planning and technical assistance provided through the US 53 EIS process aimed to minimize adverse impacts to utilities caused by the termination of the easement by providing opportunities for utilities to relocate within the preferred alternative. 5.3 Water Supply 5.3.1 Changes Since the Draft EIS Related to Water Supply With the refinements in the design of the preferred alternative since the Draft EIS, MnDOT has identified potential temporary construction staging areas needed for placement of the bridge piers and superstructure in/over the Rouchleau Pit. These areas are previously disturbed and will not impact the Rouchleau Pit. Localized dewatering will be needed for pier construction. The pier style, depth, and other design details will be determined as part of final design, which will continue through August 2015. The snow storage area is located approximately 0.8 miles from the Rouchleau Pit, northeast of the road alignment on the west side of Landfill Road. During a snow event, snow will be plowed onto the shoulders. After the snow event, snow will be loaded into trucks and hauled off the bridge and the constrained September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS northbound section between Landfill Road and the bridge, then piled on the snow storage site. Runoff from this snow storage area will be filtered through infiltration and surface features before reaching the Rouchleau Pit. The temporary staging areas will have erosion control best management practices (BMPs) installed to ensure no runoff from disturbed areas flows untreated to the pit. 5.3.2 Impacts of the Preferred Alternative The preferred alternative will cross the Rouchleau Pit, which is the water supply source for Virginia and the ArcelorMittal Mine. The preferred alternative has the potential to impact the Virginia Inner Emergency Response Area due to turbidity from bridge construction. The City’s intake system is located approximately 0.6 miles north of the alignment. ArcelorMittal’s intake is located approximately 1.2 miles from the alignment, and, given its distance from the alignment, is not anticipated to experience turbidity impacts from the preferred alternative. 5.3.3 Mitigation BMPs, as identified within the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP), will be implemented by MnDOT to minimize the amount of turbidity generated by the project within the Rouchleau (Mesabi) Pit water supply. The City will continue to monitor for turbidity levels and, if thresholds are exceeded, will implement additional treatment to comply with the US Environmental Protection Agency’s (USEPA) Disinfectants and Disinfection Byproduct Rule (71 FR 388). If any fill is needed, specifications for the source and nature of the fill used within the Virginia Inner Emergency Response Area will be utilized to avoid the potential for contamination impacts to the water supply. These specifications will prohibit the use of taconite tailings as fill within the Rouchleau Pit. 5.4 Waterbody Modification 5.4.1 Changes Since the Draft EIS Related to Waterbody Modification There have been no changes since the Draft EIS that affect the information presented on waterbody modification. Sections 5.4.2 and 5.4.3 summarize the information reported in the Draft EIS for the preferred alternative. 5.4.2 Impacts of the Preferred Alternative The preferred alternative will cross the Rouchleau Pit by bridge, minimizing the impact to the waterbody by avoiding most activity below the water line. Disturbance (excavation, pilings, etc.) within the waterbody will be limited to construction of bridge piers and abutments. Pier and abutment locations will be designed to minimize impacts (localized fill) on the pit and waterbody to the extent feasible. Only localized, temporary dewatering will be required during pier/abutment construction. Water from temporary construction dewatering will be routed through a sediment basin and back into the Rouchleau Pit. 5.4.3 Mitigation The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) is authorized to issue a General Permit (19970005) that authorizes temporary appropriations including dewatering for construction activities. Additionally, the required NPDES permit via the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) will include a SWPPP that will describe the BMPs to be implemented as part of the project to protect water quality during and after construction. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS 5.5 Wetlands 5.5.1 Changes Since the Draft EIS Related to Wetlands As described in Section 5.1, the areas evaluated for wetland impacts have been refined since the Draft EIS. No wetlands were identified in any of the staging areas or snow storage area. Three small unregulated wetlands were identified within the Mesabi Trail connection. Additionally, a Level 2 wetland delineation was completed and approved by the appropriate agencies. A total of 80 wetland basins comprised of a variety of wetland plant communities were found in the project area. Three deep-water pits were also identified in the project area, including the Rouchleau Pit – a deep, water-filled depression that has developed due to past mining activities. A summary of wetland and aquatic resources by wetland type is included in Tables 1 and 2 in Volume 2 of the permit application (see Appendix F). The detailed documentation of the Level 2 delineation is provided in the TH 53 Relocation Project Wetland Delineation Report (SEH, 2015) (available upon request). The wetland boundaries and report were reviewed in the field and approved by the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) on June 1, 2015. Correspondence since the Draft EIS regarding wetlands, boundary reviews, and/or approvals is summarized in Table 5.5-1, and documentation is included in Appendix F. Table 5.5-1.

The Section 404 permit application and September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS jurisdictional determination request has been submitted by MnDOT to the USACE, and it was public noticed by the USACE on March 24, 2015 for comments to be received through April 23, 2015. 5.5.2 Impacts of the Preferred Alternative There will be no impacts to regulated wetlands in the areas added since the Draft EIS (i.e., the staging areas, snow storage area, and Mesabi Trail connection). The Draft EIS described the alternatives analyzed for this project and the wetland impacts of each (Chapter 2 and Section 5.4.3, respectively). The preferred alternative had the least amount of wetland impact compared to other Build Alternatives (two to four acres less). Since the Draft EIS, final design details have developed, and the Level 2 wetland delineation has been completed. A permit application has been submitted to the USACE (Section 404), MPCA (Section 401 certification), and MnDOT (WCA LGU) for this project. Volume 1 (February 2015) of the application provided project background, sequencing, and preliminary impacts. Volume 2 (June 29, 2015) provides the Level 2 wetland boundaries and the revised impacts. In August 2015, a supplemental memo was submitted to the USACE with additional refinements to wetland impacts based on 60 percent design plans. These three documents are provided in Appendix F. All of these permits and approvals require documentation of sequencing, which is the evaluation of options for wetland avoidance, minimization, and mitigation. Sequencing information and other application details are included in Volume 1 of the permit application (see Appendix F). With the refined construction limits and Level 2 wetland boundaries included in the permit application (see Figures 4-1 through 4-17 included with the August 2015 memo in Appendix F), the total wetland and aquatic resource impact (permanent and temporary) is 15.49 acres, with 9.96 in WCA jurisdiction and 7.90 acres in USACE jurisdiction. Some wetlands are under the jurisdiction of both the WCA and USACE. A total of 2.27 acres of wetland impact is unregulated by the USACE and/or WCA primarily due to incidental/human induced/isolated wetland characteristics resulting from some form of prior disturbance (e.g., grading, excavation) and, therefore, is not subject to replacement requirements. Table 5.5-2 provides a summary of impacts. Detailed information can be found in Table 3 in the supplemental memo (see Appendix F). There are 27 USACE wetlands impacted, 13 of which are temporarily impacted (0.58 acres). There are 26 WCA regulated wetlands impacted, 10 of which are temporarily impacted (0.75 acres). These impacts include those associated with the removal of the roadway within the easement agreement area.  Table 5.5-2. Summary of Wetland Impacts of the Preferred Alternative (in acres) Impact Type  Total Wetland ImpactA  USACE Wetland Impacts  WCA Wetland Impacts  Unregulated Wetland Impacts  Temporary  1.58 (18 wetlands)  0.58 (13 wetlands)  0.75 (10 wetlands)  0.78 (3 wetlands)  Permanent  13.91 (45 wetlands)  7.90 (20 wetlands)  9.96 (20 wetlands)  1.49 (15 wetlands)  TOTAL  15.49 (57 wetlands)  8.48 (27 wetlands)  10.71 (26 wetlands)  2.27 (18 wetlands)  A Some wetlands have both temporary and permanent impacts and/or both WCA and USACE impacts; therefore, the total of the columns and rows may not be additive. 5.5.3 Mitigation The current minimum wetland replacement ratio for wetland credits is 1:1 for WCA regulated impacts and 1:1for USACE regulated impacts on MnDOT road projects in the northeast part of the state if replacement is in the same Bank Service Area (BSA) as the impact. If replaced outside the BSA, the ratio increases to 1.25for the USACE and 1.5 under the WCA. Discussions between MnDOT and the USACE have determined that the potential for wetland restoration is limited in the northeast and adjacent to the roadway corridor (bedrock, pit, mine dewatering); therefore, wetland replacement will be through use of wetland bank credits. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS The mitigation plan has not changed and existing wetland bank credit will be used. There are currently 32 acres of credit available in BSA 1. Wetland bank account number 1595 in the St. Louis River watershed and BSA 1 will be used to withdraw 9.96 acres of wetland credit. The replacement plan proposes mitigation for permanent impacts, for a total of 9.96 acres for WCA and 7.90 acres for USACE (see Table 5.5-3). Table 5.5-3. Proposed Wetland Mitigation Summary Agency  Estimated Regulated Permanent Wetland Impact  Mitigation Ratio  Credits Needed (acres)  MnDOT under WCA  9.96 acres  1:1  9.96  USACE  7.90 acres  1:1  7.90  5.6 Surface Water/Water Quantity and Quality 5.6.1 Changes Since the Draft EIS Related to Surface Water/Water Quantity and Quality Since the publication of the Draft EIS, impervious surfaces have been evaluated as part of final design. Surface water impacts and associated mitigation are summarized in Sections 5.6.2 and 5.6.3. A snow storage area has also been identified approximately 0.8 miles northeast of the road alignment, on the west side of Landfill Road. The site is disturbed and sparsely vegetated. A runoff barrier will be installed along the perimeter of the site (e.g., berm, J-barriers) to slow runoff from snow melt leaving the site. This site may also be used during construction, if needed. Similar perimeter treatment will be installed at the temporary staging areas to control runoff. The NPDES permit and associated SWPPP will detail specific BMPs to use in the respective areas of the site that will be disturbed. 5.6.2 Impacts of the Preferred Alternative With the preferred alternative, the existing ditch that flows parallel to and along the east side of US 53 will remain after MnDOT vacates the existing easement agreement area. See Chapter 7: Cumulative Impacts regarding cumulative stormwater impacts due to mining operations. MnDOT will collect and treat surface runoff from its roadway and will maintain off-site drainage patterns that currently cross the proposed alignment. The preferred alternative applies two typical sections along the alignment (see description in Section 2.3.1.3). A rural typical section is proposed where possible. In these areas, runoff will be directed from the roadway into grassed swales that are located within the approximately 40-foot center median and on each side of the roadway. This rural section is planned to extend from the south end of the project to the south end of the MN 135 interchange, at the Landfill Road intersection, and where the alignment transitions back to the existing alignment at the 2nd Avenue intersection. The constrained rock cut section at the east side of the bridge, which includes the portion where rock excavation will be required, also incorporates swales as a means for collection and conveyance. Manganika Lake is the ultimate receptacle of a portion of the stormwater runoff from US 53 in the existing condition, with the rest of the project area draining to landlocked basins, wetlands, or the Rouchleau Pit (after treatment) (Figure 5.5-2). According to the MPCA 2014 listing of impaired water bodies, Manganika Lake is currently listed as impaired due to excess nutrients, eutrophication, and biological indicators. Manganika Lake will be receiving similar runoff volume after the preferred alignment is constructed due to a small increase (three acres) in impervious surface coverage within the tributary area, which will be treated before discharging to the lake. As a result, the preferred alternative does not exacerbate the existing impairments prescribed by the MPCA. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS Once the existing alignment area between the Rouchleau and Auburn Pits is excavated as part of mining operations, stormwater runoff in the excavated area will be managed in conformance with UTAC’s Industrial Stormwater Permit requirements. MnDOT assessed the total dissolved solids and chloride concentrations in response to inquiries from UTAC. This assessment was limited by the information available, and a conservative approach was taken. Roadway areas were estimated and compared to the average salt application in tons per mile annually. An overall subwatershed delineation and hydrologic review was conducted to estimate the amount of water entering the Rouchleau Pit. This hydrologic review and analysis was also limited by the information available at the time. The result of this assessment was an estimate of milligrams per liter (mg/l) composition of sodium chloride (NaCl) and total dissolved solids (TDS) that could be present in the tributary area runoff volume. This assessment assumed that all applied salt will be dissolved into solution and made it to the pit, which is highly unlikely. Resulting values were 3.81 mg/l chlorine (Cl) for existing conditions, 16.95 mg/l prior to mining out the old road, and 13.39 mg/l after the existing road is mined out. Drinking water standards are 200 mg/l, and background Cl concentrations in forested areas are 15 to 30 mg/l. Chlorine was 0.7% of UTAC’s TDS. Since the assessment was completed, an area has been identified for snow storage that is 0.8 miles from the Rouchleau Pit. BMPs will be selected for the snow storage area to manage runoff. Since the snow collected and dumped at this location will be from the roads in the study area, the assessment will account for the salt that may be in the runoff from this snow storage area. 5.6.3 Mitigation A review of the impervious surface coverages for the existing and proposed conditions is being evaluated as part of final design. Based on the current assumptions for access roads, staging areas, and the Mesabi Trail connection, along with pavement removals, there will be a net increase of impervious surface of approximately three acres. Per NPDES requirements, treatment of stormwater is required for the net change in impervious surface area for the project. The constrained rock cut section refers to the roadway typical section proposed for the segment of roadway that will require rock cut, and spans from approximately ¼ mile north of the high point near Landfill Road to the bridge east approach panel. The rock cut section is unique in that the outer edge of the section is near a vertical rock face, whereas the other typical sections for this project are generally a rural ditch section with outer slopes matching existing grade. Stormwater quality treatment in the rock cut section is proposed in the form of two detention basins at each side of the preferred alignment immediately south of the bridge. The first basin serves as spill containment in the event of an incident that results in contaminant release into roadside ditches. The second basin will provide detention of surface runoff, with the goal of reducing the rate of discharge to the Rouchleau Pit. The bottom section of the downstream basin will consist of filtration media and will be lined to prevent percolation into the rock fissures below. No infiltration is permitted from the ponds because of geotechnical concerns about the unintended consequences of infiltration near the bridge abutment, most importantly the potential to destabilize rock used for structural anchoring of the bridge abutment. All project detention ponds are sized per the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Atlas 14 precipitation data per MnDOT’s recently changed design standard. Atlas 14 consists of updated precipitation data from weather stations nearest the project site and generally increases the design storm events for each frequency compared to previous rainfall intensity values. Additionally, detention ponds will be designed to meet the requirements of the NPDES permit, enforced via the MPCA’s Construction General Permit, for water quality treatment for the constrained section. For this segment of the alignment, per NPDES requirements, a permanent volume of approximately 0.9 acre-feet will be required. The size of the stormwater pond(s) will be approximately 0.4 acres in surface area. Per MPCA and National Urban Runoff Program (NURP) guidance, discharge may be limited to 5.66 cubic feet per second per acre of pond surface area for the water quality storm event, which is defined as the 0.3-year, 1.25-inch event (instant runoff volume). MnDOT will collect stormwater from the bridge, preventing it from draining directly into the Rouchleau Pit. There will be no deck drains on the bridge and no storm sewer. All bridge drainage will be conveyed along September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS the outside shoulder and part of the outside drive lane until it is collected at the downstream end for conveyance into the new proposed pond on the west side of the preferred alignment. The right-of-way identified will accommodate the proposed detention and filtration ponds. Surface runoff from the existing alignment will continue to travel to Manganika Lake until the area is excavated through mining operations. Stormwater reaches Manganika Lake by means of the channel (Manganika Creek) on the west side of the Auburn Pit (Figure 5.5-2). Potential stormwater treatment pond locations are all within existing or proposed right-of-way limits. While the roadway is being constructed, a SWPPP will be in place to prevent erosion and sedimentation from occurring that will negatively impact Manganika Creek. Construction activities for the preferred alternative will be consistent with typical roadway construction. Erosion and sediment control will be provided during construction in accordance with the requirements of the MPCA and NPDES. Permanent erosion and sediment control measures will be constructed along the alignment, such as filter berms that reduce channel flow velocity and permanent stabilization methods to reduce scour potential. MnDOT’s current design and maintenance practices include many BMPs, such as installing stormwater ponds, vegetated swales and disconnected impervious areas, filtration berms, using Road Weather Information Systems, calibrating sanders for road-clearing operations, and removing snow buildup along shoulders throughout the winter. 5.7 Geology and Soils/Soil Erosion 5.7.1 Changes Since the Draft EIS Related to Geology and Soils/Soil Erosion There have been no changes since the Draft EIS that affect the information presented on geology and soils. Sections 5.7.2 and 5.7.3 summarize the information reported in the Draft EIS for the preferred alternative. 5.7.2 Impacts of the Preferred Alternative The preferred alternative crosses areas that have been disturbed previously by mining, road construction, and other activities. Outside of the Rouchleau Pit area, steep slopes that may require erosion control measures may be encountered within newly proposed embankment areas constructed along existing high embankments found on portions of Landfill Road and where the bottom of the slope of a roughly 500-foot stretch of proposed southbound US 53 embankment intersects a high-wall present on the west side of the Rouchleau Pit and near the US 53/2nd Avenue interchange. 5.7.3 Mitigation Standard BMPs for working adjacent to surface waters will be implemented to prevent stormwater runoff from entering the Rouchleau Pit during construction of the bridge, approaches, and roadway. Design and construction approaches for the preferred alternative will include a more detailed assessment of the potential for use of special erosion control measures such as geotextile sheeting for temporary cover on slopes, articular concrete rip-rap, or other specific construction practices to minimize soil erosion. In areas where no special conditions are identified, standard erosion control BMPs for steep slopes and erodible soils will be incorporated into the roadway design plans and specifications for construction. An example of a special condition requiring more extensive controls is disturbance within 300 feet of the Rouchleau Pit. These disturbances will be for staging and access to the pit for construction of the bridge abutments. The SWPPP requires the contractor to submit the intended controls and method of approach at least one week prior to the work commencing, and this submission will be reviewed and approved by MnDOT. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS 5.8 Noise 5.8.1 Changes Since the Draft EIS Related to Noise The southern limit of the project has been extended to Bourgin Road to account for the modified access to the Midway neighborhood and acquisition of Parcel 206, which underlies a portion of the existing US 53. As such, additional noise modeling was conducted after the publication of the Draft EIS to assess potential impacts to receivers previously outside of the study area for the preferred alternative. This additional analysis is included in Appendix G. Twenty-five receivers were added along US 53 between Vermillion Drive and Bourgin Road. It was determined that 13 of 25 receivers had existing daytime noise impacts, and all 25 had existing nighttime noise impacts. Twenty-one of the 25 additional receivers would benefit from installation of a noise wall. The noise wall voting process concluded on “the date of public knowledge,” which is the date the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) signed the Record of Decision. Final results have been incorporated into an addendum to the noise technical report, which is included in Appendix G, and reported in the Record of Decision. 5.8.2 Impacts of the Preferred Alternative Alternative E-2 with the Straight Option was selected as the preferred alternative and was identified in the Draft EIS as impacting Area C, which is near 2nd Avenue (see Figure 5.8-1). A noise barrier was found be to be cost-effective in this location. As a result of the extension of the southern limit of the project to Bourgin Road, the preferred alternative will also impact Area F near Midway (see Figure 5.8-1). Additional noise modeling was conducted for this area, and the findings of this analysis are included in Appendix G. 5.8.3 Mitigation 5.8.3.1 Area C (2nd Avenue) Noise Wall Based on a refinement of the analysis from the Draft EIS, a 1,260-foot long noise wall was found to be cost-effective in Area C. With a 20-foot tall barrier, the cost per residence achieving a five dBA reduction is $36,000, meeting the cost-effectiveness requirement of $43,500 per residence. 5.8.3.2 Area F (Midway Area) Noise Wall With the additional analysis for the receivers south of Vermillion Drive, a 2,074-foot long noise wall was found to be cost-effective in Area F. With a 20-foot tall barrier, the cost per residence achieving a five dBA reduction is $24,735, meeting the cost-effectiveness requirement of $43,500 per residence. 5.8.3.3 Voting Process In accordance with federal Noise Abatement Criteria (NAC) standards, benefited receivers have been given the opportunity to vote for or against the construction of the proposed walls. Each benefitted receiver was assigned a number of points depending on location and whether the parcel use was residential or commercial. The point assignments from MnDOT’s Noise Policy are shown in Table 5.8-1. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS Table 5.8-1. Benefitted Receiver Point Assignments Commercial Parcels  Residential Parcels  Tier 1  Points for Tier 1 Owners  4  4  Points for Tier 1 Residents  N/A  2  Total Points for Tier 1 Parcels  4  6  Tier 2  Points for Tier 2 Owners  2  2  Points for Tier 2 Residents  N/A  1  Total Points for Tier 2 Parcels  2  3  Tier 1 refers to those parcels directly abutting the roadway, and Tier 2 includes those parcels that do not abut the roadway. For residential properties, where the resident is different than the owner, both have the opportunity to vote, with the owner retaining higher points than the resident. If greater than half of the available points vote against the wall, the wall will not be constructed. Notices and ballots were mailed to benefited receivers on February 18, 2015, with notice of a public open house to be held on March 5, 2015. The City of Virginia also distributed flyers door-to-door regarding the open house for the benefited receivers. Fourteen residents attended the open house. The voting period was advertised to close March 20, 2015; due to several undelivered ballots (no forwarding address), additional time and effort was put forth to reach the affected parties. Technically, votes can be accepted until “the date of public knowledge” is reached, which is the date FHWA signs the Record of Decision. MnDOT conducted door knocking on two separate occasions and hand delivered ballots to unresponsive properties. For properties that were vacant, extra effort was made to reach property owners in order to obtain a vote for the property. In July 2015, MnDOT refined the noise analysis for Area F (Midway) as part of the project development process. No refinements were indicated for Area C (2nd Avenue). During this evaluation, MnDOT identified the need for refinements to the noise model to improve the accuracy of its depiction of the area, wall design, and access changes. With the refined results, MnDOT determined that: ■ Four parcels previously identified as benefitted receivers would not benefit from the proposed noise barrier design ■ Seven parcels not previously identified as benefitted receivers would benefit from the proposed noise wall The seven additional benefitted receivers were mailed notices and ballots on July 17, 2015, with notice of a public open house to be held on August 3, 2015. No residents attended the open house. It was requested that benefited receivers return their ballots by August 18, 2015. Based on the final vote count, the following conclusions have been made regarding noise walls. Area C (2nd Avenue) Based on modeling, 12 parcels were considered benefitted receivers of the proposed wall in Area C. The total number of available voting points for the 1,260 foot wall was 37. Of the 37 available points, 21 points (57 percent) were from “no” votes. Therefore, the proposed wall in Area C will not be constructed. Area F (Midway Area) Based on revised modeling, 35 parcels were considered benefitted receivers of the proposed wall in Area F. The total number of available voting points for the 2,074 foot wall was 99. Of the 99 available points, 54 points (55 percent) were from “no” votes. Therefore, the proposed wall will not be constructed. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS 5.9 Transportation-Related Air Quality 5.9.1 Changes Since the Draft EIS Related to Transportation-Related Air Quality There have been no changes since the Draft EIS that affect the information presented on transportation-related air quality. Sections 5.9.2 and 5.9.3 summarize the information reported in the Draft EIS for the preferred alternative. 5.9.2 Impacts of the Preferred Alternative The preferred alternative will not result in an increase in traffic volumes, vehicle mix, basic project location, or any other factor that will cause an increase in mobile source air toxics (MSATs) impacts compared to the existing condition. This project has been determined to generate negligible air quality impacts for Clean Air Act Amendment criteria pollutants and has not been linked with any special MSATs concerns as compared to existing conditions. Moreover, USEPA regulations for vehicle engines and fuels will cause overall MSATs emissions to decline significantly over the next several decades. Based on regulations now in effect, an analysis of national trends with USEPA's MOVES2010b model forecasts a combined reduction of 83 percent in the total annual emission rate for the priority MSATs from 2010 to 2050 while vehicle-miles traveled are projected to increase by 102 percent. This will reduce both the background level of MSATs as well as the possibility of even minor future MSATs emissions. Future annual average daily traffic (AADT) volumes for the project do not approach the benchmark criterion for a carbon monoxide hot spot air quality analysis. The project is not located in an area where conformity requirements apply, and the scope of the project does not indicate that air quality impacts will be expected. 5.9.3 Mitigation No transportation-related air quality impacts have been identified; therefore, no mitigation is proposed. 5.10 Vegetation and Cover Types 5.10.1 Changes Since the Draft EIS Related to Vegetation and Cover Types As described in Section 5.1, the areas evaluated for vegetation impacts have been refined since the Draft EIS. In addition to refined construction limits, staging areas, a snow storage area, and a Mesabi Trail connection have been identified since publication of the Draft EIS. Staging Areas: The three staging areas (not including the snow storage area) were previously disturbed by mining activities and have recently been cleared of vegetation and used for access to the pit for various data gathering activities. The total size of these staging areas is approximately three acres. Snow Storage Area: This approximately nine acre site is located in an area disturbed by past mining activities and is a mine tailings waste area. It sits several feet higher in elevation than the wetlands to its west. The vegetation is sparse (approximately 40-50 percent cover) with a number of saplings scattered around the outer edges of the area. Mesabi Trail Connection: The approximately two acre parcel where the trail connection will be located is part of an old railroad corridor and is approximately half unvegetated due to disturbance (i.e., road, old rail bed, ATV use). The east end of the parcel is currently cleared for an overhead power line. The remainder of the parcel is covered in grasses, low shrubs, and a few encroaching saplings. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS Parcel 206: MnDOT will acquire 13 acres of the 47 acre parcel that currently underlies a portion of US 53. This area is essentially all impervious surface or vegetated right-of-way and lies outside the project construction limits. 5.10.2 Impacts of the Preferred Alternative The acreages of cover types present within the construction limits, staging areas, snow storage area, and Mesabi Trail connection are shown in Table 5.10-1. With the construction of the preferred alternative, six acres of wetland and 39 acres of forest will be converted to paved/impervious or vegetated disturbed areas. Table 5.10-1.

Due to the previously disturbed nature of much of the area, no special/unique mitigation is specifically required for the cover type changes other than revegetation and stabilization of disturbed areas. Standard practices for weeds and invasive species will be implemented. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS 5.11 Fish and Wildlife 5.11.1 Changes Since the Draft EIS Related to Fish and Wildlife There have been no changes since the publication of the Draft EIS that affect the information presented on fish and wildlife. The additional areas added to the project (staging areas, snow storage area, and Mesabi Trail connection) will not affect the overall impact to fish or wildlife due to their high level of previous disturbance. Sections 5.11.2 and 5.11.3 summarize the information reported in the Draft EIS for the preferred alternative. 5.11.2 Impacts of the Preferred Alternative Some wildlife impacts are anticipated to occur as a result of the preferred alternative. Due to the disturbed nature of the habitat from past mining activities, the wildlife species that inhabit these areas are generalist species adapted to highly disturbed habitat and anthropogenic disruptions, such as adjacent mining operations and traffic and transit activities. These species have demonstrated by their presence that they adapt readily to anthropogenic changes in their environment. A negligible1 to minor2 impact to wildlife will occur as a result of the preferred alternative. The impact is small compared to the large amount of adjacent habitat available to the east and north of the preferred alternative. Peregrine falcons were identified within the project area during the DNR database record search, with nesting reports in 1991 and 1992 on the pit wall at the north end of the Rouchleau Pit. No sightings have been recorded since that time. The peregrine falcon population has recovered and, as a result, was federally delisted in 1996. It has also been downgraded from threatened to special concern in Minnesota. However, it is still protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. If peregrine falcons are observed during construction, the MnDOT biologist will be contacted for coordination with the DNR Non-Game Program. No other rare features or species were identified during the database search. 5.11.3 Mitigation If peregrine falcons are observed during construction, the MnDOT biologist will be contacted for coordination with the DNR Non-Game Program. The measures selected for construction mitigation will be made in consultation with the appropriate agencies. 5.12 Threatened and Endangered Species 5.12.1 Changes Since the Draft EIS Related to Threatened and Endangered Species Since the publication of the Draft EIS and previous US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) consultation, the following changes were made to the proposed action as well as to the species listed under the Endangered Species Act. ■ The gray wolf has been relisted under the Endangered Species Act as threatened ■ The northern long-eared bat survey in the project area has been completed (Appendix D) 1 Negligible impacts are those that are imperceptible or not detectable. The action would not result in noticeable changes in habitat or wildlife use. 2 Minor impacts are those that are slightly detectable and localized but would not affect the overall viability of the wildlife within that area. It is anticipated that wildlife within areas identified as having minor impacts would adapt to habitat changes and/or use adjacent habitat areas. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS ■ The northern long-eared bat has been officially listed under the Endangered Species Act as threatened by the USFWS (effective May 4, 2015). ■ Additional areas of evaluation have been added to the project, including staging areas, a snow storage area, and the Mesabi Trail connection Additional correspondence between MnDOT and USFWS has also occurred (see Appendix C) to address Endangered Species Act listing changes. The information presented in the Draft EIS is summarized below for the preferred alternative and has been updated to reflect the above changes. 5.12.2 Impacts of the Preferred Alternative In early 2015, MnDOT coordinated with the USFWS to assess the potential for impacts to listed species. Correspondence to the USFWS dated February 17, 2015 (Appendix C) identified five species that are listed or were proposed for listing in St. Louis County: the Canada lynx, gray wolf, rufa red knot, piping plover, and northern long-eared bat. Habitat for the piping plover and rufa red knot are not found within the corridor; therefore, MnDOT, on behalf of FHWA, made a determination of “no effect” on these species for this project. The critical habitats for the Canada lynx and gray wolf are not within the study area for the preferred alternative, but the preferred alternative is within the distribution range of both species. Due to the disturbed nature of the study area and the lack of boreal forests, no adverse impacts to the Canada lynx or gray wolf are anticipated. Therefore, a determination of “may affect, but is not likely to adversely affect” was made. At the time of the correspondence, the northern long-eared bat was proposed for listing as an endangered species, but it has no critical habitat identified at this time. Based on current information, the impacts of the preferred alternative are not at a magnitude that will result in jeopardizing the continued existence of this species. The preferred alternative will result in 39 acres of impacts to forest habitat that could potentially affect summer roosting areas for the northern long-eared bat. The identified potential hibernaculum is not located in an area anticipated to be disturbed by the preferred alternative (see Appendix D). A determination of “no jeopardy” was made in consultation with USFWS. USFWS concurred with these findings of FHWA, as requested by MnDOT in a letter dated March 20, 2015 (see Appendix C). As noted above, since the correspondence between MnDOT and USFWS in early 2015, the northern long-eared bat was officially listed as threatened by the USFWS (effective May 4, 2015). The USFWS is still accepting public comments on the interim 4(d) rules regarding activities in northern long-eared bat habitat through July 1, 2015. MnDOT requested that USFWS update the determination based on the change in species status. USFWS responded with an updated determination on July 23, 2015. These additional letters are included in Appendix C. No additional state listed rare, threatened, or endangered species were identified by the DNR in the study area. 5.12.3 Mitigation MnDOT has entered into informal consultation with USFWS as part of the Section 7 process and does not anticipate any project modifications as a result of the northern long-eared bat becoming a listed species. MnDOT is committed to completing winter tree removal to avoid impacts to the potential summer roosting areas of the northern long-eared bat. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS 5.13 Hazardous Materials and Contaminated Properties 5.13.1 Changes Since the Draft EIS Related to Hazardous Materials and Contaminated Properties As described in Section 5.1, the areas evaluated for hazardous materials and contaminated properties have been refined since the Draft EIS. In addition to refined construction limits, staging areas, a snow storage area, and a Mesabi Trail connection have been identified since publication of the Draft EIS. 5.13.2 Impacts of the Preferred Alternative 5.13.2.1 Phase I Environmental Site Assessment A Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) was completed for the project in 2013 and addressed four separate alignment alternatives being considered at that time. One of the alignments assessed in the Phase I ESA report (Alignment E-2) was very similar to the preferred alternative. The Phase I ESA report includes information on the locations of potentially contaminated properties located within 650 feet of the assessed alignment alternatives based on information obtained through review of historic land use records, air photos, federal/state government records, county/city records, and site reconnaissance. Sites of potential environmental concern identified by the Phase I ESA were categorized into three categories: high, medium, and low risk. In general, high environmental risk sites are properties that have a documented release of chemicals or other strong evidence of contamination such as soil staining or storage of large volumes of petroleum or other chemicals. Medium environmental risk sites may include properties where relatively smaller volumes of petroleum, chemicals, or hazardous materials are stored, but there is no evidence of spills or releases, or properties with documented releases that have been “closed” (no further cleanup action deemed necessary) by the MPCA. A “closed” site is considered a medium risk because it may still have residual soil or groundwater contamination. Low environmental risk sites include properties where small volumes of chemicals or hazardous materials have been used or stored and are considered not of concern to the project. The Phase I ESA report identified nine sites of potential environmental concern in the area of the preferred alternative: two high risk, five medium risk, and two low risk sites. Of these sites, sites targeted for project-related acquisition and/or sites where construction excavations would likely occur were further evaluated through completion of follow-up Phase II Investigations (see Section 5.13.2.2). Copies of the Phase I ESA report are available on the project website.3 5.13.2.2 Phase II Investigation Results and Recommendations A Phase II Investigation was completed for the project in 2013, and an additional Phase II Investigation was completed in 2014 (Phase II investigations). The Phase II investigations focused on assessing environmental conditions on selected sites of potential environmental concern identified in the Phase I ESA report. As discussed in Section 5.13.2.1, the specific sites assessed by the Phase II investigations consisted of likely acquisition parcels and suspect areas likely to be excavated or disturbed by planned construction. The Phase II investigations identified several areas where the analytical testing identified locations on or near the preferred alternative where one or more of the analyzed compounds were detected at concentrations exceeding an established MPCA standard. The following sites and issues of potential environmental concern were identified by the Phase II investigations and may require consideration for future property acquisitions and construction of the preferred alternative. 3 http://www.dot.state.mn.us/d1/projects/hwy53relocation/ September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS Bike Path and Wenonah Properties (RGGS) ■ Elevated concentrations of arsenic in shallow soil near a suspected former copper wire salvage area ■ Isolated area of petroleum-impacted soil ■ Small quantities of intermixed man-made debris present in fill soils ■ Past mining use Vacant Industrial Facility (former Staver Foundry) ■ Petroleum release with “open” status according to MPCA ■ Elevated concentrations of arsenic, lead, Benzo (a)pyrene (BaP), and diesel range organics (DRO) detected in soil samples Lenci Enterprises, Inc. & Sunrise Equipment Corp ■ Elevated concentrations of DRO and BaP detected in soil samples ■ Recently closed petroleum release Property acquisitions or excavations for construction at the above sites (if any are required) would need to consider the potential for encountering contaminated soil and appropriate mitigation measures (see Section 5.13.3). Copies of the Phase II investigation reports are available on the project website.4 5.13.2.3 Additional Review The added staging and snow storage areas were reviewed, and no potential contamination issues were identified based on existing data. The potential for environmental concerns associated with the Mesabi Trail connection (old railroad right-of-way) were also considered. In general, old railroad right-of-way property can contain remnants of historic railroad infrastructure including steel rails, ties, and ballast materials. Such remnant materials, if encountered during construction, may require segregation and special handling/disposition during construction but are not necessarily considered to be contamination issues requiring pre-construction investigation. 5.13.3 Mitigation Taconite Materials Handling Some taconite may contain elongated mineral particles (EMP) which resemble asbestos. The University of Minnesota conducted a Minnesota Taconite Workers Health Study.5 This study took a comprehensive look at the health of Minnesota taconite workers from portions of the Mesabi Iron Range. A final report was issued in December 2014. The length of time people worked in the industry was linked to higher levels of mesothelioma but not lung cancer. Workers with above average exposure to dust containing EMPs were twice as likely to develop mesothelioma as workers with below-average exposures. Exposure to EMPs was linked to mesothelioma but not lung cancer; therefore, the study identified links between mesothelioma from working in the taconite mining industry and exposure to EMPs. MnDOT’s Standard Specification for Construction Manual (MnDOT, 2005) allows taconite tailings from certain areas to be used in bituminous mixtures and as road base. Historically, starting in the 1950s, MnDOT constructed some roadways in northern Minnesota using taconite tailings for aggregate in road base and bituminous. Reconstruction of these roadways requires excavation and handling of taconite tailings. Certain aggregates in the east range of the Biwabik Iron Formation contain minerals that generally resemble asbestos (EMPs or asbestos-like materials), which are not subject to asbestos regulations. MnDOT has produced a best practice for management of tailings used in highway construction,6 recognizing that even though taconite tailings present in this project are not subject to regulation, some reasonable handling techniques are prudent. MnDOT will use its standard regulated materials BMP 4 http://www.dot.state.mn.us/d1/projects/hwy53relocation/ 5 Minnesota Taconite Workers Health Study website: http://taconiteworkers.umn.edu/index.html 6 MnDOT Regulated Materials Management Section 11, MnDOT Office of Environmental Stewardship, Environmental Investigation Unit, Best Management Practice, Taconite Tailings Road Aggregate September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS procedures during construction on this project to limit potential exposure from taconite to the public and to the contractors and employees working on this project. MnDOT will specify in construction documents that all aggregate materials to be used for project construction will be from sources that are free from asbestos or other contaminants. Potentially Contaminated Sites A Response Action Plan (RAP) will be completed for the preferred alternative prior to any right-of-way acquisition or construction by MnDOT in areas of known or suspected contamination. A RAP will set a protocol for properly handling and treating contaminated soil and/or groundwater that could be handled during construction as identified in the contract special provisions or the RAP. If necessary, MnDOT may enroll in the MPCA Voluntary Investigation and Cleanup (VIC) Program to obtain regulatory assurances for contamination indicated during Phase II investigations and to obtain approvals for any contamination management and clean-up plans. If necessary, prior to construction activities a MPCA-approved Construction Contingency Plan and/or contract special provision will be developed. In the event that previously unknown hazardous materials are discovered during construction, the Contractor shall notify the Project Engineer immediately and follow the prescribed management protocol contained in the Construction Contingency Plan/RAP or contract special provisions. The materials will be handled in accordance with all appropriate federal, state, and local regulations. During construction, there is potential for incidental spills of vehicle fluids and/or fuels as a result of normal existing roadway operations or traffic incidents. In the event that any spill is encountered within the project area, the appropriate response protocol required by the MnDOT Technical Memorandum No. 11-10-M-02 will be followed. Spills Any potential contaminant spills on the road, such as gasoline, oil, and antifreeze, will be collected within the storm sewer system on the road and conveyed to a treatment pond on the west side of the pit where they could be contained for cleanup; therefore, no contaminants will be directly discharged into the pit. Emergency spills will be cleaned up as identified in MnDOT’s Emergency Spill Response Technical Memorandum (MnDOT, April 2011). 5.14 Excess Material 5.14.1 Changes Since the Draft EIS Related to Excess Material There have been no changes since the Draft EIS that affect the information presented on excess material. Sections 5.14.2 and 5.14.3 summarize the information reported in the Draft EIS for the preferred alternative. The staging areas, snow storage area, and Mesabi Trail connection will not require extensive grading and will not change the estimate of cut and fill material for the project. 5.14.2 Impacts of the Preferred Alternative The preferred alternative will require proper disposal or reuse of the existing roadway pavement and the top few feet of roadbed from the terminated easement agreement area from which US 53 is relocated. However, no disposal of excess materials will occur in wetlands, floodplains, or other sensitive areas. The amount of cut and fill material needed for the preferred alternative will be as follows: ■ Cut: 700,000 cubic yards ■ Fill: 850,000 cubic yards 5.14.3 Mitigation Excess material and debris from this project, such as road pavement or roadbed materials, can be taken off site by the contractor for reuse on other projects, with the exception of taconite. If excess material cannot be reused, under no circumstance will MnDOT approve creation of permit-by-rule landfills for September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS disposal of any waste material. If disposal is required for waste materials resulting from demolition, this waste will be disposed of in a MPCA permitted demolition landfill. Demolition waste can include concrete, bituminous, untreated wood, masonry, glass, trees, and rock. The project will not explicitly or effectively designate borrow or disposal sites. If any fill is needed, specifications for the source and nature of the fill used within Virginia’s Inner Emergency Response Area will be required to avoid the potential for contamination impacts to the water supply. These specifications will prohibit the use of taconite tailings as fill within the Rouchleau Pit. 5.15 Geotechnical and Earthborne Vibration 5.15.1 Changes Since the Draft EIS Related to Geotechnical and Earthborne Vibration MnDOT has continued to study geotechnical issues within the project corridor. The resulting changes and updates have been incorporated in the following summary. Sections 5.15.2 and 5.15.3 summarize the information reported in the Draft EIS for the preferred alternative. The staging areas, snow storage area, and Mesabi Trail connection will not require extensive grading and do not result in any additional geotechnical concerns. MnDOT continues to conduct boring studies in the areas of the proposed bridge piers to inform the final design. 5.15.2 Impacts of the Preferred Alternative The following areas have been identified that may require special geotechnical design and/or construction techniques to address soil, embankment, and/or vibration-related issues. East of the Rouchleau Pit there is a small pond area within the preferred alternative alignment that may require removal of poor/potentially organic soils or some other soil remediation (such as lightweight fill) to prevent potential settlement in this area. Mine dumps were also encountered in the pond stretch, which, depending on gradation, could also pose a settlement concern. Investigations revealed that the pond is bounded and underlain by mine dump fill and will not require soil removal/remediation of poor/potentially organic soils. Geotextile has been proposed as a means of soil separation and settlement prevention where new embankment fill is proposed over existing mine dump fill. DNR mapping of documented underground abandoned mines (UAMs) in the project vicinity was reviewed. DNR staff indicated that documented UAMs are located outside of the construction limits of the preferred alternative or, if located within the construction limits, the mines have been open pit. There is a possibility that undocumented mine(s) could exist in this area. Thus far, geotechnical borings conducted inside and outside of the Rouchleau Pit have not encountered any UAMs. Tall substructures (piers) for a bridge spanning the Rouchleau Pit may be susceptible to vibrations and flyrock produced by nearby blasting that could take place in the future if mining operations reconvene in the pit. The bridge will need to be designed to address this possibility. Stability of the existing fill in the area and its effects on bridge foundations constructed on/within the submerged haul road is also a concern related to future mining activities, particularly blasting. Criteria for future mining will need to be established and addressed in agreements with the mine to ensure that both the mine dump fill and bridge structure remain unharmed during future mining activities. Stability analyses of the fill encompassing the west pier have been performed and results will be used during final design to develop a pier design that addresses the local geologic conditions. Due to the properties of existing fill in the area, the foundations for the bridge will need to be drilled (as opposed to using driven piling) to and into the bedrock in order to acquire the necessary bearing capacity and lateral resistance. Potentially unstable bedrock units are also present in the highwalls and will need to be assessed if foundations are placed in these areas. Drilled pile tests have been conducted at the west pier site and have shown favorable results in terms of constructability. Both the east and west pier September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS will be constructed with drilled pile foundations and will alleviate prior concerns related to stability, settlement, and capacity at both piers. Water levels in the Rouchleau Pit will likely vary over time due to mining-related dewatering. Therefore, stability and settlement of the existing fill material is a potential concern for bridge foundations. Drilled piles will be designed to account for dragload and downdrag. It is possible that mining could take place in the future east of the pit and on both sides of the future roadway and bridge. Consequently, a peninsula-like bedrock structure (isthmus) as much as 400 to 500 feet tall will remain supporting the roadway and bridge. Stability of this structure is of particular concern since vibrations from mining coupled with perched groundwater could initiate sliding along a weak, northwestward-dipping layer found within the iron formation. An instrumentation plan will likely be implemented to monitor stability within the roadway structure. Borings have been conducted in this area to assess rock slope and global stability of a future isthmus. Based on observations from the Rouchleau Pit, an area of the proposed southbound lane of US 53 between 150 feet and 450 feet north of the proposed US 53/2nd Avenue intersection appears to be underlain by mine dump fill and glacial till, in descending order. Consequently, this area poses a potential slope stability concern. Additional borings have been acquired from this area. Slope stability modeling performed for this area suggests that slope failures could occur, particularly in the presence of seismic loads and dewatering. Construction plans are being developed to prevent slope failure in this area. 5.15.3 Mitigation MnDOT has investigated geotechnical constraints in the project area and will continue to do so. This information has been and will be used to identify measures to avoid, minimize, or mitigate construction/design practices related to potential geotechnical and earthborne vibration issues. The area of permanent easement MnDOT will be purchasing around the bridge accounts for future mining seismic activity and is large enough to protect the integrity of the structure and roadbed, extending a maximum of 580 feet on either side of the bridge centerline. This distance is based on a minimum bridge setback and pier stability analysis. Mining activities will not be allowed within the permanent easement area. MnDOT will continue to coordinate with the mine operator regarding future mining activities. 5.16 Climate Change 5.16.1 Changes Since the Draft EIS Related to Climate Change There have been no changes since the Draft EIS that affect the information presented on climate change. Sections 5.16.2 and 5.16.3 summarize the information reported in the Draft EIS for the preferred alternative. 5.16.2 Impacts of the Preferred Alternative The trip length increase from the preferred alternative will not result in a noticeable change in vehicle miles traveled and will not have a substantive effect on global greenhouse gas generation. The preferred alternative will impact the forested landscape in the project area (see Section 5.10), and forest vegetation may be considered a resource vulnerable to the effects of climate change. There is no known way to predict the potential future impacts on the current type of forest vegetation in this area that may result from climate change. Therefore, the combined effects of the project plus climate change cannot be estimated quantitatively. However, the overall impact on the relatively extensive northern forest ecosystem of Minnesota resulting from the potential loss of approximately 39 acres of forest vegetation from construction of the preferred alternative will not be considered substantive. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS 5.16.3 Mitigation No mitigation measures are proposed since the preferred alternative is not projected to have a substantive effect on greenhouse gas emissions (i.e., energy use) or resources affected by climate change. 5.17 Construction Related Impacts 5.17.1 Changes Since the Draft EIS Related to Construction Related Impacts Construction impacts since the Draft EIS remain the same, with the exception of potential staging areas being identified. These staging areas are addressed in Section 5.17.2.12. 5.17.2 Impacts of the Preferred Alternative and Mitigation 5.17.2.1 Economics and Business To manage impacts on businesses during highway construction, MnDOT will follow guidance in a report developed in response to a law passed by the Minnesota State Legislature in 2008 (Laws of Minnesota 2008, chapter 308). The referenced report (Open for Business -A workbook to help Minnesota businesses survive and thrive during highway construction, 2009) can be found on MnDOT’s website7 and provides guidance based on business outreach methods/results, best practices, and lessons learned that can aid local businesses during construction. Construction activities will not impact mine operations. Mine operations will also not impact construction activities, except if construction is occurring in an area where there is mine blasting. In that situation standard safety protocols would be followed, which may require periodic shutdown of specific construction activities for a short period on a given day. 5.17.2.2 Visual and Aesthetics Visual impacts will occur during construction of the preferred alternative. Temporary visual impacts include the presence of construction equipment and workers, temporary changes in the views experienced by travelers when rerouting is necessary, a decrease in vegetation in some areas, and the addition of increased time in which traffic remains in a certain area due to the increased congestion associated with construction. 5.17.2.3 Utilities Impacts to utilities are anticipated during construction of the preferred alternative, although these are not impacts imposed by MnDOT. Impacts could include utility relocation and/or temporary interruptions in service. MnDOT is coordinating with utility providers regarding relocation timing and location. 5.17.2.4 Water Supply and Waterbody Modification The construction of the preferred alternative will require a NPDES/State Disposal System (SDS) Stormwater Construction Activity Permit, which may be covered under the State’s Construction Stormwater General Permit. As part of the application process, the owner and operator must create a SWPPP that explains how stormwater will be controlled to prevent introduction of sediment and other pollutants transported by runoff. Any equipment, materials, or personnel coming into contact with the Rouchleau Pit water due to dewatering or construction may transfer aquatic invasive species (AIS) into the Rouchleau Pit. Appropriate measures will be taken to prevent any potential transfers of AIS into the water (e.g., having any 7 http://www.dot.state.mn.us/businessimpacts September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS equipment or material used for dewatering or construction exposed to dry conditions for at least five days before coming into contact with the waterbody). 5.17.2.5 Stormwater The MPCA serves as the permitting authority for stormwater issues related to roadway construction, including a general stormwater permit for construction activity under Phase II of the NPDES. Compliance with the NPDES permit will be met through the use of BMPs to mitigate impacts of roadway construction affecting water quality. Stormwater features will be used for runoff treatment and attenuation, where practical, and determined if necessary during more detailed design of the preferred alternative. A NPDES permit will be obtained from the MPCA prior to construction. This permit will include an erosion control plan, as well as BMPs contained in MnDOT’s standard specifications, details, and special provisions. Special consideration will be given to steep slope areas, specifically in the pit crossing areas to stabilize long, steep slopes. After construction, all disturbed areas will be sodded or seeded, leaving temporary erosion control structures in place until vegetation has been established. Erosion and sedimentation of these and all other exposed soils within the project corridor will be minimized by utilizing the appropriate BMPs during construction. Implementation of BMPs in the final construction and site grading plans greatly reduces the amount of construction-related sedimentation and helps to control erosion and runoff. Ditches, dikes, siltation fences, bale checks, and sedimentation basins will be utilized, as needed, as temporary erosion control measures during construction. 5.17.2.6 Noise The construction activities associated with construction of the preferred alternative will result in increased noise levels relative to existing conditions. These impacts will primarily be associated with construction equipment and pile driving. Elevated noise levels are, to a degree, unavoidable for this type of project. MnDOT will require that construction equipment be properly muffled and in proper working order. While MnDOT and its contractor(s) are exempt from local noise ordinances, it is MnDOT’s practice to require contractor(s) to comply with applicable local noise restrictions and ordinances to the extent it is reasonable. Advanced notice will be provided to affected communities of any planned abnormally loud construction activities. It is anticipated that night construction may be required to expedite construction, minimize traffic impacts, and improve safety. However, construction will be limited to daytime hours as much as possible. This project is expected to be under construction for two construction seasons. Any associated high-impact equipment noise, such as pile driving, pavement sawing, or jack hammering, will be unavoidable with construction of the proposed project. Pile driving noise is associated with any bridge construction and sheet piling necessary for retaining wall construction. High-impact noise construction activities will be limited in duration to the greatest extent possible, with the understanding that construction will likely be under an accelerated schedule. 5.17.2.7 Transportation-Related Air Quality Air quality impacts from construction include increased dust and airborne particulates caused by grading, filling, removals, and other construction activities. Dust impacts will be minimized through standard dust control measures such as watering. After construction is complete, dust levels are expected to return to near existing conditions. Air quality impacts may also result from emissions from construction equipment and possibly from traffic stopped at intersecting roadways or on potential detour routes. These impacts are expected to be minimal and of short duration. 5.17.2.8 Hazardous Materials and Contaminated Properties A management plan will be developed for properly handling, treating, storing, and disposing of solid wastes, hazardous materials, petroleum products, and other regulated materials/wastes that are used or generated during construction. The plan will also establish protocols to minimize impacts to soils and September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS groundwater in the event a release of hazardous substances occurs during construction. If a release were to occur, the Minnesota Duty Officer will be contacted immediately to make the required agency contacts. In the event that any spill of vehicle fluids and/or fuels is encountered during construction, the appropriate response protocol required by MnDOT Technical Memorandum No. 11-10-M-02 will be followed. Prior to the demolition of any structures, assessments for asbestos-containing materials, lead-based paint, and other regulated building materials/wastes will be performed. A demolition and disposal plan will be prepared for any identified contaminants that may be encountered during construction. If used as a construction material on this project, handling of taconite tailings will be completed in conformance with the project special provisions and the MnDOT Guidance Document #36: Best Management Practice: Taconite Tailings Road Aggregate. 5.17.2.9 Excess Materials During construction, if excess material is to be disposed of outside of the project limits, the contractor will develop a disposal plan that must be approved by the MnDOT Project Engineer. Disposal of excess material will be in compliance with the guidelines listed in the standard specifications, including MnDOT specifications, FHWA policies, and environmental laws and regulations. Disposal will not occur in wetlands, floodplains, or other sensitive areas. The contractor will dispose of unusable excavated material in accordance with state regulations and special provisions to ensure protection of wetlands and waterways. All waste and demolition material from project construction activities will be disposed of in accordance with the standard specifications or special provisions to ensure protection of wetlands and waterways. Erosion and sedimentation will be controlled in accordance with temporary and permanent erosion and sediment control plans, MnDOT Standard Plans and standard specifications, and local ordinances. 5.17.2.10 Geotechnical and Earthborn Vibrations The project may require blasting, pile driving, dynamic compaction, ordinary compaction, and/or pavement breaking or the operation of other construction equipment that may result in temporary earthborn vibrations that have the potential to affect homes. The typical practice is to use vibration monitoring, and if the vibrations reach a certain level, require that the contractor revise operations to reduce earthborn vibrations. This monitoring will also be used to distinguish construction vibration from mine generated vibration. 5.17.2.11 Staging Areas Areas have been identified for potential use for staging of construction, especially for building the bridge. These areas may be used during the two-plus years preparing for and implementing project construction. The areas labeled as “staging areas” on Figure 2.3-1 have been cleared of vegetation and used for access to the pit for various data gathering activities. The identified snow storage site, which may also be used for staging, was previously disturbed by past mining. Access roads to these areas are already in place. Therefore, use of these areas will have negligible impacts. Once construction is complete, these areas will be vegetated to stabilize soils. Some construction will be conducted off of barge platforms within the Rouchleau Pit. Specific BMPs to address barge use will be included in the SWPPP (e.g., perimeter confinement, turbidity curtain, floating silt curtain). September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS 5.18 Relationship of Local Short-Term Use vs. Long-Term Productivity 5.18.1 Changes Since the Draft EIS Related to Relationship of Local Short-Term Use vs. Long-Term Productivity There have been no changes since the Draft EIS that affect the information presented on the relationship of local short-term use vs. long-term productivity. Section 5.18.2 summarizes the information reported in the Draft EIS for the preferred alternative. 5.18.2 Impacts of the Preferred Alternative 5.18.2.1 Potential Adverse Use Temporary Reduction of Energy and Material Resources Materials consumed in the construction of the preferred alternative will be unavailable for other uses, including construction of other non-highway related facilities. The energy consumed in the construction, maintenance, and operation of the facility is higher than the energy consumed by the No Build Alternative in the short-term. Temporary Loss of Vegetation In addition to permanent loss of vegetation as a result of the preferred alternative, construction activities will result in additional temporary losses of vegetation adjacent to the roadway improvements. Revegetation activities will be coordinated with other erosion control and stabilization components of the project to minimize impacts. Visual quality will also be considered in selecting appropriate methods and materials for revegetation. Temporary Loss of Wetlands The impact on wetlands cannot be completely avoided due to their scattered distribution and the limited options for realignment due to the presence of active mining areas. The preferred alternative design will incorporate avoidance, minimization, and mitigation measures, and compensatory mitigation areas have been described in a permit application to the USACE. Compensatory mitigation will replace the loss of wetland functions and values within the project area. Temporary Impacts on Water Resources The preferred alternative has the potential to create temporary impacts to the Rouchleau Pit by implementing a crossing of the pit. Disruption to this waterbody will be minimized to the extent feasible for the preferred alternative. Temporary wetland impact during removal of existing roads, trail, and culverts will be restored to preconstruction condition when removals are complete. Short-Term Economic Impacts The construction of the preferred alternative will require the acquisition of property and will remove this land from tax rolls, resulting in some short-term loss of property tax revenues. This temporary loss is anticipated to be offset by the increased value of land served by the new highway location and ore access. The preferred alternative will also require full acquisition and relocation of three commercial properties. Given the availability of a number of potential replacement sites in the area, short-term loss in tax revenues will be negligible. Temporary changes in consumer behavior may occur until highway improvements are fully integrated. These impacts will be minimized through wayfinding signage and frequent project schedule updates during construction. Inconveniences from Construction Construction will cause minor traffic delays and detours for motorists in the area. This may result in temporarily higher levels of congestion. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS Significant Capital Investment Financial commitments to the project include acquisition, relocation, and construction costs. These public dollars will not be available for other uses. In addition, the land converted to highway use represents a reduction in tax base. These costs will be recovered by continuing to provide a transportation facility that will safely maintain adequate roadway capacity and mobility as well as local, regional, and inter-regional connectivity while meeting the terms of the current agreement with RGGS. 5.18.2.2 Long-Term Gains in Productivity Improve Travel Time and Minimize Cost of Travel A four-lane highway will have the ability to accommodate existing and forecast traffic volumes. The presence of free-flowing traffic, combined with the minor additional length of the preferred alternative compared to the existing US 53 alignment, will generally maintain or slightly increase motorist travel times and fuel consumption. Economic Benefit The economic advantage lies in the long-term efficiencies that a transportation system will provide. These efficiencies include travel time savings, development opportunities, and increased consumer activity due to enhanced mobility and exposure. The preferred alternative will maintain the status quo for traffic/travel times and provide possible growth opportunities. The new intersections associated with the preferred alternative may provide opportunity for new highway-related commercial development. 5.19 Irreversible and Irretrievable Impacts 5.19.1 Changes Since the Draft EIS Related to Irreversible and Irretrievable Impacts There have been no changes since the Draft EIS that affect the information presented on irreversible and irretrievable impacts. The sections below summarize the information reported in the Draft EIS for the preferred alternative. 5.19.2 Land Consumption The amount of land required for the preferred alternative is 203 acres of right-of-way to be acquired, some through permanent easements. An additional six acres of temporary easements will be required for staging and construction. Land used in the construction of the proposed project is considered an irreversible commitment during the time period that the land is used for a highway facility. Portions of the facility may be subject to easement agreements with the mining operation. The priority of MnDOT and FHWA is to ensure that this current investment in infrastructure is supported by the length of the easement so full use and life of the infrastructure may be realized. 5.19.3 Social and Cultural Resources The displacement and relocation of residences, businesses, and other resources of the built environment (public and private) are considered to be irreversible and irretrievable. Displacements and relocations are limited for the project, with displacement of three commercial properties proposed under the preferred alternative. 5.19.4 Energy Resources Several energy resources will be committed to plan, design, manufacture materials for, and conduct improvements to the highway system. The use of fossil fuels (coal, natural gas, and petroleum), water, and labor expenditures for both construction and maintenance of the facility are considered irreversible and irretrievable. Use of construction materials, such as cement, aggregate, and bituminous material, is generally considered irretrievable; however, these materials are not in short supply, and their use will not September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS have an adverse effect upon continued availability. In addition, some of these materials may have salvage value and may be recycled at the end of the facility’s design life. 5.19.5 Financial Resources The proposed improvements will require a considerable expenditure of both state and federal funds which are not retrievable. While these public funds are not directly retrievable, the money spent can be considered a long-term investment in the economic vitality of the region. 5.19.6 Natural Resources The proposed improvements may require the commitment of natural resources including the loss of vegetation, wetland functions and values, and other wildlife habitat. The commitment of these resources may in part be irreversible and irretrievable. Avoidance and minimization measures will be incorporated into final design of the preferred alternative. Mitigation measures will be employed in attempt to counter remaining impacts to natural resources. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS 78 79 80 VIRGINIA 77 02 01 76 03 SOUTHERN DR 6TH AVE2ND AVE £¤ 5361 74 75 04 72 06 67 71 05 66 70 08 07 6564 10 63 ROUCHLEAU PIT 62 09 11 60 59 58 12 15 13 14 57 16 56 55 17 21 18 22 23 19 53 AUBURN PIT 47 27 24 52 26 54 28 25 51 46 45 29 31 32 49 48 44 35 34 33 42 43 41 36 135 37 £¤ 40 CUYUNA DR MIDWAY VIRGINIA 53 ( ) VERMILLION DR 39 38 SEPTEMBER 2015 800 1,600 Feet ±0 Source: USGS Aerial 2009 LegendPreferred Alternative Staging Areas Delineated Wetland Boundaries Snow Storage/Staging Area Wetland Impacts Existing Access Roads Construction Limits Figure 5.5-1 Wetland Impacts US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final Environmental Impact Statement 1,000 2,000 Feet ±0 Source: USGS Aerial 2009 LegendDrainage to the Rouchleau Pit Snow Storage/Staging Area Drainage to Manganika Lake Existing Access Roads PreferredAlternative Realigned Mesabi Trail Manganika Creek Proposed Mesabi Trail Connection Staging Areas Existing Mesabi Trail Figure 5.5-2 Existing Drainage Patterns US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final Environmental Impact Statement 12TH AVE £¤ 2ND AVE R15AR15F R15BR16 R17 6TH AVE R41 R37 R19B R34 R19 R35 R43R44 R19ER20A R31 (!!!((!!(!(!( < !< R46R40 R36R29 !( !( !( !( !( R21 !( !( R30 !( (!((!!((!!((!!( R24 R15 !!( ( !( ! !( ( R14 R12CR12B R12A R12A2R13 !( !( (! !( !( !( !( (! R26 R20B R8 R26A R20 R9 R19D ! ROUCHLEAUPIT R10 R26B R12R10A R19CR19A AUBURNPIT R51BR51A ( ! !( RN1 RN2 RN3 RN4 ! !( !( !( ( !( !(! !( RN25RN24 R3 RN23RN22 RN5RN6 RN7RN8 RN12 RN9 !(!!(!( ( ( !!((!((! !(( ! !(!( (!( ! !!( (!(!( RN21RN20RN19 R2R2BR2C R1 (!(!(! !((!(!(!!!!((( !!(!(!(( (!( !!(!((!(!!(!(!(( (!!(!((( !(!( !( ! !!( ! R51R7R5CCUYUNA DR R6R5A R5 SEPTEMBER 2015 RN18RN17 RN16 R5BR5DR4 !( RN15RN14RN13 !( RN10 RN11 ± 0 1,000 2,000 Feet Source: Noise Impacts Technical Report Addendum (SBP Associates, Inc., 2015); USGS Aerial 2009 Legend !

Parts of Chapter 6 from the Draft EIS are repeated here, but it has been abbreviated to focus only on the preferred alternative. 6.1 Changes Since the Draft EIS There have been no changes in the project setting or regulatory context or new technical studies since the Draft EIS that affect the indirect/secondary impacts analysis.1 Changes in the project are described in Section 2.3.1. The refined alternative now includes a modified access median at Cuyuna and Vermillion Drives. The closure of the median at Cuyuna Drive has potential for indirect impacts to business access; however, the proposed median break at Vermillion Drive allows for continued access to these businesses and the neighborhood. The impacts of the preferred alternative as reported in the Draft EIS are summarized in Section 6.2. 6.2 Impacts of the Preferred Alternative Minimal changes to businesses along US 53 will be expected given that the traffic patterns will not change substantially under the preferred alternative due to the limited possibility of induced changes in land use or traffic. The lands adjacent to the preferred alternative will not be likely to change in their use, as they are on state land primarily reserved for recreational or mining use or on land that is already developed. However, the land outside the mine lands near the new intersection locations for 2nd Avenue and for MN 135 may experience a change to highway-related commercial business such as gas stations, convenience stores, coffee shops, or restaurants given changes in access and visibility. A number of these parcels are currently vacant or underdeveloped and may be available for new or redevelopment opportunities. If these parcels have wetlands, the proposed developments will be required to comply with current wetland permit requirements, including mitigation plans. 6.3 Mitigation No mitigation is required for the US 53 project. 1 According to the Council on Environmental Quality, an indirect impact is caused by a specific project or action but later in time or farther away, yet is still reasonably foreseeable. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS 7.0 Cumulative Impacts The US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) (December 2014) is incorporated by reference and is considered part of the Final EIS. Parts of Chapter 7 from the Draft EIS are repeated here, but it has been abbreviated to focus only on the preferred alternative. 7.1 Changes Since the Draft EIS There have been no changes in the project setting or regulatory context or new technical studies since the Draft EIS that affect the cumulative impacts analysis. There have been no new past actions or future anticipated actions identified relevant to the cumulative impacts analysis. Changes in the project are described in Section 2.3.1. The resulting changes in direct or indirect project impacts are described in Chapters 3 through 6 and have been considered in relation to the cumulative impacts discussed in Section 7.2. 7.2 Impacts of the Preferred Alternative and Mitigation This section addresses the resource areas for which the proposed project will cause direct or indirect impacts and for which past and other anticipated future actions will also be expected to cause impacts. Only those issue areas which are directly or indirectly impacted by both the US 53 project and past and/or other anticipated future projects are discussed below. The following future projects were identified through coordination with jurisdictions and landowners in the study area (Table 7.2-1 of the Draft EIS provides additional detail): ■ General development of parcels on the north side of MN 135, west of MN 37 in the Gilbert area (proposer: City of Gilbert) ■ Existing and potential future mining and mining related-activities within the permit to mine and environmental setting boundaries (proposer: UTAC/RGGS) ■ Continued mining and mining-related activities within the permit to mine area and environmental setting boundary to the southwest, including closing Co. 101 west of Eveleth for a mine crossing (proposer: UTAC) ■ Expansion of Minntac mine in Mountain Iron (proposer: Minntac) ■ Reconfiguration of water supply systems in Virginia (proposer: City of Virginia) ■ Expansion of the Iron Range Off-Highway Vehicle Recreation Area (OHVRA) east of Virginia (proposer: Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR)) 7.2.1 Recreational Lands and Trails Impacts of the Preferred Alternative Impacts to the OHVRA by the preferred alternative are expected to be negligible (acquisition of property that has no impact on recreational use, features, or attributes). Impacts of Past/Future Projects Permitted mining activity will directly affect/eliminate portions of the Mesabi Trail and local snowmobile trails at the time when RGGS terminates license agreements for trail use. RGGS, MnDOT, and the St. Louis and Lake Counties Regional Railroad Authority (SLLCRRA) will coordinate the closure of the trails with construction activities, keeping the trails open as long as possible. No mitigation is stipulated in the current agreement with these users. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS There are no known impacts planned to the OHVRA by other projects. Cumulative Impacts/Mitigation Future mining would eliminate the trail section across the mine. The Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) has made allowance for the future Mesabi Trail to parallel the new road alignment between the new Landfill Road access and the existing trail segment west of the Rouchleau Pit. The trail on the bridge will be a 14-foot wide shared use trail for pedestrians and snowmobiles. With this accommodation, there will still be a gap in the trail between the new and old Landfill Road access points. SLLCRRA has identified an old railroad corridor under its ownership that crosses through the OHVRA and could be used make a connection between the Landfill Road end of the trail accommodated on the US 53 bridge and the existing trail within the OHVRA. SLLCRRA has surface rights to the rail corridor and is willing to realign the trail to this location. The trail segment will be constructed as part of the project but funded by state bonds through SLLCRRA. It will restore the Mesabi Trail connection between Virginia and Gilbert. Impacts to the Trail Hawks Snowmobile Club Trail Spur as a result of the mining operation will also be mitigated with the accommodation of the shared used trail on the bridge across the Rouchleau Pit, maintaining the connection to Eveleth. The trail realignment is being coordinated between MnDOT, SLLCRRA, DNR, and others. As noted, the trail connection is on SLLCRRA property and avoids further impact to the OHVRA. 7.2.2 Economics Impacts of the Preferred Alternative The US 53 project is anticipated to have no economic impacts to the local economy. The potential risk to private mining has been reduced by routing the alignment around the current permit to mine area and has limited risk to mineral resources by running the alignment along Landfill Road, which is near the southeast edge of the Biwabik Iron Formation. From a public land mining perspective, the preferred alternative could restrict access to substantial quantities of ferrous resources, which could affect the long-term viability of the mining near the new roadway. However, the preferred alternative avoids the current permit to mine boundary approved for mining activity. MnDOT has identified mitigation measures for its contribution to this potential impact (Section 4.2 of the Draft EIS provides more detail regarding business mitigation). Impacts of Past/Future Projects Past mining activity in the area has affected the local economy through employment, induced development, and retail and property expenditures. Permits exist or are planned for continued mining in the area in the future (20 to 30 years). This will continue to stimulate the local economy by providing employment opportunities and drawing more workers, who will in turn spend more money in the area. The Taconite Production Tax also provides a significant contribution to the local economy. Cumulative Impacts/Mitigation If the mine cannot meet ambient air quality standards, this could limit mining operations, thereby limiting economic potential of the mine and in turn the amount of Taconite Production Tax generated. MnDOT reduced its risk to mine operation through the road alignment avoiding the permit to mine boundary and skirting the edge of the ore formation. Potential and other future anticipated actions increase access to businesses in the area and expand the base of potential local consumers. These developments will be reviewed by appropriate City staff, and mitigation for impacts to wetlands, surface waters, and other regulated resources will be provided. No further mitigation is required. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS 7.2.3 Community Connections Impacts of the Preferred Alternative Impacts to connectivity and travel times will not be substantial for the preferred alternative. Impacts of Past/Future Projects In general, past and future planned projects have not and are not anticipated to create substantial reroutes or lengthen travel or emergency response times, except for the expected closure of Co. 101 to through traffic, just west of Eveleth, by 2024. UTAC has indicated that mining in this area will require a portion of Co. 101 to close and has not indicated whether the road alignment will be replaced. Connectivity between cities in the area is not anticipated to be affected by any of the other future projects. Cumulative Impacts/Mitigation Community connections will only be affected by the future closure of Co. 101. The traffic and economic sections of the Draft EIS address the potential cumulative impacts to these resources. No potential mitigation other than project mitigation described in Section 4.7.4 of the Draft EIS has been identified. 7.2.4 Utilities Impacts of the Preferred Alternative MnDOT’s proposed action is driven by the RGGS existing easement agreement area terms, which require MnDOT to relocate US 53 from the existing easement agreement area. As a result, the impact to the utilities within this existing easement agreement area is the termination of the easement and subsequent termination of the utility permits. Utility relocation will be required for the preferred alternative; however, given the advanced time for planning and reconstruction of utilities, this is not anticipated to cause major interruptions in service. Impacts of Past/Future Projects Mining is the activity that is requiring utility relocation. Any future development identified that requires service from the utility providers will coordinate service directly with utility owners. Cumulative Impacts/Mitigation Effects of future projects, combined with natural population growth, may cumulatively add to the demands on the customer base of utilities in the study area. To meet any increased demand of utilities from anticipated future development and the other anticipated future projects, providers will plan appropriately through their regular planning processes. No further mitigation is required. 7.2.5 Water Supply/Groundwater Impacts of the Preferred Alternative The preferred alternative will be within Virginia’s Inner Emergency Response Area, which is an area more susceptible to drinking water contamination due to contaminant releases or other threats. Best management practices (BMPs) implemented by MnDOT will minimize potential water quality impacts. The Rouchleau Pit water will continue to be monitored by the City for turbidity and other contaminants. Impacts of Past/Future Projects Past mining activity in the area has required extensive dewatering and changes to area water levels. Expansion of the UTAC mine or potential southwest expansion of the ArcelorMittal/Minorca mine into the Rouchleau Pit has been identified by the City and the mine operator(s) as a potential future impact to the existing water supply. As mining activity approaches the Rouchleau Pit, at some point dewatering will be necessary to allow for mine operations, resulting in a drop in the water level of the Rouchleau Pit. The city of Virginia relies on the pit for drinking water, so the water supply will need to be assessed as part of mining activities that could affect that pit. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS Cumulative Impacts/Mitigation MnDOT will implement mitigation measures to minimize and avoid potential impacts to Rouchleau Pit water quality. The mining impact to the water supply will not occur within the same timeframe as the roadway relocation project. Mitigation for potential water quality impacts for the US 53 project and for future mining activity will be provided, as required by National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) and other permit requirements. Impacts related to road and mine activities on water levels will be addressed through respective DNR water appropriation permits. No further mitigation is required. 7.2.6 Waterbody Modifications and Wetlands Impacts of the Preferred Alternative The preferred alternative will have an impact on 15.49 acres of wetlands, 9.96 acres of which are regulated permanent wetland impacts. Temporary wetland impacts (0.75 acres) will be restored after construction. These impacts include those associated with the removal of the roadway within the easement agreement area. It also has the potential to temporarily affect the body of water in the Rouchleau Pit during bridge construction. Impacts of Past/Future Projects Past and current mining activity in the area has required extensive dewatering and has changed water levels in surrounding surface waters, including wetlands. Future mining in the study area may include dewatering of the Rouchleau Pit and expansion of mining between the Auburn and Rouchleau Pits. This may have the potential to impact adjacent wetlands and waterbodies; however, without a specific mining plan these impacts cannot be certain. Past mine dewatering may have also affected water quality in downstream waters (i.e., Manganika Lake is high in methyl mercury). Cumulative Impacts/Mitigation Past mining and filling of the Rouchleau Pit and future mining and dewatering of the Rouchleau Pit could result in a lower water elevation in the pit. The preferred alternative will cross the pit with a bridge, avoiding most impacts to the pit. US 53 wetland impacts will be mitigated consistent with obtained wetland, NPDES, and appropriation permits/approvals. Under current state and federal laws, the mine operator/owner will be required to determine if the affected wetland areas are jurisdictional or regulated and to obtain the appropriate approvals and replacement required, similar to the US 53 project. The extent of potential impacts to wetlands by mining activities cannot be estimated without a mining plan (which provides information such as depth and amount of dewatering), and such a plan does not currently exist. However, the impacts will be mitigated so there will be no cumulative impact on wetlands. Construction dewatering impacts from the US 53 project will be localized for bridge piers; temporary, if they occur; and primarily result from the volume of water transferred in a short period of time (during construction) versus mining dewatering which will drop water levels over a much longer time period (decades). Both actions will require obtaining necessary permits from the DNR and Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) and mitigate impacts to discharge/receiving waters. 7.2.7 Surface Water/Water Quantity and Quality Impacts of the Preferred Alternative The preferred alternative will result in a net increase of impervious surface of approximately three acres, and treatment of stormwater will be required. Water quality treatment of the runoff from the pit crossing areas will be necessary to maintain the existing level of water quality treatment in the study area. Stormwater ponding will be designed to meet the requirements of the NPDES permit for water quality treatment. Impacts of Past/Future Projects It will be expected that future mining expansion and highway and development projects could increase impervious area, mine dewatering discharge, and/or increase stormwater runoff. Under the preferred alternative, mining by UTAC of the existing easement agreement area will cut off the stormwater flow east September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS of the Rouchleau Pit that currently crosses along the north side of US 53, requiring rerouting of this flow to another receiving water or increase pit dewatering to compensate increased flow to the mine pit. These projects will be subject to state and federal requirements and the responsibility of the mine operator. Cumulative Impacts/Mitigation The identified past, present, and future projects may incur some level of stormwater runoff that may affect nearby surface waters. Stormwater will be regulated, and mitigation will be completed on a project-by-project basis, as required by state and federal regulations. Therefore, there will be no cumulative impact on surface water quality and stormwater given that the impacts will be mitigated. 7.2.8 Noise Impacts of the Preferred Alternative The preferred alternative will move the traffic noise source from the existing US 53 corridor to a new corridor, therefore affecting different receptors. The preferred alternative will impact two areas where noise barriers were found to be cost-effective. Benefitted receivers were given the opportunity to vote for or against construction of the noise barriers, and the voting process resulted in both walls not being constructed. Impacts of Past/Future Projects Traffic from anticipated future development projects will contribute to future traffic noise generation; however, those potential impacts have already been accounted for in the future traffic forecasts used for the US 53 traffic noise analysis. Implementation of future mine expansion projects and/or the OHVRA facility may also increase or change the location of noise generation from activities at those facilities. If noise generation exceeds regulatory thresholds, special permit conditions or implementation of mitigation may be required. For example, the DNR has source standards for off-road vehicles, and the MPCA regulates noise as per the requirements of Minnesota Rules, part 7030. Cumulative Impacts/Mitigation Each separate project will be responsible for mitigating its own noise impacts based on regulatory requirements. Also, identified future projects are far enough apart geographically and in time that any increase in noise is not likely to affect the same populations, and, therefore, cumulative effects will be minimal. 7.2.9 Vegetation/Cover Types Impacts of the Preferred Alternative The preferred alternative will result in localized loss of vegetation in some areas. No mitigation is required for these impacts other than revegetation and stabilization of disturbed areas. Impacts of Past/Future Projects Permits exist for continued mining in the area in the future. Mining activity will likely remove existing vegetation. When mining areas are abandoned, it is likely that these areas will be revegetated to the extent feasible, as was done when mining in the Rouchleau Pit was completed. Cumulative Impacts/Mitigation The implementation of the US 53 project, combined with other past/future actions, could result in a cumulative reduction in vegetative cover in the project area over time. The planned projects will be expected to adhere to erosion control and vegetation management BMPs during construction in order to limit indirect impacts to vegetative cover and habitats, and with this mitigation, minor adverse cumulative impacts are anticipated. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS 7.2.10 Hazardous Materials Impacts of the Preferred Alternative A Phase II Environmental Site Assessment was completed for four sites that are within the estimated limits of construction for the preferred alternative. A Response Action Plan (RAP) will be completed, as necessary, for the preferred alternative prior to any right-of-way acquisition or construction by MnDOT. A RAP will set a protocol for properly handling and treating contaminated soil and/or groundwater that could be handled during construction as identified in the contract special provisions or the RAP. Impacts of Past/Future Projects An assessment of hazardous materials will occur for land acquisition or disturbance as necessary for future projects. It is possible that hazardous materials may be encountered or that future projects will become generators of hazardous waste during construction or operation. Cumulative Impacts/Mitigation No cumulative impacts to hazardous waste sites are anticipated as a result of past, present, and future projects. For any project, proper agency coordination will take place to identify the appropriate plans and provisions necessary to handle known or unknown hazardous materials. A management plan will be developed for properly handling, treating, storing, and disposing of solid wastes, hazardous materials, petroleum products, and other regulated materials/wastes that are used or generated during construction. Any specific mitigation will be handled on a project-by-project basis. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS Consultation and Coordination The US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) (December 2014) is incorporated by reference and is considered part of the Final EIS. 8.1 Changes Since the Draft EIS Additional coordination has taken place with the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) and the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) since the publication of the Draft EIS regarding the additional areas evaluated (staging, snow storage, Mesabi Trail connection) and the additional species information, respectively (see Appendix C). Additional public meetings have been held since the publication of the Draft EIS, including: ■ A Draft EIS open house/public hearing on January 22, 2015 ■ A meeting for residents and businesses in the Midway neighborhood to discuss access options on February 23, 2015 ■ A meeting for residents that would be benefitted by the proposed noise walls on March 5, 2015 ■ A meeting for residents that would be benefitted by the revised proposed noise wall in the Midway area on August 3, 2015 Additional meetings have also been held with directly affected parties, including but not limited to utility owners, St. Louis and Lake Counties Regional Railroad Authority (SLLCRRA), RGGS, UTAC, Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR), Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA), cities, and property owners. Some discussion regarding property acquisitions have been initiated, and coordination regarding permits has been conducted with agencies such as the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). A Municipal Consent hearing was held on March 24, 2015 by the City of Virginia. Approval of the project was given by the City on April 28, 2015 via resolution number 15087 (see Appendix C). As part of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)/Section 404 merger process, the USACE and US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) provided concurrence with Concurrence Point #3 (preferred alternative) in letters dated February 2, 2015 and May 7, 2015, respectively (see Appendix C). The Section 404 permit application and jurisdictional determination request has been submitted by MnDOT to the USACE, and it was public noticed by the USACE on March 24, 2015 for comments to be received through April 23, 2015. One comment was received during the public notice period. USEPA provided its comment letter on the Draft EIS as its comment on the jurisdictional determination request. This letter is provided in Section 11.3 of this Final EIS. Table 5.5-1 in Chapter 5: Physical and Environmental Analysis outlines the frequent coordination and correspondence with the USACE regarding wetland delineation, impacts, and mitigation. Additional permit application details have been submitted (June 29, 2015 and August 24, 2015), including a replacement plan using 9.96 acres of banked wetland credit. On June 22, 2015, MnDOT published a Final EIS pursuant to Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 116D. The comment period for the state Final EIS concluded July 7, 2015. Two comment letters were received and are provided in Appendix C. 8.2 Consultation and Coordination Chapter 8 of the Draft EIS discusses the process used to involve stakeholders in the Scoping process and preparation of the Draft EIS. Included in this process was coordination with cooperating agencies (USACE September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS and USEPA), environmental agencies, tribes, and a project advisory committee. There were also a number of public open houses, visual quality stakeholder meetings, and monthly Coffee and Conversation meetings at the MnDOT Virginia office since May 2013 to provide brief updates on the project and to allow for questions and answers from the public. Information on the open house/public hearing held on January 22, 2015 at the Mountain Iron Community Center and responses to comments received during the comment period on the Draft EIS can be found in Chapter 11: Responses to Comments on the Draft Environmental Impact Statement. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS Cost Analysis The US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) (December 2014) is incorporated by reference and is considered part of the Final EIS. Parts of Chapter 9 from the Draft EIS are repeated here, but sections have been abbreviated. 9.1 Changes Since the Draft EIS The cost estimates for the preferred alternative have been further evaluated as final design has progressed, and the estimated project costs remain in the cost range previously identified and listed below. The changes in project description, additional right-of-way acquisition and relocation, and noise walls, described in previous chapters of the Final EIS, have been factored into the cost estimate. 9.2 Capital Costs 9.2.1 Capital Costs of the Preferred Alternative There are a number of factors that were included in developing a preliminary estimate of costs for the preferred alternative. These included estimates for: ■ Construction: includes preliminary estimates for mobilization, removals, excavation, materials (i.e., pavement, aggregate), traffic control/signing and striping, storm sewer and drainage, turf establishment and erosion control, bridges, culverts, retaining walls, noise walls, lighting, and traffic signals, and other miscellaneous construction costs. Also includes 12 percent for professional services necessary to complete construction. Construction costs were inflated to 2015 dollars to reflect anticipated year of construction. ■ Right-of-Way/Land/Mitigation: includes estimated right-of-way acquisition (permanent; in perpetuity), relocation costs, air quality mitigation, mine operating expenses, mineral rights, and other compensation Estimates for unit costs were reviewed and evaluated based on identified risks for cost variation, and a Monte Carlo simulation1 was used to develop estimated cost ranges for each alternative based on these risks. Specific unit costs for ferrous and non-ferrous resources were not available at the time of this estimate and therefore were not specifically included; however, the cost ranges were set to cover a range of risks associated with these and other unknown costs and/or variability in cost factors. The cost range for the preferred alternative is separated into the construction and right-of-way/land/ mitigation cost categories described above and is provided in Table 9.1-1. The range shown is based on 30 to 60 percent design and information available at the time of Final EIS preparation. Additional cost factors, such as operation and maintenance costs, have not been included in these estimates at this time. The Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) has evaluated the potential quantity and quality of ferrous and non-ferrous metallic resources within the path of the preferred alternative for property negotiation purposes. The results of this analysis can be made public after negotiations and the acquisition are complete. 1 Monte Carlo simulation is a computerized mathematical technique that allows for risk in quantitative analysis and decision making to be taken into account. It furnishes the decision-maker with a range of possible outcomes and the probabilities they will occur for any choice of action. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS Table 9.1-1. Range of Total Capital Costs for Construction of the Preferred AlternativeA, B Construction Cost  Right of Way/Land/Mitigation Cost  Total Capital Costs for Construction  $165-215 million  $15-25 million  $180-240 million  A Based on 2014 dollars; construction costs inflated to 2015 dollars. Does not include costs for maintenance/operation. B The cost range includes the additional $4 million to construct the Interchange Option rather than the Intersection Option. The description of the preferred alternative below is provided to illustrate the assumed components for the basis for project cost estimate. Changes to the design assumptions may occur as more information becomes known and as higher levels of engineering design are undertaken. 9.2.1.1 Preferred Alternative Description The preferred alternative routes to the east, avoiding the active United Taconite (UTAC) mine boundary; however, it will require construction over the Rouchleau Pit. The Rouchleau Pit crossing is accommodated by a bridge structure. The bridge structure will cross between the east and west sides of the pit with abutments built high atop the presumed bedrock ridges at each side. For intermediate support within the 1,100-foot bridge length, two tall support piers 180 feet or taller will extend down to pile supported foundations built at approximately the existing water level elevation. The preferred alternative preliminary cost estimate includes the following layout assumptions: ■ US 53 reconstruction length of approximately 15,000 feet ■ MN 135/US 53 interchange includes a compressed diamond configuration with one bridge, full access ramps, and a 25 percent contingency ■ Access to 2nd Avenue is provided via an at-grade, signalized intersection ■ Single, three span, 1,100-foot long steel plate girder bridge ■ Bridge crosses over the existing Rouchleau Pit ■ Extent of mined fill placed over bedrock within the pit is unknown. For determination of foundation piling lengths, estimate assumes a bedrock elevation at approximately 1,200 feet. 9.3 Project Delivery Method MnDOT is using the Construction Manager/General Contractor (CMGC) project delivery method for roadway construction for this project. CMGC project delivery allows an owner (MnDOT) to engage a construction manager during the design process to provide constructability input. The CMGC contracting method offers benefits to MnDOT in terms of innovation, value, and speed. The CMGC construction manager and the final design team has been selected for the project and will be working on design plans through 2015. At approximately an average of 60 percent to 90 percent design completion, the owner and the construction manager negotiate a “guaranteed maximum price” for the construction of the project based on the defined scope and schedule. If this price is within 10 percent of an independent estimate, a contract is executed for construction services, and the construction manager becomes the general contractor.2 If the price is not within 10 percent, MnDOT prepares a variance report and tries to reconcile differences in pricing assumptions for items of work that differ by more than 10 percent. If reconciliation is possible, changes to the cost model and baseline schedule are made. If reconciliation is not possible, the CMGC contract could be terminated and the project procured through another method, or management could be consulted on the option to award the contract. Although the CMGC construction manager’s scope of work includes providing technical assistance during the NEPA process, the construction manager does not have any role in the preparation of NEPA documentation or any decision-making responsibility with respect to the NEPA process. The CMGC 2 http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/construction/cqit/cm.cfm September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS contract includes appropriate provisions ensuring that all environmental and mitigation measures identified in the NEPA document are implemented. MnDOT will use a “green sheet” tracking system to document and manage all environmental and design commitments made for the US 53 project through the EIS and permit review process. Appendix E provides the green sheets developed for the preferred alternative to date, and will be updated as permits are obtained. 9.4 Available Funding 9.4.1 Estimate of Cost The estimated total project cost of the preferred alternative (in 2015 dollars) is $180 to $240 million. 9.4.2 Anticipated Funding The funds allocated for the proposed project (SP 6918-80, SP 6918-84, and SP 6918-86) are a combination of federal and state funds. ■ Federal: $30 million (National Highway Performance Program – NHPP) ■ State Trunk Highway Bonds: $60 million (Chapter 152); up to $140 million (Chapter 5) ■ State General Obligation Bonds: $19.5 million These funds will be used for right-of-way, preliminary engineering, and construction. Of the $140 million of Trunk Highway Bonds, MnDOT currently has $94 million in the approved Fiscal Year 2016 State Transportation Improvement Program (STIP) for preliminary engineering and initial construction. Combined, these funding sources cover the anticipated range in capital costs for this project. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS Summary of Mitigation The US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) (December 2014) is incorporated by reference and is considered part of the Final EIS. This Final EIS has described the transportation, social, natural, and physical environmental impacts associated with the construction and operation of the preferred alternative for US 53 Virginia to Eveleth project. The effects of the preferred alternative, which includes the Interchange Option and Straight Option from the Draft EIS, were evaluated comparatively across a range of subject areas related to the built and natural environment.

The document was available for review in hard copy at local libraries and local government offices and was available in electronic format on the project website. The public comment period for the Draft EIS extended from December 22, 2014 to February 5, 2015. An open house/public hearing was held on January 22, 2015. Attendees of the open house/public hearing were invited to provide comments on the proposed project through comment forms or oral statements to a court reporter. Comments were received from five government agencies and 12 members of the public. Responses to these comments are provided in this chapter in the following order: ■ US Army Corps of Engineers ■ US Department of Interior ■ US Environmental Protection Agency ■ Minnesota Department of Natural Resources ■ Minnesota Pollution Control Agency ■ Public Comments All comments received on the Draft EIS were considered in identifying the preferred alternative and in the development of the Final EIS. Two commenters (the US Environmental Protection Agency and one member of the public) expressed a preference regarding the Straight Option and the Curved Setback Option; both preferred the Straight Option. Where appropriate, text has been incorporated into the Final EIS in response to comments on the Draft EIS. As such, responses to comments refer to relevant sections of the Final EIS. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS 11.1 US Army Corps of Engineers September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS Response to Comment A: Section 4.5 of the Draft EIS described the potential for future development in the area of the new intersection at 2nd Avenue and the interchange at MN 135 as limited due to the location of the mine boundary, ore formation, and topography. The Draft EIS concluded that the preferred alternative would not cause noticeable change in land use within the study area. Mining in the existing easement agreement area would commence and be active for a number of decades, which is consistent with local and regional comprehensive plans. The Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) will purchase surface and mineral rights where needed to preserve the roadway in perpetuity. Therefore, the potential for future relocation of the roadway should be minimized, and the cost/impact of relocation would not be borne by MnDOT. The preferred alternative avoids the current permit to mine boundary, minimizing conflicts with mining. Cumulative effects of reasonably foreseeable mining are addressed in Chapter 7 of the Draft EIS. Given no new impacts have been identified, the impact summary table has not been revised for land use impacts. Response to Comment B: MnDOT has been in coordination with the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) regarding listed species. Information and evaluation of the gray wolf has been added to Chapter 5 of the Final EIS. Correspondence with USFWS is included in Appendix C. Response to Comment C: Construction of the bridge over the Rouchleau Pit will require floating barge platforms, temporary coffer dams for dewatering around the two pier locations, and silt curtain/containment devices. The quantities and detail of the pier type/size and the materials to be used will be determined during final design with input of the contractor, Construction Manager/General Contractor (CMGC), and MnDOT. Final design commenced in March 2015 and will continue through August 2015 for the bridge, with construction anticipated to start in September. Design details, to the extent they are known, have been provided to the US Army Corps of Engineers during the review of the wetland permit application. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS Response to Comment D: MnDOT is in the process of negotiating acquisition of surface and mineral (ferrous) rights for the right-of-way needed to preserve the roadway in perpetuity via fee acquisition and permanent easement. Acquiring both the surface and mineral rights means that MnDOT cannot be forced to move the new roadway. It is possible that a mining company could offer to buy the surface and mineral rights under the new road alignment and pay to relocate the road, but MnDOT would have to choose to accept that arrangement. MnDOT’s cost estimates included estimated values for acquiring mineral rights via permanent easement. Response to Comment E: The refined alignment for the preferred alternative is described in Chapter 2 of the Final EIS. The Straight Option is now included as part of the preferred alternative. Appendix B provides the current layout and profile. Final design commenced in March 2015, and design adjustments will continue through the end of the year and into 2016, resulting in two construction packages, one for the large bridge and one for the remainder of the project work. Response to Comment F: A Level 2 delineation has been conducted and used to further refine wetland impact quantities and update the permit application. Temporary wetland impacts have been identified in the permit application/wetland replacement plan submitted to the USACE (Appendix F). No indirect impacts to wetlands or other aquatic resources have been identified as a result of this project. Response to Comment G: MnDOT appreciates the US Army Corps of Engineers concurrence on the preferred alternative. It will continue coordination with the Corps regarding the final impact assessment and mitigation plan, including the final step in the NEPA/Section 404 concurrence process (Concurrence Point #4). September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS 11.2 US Department of Interior September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS Response to Comment A: MnDOT appreciates the Department of Interior reviewing the de minimis determination. It has been noted in the Final EIS that there will be negligible impacts to the activities, features, and attributes of the Iron Range Off-Highway Vehicle Recreation Area (OHVRA), a Section 4(f) resource, consistent with a de minimis determination. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS 11.3 US Environmental Protection Agency September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS Response to Comment A: A reformatted summary table of Draft EIS alternatives and impacts is included in Appendix H as requested, which adds a column for the Existing US 53 Alternative. It was clearly noted in the Draft EIS as an introduction to the tables in question that the Existing US 53 Alternative had no resource impacts except the cost to buy mineral rights and thus was not included in the table. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS Response to Comment B: A reformatted summary table of Draft EIS alternatives and impacts is included in Appendix H as requested, which adds a column for the Straight and Curved Setback Options. Response to Comment C: Comment noted. MnDOT has included the Straight Option as part of the preferred alternative. Response to Comment D: MnDOT is in the process of negotiating acquisition of surface and mineral rights for the right-of-way needed to preserve the roadway in perpetuity via fee acquisition and permanent easement. Mineral rights are needed from three landowners including RGGS, DNR, and Penobscot Iron Ore, LLC. Acquiring both the surface and mineral rights means that MnDOT cannot be forced to move the new roadway. It is possible that a mining company could offer to buy the surface and mineral rights under the new road alignment and pay to relocate the road, but MnDOT would have to choose to accept that arrangement. MnDOT’s cost estimates included estimated values for acquiring mineral rights via permanent easement. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS Response to Comment E: Since the Draft EIS was published, there has been further coordination between MnDOT, DNR, and SLLCRRA regarding the future Mesabi Trail alignment in order to facilitate trail continuity between the severed trail sections that would result from mining activity in the easement agreement area. MnDOT has made allowance for the future Mesabi Trail to parallel the new US 53 alignment between the new Landfill Road access and the existing trail segment west of the Rouchleau Pit. As described in the Final EIS (Section 2.3.1), the Mesabi Trail connection has been identified on an old railroad corridor owned by SLLCRRA that would fill the remaining gap in the trail between the new and old Landfill Road access points. The realigned Mesabi Trail would accommodate pedestrians, bicycles, and snowmobiles. Two box culverts will also be constructed by MnDOT as part of this project to provide grade separation for the new trail crossings at MN 135 and at Landfill Road. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS Response to Comment F: Section 5.5 of the Final EIS identifies the latest estimate of wetland impact based on changes to the preferred alternative, Level 2 delineation, and minor changes to the construction limits. As a result of project changes between the time the Water Resources Technical Report (November 2013) and Draft EIS (December 2014) were completed, neither document provides accurate estimates at this time. Thus, rather than repeating outdated information, Section 5.5 of the Final EIS presents wetland impact estimates that were submitted to the US Army Corps of Engineers as part of the Section 404 permit application in June 2015 and supplemental information in August 2015. Response to Comment G: Table 5.5-1 in the Final EIS presents the acres of wetland impact to two decimal places. Response to Comment H: A reformatted summary table of Draft EIS alternatives and impacts, including wetland impacts, is included in Appendix H, as requested. Response to Comment I: Consistent with state and federal requirements, wetlands have not and will not be proposed for use as stormwater pollution prevention devices. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS Response to Comment J: See the explanation of the areas of evaluation in Section 2.3.5 of the Draft EIS that explains why impacts in the table may not match the potential impact areas shown within the areas of evaluation on Figure 5.4-1 of the Draft EIS. The scale of the figure will not change how the impacts are shown. Figures 4-1 through 4-17 in Volume 2 of the permit application (see Appendix F), which was submitted with the US Army Corps of Engineers permit application, illustrate the current estimated impact of the preferred alternative. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS Response to Comment K: The requested information has been submitted to the US Army Corps of Engineers (March and June 2015) for review and to determine jurisdiction. That application information is included in Appendix F. Response to Comment L: The Draft EIS document is being updated via this condensed Final EIS; therefore, a revised call out box is not included. However, a reference has been added to the beginning of Chapter 5 referring the reader to the various water-resource related sections, including the utilities section. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS Response to Comment M: This modification is noted in Section 5.6 of the Final EIS. Manganika Lake does not receive all of the surface water runoff from the project area, and the preferred alignment is not expected to exacerbate the existing impairments that the MPCA has identified for the lake. Response to Comment N: This modification is noted in Section 5.6 of the Final EIS. A SWPPP will be prepared for the project, including the disturbed area that is tributary to Manganika Lake and Creek. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS Response to Comment O: Figure 5.5-2 has been added to illustrate existing flow patterns, which have been updated since the Drat EIS. Response to Comment P: Existing and proposed drainage area mapping has been prepared (see Figure 5.5-2 and Appendix B, respectively). Mining excavation of the existing alignment will ultimately change the drainage conditions such that stormwater is conveyed into the one or both of the pits. As a result, that stormwater would be managed in conformance with the mining operations’ industrial stormwater permit. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS Response to Comment Q: Notices and ballots were mailed to benefited receivers on February 18, 2015, with notice of a public open house to be held on March 5, 2015. The City of Virginia also distributed flyers door-to-door regarding the open house for the benefited receivers. Additional effort was made to reach residents and owners of properties that did not respond to mailed ballots. MnDOT conducted door knocking on two separate occasions and hand delivered ballots to unresponsive properties. For properties that were vacant, extra effort was made to reach out to property owners in order to obtain a partial vote for the property. Refinements of the noise analysis during the project development process show that an additional seven properties along the south end of Mesabi Drive will receive a noise benefit from the proposed noise wall. As a result, a second open house was held on August 3, 2015 for these benefited receivers and each was given the opportunity to vote on whether they want a noise wall. With the refined analysis, MnDOT also determined that four parcels previously identified as benefitted receivers would not benefit from the proposed noise barrier design. These receivers were also notified that their voting status had changed. The letter notification, ballot, benefitted receiver maps, open house flyer, and voting results are included in Appendix G. Further details regarding the noise assessment update and notification/voting process are described in Section 5.8 of the Final EIS. Response to Comment R: The Curved Setback Option has been dismissed since the Draft EIS was published. Impacts of the Curved Setback Option can be seen in the reformatted summary table of Draft EIS alternatives and impacts included in Appendix H. The estimated vegetation impacts of the preferred alternative are described in Section 5.10 of the Final EIS. Response to Comment S: MnDOT will follow the guidance of the USFWS with regard to tree removal as it relates to the northern long-eared bat. The majority of land in the project vicinity not in urban or wetland use is in forest vegetation. Therefore, there would be minimal benefit to wildlife and/or water quality from MnDOT voluntarily planting trees in the project vicinity. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS Response to Comment T: New information from the northern long-eared bat study has been added to Section 5.12 of the Final EIS. MnDOT will follow the guidance of the USFWS with regard to tree removal as it relates to the northern long-eared bat. Response to Comment U: Impacts of the preferred alternative on climate change are discussed in Section 5.16. As discussed in Section 5.6.3, detention ponds for the project have been designed per the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Atlas 14 precipitation data per MnDOT’s recently changed design standard. Atlas 14 consists of updated precipitation data from weather stations nearest the project site and generally increases the design storm events for each frequency compared to previous rainfall intensity values. Response to Comment V: While there is no current regulatory requirement to address greenhouse gas emissions in environmental documents, MnDOT is currently working with contractors on possible approaches for addressing construction equipment emissions. MnDOT will use feedback from a diesel construction equipment survey of contractors to evaluate ways to reduce construction emissions including incentives, education and outreach, promoting the use of federal grant funding for diesel retrofitting, and consideration of a pilot project to reduce idling. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS 11.4 Minnesota Department of Natural Resources September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS Response to Comment A: MnDOT looks forward to reaching an agreement with the DNR on ferrous and non-ferrous resource values. Response to Comment B: Thank you for your review and comment. Concurrence is consistent with FHWA and Department of Interior findings. Response to Comment C: MnDOT is assessing the feasibility of a shared motorized/non-motorized trail on the bridge. A 14-foot wide shared trail on the bridge is anticipated, which will widen to a separated 8-foot paved pedestrian trail and a 12-foot gravel snowmobile/ATV trail off the bridge. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS Response to Comment D: See response to comment C above. Response to Comment E: The preferred alternative (Alternative E-2) does not require extensive dewatering and will not impact other surface waters or fisheries. Response to Comment F: The purpose of the water discharged to Bailey and Virginia Lakes is to maintain water levels in the lakes, not temperature, as noted by the DNR. Section 5.2.2 of the Draft EIS correctly states, “The pumping system can also divert water flow into Sauntry Creek system to supplement flow to Bailey and Silver Lakes.” Correction noted regarding the VPU discharge; it is not intended to maintain ambient temperatures in Bailey and Silver Lakes. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS 11.5 Minnesota Pollution Control Agency September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS Response to Comment A: Thank you for your review and comment. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS 11.6 Public Comments September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS Response to Comment A: See Section 4.4 of the Final EIS for a description of the trail plan. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS Response to Comment B: MnDOT will implement winter maintenance operations that include snow removal from the bridge after snow events to minimize the amount of runoff from the bridge. Snow will not be plowed over the sides of the bridge. The bridge design will also include features that carry runoff over the expansion joints to prevent direct runoff from the bridge into the pit. Runoff from the east bridge approach will be collected on the east side of the bridge to minimize flow crossing the bridge/pit. Similarly, stormwater pond(s) are planned on the west side of the bridge. All drainage from the bridge will be carried to the west side and into the stormwater system, which will ultimately flow to the same location to which the existing highway flows today. Response to Comment C: MnDOT has evaluated both a friction course and an anti-icing system for the bridge. A friction course consists of gluing small rock chips to the concrete deck with epoxy to enhance traction. Anti-icing systems spray magnesium chloride on the deck. This method is expensive, corrosive to concrete and steel, adds extra chlorides to the environment, and is maintenance-intensive to keep operating. Therefore, MnDOT has elected to place a friction course on the deck. Response to Comment D: This issue is being analyzed by geotechnical and bridge design engineers and appropriate measures are being taken into the bridge design as well as right-of-way setbacks. The bridge will be designed with consideration of future mining activity near the bridge to ensure blasting effects will not compromise the support of the bridge. MnDOT will also implement setback agreements with RGGS that will protect the integrity of the bridge from blasting and flyrock. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS Response to Comment E: The preferred alternative is Alternative E-2 with the Interchange Option. One signalized intersection at 2nd Avenue is included in the project. No stop signs will be used on the through lanes of US 53. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS Response to Comment F: See Section 4.4 of the Final EIS for a description of the trail plan. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS Response to Comment G: See Section 4.4 of the Final EIS for a description of the trail plan. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS Response to Comment H: See Section 4.4 of the Final EIS for a description of the trail plan. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS Response to Comment I: See Section 4.4 of the Final EIS for a description of the trail plan. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS Response to Comment J: MnDOT has considered safety in preliminary design of the bridge by minimizing the slope on the bridge and avoiding use of a curved structure. MnDOT has elected to place a “friction course” on the deck to enhance traction. This consists of gluing small rock chips to the concrete deck with epoxy. MnDOT has also planned for spill containment measures by designing the bridge to have no direct drainage into the Rouchleau Pit. All stormwater runoff from the road and bridge will be collected in areas where emergency containment can be implemented if necessary. With regards to the cost of a bridge versus fill, the Draft EIS (Section 2.3.5) described the differences in constructability issues. The volume of fill alone is prohibitive given the depth of the pit combined with the length and width of fill that would be needed, as well as the concerns with that much filing activity within a half-mile of the water supply intake. The longevity of the bridge structure should exceed 75 years. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS Response to Comment K: MnDOT has looked extensively at the intersection of US 53 and Landfill Road. Acceleration lanes are not justified by current design standards; in addition, the very narrow right-of-way does not provide room for including acceleration lanes. A northbound right turn lane and a southbound left turn lane to Landfill Road will be constructed. The proposed design meets current design standards for traffic safety considering traffic volumes, speed, and grade. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS Response to Comment L: Thank you for your review and comment. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS Response to Comment M: The Straight Option has been selected as part of the preferred alternative. The Curved Setback Option has been dismissed as described in Section 2.3 of the Final EIS. Response to Comment N: The Straight Option does reuse much of the existing route of US 53/MN 135 exit ramp for the preferred alternative. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS Response to Comment O: The reasons the western alternative was dismissed were explained in detail in Sections 2.1 and 2.2 of the Draft EIS and summarized in Section 2.1.1 of the Final EIS. This decision was supported by an extensive economic study that indicated severe impacts would result from the western alternative. The reasons for selection of the preferred alternative were provided in Section 10.3 of the Draft EIS and in Section 2.3 of the Final EIS. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth STATE PROJECTS SP 6918-80, SP 6918-84, AND SP 6918-86 FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT/RECORD OF DECISION SEPTEMBER 2015 Publication under 42 USC 4332(2)(c) and 49 USC 303 Record of Decision Introduction Since May 1960, the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) has operated a segment of US Highway 53 (US 53) on an easement granted by United States Steel Corporation (US Steel, now RGGS Land and Minerals Co., or RGGS). This roughly one and a half mile segment of US 53, from approximately 2nd Avenue West to Cuyuna Drive in Virginia, Minnesota, is subject to iron ore mining rights held by RGGS and Cliffs Natural Resources (United Taconite Division, herein referred to as UTAC), the mine’s owner and operator, respectively. At its east end, the US 53 easement segment connects with Minnesota Trunk Highway 135 (MN 135), which provides the inter-regional link toward Gilbert and other communities to the east. Under the 1960 easement terms, MnDOT agreed to relocate US 53 upon notice from the mine owner/operator. On May 5, 2010, UTAC and RGGS provided notice to MnDOT that the 1960 easement rights would be terminated. Under the original easement terms, MnDOT must vacate the US 53 easement within three years of notification. In response to the notice, MnDOT requested a seven-year timeframe for relocation of US 53. The two parties have signed an agreement to modify the easement vacation date to May 2017. The current project schedule anticipates construction will be complete in the fall of 2017. MnDOT will negotiate with RGGS and UTAC to extend the easement agreement to a date that coincides with the end of construction. In the unlikely event that negotiations are unsuccessful, traffic would be detoured along MN 37, Co. 7, and US 169. Impacts would be temporary and would be similar to the No Build Alternative while the detour is in place (see a summary of impacts for the No Build Alternative in Appendix H). MnDOT will continue outreach to the public regarding status of construction plans and detours, as necessary. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT), as joint lead agencies, are proposing relocating the segment of US 53 within the existing easement agreement area. The preferred alternative generally follows existing US 53 from the south end of the Midway neighborhood to the MN 135 exit ramp for the start of new four-lane construction. The new alignment then continues on a northeasterly track on the present day Landfill Road before turning to the west to cross over the Rouchleau Pit via a bridge. The pit is approximately 250 feet deep at the crossing location, and the bridge would span approximately 1,100 feet with 180-foot or taller bridge piers within the pit. Upon crossing the pit, the preferred alternative turns to the southwest following an abandoned railroad corridor that runs between the pit and residential neighborhoods before reconnecting to existing US 53 at 2nd Avenue. Approximately two and a half miles of new four-lane roadway would be constructed. The preferred alternative is the environmentally-preferred alternative. A detailed description of the preferred alternative is included in Section 2.3.1 of the Final EIS. The following are cooperating agencies for this project: ■ US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) ■ US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) The following are participating agencies for this project: ■ Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) ■ City of Gilbert ■ City of Mountain Iron ■ City of Virginia September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS ROD-1 ■ City of Eveleth The Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the US 53 project describes why the project is needed; the alternatives that were studied; the transportation, social, and environmental impacts associated with the alternatives; the public and agency outreach and coordination that occurred as part of the decision-making process; and the proposed mitigation for any anticipated impacts. The Draft EIS also identified the preferred alternative. The Draft EIS was published in the Federal Register on December 19, 2014, and the 45-day comment period extended from the date of publication to February 2, 2015. In accordance with the provisions of the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21), FHWA and MnDOT are issuing a single document that combines the Final EIS and the Record of Decision (ROD). The intent to combine these documents was provided on the signature page of the Draft EIS. After reviewing the comments received on the Draft EIS, FHWA and MnDOT jointly affirmed the decision to prepare a combined Final EIS/ROD. The Final EIS to meet the state requirements was published in June 2015 without the federal ROD, and an Adequacy Determination was made in September 2015 prior to the federal decision. Purpose and Need The purpose of the US 53 project is to address the termination of the 1960 easement agreement that affects the current highway location in order to continue to provide a transportation facility that will safely maintain adequate roadway capacity and mobility as well as local, regional, and inter-regional connectivity. The need for undertaking this project is derived from the following elements: ■ Respond to the roadway easement terms; address the requirements set forth in agreements between the State of Minnesota and the land owner ■ Provide a facility that meets regional and inter-regional system connectivity needs and inter-regional highway corridor performance targets ■ Maintain local connectivity to the regional system and maintain efficiency of local connections ■ Provide a facility that serves current and future capacity needs while maintaining system mobility and safety Alternatives Considered MnDOT initiated Scoping of alternatives in 2011. A range of project alternatives was developed based on several data sources and stakeholder feedback, including the project Purpose and Need (see Chapter 1: Purpose and Need), previous MnDOT and UTAC design concepts, and consideration of applicable technical data. The February 2012 Scoping Document/Draft Scoping Decision Document (SDD) and September 2012 Final SDD documents describe the process of developing and evaluating the Scoping alternatives in detail. The evaluation process included consideration of issues such as how well each alternative met the Purpose and Need; potential for social, economic, and/or environmental impacts; relative estimated costs; and potential engineering feasibility issues. Stakeholder input was also an important factor in the evaluation process. After the SDD was distributed in September 2012, more detailed study of the Draft EIS alternatives and their potential impacts was performed. The initial findings regarding the cost and feasibility of some of the Build Alternatives led MnDOT to 1) reconsider some Scoping alternative alignments that had been dismissed from further consideration during the 2012 Scoping process (i.e., Alternatives W-1 and E-1) and 2) assess whether minor alignment modifications to some alternatives (i.e., Alternative E-2) would make them more feasible/cost-effective. In order to add or amend alternatives to be studied in the Draft September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS ROD-2 EIS, an Amended Scoping Decision Document had to be prepared (Minnesota Rules, part 4410.2100, subpart 8). The September 2013 Amended Scoping Decision Document (ASDD) and the Alternatives Development Report (Kimley-Horn, 2014) provide details of the Scoping reassessment and the resulting decisions regarding alternatives that would be carried forward for study in the Draft EIS. The amended Scoping process alternatives and the amended Scoping decisions regarding alternatives carried forward for study in the Draft EIS are summarized in Section 2.2.2 of the Draft EIS and included five alternatives: ■ No Build Alternative (Existing Easement Agreement Area Closed) ■ Existing US 53 Alternative (Existing Easement Agreement Area Remains Open) ■ Alternative M-1 ■ Alternative E-1A ■ Alternative E-2 As the Draft EIS analysis was prepared, design details were refined as new information was obtained and decisions were made regarding construction options. These design assumptions and decisions are documented in the Alternatives Development Report (Kimley-Horn, 2014). Agencies and key stakeholders were engaged during the preparation of the Draft EIS in the development of information for the evaluation of impacts and mitigation. A detailed description of each alternative evaluated in the Draft EIS can be found in Section 2.3 of the Draft EIS. Based on the analysis conducted for and presented in the Draft EIS, MnDOT identified Alternative E-2 with the Interchange Option (interchange at US 53/MN 135) as the preferred alternative. It was recommended as the preferred alternative based on its ability to meet the project Purpose and Need and minimize impacts to social, economic, and environmental resources, and on the basis of a number of technical and cost considerations. Two alignment options were considered for Alternative E-2 in the Draft EIS between approximately Mesabi Drive and MN 135: the Straight Option and the Curved Setback Option. Both were carried forward for further refinement. Each alternative evaluated had unique and challenging issues and a combination of impacts. A summary of why the other alternatives were dismissed is provided below. For a more detailed discussion of the selection of the preferred alternative, see Section 10.3 of the Draft EIS. ■ The No Build Alternative was evaluated as the “do nothing alternative” because it was required for comparison to other alternatives. It was not identified as the preferred alternative since other Build Alternatives (i.e., M-1, E-1A, and E-2) met all of the identified project needs with less severe social, economic, and environmental impacts. ■ The Existing US 53 Alternative had substantially greater uncertainty and cost than any of the Build Alternatives; therefore, it was not selected as the preferred alternative. ■ Alternative M-1 had feasibility issues (i.e., constructability of foundations in unstable mine waste fill, frequent delays associated with construction in an active mine) and resulted in severe negative impacts that were not offset by the benefits in minimization; therefore, it was not identified as the preferred alternative. ■ The Alternative E-1A RSS Option had feasibility issues and resulted in severe schedule and constructability impacts (i.e., it is unlikely to meet the timeline due to dewatering, with substantial risks for additional delays due to weather, mine waste fill, and design requirements to mitigate constructability concerns) that were not offset by the benefits in minimization of environmental impacts; therefore, it was not identified as the preferred alternative. ■ The Alternative E-1A Bridge Option had feasibility issues and resulted in severe negative schedule impacts (i.e., it would require the greatest construction effort to meet the timeline, with substantial risks for delays due to weather, mine waste fill, and design requirements to mitigate constructability September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS ROD-3 concerns) that were not offset by the benefits in minimization of environmental impacts; therefore, it was not identified as the preferred alternative. Findings and Mitigation After publication of the Draft EIS, the Straight Option was identified as the selected option based on public and agency comments received during the Draft EIS comment period, refinement of the design, and overall environmental impacts. Other refinements in the design of the preferred alternative since the Draft EIS are described in Section 2.3.1 of the Final EIS. The Final EIS also included updated information on impacts. In the Draft EIS, impacts were calculated based on the area of evaluation for each alternative. These “areas of evaluation” were defined based on general design assumptions, estimated construction limits, potential additional right-of-way needed for stormwater management and other related transportation functions, and other design factors. In the Final EIS, impacts for the preferred alternative were recalculated based on refined construction limits and included staging areas, a snow storage area, a Mesabi Trail connection, additional property acquisition, and a new noise wall location that were not evaluated in the Draft EIS. MnDOT has worked to avoid, minimize, and mitigate the potential environmental impacts of the proposed project. This process included efforts to involve the public and agency stakeholders in the planning and design of the proposed project. The anticipated impacts of the preferred alternative are summarized in Table ROD-1 along with the proposed mitigation. Table ROD-1. Summary of Preferred Alternative Impacts and Mitigation Issue Area  Identified Impact  Mitigation Measures  Right-of-Way  ■ 203.1 acres needed for new rightof-way affecting 13 parcels ■ Includes five total parcel acquisitions, three of which require commercial relocations ■ 6.4 acres of temporary easements required on four parcels ■ Mineral rights also need to be compensated  ■ Compensate landowners via Federal Uniform Relocation Act ■ Acquire permanent easement or ownership of mineral and surface rights to reduce relocation risk ■ If a contractor chooses to pursue temporary easements for staging areas not identified in the Final EIS, standard erosion control and site management BMPs will apply to these areas  Recreational Lands  ■ Mesabi Trail and snowmobile trail will be realigned, creating new crossing points  ■ To maintain trail connection between Gilbert and Virginia, MnDOT will provide a trail permit on east side of alignment and construct the new connection between Landfill Road and the trail segment within the OHVRA ■ Snowmobile use will be allowed on bridge;

The DNR concurred with the proposed de minimis determination in a letter dated February 5, 2014, based on proposed construction limits. Three comments were received on FHWA’s intent to make a de minimis determination during the public comment period on the Draft EIS; all agreed with FHWA’s intent. Therefore, based on the information provided, FHWA finds the impact to the OHVRA is a de minimis impact. Monitoring and Enforcement FHWA and MnDOT are ultimately responsible for monitoring and enforcing mitigation measures. MnDOT and the contractor are responsible for compliance assurance of all related commitments and regulatory permit conditions made or obtained for the US 53 project. MnDOT will use a “green sheet” tracking September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS ROD-7 system to document and manage all environmental and design commitments made for the US 53 project through the EIS and permit review process (see Appendix E of the Final EIS). Draft green sheets are included in the Final EIS and will be updated throughout project construction. Conclusion The environmental record for this decision includes the following documents: ■ US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Draft Environmental Impact Statement (December 2014) ■ US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final Environmental Impact Statement (June 2015 publication under state rules) ■ US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Adequacy Determination (September 2015) ■ US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final Environmental Impact Statement (September 2015) ■ All technical reports and supporting documentation incorporated by reference into the Draft EIS and Final EIS These documents, incorporated here by reference, constitute the statements required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and Title 23 of the United States Code on: ■ The environmental impacts of the project ■ The adverse environmental effects that cannot be avoided should the project be implemented ■ Alternatives to the proposed project ■ Irreversible and irretrievable impacts on the environment that may be involved with the project should it be implemented Having carefully considered the environmental record noted above, the mitigation measures as required herein, the written and oral comments offered by other agencies and the public on this record, and the written responses to comments, FHWA has determined that the preferred alternative is also the environmentally preferred alternative. The preferred alternative represents the best option for the US 53 project. FHWA finds that all practicable measures to minimize environmental harm have been incorporated into the design of the preferred alternative. FHWA will ensure that the commitments outlined herein will be implemented as part of final design, construction contract, and post-construction monitoring. FHWA also determines that this decision is in the best overall public interest. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS ROD-8 Abstract The US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Draft Environmental Impact Statement (Draft EIS) published in December 2014 described the transportation and environmental impacts associated with the termination of easement rights for a one and a half mile segment of the US 53 corridor where it crosses the United Taconite open-pit mine between Virginia and Eveleth, Minnesota. On May 5, 2010, United Taconite (UTAC) and RGGS provided notice to the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) that the 1960 easement rights would be terminated. Under the original easement terms, MnDOT must vacate the US 53 easement within three years of notification. In response to the notice, MnDOT requested a seven-year timeframe for relocation of US 53. The two parties have signed an agreement to modify the easement vacation date to May 2017. The project is located within the Mesabi Range of the “Iron Range” of northeastern Minnesota and is set in the middle of the Quad Cities area, which includes the cities of Eveleth, Gilbert, Mountain Iron, and Virginia. This segment of US 53 is an important local and interregional transportation connection. The land use characteristics within the project area consist of large mining operations, forested land, wetlands, open space, residential areas, and commercial developments. Five potential alignments were evaluated in the Draft EIS: No Build Alternative, Existing US 53 Alternative, Alternative M-1, Alternative E-1A, and Alternative E-2. All potentially significant environmental, social, economic, and transportation benefits and impacts of the proposed alternatives were evaluated in the Draft EIS, and documentation regarding Section 4(f) recreational resource impacts was also included. The Draft EIS identified Alternative E-2 with the Interchange Option as the preferred alternative, carrying forward both the Straight Option and the Curved Setback Option for further refinement. The Straight Option has since been identified as the selected option based on public and agency comment received during the Draft EIS comment period, refinement of the design, and overall environmental impacts. This Final EIS describes the transportation and environmental impacts of the preferred alternative: Alternative E-2 (with the Interchange Option and Straight Option). This Final EIS is presented in a condensed format. This means that each chapter summarizes the changes that have occurred since the publication of the Draft EIS related to the topics covered in that chapter, including design refinements, updated policies/regulations, and updated coordination; describes the impacts of the preferred alternative; and discusses any mitigation that is required. This Final EIS also provides responses to comments received on the Draft EIS. September 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Final EIS THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK Table of Contents Record of Decision......................................................................................................................................
