document is being prepared to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) as amended. The Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) was prepared and made available for public comment from January 4, 2013 to February 25, 2013.  The comment period was extended to March 25, 2013.  A public hearing was held in Moscow on January 23, 2013. Approximately four hundred comments were received during the DEIS comment period. A summary of public involvement activities is described in Chapter 7, Public Involvement and Agency Coordination. The US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) has been prepared in accordance with the FHWA TA 6640.8A NEPA Implementation-Guidance for Preparing and Processing Environmental and Section 4(f) Documents (FHWA 1987) and FHWA and US Department of Transportation (USDOT) Right-of-way and Environment; Environmental Impact and Related Procedures [23 CFR 771]. The FEIS presents new, changed, and corrected information since the DEIS was published. It addresses substantive public comments, provides rationale for identifying the Preferred Alternative, and lists mitigation measures. The primary changes since the DEIS are listed below: • Revised the W-4 Alternative to avoid a Section 4(f) property and reflected the change throughout the FEIS.  It is now presented as the Modified W-4 Alternative • Revised the Section 4(f) Evaluation to include the Modified W-4 Alternative • Prepared an addendum to the Cultural Resource Survey Reports to evaluate the Modified W-4 Alternative • Prepared Chapter 10, Response to Comments on the DEIS • Revised Weather Analysis • Revised Safety Analysis • New Hydrogeologic Analysis • New Mobility and Road User Cost Reports • Updated Noise Analysis • Provided additional wildlife information (bumblebees, grassland birds, pygmy nuthatch, and giant Palouse earthworm) • Provided additional information regarding CRP land and matrix habitats • Provided additional information regarding invasive plants • Revised and clarified residential and business impacts • Revised descriptions of access • Updated public involvement activities Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 1 Executive Summary • Finalized mitigation measures • Provided additional detail regarding the vertical and horizontal alignment for the alternatives. • Provides public comments on the DEIS and responses to the comments The FEIS provides the lead agencies (FHWA and ITD), and a cooperating agency (the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)), with an in-depth analysis of the environmental effects of the alternatives so that an informed decision can be made.  This FEIS is also a public disclosure of the potential environmental effects of the project and identifies a Preferred Alternative.  After making its decision, and no sooner than 30 days after this FEIS is available to the public and notice of its availability has been published in the Federal Register, FHWA will issue a Record of Decision (ROD) selecting an alternative, providing the rationale for the decision and stating the mitigation measures that will be incorporated into the project. This Executive Summary provides general information regarding the proposed project and alternatives and highlights key information from chapters of this FEIS to show how the alternatives compare to each other in their benefits and effects to the natural and human environment.  ES.1.1	  Project Background In 1999, FHWA and ITD began developing an Environmental Assessment (EA) for a 20.4-mile improvement of US-95 from the Top of Lewiston Hill to Moscow. The project intent was to widen the existing highway in the southern 15.8 miles of the project and construct 4.6 miles of a new four-lane highway in the northern section. Eleven alternatives for the northern-most section of the corridor were narrowed to two. Alternative 6 would have widened along the existing highway and Alternative 10A would have constructed a four-lane highway on new alignment near the base of Paradise Ridge.  Alternative 10A was selected by ITD and FHWA and a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) was issued in May 2002. The project was litigated by the Paradise Ridge Defense Coalition, Inc. in 2003. The US District Court for the District of Idaho (Court) in the judgment for Civil Case number 03-0156-S-BLW decided that the EA and issuance of a FONSI were not appropriate. The court found that an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) would be required for the northern 4.6-mile segment between Thorncreek Road and Moscow to allow full consideration of the impacts by the public and agencies. The southern 15.8 miles was allowed to proceed and construction was completed in October 2007.  A Notice of Intent to prepare an EIS for the northern section was published in the Federal Register on November 13, 2003. See the DEIS, Chapter 1, Introduction for additional information. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 2 Executive Summary ES.1.2	  Project Location The project is located along US-95 south of the City of Moscow in Latah County, Idaho. The project begins at Thorncreek Road (MP 337.67) and continues north for 6.34 miles, ending at the South Fork Palouse River Bridge (MP 344.00). This section of US-95 travels primarily through the rolling hills and agricultural fields of the Palouse Region.  See Exhibit 1. Project Location Map. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 3 Executive Summary Exhibit	  1.	  Project	  Location	  Map ES.2	  Purpose and	  Need The purpose of this project is to improve public safety and increase highway capacity on US-95 south of Moscow between Thorncreek Road (MP 337.67) and the South Fork Palouse River Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 4 Executive Summary Bridge (MP 344.00).  Within the project limits, US-95 does not meet current American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Standards. Additional concerns include High Accident Locations (HALs) and insufficient highway capacity. The primary deficiencies of the roadway are described in detail in the DEIS, Chapter 1, Introduction and Section 3.10, Transportation. ES.2.1	  Need US-95 is part of the National Highway System (NHS), a North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) route spanning the United States from Canada to Mexico. Within Idaho, US-95 is classified as a principal arterial, providing the only continuous north-south highway connection between the Idaho Panhandle and the rest of the State. US-95 is a major route for commercial, residential, agricultural, and recreational travel through Idaho. Public Safety Horizontal Curves and Vertical Grades.  The existing highway has several horizontal curves and vertical grades that do not meet AASHTO standards.  The ascending grade on the south side of Reisenauer Hill is an approximately 4.3 percent and the descending grade on the north side of Reisenauer Hill is approximately 6 percent.  The crash statistics for the highway between 2003 and 2012 show that this section of US-95 averages 25.3 crashes per year and is expected to reach 27.4 crashes per year by 2017. Reisenauer Hill is the most prominent topographical feature the alignments go over, with the steepest grades and some of the highest crash rates. As ADTs in this segment continue to increase and the two-lane highway reaches capacity, these conditions are expected to worsen. Crashes. High Accident Locations (HALs) are based on the past three years of crash data and change annually.  Three HALs are located in the project limits based on the DEIS crash data. These segments have the highest crash rates in ITD District 2 and ranked in the top 13 of Idaho State HALs.  See Table 1. High Accident Locations (HALs).  Table	  1.	  High	  Accident	  Locations	  (HALs) Milepost Location on US 95  Idaho 	  HAL 	  Ranking  337.67	  -‐338.17  6  338.67	  -‐339.62  13  340.62	  -‐341.12  4  Source: (ITD 2012a) Based on the updated crash data, two of District 2’s top five official HALs are located within this section of highway. Statewide, the two HALs are ranked as numbers 17 and 34. See Table 2. Updated High Accident Locations (HALs). Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 5 Executive Summary Table	  2.	  Updated	  High	  Accident	  Locations	  (HALs) Milepost Location on US 95  Idaho 	  HAL 	  Ranking  337.67	  to 339.62  34  340.62	  to 341.62  17  Source: (ITD 2013) Access.  There are 66 approaches1 from the highway to either public, commercial and field locations in this 6.34-mile segment of US-95. The many approaches do not meet the ITD Access Control Policy due to spacing, sight distance, and the width and grade of the approaches, which contribute to intersection-related conflicts.  Since the DEIS was published, access for the proposed US-95 Action Alternatives was designated as Expressway Access Control which would limit approaches to only ITD designated locations as determined during the design and right-ofway process. This access control would not be in effect until payment is made to adjacent property owners for the restriction of existing access rights.  See Sections 2.4.2, 3.10 and 4.10 and Table 76. General Responses to Issues under Access for more detail. The north end of the project is the most densely populated area with the highest number of intersection related crashes.  The southern end of the project has closely spaced approaches with curves, which have also resulted in a high number of intersection related crashes.  Surface Conditions.  In addition to the primary deficiencies, this section of US-95 has a substandard rating for the pavement surface. Both the surface roughness and the amount of cracking fall below the minimum standard indices used to determine acceptable pavement performance.  Highway Capacity  Capacity and Operating Conditions.  The AASHTO standards and ITD Policy for capacity for a rural highway is a Level of Service (LOS) B.  This segment of US-95 currently has a volume of 5,364 ADT and is operating at a LOS C.  This is considered a high-density traffic flow with restricted movements and delays for short periods. By the 2037 design year, the volume for this segment of US-95 is projected to be 8524 ADT and would be operating at LOS D. This is at-capacity and would result in delays due to congestion.  Roadway Width.  The existing roadway consists of two undivided 12-foot travel lanes with two-foot shoulders.  The clear zone and shoulder width, which are important elements for safety, 1 IDAPA 39.03.42 definition of approach is a connection between the outside edge of the shoulder or curb line and the abutting property at the highway right-of-way line, intended to provide access to and from said highway and the abutting property. An approach may include a driveway, alley, street road or highway. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 6 Executive Summary vary throughout the corridor and do not meet the AASHTO standards2.  This two-lane segment of US-95 is also a bottleneck for the four-lane highway at the northern and southern ends of the project.    ES.3	  Proposed Solution The proposed solution or “action” would be constructed to meet the AASHTO standards. The existing two-lane undivided highway from Thorncreek Road to the South Fork Palouse River Bridge would be replaced with a four-lane divided highway with a 34-foot median through the majority of the corridor.  A four-lane highway with center turn lane, curb, gutter and sidewalk would be constructed at the northern end of the project.  See Exhibit 2. Typical Section: Four-Lane Divided Highway and Exhibit 3. Typical Section: Four-lane Highway with Center Turn Lane and Curb, Gutter and Sidewalk. The elements of the proposed action are described in detail in Chapter 2, Alternatives.   Exhibit	  2.	  Typical	  Section:	  Four-‐Lane 	  Divided	  Highway Exhibit	  3.	  Typical	  Section:	  Four-‐lane Highway	  with	  Center Turn	  Lane and	  Curb,	  Gutter and	  Sidewalk The highway would be designed to meet the capacity and safety needs for the 2037 design year.  It would be designed to include the following: • Lanes – Four travel lanes with a 34-foot median, four-foot wide shoulders on the left and eight-foot paved shoulder on the right, would transition to four travel lanes with a continuous 12-foot center turn lane and six-foot shoulders, curb, gutter and a five-foot 2 AASHTO standards are outlined in the Roadside Design Guide 2011 (4th Edition). Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 7 Executive Summary wide sidewalk.  This would match the existing US-95 cross sections at the South Fork Palouse River Bridge and south of Thorncreek Road.   • Speed Limit – The posted speed would be 65 mph for the four-lane divided highway section.  It would be 35 mph or 45 mph (depending on the alternative) in the section with a four-lane highway with center turn lane, curb, gutter, and sidewalk at the north end of the project where there are no curves. It is possible that the speed limit could be increased in the future; however, this would require a speed limit study to be conducted. • Turn Lanes – Right and left turn lanes would be constructed at all county road intersections. • Stormwater – In the rural sections, a minimum one-foot deep, V-shaped ditch would be located on either side of the roadway in cut sections and in the center median.  The urban section would have curbs and gutters and would be designed to meet the requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) and treated in accordance with applicable state and federal laws.  A Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) would be developed and implemented to comply with the Construction General Permit (CGP).  Stormwater in this area would be collected and managed with temporary and permanent Best Management Practices (BMPs) such as grassy swales and check-dams, in order to meet the requirements of the CGP and Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs). • Access – The existing US-95 is currently designated as Statewide Access Control.  The proposed US-95 Action Alternatives were designated as Expressway Access Control through an Idaho Transportation Board action on January 15 &16, 2014.  Expressway Access Control is a segment of a highway designated by the Idaho Transportation Board for use as a through highway, with partially controlled access, accessible only at locations specified by ITD, and characterized by medians, limited at-grade intersections, and high speeds. An existing segment of state highway may only be designated as an expressway if payment is made to adjacent property owners for the restriction of existing access rights [Idaho Administrative Procedures Act (IDAPA) 39.03.42]. While the District Engineer has the authority to approve a decrease in the spacing requirements for other access types, Expressway Access Control does not have spacing requirements; therefore, access is allowed only at locations designated by ITD which will be determined in collaboration with the landowner during the right-of-way process. This is stated in the IDAPA 39.03.42 Section 400.03, which is reflected in ITD’s 0606 Form for Current Access Purchase Determination. A blank sample of the ITD 0606 Form that would be used is provided in the Safety Analysis Technical Report. ITD will be required to comply with their access policy and will have the regulatory power to limit access. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 8 Executive Summary ITD would buy access rights from adjacent properties during right-of-way acquisition, and access will be recorded in the deeds. Existing approaches3 would be allowed to remain at locations where construction of joint access is not economically justified. See Section 2.4.2, 4.10, Transportation Effects and Table 76. General Responses to Issues under Access for additional detail.  The board agenda, minutes, and a blank sample of the ITD 0606 Form that would be used is provided in the Safety Analysis Technical Report. • Clear Zone – The clear zone would be a minimum of 30 feet for the four-lane divided highway. • Vertical Grade – The roadway would have a maximum of a five percent vertical grade. • Horizontal Curve – The rural section would have a 2910-foot minimum radius at a 5.4 percent super elevation, which is adequate for a design speed of 70 mph. The urban section will have a 1760-foot minimum radius at a three percent super elevation, which is adequate for design speeds of 35 mph and 45 mph. • Stopping Sight Distance4– the stopping sight distance would be a minimum of 730 feet, which is adequate for a design speed of 70 mph on level grades.  This will increase or decrease depending on the grade. • LOS – The LOS for the 2037 design year would be LOS A for both the rural section with the four-lane divided highway and the urban four-lane with center turn lane, curb, gutter and sidewalk. • Bicycle/Pedestrian Facilities – The shoulders on the outside lanes of the highway in the rural and urban sections would be shared use lanes but would not be specifically marked for bicycle use. The five-lane section would have sidewalk for pedestrian use. Adding a lane in each direction to create a four-lane section would alleviate the bottleneck caused by the existing two-lane segment, improving the capacity and traffic flow safely. Improving the grades, curves, stopping sight distance, access control and clear zone widths to meet AASHTO standards would improve the safety and capacity of the highway.  The proposed actions would reduce the projected crash rate for this segment of US-95 by more than 50 percent. ES.4	  Alternatives	  Screening NEPA requires that a range of reasonable alternatives, including a No Action Alternative, be evaluated in detail. The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) defines “reasonable 3 IDAPA 39.03.42 definition of approach is a connection between the outside edge of the shoulder or curb line and the abutting property at the highway right-of-way line, intended to provide access to and from said highway and the abutting property. An approach may include a driveway, alley, street road or highway. 4 Stopping sight distance on a roadway should be sufficiently long to enable a vehicle traveling at or near the design speed to stop before reaching a stationary object in its path. The design speed for the proposed alternative is 70 mph for rural sections. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 9 Executive Summary alternatives” as those that are practicable or feasible from a technical and economic standpoint and those that achieve the project’s purpose and need. The alternatives were developed in consideration of natural and social effects, engineering design considerations, and input from the public, agencies, and local elected officials.  The alternatives were developed, evaluated and screened in two phases as summarized below.  See the FEIS, Chapter 2, Alternatives and the Screening of Alternatives Technical Report for details. Level One.  The goal of the Level One screening process was to collect preliminary information and to evaluate broad transportation concepts.  Early in the project scoping, traffic and safety data for the corridor was collected and analyzed. This information helped to identify the roadway deficiencies and to identify the project purpose and need.   In 2004 ITD conducted community interviews and implemented an extensive public involvement process to introduce the proposed project and obtain community input. See Chapter 7, Public Involvement and Agency Coordination.  Key public and agency involvement opportunities during the DEIS development have included the following: • An Interdisciplinary Team (IDT) was formed that included ITD, FHWA, US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), Idaho Department of Fish and Game (IDFG) and Idaho Department of Environmental Quality (IDEQ).  They reviewed and provided comment on project information, technical reports and collaborated with FHWA and ITD on specific topics as needed. • Monthly newsletters and monthly breakfast meetings featuring technical experts provided an opportunity for the public to learn about the project and to ask questions. • A project website with project information and technical reports was used to inform and update the public during project development. • Two-day public meetings and open houses were held in 2004, 2005 and 2006. • A two-day public workshop for community members to review the range of alternatives and provide input was held in 2005. • Postcard invitations were sent to all residents of Moscow and Genesee for key public involvement opportunities. • A mobile project kiosk with project information and updates was placed at several public facilities in the area between November 2004 and June 2005. Transportation concepts that were evaluated included the No Action, Action Alternative, Transportation System Management (TSM), Transportation Demand Management (TDM) and Mass Transit. The TSM, TDM and Mass Transit alternatives were not forwarded for further consideration because of the rural nature and low population density of the project area and Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 10 Executive Summary because they would not address the safety deficiencies of the existing roadway and therefore would not address the purpose and need. The No Action and Action Alternatives were forwarded for further consideration.    Design elements to address the roadway deficiencies were evaluated and incorporated into typical sections for the Action Alternatives.  See ES.3, Proposed Solution and Section 1.4, Purpose and Need.  Level Two.  The goal of the Level Two screening process was to identify a range of alternatives and to screen them.  The No Action and 10 Action Alternatives were identified and categorized into the western, central and eastern corridors. These alternatives can be seen in Exhibit 4. Initial Alternatives. One alternative from each corridor was forwarded for detailed analysis to give a range of alignment alternatives.  Seven alternatives were eliminated from further consideration during the Level Two screening process. These alternatives were not advanced due to high adverse effects on the natural or built environment, less benefit compared to the other alternatives, or because they were similar to other alternatives that were advanced for detailed analysis.  See Chapter 2, Alternatives, for detail regarding the screening process and rationale. The alternatives’ benefits and effects to the natural and human environments were evaluated and organized into a comparative spreadsheet.  Criteria used to screen the alternatives are listed below.   • Air Quality • Archaeological Sites • Design Standards • Displacements • Environmental Justice • Estimated Construction Cost • Hazardous Materials • Historic Sites • Noise • Plant Species and Communities of Concern • Prime Farmland • Regulatory Floodways and Floodplains • Right-of-Way Acres • Safety • Socio-Economic • State Sensitive Species • Threatened and Endangered Species • Ungulates • Visual Analysis • Water Quality • Weather • Wetlands and Tributaries Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 11 Executive Summary ES.5	  DEIS	  Alternatives NEPA laws and regulations require that a No Action Alternative be considered in the range of reasonable alternatives. In addition to the No Action Alternative, three Action Alternatives were carried forward for detailed analysis in the DEIS, the W-4, C-3 and E-2 alternatives. See Exhibit 4. Initial Alternatives.  All three Action Alternatives and the No Action Alternative were evaluated with the design elements as described in ES.3, Proposed Solution. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 12 Executive Summary Exhibit	  4.	  Initial	  Alternatives	  Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 13 Executive Summary Exhibit	  5.	  DEIS	  Alternatives	  Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 14 Executive Summary No Action  The No Action Alternative would not involve any major improvements to US-95 but would include short-term minor restoration activities to the existing 6.34-mile segment.   Improvements would include minor safety, paving and maintenance activities for the continued operation of the existing roadway. It would not involve improving or widening this segment of US-95 to meet AASHTO standards. The No Action Alternative provides a baseline for comparison of the other alternatives. W-4 Alternative The W-4 Alternative that was evaluated in the DEIS was shifted during the FEIS development to avoid a historic farmstead that is also a Section 4(f) Resource.  This alternative is called the Modified W-4 Alternative and is evaluated in detail in this FEIS. Modified W-4  This alternative would be approximately 6.65 miles long.  It would begin at Thorncreek Road and would closely follow existing US-95 between Thorncreek and Jacksha roads. The alignment would then shift west of existing US-95. Modified W-4 would cross Snow Road, stay west of Clyde Hill and connect back into the existing US-95 near the grain elevators south of Moscow. Existing US-95 between Jacksha Road and the grain elevators (2.91 miles) may be turned over to the North Latah Highway District (NLHD).  See Exhibits 13 –18. Alignment Alternatives in Chapter 2, Alternatives for more detail. C-3  This alternative would be approximately 5.94 miles long.  It would begin at Thorncreek Road and would closely follow existing US-95 to just north of Eid Road. The alignment would then shift to the east of existing US-95 and cross Zeitler Road. C-3 would connect back into existing US-95 just south of Cameron Road, near Johnson Trucking.  From Johnson Trucking north to the South Fork of Palouse River Bridge this alternative would utilize the existing alignment. Existing US-95 north of Eid Road to south of Cameron Road (2.71 miles) may be turned over to the NLHD.  See Exhibits 13 –18. Alignment Alternatives in Chapter 2, Alternatives for more detail. E-2 (Preferred Alternative)  This alternative would be approximately 5.85 miles long.  It would begin at Thorncreek Road and would closely follow existing US-95 to the top of Reisenauer Hill where it would then shift to the east of existing US-95. The alignment would connect back into existing US-95 near the grain elevators south of Moscow. Existing US-95 from the top of Reisenauer Hill to the grain elevators (5.43 miles) may be turned over to the NLHD. This is FHWA and ITD’s Preferred Alternative. See Exhibits 13 –18. Alignment Alternatives in Chapter 2, Alternatives for more detail. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 15 Executive Summary ES.6	  Alternative Benefits	  and	  Effects Each of the four alternatives was analyzed for a full spectrum of environmental effects in compliance with 23 CFR 771 and FHWA Technical Advisory (TA) 6640.8A NEPA Implementation-Guidance for Preparing and Processing Environmental and Section 4(f) Documents.  Information for the W-4 Alternative that was evaluated in the DEIS was replaced with information for the Modified W-4 Alternative. The major differences between alternatives are summarized in Table 3. Summary of Alternatives’ Benefits and Effects.

With the projected increase in traffic volumes the crash rate for the No Action Alternative is estimated to have 27.4 crashes in 2017. From 2017 through 2036 the No Action Alternative is estimated to have 642.5 crashes, with 256.5 of those crashes being fatal or injury crashes.  The No Action would have a LOS D by 2037 and would be substantially more congested than existing conditions. The No Action Alternative would not require right-of-way acquisition.  It would have some environmental effects such as uncollected and untreated stormwater, the highest noise impacts, and air quality degradation, and would have some minor environmental effects but it would have the least overall effect.  The No Action Alternative would have the worst safety and LOS compared to any of the Action Alternatives.  It would not meet the project purpose and need.   Modified W-4 The Modified W-4 Alternative is aligned west of existing US-95 similar to the W-4 Alternative but a short section of the centerline was shifted approximately 120 ft east to avoid a historic farmstead.  Modified W-4 would impact fewer residences than the E-2 Alternative and would have similar effects to hazardous materials compared to E-2.  The Modified W-4 would have the greatest effects to farmlands, use the greatest total right-of-way and affect the greatest number of tributary crossings. It would not affect potential habitat for long-eared myotis and northern alligator lizard, and pygmy nuthatch habitat associated with ponderosa pine stands near Paradise Ridge. It would also have the greatest total fatal and injury crashes.  Of the alternatives, the Modified W-4 Alternative would be the least consistent with the land use plans. C-3 The C-3 Alternative would run closest to the current highway and would utilize much of the existing US-95 alignment. It is predicted to have the highest total number of crashes of the Action Alternatives. The primary differences between the C-3 Alternative and the other Action Alternatives are that C-3 would require the least amount of new right-of-way compared to Modified W-4 and E-2 but would have the greatest potential business impacts and affect the greatest number of hazardous material sites.  It would have the greatest amount of floodplain impact and approximately three times the length of tributary channel compared to the E-2 Alternative.  It would avoid the pine stands that are habitat for Pygmy nuthatch and potential habitat for northern alligator lizard and long-eared myotis, similarly to the Modified W-4.  C-3 would also have the least wetland effects.  It would have the fewest impacts to residenceswould be compatible with land use plans.  Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 17 Executive Summary E-2 (Preferred Alternative) E-2 is aligned east of existing US-95.  The primary advantages of E-2 are that it is aligned through flatter topography, has the fewest number of approaches, and has the greatest safety improvement.  E-2 would affect the least amount of tributary channel and would avoid floodplains. Similarly to the other alternatives, it would avoid cultural and Section 4(f) resources.  The primary disadvantage of E-2 over the other alternatives is that it would be located in close proximity to Paradise Ridge which supports a Ponderosa pine stand and various shrubs that provide the best ungulate habitat in the project area (Sawyer 2010).  E-2 would affect pine stands that are pygmy nuthatch habitat and potential habitat for long-eared myotis and northern alligator lizard. It would also have the highest noise impacts to residences of the action alternatives. The E-2 Alternative would have the greatest indirect effects to Palouse remnants, planned and ongoing Palouse restoration projects and a key conservation area for Spalding’s catchfly recovery primarily due to potential weed establishment and spread outside the right-of-way compared to the other alternatives. E-2 would be compatible with land use plans.  ES.7	  Preferred	  Alternative The evaluation of effects during the screening process, detailed analyses presented in this FEIS, and the public and agency comments on the DEIS resulted in the lead agencies, FHWA and ITD, identifying the E-2 Alternative as the Preferred Alternative. The E-2 Alternative is identified as the Preferred Alternative for the following reasons: • It would have the greatest safety improvement. • It would have the fewest access points and at-grade county intersections. • It would have the least effect to streams. • It would avoid potential business impacts and floodplains. • It would have the shortest five-lane typical section and overall shortest length. • It best meets the project purpose and need. ES.8	  Topics	  of	  Concern	  or	  Controversy	  During the public and agency involvement processes, it became evident through repeated written and verbal comments, that there were specific concerns and controversy related to the following topics: • Effects of the E-2 Alternative on Paradise Ridge including effects to the Palouse remnants, weed dispersal, potential wildlife effects and mitigation for wildlife impacts • Effects of weather on safety within corridors • Visual impacts to Moscow residents Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 18 Executive Summary In response to public and agency concerns, FHWA and ITD prepared detailed studies and shared the findings through the extensive public involvement process and considered them in decision-making.  Wildlife Habitat and Wildlife Movement.  IDFG, EPA and USFWS prefer the C-3 Alternative to the E-2 Alternative. This is primarily due to the E-2 Alternative’s direct and indirect effects to wildlife, weed dispersal to Palouse remnants, and the effects to wildlife habitat and movement due to its proximity to Paradise Ridge and other native habitats. The primary reasons that C-3 was not identified as the Preferred Alternative were because it would have the greatest predicted total crashes with the greatest number of at-grade access points compared to the other Action Alternatives.   There has been disagreement between IDFG and ITD regarding appropriate mitigation for the direct and indirect effects due to the conversion of land that may be utilized by wildlife (privately-owned farmland and Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) land), which would be converted to highway right-of-way and therefore represents a loss in wildlife habitat. IDFG had prepared a wildlife assessment (IDFG 2006), which provided mitigation recommendations for the loss of habitat in the project area and the direct and indirect effects of alternatives on wildlife and wildlife habitat. Three other wildlife studies were also prepared which concluded wildlife species, including ungulates, may utilize the project area, which offers low to moderate quality habitat for wildlife. The eastern corridor has more suitable habitat than the central or western corridors.  More suitable habitat is available north, south and east of the project area or concentrated in the gullies (Ruediger 2007).  While high quality habitat for ungulates is not present in the project area, the E-2 Alternative would have a greater effect on wildlife habitat than either Modified W-4 or C-3. Mitigation for direct habitat loss, indirect habitat loss, or loss of connectivity for moose or elk was reviewed in the report titled Assessment of Potential Big Game Impacts and Mitigation Associated with Highway Alternatives from Thorncreek Road to Moscow (Sawyer 2010).  The report findings recommended future monitoring of wildlife crashes to determine whether future mitigation might be warranted in sections of E-2 but did not recommend other mitigations for ungulates.  Through a series of correspondence and meetings between 2007 and the FEIS publication, ITD and IDFG evaluated the impacts and discussed several mitigation options including, additional monitoring, wildlife crossing structures, ratio-based funding for Palouse Ecoregion restoration, and conservation projects, and additional funding to replace the roadway footprint. Many other specific wildlife mitigations were also suggested. Prior to the FEIS publication, IDFG agreed with ITD and FHWA’s position to not provide monetary compensatory mitigation funds to IDFG.  ITD and IDFG agreed upon other mitigation measures that compensate for identified Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 19 Executive Summary impacts, and will be incorporated into the project design to minimize harm to wildlife and habitat.  ITD and IDFG will collaborate on the details of the mitigation measures before final design.  See the FEIS, Section 4.8 Vegetation, Fish and Wildlife and Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments.  Weather Conditions.  During the public meetings held from 2004 to 2006, weather as it pertained to safety was a major topic of concern.  The public expressed concern that the topographic differences between the alternative corridors (west, central and east), could result in differing climatic conditions that could influence safety.  To respond to this concern, a detailed weather analysis was developed that evaluated the differences in the weather in three corridors.  The study measured wind speed, precipitation, snow, and road ice over the five month winter period. This five-month data set was used to rank the larger 30+ year data set from the University of Idaho (UI) Plant Sciences Farm (PSF).  The Weather Analysis was revised after the DEIS was published.  The revised report is titled Weather Analysis and Climate Study for US Highway 95, Thorncreek Road to Moscow, Four Proposed Alternatives, No-Build, W-4, C-3 and E-2 (Qualls 2014) and provides additional year-round data and additional data on snow accumulation.  It also offers clarification of weather principles.  The studies concluded that while there may be minor variations in climatic conditions in the corridors, they were not substantial enough to warrant additional safety factors in the safety analysis.  The Modified W-4 and C-3 alternatives would descend at a steeper grade near Reisenauer Hill where snow accumulation is greater compared to the E-2 Alternative, which descends at a flatter grade further north where snow accumulation is less.  However, the improvement of the lane widths, clear zones, steep grades and curves are more influential factors to safety and all the action alternatives would be designed to AASHTO standards and would be safe.  Therefore, weather was considered when developing the design elements but will not be a major factor for comparing the alternatives. See Chapter 3, Affected Environment and Chapter 4, Environmental Consequences.  Detail may be found in the Revised Weather Analysis (Qualls 2014). Visual. There are differing opinions regarding the visual effects of the W-4 and E-2 alternatives and what may be an adverse impact to one person may not be to another.  The Citizens for a Safe Highway 95, claiming to represent people collectively owning 80 percent of the land along E-2, were in favor of the E-2 Alternative due to the “spectacular view” of the Palouse and of the City of Moscow for travelers. They believe that the beauty of Paradise Ridge could transform the highway into a gateway for Moscow, and that E-2 could promote and preserve the Palouse landscape through scenic highway status. The group opposed alternative W-4, stating that it Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 20 Executive Summary would disrupt westerly views and promote farmland conversion disrupting the agricultural setting (HDR 2005a). The Paradise Ridge Defense Coalition, who opposed the E-2 Alternative, felt the expansion of the roadway should follow the existing route as much as possible in order to minimize the ecological footprint of road.  In the view of those opposed to an E-2 Alternative, the ridge should remain untouched because it provides both aesthetic and environmental value as one of the last remaining natural prairie in the area (HDR 2006). ES.9	  Planned	  Projects There are no other major transportation projects planned for the area.  The Ring Road project is a planned loop around the City of Moscow that would permit through traffic on both US-95 and SH-8 to travel around the perimeter of the City; however, it is in a conceptual phase and no detailed alignment has been proposed, nor is project funding identified.  The Ring Road Concept has been developed to a point that an alignment is proposed based on topographic conditions, expected design standards, and anticipated use.  The alignment has been included in the adopted City of Moscow Comprehensive Plan, the Latah County Comprehensive Plan, and the North Latah County Highway District Transportation System Plan.  While a final detailed alignment has not been developed, in the area of the interaction with the US-95 realignment project, the Ring Road alignment options are fairly limited and all of the action alternatives for the US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow project would be designed to accommodate future construction of the Ring Road Concept. See Chapter 6, Indirect and Cumulative Effects and Community Profile - Induced Development Technical Reports for more information regarding planned developments.  ES.10	  Permits	  and	  Approvals If an Action Alternative is selected, then permits and approvals will be required and may include; Section 404 permits, NPDES Construction General Permit, Notice of Demolition, Section 401 Water Quality Certification, Stream Channel Alteration Permit and Floodplain permits. See Table 5. Permits and Approvals in Chapter 1, Introduction. Additional requirements for each alternative are listed in Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments. ES.11	  Next Steps FHWA and ITD have published a 30-day notice of availability in the Federal Register for this FEIS.  FHWA will then issue a ROD selecting an Action Alternative, a combination of the Action Alternatives, or the No Action Alternative.  The ROD will also provide the rationale for the decision and identify mitigation measures.  See Exhibit 6.

Select “US-95 Thorncreek to Moscow Phase I”. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 22 Introduction 1 INTRODUCTION 1.1 Background In 1999, FHWA and ITD began developing an Environmental Assessment (EA) for a 20.4-mile improvement of US-95 from the Top of Lewiston Hill to Moscow. The project intent was to widen the existing highway in the southern 15.8 miles of the project and construct 4.6 miles of a new four-lane highway in the northern section. Eleven alternatives for the northern-most section of the corridor were narrowed to two. Alternative 6 would have widened along the existing highway and Alternative 10A would have constructed a four-lane highway on new alignment near the base of Paradise Ridge. Alternative 10A was selected by ITD and FHWA and a FONSI was issued in May 2002. The project was litigated by the Paradise Ridge Defense Coalition, Inc. in 2003. The US District Court for the District of Idaho (Court) in the judgment for Civil Case number 03-0156-S-BLW decided that the EA and issuance of a Finding FONSI were not appropriate. The court found that an EIS would be required for the northern 4.6-mile segment between Thorncreek Road and Moscow to allow full consideration of the impacts by the public and agencies. The southern 15.8 miles was allowed to proceed and construction was completed in October 2007. The Court decision for US-95 Lewiston Hill to Moscow was based on the finding that FHWA regulations give examples of actions that normally require an EIS, which includes a highway project of four or more lanes in a new location. Since the EA didn’t discuss its unique circumstances, an EIS should have been prepared.  In an Idaho Department Fish and Game (IDFG) Draft Terrestrial Wildlife Impact report which was an appendix to the EA, IDFG characterized the diversity of plant and wildlife communities in Palouse remnants, xplained its rarity and stated that the new highway would disturb habitat and result in fragmentation and disruption of wildlife movement.  IDFG also stated that it is difficult to predict the extent of this long-term impact but it is expected to be significant.  Mitigation was recommended should the 10A alternative be selected. ITD did not follow the IDFG mitigation but pursued an alternative mitigation site.  The Court ruled that because ITD chose not to follow the IDFG analysis and mitigation recommendations without relying on its own experts or explaining in the EA the unique or atypical circumstances that warranted proceeding in a different direction, that the EA raised substantial concerns regarding significant impact which was not resolved.  Therefore, a FONSI was not appropriate and an EIS should be prepared.   An EIS is being prepared in response to the Court decision and in compliance with FHWA regulations.  A Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare an EIS for the section of US-95 between Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 23 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow Introduction Thorncreek Road and Moscow was published in the Federal Register on November 13, 2003. An extensive public involvement process has been completed and will continue to be implemented to identify and continue to address public and agency concerns. The public scoping process resulted in the identification and screening of a range of reasonable alternatives.  See Chapter 2, Alternatives and Chapter 7, Public Involvement and Agency Coordination. During the development of the DEIS and FEIS several technical reports were prepared to fully evaluate vegetation and wildlife resources and alternative effects.  Experts in the respective fields conducted these reports. The technical reports are summarized in Chapter 3, Affected Environment and Chapter 4, Environmental Consequences and are listed below: General Wildlife Assessment, Thorncreek Road to Moscow (December 2006).  This report evaluates the impacts of the project to Idaho Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN) species found in the project vicinity.  It also discusses potential mitigation measures (IDFG 2006). Biological Evaluation on the Potential Impacts of Corridor Alternatives from Thorncreek Road to Moscow on Large Ungulates (December 2005).  This report evaluates the potential effects of alternatives through different corridors (west, central and east) on the habitat and survival of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), elk (Cervus elaphus), and moose (Alces alces) in the project area (Melquist 2005a).  Biological Evaluation on the Long-eared Myotis and Pygmy Nuthatch (December 2005). This report describes the potential effects of the proposed project on the long-eared myotis (Myotis evotis) and pygmy nuthatch (Sitta pygmaea) which were classified as SGCN by the IDFG (Melquist 2005b).   Final Review of Wildlife Mitigation for the Thorncreek Road to Moscow Highway Development Project (US-95) (September 2007).  This report reviews and summarizes the information in the General Wildlife Assessment (IDFG 2006) and Biological Evaluation on Potential Impacts of Corridor Alternatives (Melquist 2005a). It evaluates the effects of the alternatives to deer, elk and moose and makes mitigation recommendations (Ruediger 2007). Assessment of Potential Big Game Effects and Mitigation Associated with Highway Alternatives from Thorncreek Road to Moscow (December 2010).  This report summarizes the various wildlife reports prepared for the project and provides ITD with an independent assessment of the project’s effects to potential big game and also discusses mitigation (Sawyer 2010). Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 24 Introduction Biological Assessment, Thorncreek Road to Moscow Highway Construction Project (December 2007).  This study describes the project effects to federally listed and proposed species and designated critical habitat (ITD 2007a).  This report was reviewed in November 2011 and USFWS provided concurrence that the findings are still valid in 2007, 2011 and 2012. A Scientific Evaluation for Noxious and Invasive Weeds of the Highway 95 Construction Project between the Uniontown Cutoff and Moscow (January, 2007). This report describes the potential weeds in the study area.  It also describes the potential for the proposed project to spread weeds and discusses mitigation for the potential effects (Lass and Prather 2007). Biological Evaluation of Plant Species and Communities of Conservation Concern in the US Highway 95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow Project Area (December 2005). This report discusses the potential occurrence and extent of rare plants and communities in the project area.  It analyzes the potential effects for the proposed project on plant species of conservation concern and remnant native plant communities that potentially provide habitat for these species (Lichthardt 2005).   A Memo Documenting Resurvey for Spalding’s catchfly in the Project Area, was prepared after the DEIS publication.  This report documents the resurvey of the project area during the summer of 2014. No new plants were found (Lichthardt 2014). Where ITD and FHWA had concerns or saw a lack of clarity with the consultants’ or IDFG’s assessments of effects to ungulates, other wildlife or proposed mitigation, recognized experts conducted additional studies to evaluate the effect and mitigation recommendations.  The evaluations and findings were documented in the reports by Ruediger in 2007 and Sawyer in 2010.  These reports were provided to IDFG.  The report prepared by Sawyer was sent to IDFG in 2010 with a letter explaining the findings. The Sawyer report found that the Melquist and Ruediger reports were consistent regarding general habitat quality and the relative alternatives' effects to habitat.  It provided new information that was available since the previous reports were prepared which also supported the conclusions of the reports.  That information was presented in the DEIS.   Both Ruediger and Melquist stated in their reports that the alternatives would not have population level effects to ungulates and that no mitigation was required for population level effects.  Both offered optional recommendations that included wildlife crossing, fencing, habitat preservation and other measures that could benefit individuals and mitigate for animal vehicle collisions; however, these were not required, nor are they likely to be effective without land use control in the surrounding properties.   July 2015 Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) 25 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow Introduction Melquist acknowledged that there may be impacts to individual ungulates through increased road kills, possible habitat avoidance, and increased risks to motorists and offers seven recommended actions that would benefit deer, elk, moose, and other wildlife should transportation corridors be constructed.  These recommendations include one or two possible wildlife crossings near draws, fencing associated with the crossings, habitat preservation near those crossings and other measures.  However, he further states that not implementing a recommended action would not jeopardize populations of any of the species.  Animal/vehicle collisions (AVCs) and associated risks to motorists were considered in the AASHTO Safety Analyses and are mitigated for in the proposed alternatives’ design.  Clearing vegetation from the clear zone (highway right-of-way), widening the roadway and improving the sight distance are all mitigating factors that are expected to significantly reduce the AVCs.  On US-20 between MP 369 and 375, similar improvements reduced the AVC by 85 percent (ITD 2012a).  To further mitigate for the possible AVCs, if the E-2 Alternative is selected; ITD will monitor AVCs near Paradise Ridge in the identified ungulate crossing areas.  The monitoring of AVCs will use existing ITD programs including the ITD/IDFG Road Kill & Wildlife Salvage Database, which is a road kill reporting and mapping tool. ITD also evaluates highway accident data annually and identifies high accident locations (HALs) based on the previous three years of crash data. These locations are investigated to determine contributing factors to accidents, including AVCs, and solutions are proposed and programmed.  Should it be identified as a problem, ITD will take action to address AVCs and will collaborate with IDFG as needed to identify effective solutions. Ruediger did not recommend stand-alone large game crossings nor did he recommend replacement of lost wildlife habitat.  However, in recognition of the resource agencies’ desire for mitigation, he made three optional recommendations, all of which were considered and included in the FEIS Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments.  These were 1) to provide a wildlife/vehicle crossing at county road underpasses of US-95 where wildlife use is expected and where wildlife are welcome on private lands (deer, elk and moose), 2) to provide oversized culverts to allow for small terrestrial movement and 3) to replace water sources on the east side of the highway should water sources be impacted.  Fencing will also be provided to prevent animals from getting onto the highway in areas where collisions are most likely and to funnel wildlife into crossings.   In the summer of 2012, ITD and IDFG began discussions regarding a MOU to address mitigation for vegetation, fish and wildlife effects.  However, after further meetings with IDFG it was decided that an MOU would not be necessary and instead mitigation measures are included in the FEIS Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments.  This includes additional detail about wildlife Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) 26 July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow Introduction mitigation including crossings for large and small terrestrial movement and fencing. In addition ITD and IDFG have committed to working together before final design to determine the details of the mitigation and to help ensure the success of the wildlife mitigation measures. See Appendix 1, Key Agency Correspondence and Forms.  See Section 4.8, Vegetation, Fish and Wildlife Effects and Section 4.9, Threatened and Endangered Species Effects and the respective technical reports for additional detail.  The measures that FHWA and ITD plan to adopt to compensate for the identified resource effects are listed in Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments.   1.2 Setting The project area is immediately south of the City of Moscow, Idaho.  Moscow is the most populous city in the Palouse Region and is the Latah County seat.  Moscow’s primary employers are the University of Idaho in Moscow and Washington State University, which is located five miles to the west in Pullman, Washington.  Moscow also serves as the agricultural and commercial hub for the Palouse Region.  The study area is primarily agricultural land with scattered rural residences. The northern section of the project is within the southern boundary of the City of Moscow and is more urbanized with commercial and higher density residential development.   1.3 Project	  Location The US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow Project is located south of Moscow, in Latah County, Idaho. The logical termini established for the project begins at Thorncreek Road (MP 337.67) and runs north to the South Fork Palouse River Bridge (MP 344.00).  See Exhibit 7. Project Location. 1.4 Purpose	  The purpose of this project is to improve public safety and increase highway capacity on US-95 south of Moscow between Thorncreek Road (MP 337.67) and the South Fork Palouse River Bridge (MP 344.00). 1.5 Need US-95 is part of the National Highway System (NHS) and is a North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) route spanning the United States from Canada to Mexico.  Within Idaho, US-95 is classified as a principal arterial, providing the only continuous north-south highway connection between the Idaho Panhandle and the rest of the state. It supports multiple local uses, including primary access to agricultural, residential, commercial and industrial land located Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 27 Introduction directly adjacent to the highway. Within the City of Moscow, US-95 connects with SH-8, which is a major east-west highway. The US-95 Thorncreek to Moscow project is included in the approved Idaho Transportation Investment Program (ITIP) (ITD 2011a). Exhibit	  7.	  Project	  Location Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 28 Introduction 1.5.1 Public Safety Horizontal Curves and Vertical Grades The existing highway has several horizontal curves and vertical grades that do not meet AASHTO standards.  The crash statistics for the highway between January 2003 and December 2012 show that this section of US-95 averages 25.3 crashes per year and is projected to reach 27.4 crashes per year in 2017, the anticipated year of construction completion.  Over half of the crashes in the corridor occurred between MP 338 and MP 342 and approximately half of those were associated with a horizontal curve in the road.  The curves on this section of highway contribute to approximately nine accidents per year. Approximately 60 percent of the crashes in this section of highway occur during inclement weather conditions, such as snow, rain, hail, fog or ice (ITD 2013). Access Access for this section of US-95 is currently Statewide Access Control. There are 66 approaches5 (public, commercial and field approaches) in this 6.34-mile segment. The many approaches do not meet the ITD Access Control Policy due to spacing, sight distance, width and grade of approaches, which contributes to intersection related conflicts.  From 2003 to 2012, 26 crashes were directly associated with private approaches or intersections (ITD 2013). The north end of the project is the most densely populated area with the highest number of intersection related crashes.  The southern end of the project is primarily rural residences and farms with closely spaced approaches and curves that have also resulted in a high number of intersection related crashes.   Surface Conditions In addition to the primary deficiencies, this section of US-95 has a substandard rating for the pavement surface. Both the surface roughness and the amount of cracking fall below the minimum standard indices used to determine acceptable pavement performance. 1.5.2 Highway Capacity Capacity and Operations This segment of US-95 has an ADT of 5364 and operates at a Level of Service (LOS) C based on 2010 data.  This is considered a high-density traffic flow with restricted movements and delays for short periods. The volume for this segment of US-95 is projected to be 8,524 ADT by 5 IDAPA 39.03.42 definition of approach is a connection between the outside edge of the shoulder or curb line and the abutting property at the highway right-of-way line, intended to provide access to and from said highway and the abutting property. An approach may include a driveway, alley, street road or highway. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) 29 July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow Introduction 2037, based on a two percent annual growth rate.  It would operate at a LOS D in the 2037 design year. See Table 4. Existing and Projected ADTs. Table	  4.	  Existing	  and	  Projected	  ADTs	  US 95	  Segment (MP)  Existing 2010	  (ADT)  Design Year 2037	  (ADT)  337.2-‐337.7  4,900  7,809  337.7-‐339.6  4,900  7,821  339.6-‐342.9  5,300  8,437  342.9-‐344.1  6,500  10,221  Overall ADT -‐337.2-‐344.1  5,364  8,524  This is at-capacity and would result in delays due to congestion. The traffic consists of approximately 5.7 percent heavy truck traffic and 94.3 percent passenger vehicles.  The AASHTO standard for capacity for a rural highway is LOS B.  See Exhibit 8. Level of Services (LOS). Roadway Width The existing roadway consists of two 12-foot undivided travel lanes with two-foot shoulders.  The clear zone and shoulder width, which are important elements for safety, vary throughout the corridor and do not meet AASHTO standards.  This two-lane segment of US-95 is a bottleneck for the four-lane highway at the northern and southern ends of the project.  It experiences approximately one head-on collision per year. The proposed solutions to alleviate these deficiencies are described in Chapter 2, Alternatives, Section 2.4.2, Design Elements and Typical Section for Action Alternatives. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) 30 July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow Introduction Exhibit	  8.	  Level 	  of	  Services	  (LOS) Note: Information in this diagram illustrates concepts from the Highway Capacity Manual 2000 1.6 Public	  Concerns 1.6.1 Scoping	  Process The following is a summary of the primary public concerns expressed during the scoping process, the public involvement effort and through public comment.

It presents the rationale used to eliminate alternatives from further consideration or to forward them for detailed analysis in the DEIS and FEIS. It also compares the alternatives evaluated in the DEIS and FEIS. 2.1 Regulatory Framework and Policies The development and screening of alternatives under the NEPA are governed by the following: • 40 CFR 1500-1508 - NEPA regulation of Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) • 40 CFR 230-Section 404(b)(1) - Guidelines for Specification of Disposal Sites for Dredged or Fill Material • 33 CFR 325 Appendix B - NEPA Implementation Procedures for the Regulatory Program • 23 CFR 771 - FHWA Environmental Impact and Related Procedures • FHWA TA 6640.8A - NEPA Implementation-Guidance for Preparing and Processing Environmental and Section 4(f) Documents • FHWA Environmental Guidebook 23 CFR 771.125(a) states the FEIS shall identify the Preferred Alternative and evaluate all reasonable alternatives considered. 2.2 Methodology ITD and FHWA began the scoping process following the publication of the NOI on November 13, 2003. Public and agency input were used to develop a range of reasonable alternatives for consideration.  The alternatives were developed and screened in two phases:  Level One involved identifying the logical termini, project purpose and need and evaluating broad transportation concepts and elements.  Level Two involved identifying a range of reasonable alternatives, analyzing alternative benefits and effects and completing a screening process.  As a result of the screening process, four alternatives were forwarded for detailed analysis in the DEIS: • No Action Alternative • W-4 Alternative • C-3 Alternative • E-2 Alternative (Preferred Alternative) Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 37 Alternatives The No Action Alternative is described in Section 2.4, Level One Screening and the three Action Alternatives (W-4, C-3 and E-2) are described in Section 2.5, Level Two Screening.  Public involvement has been a key factor for the identification and screening of the alternatives since the beginning of the project.  Key public involvement activities and scoping efforts are summarized in Chapter 7, Public Involvement and Agency Coordination and the Screening of Alternatives Technical Report.  After the DEIS publication the W-4 Alternative was modified to avoid impacts to a historic farmstead/Section 4(f) resource. A detailed analysis of the Modified W-4 Alternative is presented in this FEIS.  2.3 Logical Termini The logical termini are the rational end points for a transportation improvement project and its resulting environmental effects [23 CFR 771.111(f)].   The US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow project is located along US-95 south of Moscow, in Latah County, Idaho. The logical termini established for the project begins at Thorncreek Road (MP 337.67) and runs north to the South Fork Palouse River Bridge (MP 344.00).  See Exhibit 1. Project Location Map.  These logical termini will not restrict consideration of other reasonably foreseeable improvements.   The logical termini for the project were determined by the US District Court of Idaho’s (Court) decision on the Environmental Assessment (EA) for the US-95 Lewiston Hill to Moscow project. The Court in the judgment for Civil Case number 03-0156-S-BLW found that an EIS would be required for the northern 4.6-mile segment between Thorncreek Road and Moscow to allow full consideration of the impacts by the public and agencies. The southern 15.8 miles was allowed to proceed and construction was completed in October 2007. This southernmost project began at the Top of Lewiston Hill (MP 323.2) and ended at Thorncreek Road (MP 337.2). The US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow project abuts the northern terminus of the constructed four-lane divided highway between the Top of Lewiston Hill and Thorncreek Road (MP 337.67) and the southern terminus of the South Fork Palouse River Bridge project (MP 344.00). The segment of US-95 between Thorncreek Road and Moscow generates approximately 14 percent more traffic than US-95 between Genesee and Thorncreek Road.  The change in traffic reflects the transition from agricultural to a higher density of commercial and residential use.   Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 38 Alternatives There were four times the number of injury and fatality crashes between Thorncreek Road and Moscow when compared to US-95 between the top of Lewiston Hill and Thorncreek Road (MP 323.36 to 337.67) between October 2007 and December 2011. During this time, thirty-one injury and fatality crashes occurred on the newly constructed four-lane divided highway between the top of Lewiston Hill and Thorncreek Road. This is 2.17 injuries and fatalities per centerline mile. During the same time period, 68 injury and fatality crashes have occurred between Thorncreek Road and Moscow (MP 337.67 to 344.00). This is 10.7 injuries and fatalities per centerline mile. The Thorncreek Road to Moscow segment represents a change in topography from rolling hills to more mountainous terrain, which contributes to the deficiencies in curvature and grade through the corridor.   2.4 Level One Screening 2.4.1 Transportation	  Concepts The following transportation concepts were considered among the range of reasonable alternatives.  The level one screening process is displayed in Table 6. Level One Screening Results and described below. Table	  6.	  Level	  One	  Screening	  Results	  Alternative  Screening Results  Summary of Rationale	  for Eliminating or Forwarding Alternatives  No Action  Forwarded for detailed analysis  Required	  by NEPA	  to	  be evaluated	  with	  other alternatives.

The No Action Alternative would include short-term minor restoration activities (safety and maintenance improvements, etc.) that maintain operation of the existing roadway. It would include projects such as turn lanes at public road approaches within the existing right-of-way, pavement overlays and seal coats to maintain the continuing operation of the existing roadway.  The No Action Alternative serves as a baseline and is required by FHWA NEPA regulations to be considered in the DEIS. Therefore, this alternative was forwarded for further consideration. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 39 Alternatives Transportation System Management (TSM), Transportation Demand Management (TDM) and Mass Transit Alternatives.  These alternatives could improve the efficiency of the existing system.  TSM may include ridesharing, high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes on existing roadways, and traffic signal timing optimization.  TDM may provide travelers choices such as work location, route, time, and mode. TSM and mass transit are required to be considered for major projects proposed in urbanized areas with populations over 200,000 (FHWA 1987). The area surrounding the US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow project is rural and does not meet the 200,000 population threshold even when considering the surrounding towns and cities.   The existing corridor between Thorncreek Road and Moscow does not have existing signalization that could be optimized.  HOV lanes would not be effective as the primary issues related to the facility are related to safety and additional HOV lanes would not address the existing safety deficiencies.  There are existing vanpool and rideshare systems in place in Moscow and Lewiston.  Mass transit in the form of shuttle buses have been implemented in the corridor in the past, but were discontinued due to low ridership and lack of funding.  Mass transit would also not address the safety deficiencies within the project limits. Reconstruction of the existing facility under the TSM, TDM and Mass Transit Alternatives would not address safety deficiencies and would not meet the project purpose and need; therefore, these alternatives were eliminated from further consideration. Action Alternatives.  These include both improvements along the existing highway and alternatives in new locations that meet the project purpose and need. An alternative that follows the existing highway and alternatives with short sections of realignment were developed and forwarded for detailed analysis. Action Alternatives were developed at a concept level for the US-95 Genesee to Moscow segment which was later divided into separate projects. Criteria used to evaluate the concept level alternatives included; safety/crash rates, highway capacity, level of service, public and agency input, functional classification of the roadway, and access control. Design elements that addressed the project purpose and need and met AASHTO standards were identified and incorporated into the typical section. See 2.5.1 Develop Alignment Alternatives for a description of the initial alternatives. 2.4.2 Design Elements and Typical Section for Action Alternatives The proposed action would replace the existing two-lane undivided highway from Thorncreek Road to the South Fork Palouse River Bridge with a four-lane divided highway with a 34-foot Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 40 Alternatives median through the majority of the alignment. See Exhibit 9. Typical Section: Four-Lane Divided Highway. It would transition to a four-lane highway with a center turn lane, curb, gutter and sidewalk in the urban area just south of Moscow.  See Exhibit 10. Typical Section: Four-lane Highway with Center Turn Lane, Curb, Gutter, and Sidewalk. These typical sections would match the existing roadways at the northern and southern termini of the proposed project.  Safety and maintaining consistency through the corridor were primary factors in determining the design standard and the typical section.  The highway would be designed to meet capacity and safety needs for the 2037 design year and would meet AASHTO standards6.  The primary design elements of the proposed action are summarized below.  Exhibit	  9.	  Typical	  Section:	  Four-‐Lane 	  Divided	  Highway Exhibit	  10.	  Typical	  Section:	  Four-‐lane Highway	  with	  Center Turn	  Lane, Curb, 	  Gutter, 	  and Sidewalk • Speed Limit – The posted speed would be 65 mph for the four-lane divided highway section.  It would transition to 35 mph or 45 mph, depending on the alternative, in the section with a four-lane highway with center turn lane, curb, gutter, and sidewalk at the north end of the project. It is possible that the speed limit could be increased in the future; however, this would require a speed limit study be conducted. • Lanes – Four travel lanes with a 34-foot median, four-foot wide shoulders on the left and eight-foot paved shoulder on the right, would transition to four travel lanes with a continuous 12-foot center turn lane and six-foot shoulders, curb, gutter and a five-foot wide sidewalk.  This would match the existing US-95 cross sections at the South Fork Palouse River Bridge and south of Thorncreek Road. 6 FHWA has adopted AASHTO; A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, which outlines standards for new/reconstruction projects on the National Highway System. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 41 Alternatives • Turn lanes – Left and right turn lanes would be constructed at all county road intersections except where overpass structures are specified. • Stormwater – In the rural sections, a minimum one-foot deep, V-shaped ditch would be located on either side of the roadway in cut sections and in the center median. The urban section would have curbs and gutters and stormwater would be collected and treated in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and designed to meet NPDES stormwater requirements. A SWPPP would be developed that would identify temporary and permanent BMPs such as grassy swales and check-dams to comply with the CGP and TMDLs. • Access – Access control would be based on the facility type, functional classification, highway safety, vehicle operations, and preservation of highway utilities, zoning, and route consistency. The access control for this segment of US-95 is currently Statewide Access Control. The proposed US-95 Action Alternatives were designated as Expressway Access Control through an Idaho Transportation Board action on January 15 & 16, 2014. (See the Safety Analysis Technical Report for the agenda and board minutes). Expressway Access Control is a segment of a highway designated by the Idaho Transportation Board for use as a through highway, with partially controlled access, accessible only at locations specified by ITD, and characterized by medians, limited at-grade intersections, and high speeds. An existing segment of state highway may only be designated as an expressway if payment is made to adjacent property owners for the restriction of existing access rights [IDAPA 39.03.42]. • Clear zone – The clear zone would be a minimum of 30 feet for the four-lane divided highway • Vertical grade – The roadway would have a maximum of a five percent vertical grade. • Horizontal curve – The Rural Section would have a 2,910-foot minimum radius at a 5.4 percent super elevation, which is adequate for a design speed of 70 mph. The Urban Section will have a 1,760-foot minimum radius at a three percent super elevation, which is adequate for a design speed of 35 mph and 45 mph, depending on the alternative. • Stopping sight distance7 – The stopping sight distance would be a minimum of 730 feet, which is adequate for a design speed of 70 mph on level grades.  This will increase or decrease depending on the grade. • LOS – The LOS for the 2037 design year would be LOS A for both the rural section with the four-lane divided highway and the urban four-lane section with center turn lane, curb, gutter and sidewalk. 7 Stopping sight distance on a roadway should be sufficiently long to enable a vehicle traveling at or near the design speed to stop before reaching a stationary object in its path. The design speed for the proposed alternatives is 70 mph for rural sections. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 42 Alternatives • Bicycle/pedestrian facilities – The shoulders on the right side of the highway on the rural and urban sections would be shared use lanes but would not be specifically marked for bicycle use. The five-lane section would have a sidewalk for pedestrian use. Adding one lane in each direction would alleviate the bottleneck caused by the existing two-lane segment and would match the lanes in the northern and southern roadway segments.  This would improve the capacity, traffic flow, and reduce driver frustration with delays. Improving the grades, curves, stopping sight distance, access control and clear zone widths to meet AASHTO standards would improve the safety and capacity of the highway.  Any of the proposed Action Alternatives would reduce the projected crashes for this segment of US-95 by more than 50 percent.   2.5 Level Two	  Screening 2.5.1 Develop Alignment Alternatives An initial range of alternatives that included the No Action and five Action Alternatives; W 1, W-2, C-1, E-1 and E-2, was developed based on the results of the preliminary engineering, environmental studies and public input.  The Action Alternatives were categorized and named based on their locations in the west, central or east corridors.  The alternatives were presented to the public during alternative workshops on January 19-20, 2005 and April 13, 2005. The purpose of the workshops was to present a range of possible alternatives to the public and to solicit public input. As a result of the alternative workshops, five additional alternatives were developed: W-3, W-4, C-2, C-3, and E-3.  The No Action and 10 Action Alternatives were presented in subsequent public meetings on January 18 and 19, 2006.   The Action Alternatives would share the same design elements described above under 2.4.2 Design Elements and Typical Section for Action Alternatives. They would all construct a four-lane highway with Expressway Access Control, improve horizontal curves and vertical grades, and be designed to meet the ITD Design Manual and AASHTO standards.  Each alternative would transition from the four-lane divided highway to a four-lane highway with center turn lane, curb, gutter and sidewalk where they reconnect with existing US-95 at the northern end of the project. At the transition the posted speed limit would be reduced from 65 mph to 45 mph. The C-3 Alternative would be have a design speed and posted speed limit of 45 mph in the urban section and the W-4 and E-2 Alternatives would have a design speed and posted speed limit of 35 mph in the urban section. With the exception of Alternative C 1, which uses most of the existing highway alignment, the abandoned sections of existing US-95 may be turned over to the NLHD.  It should be noted that the lengths of the W-4, C-3 and E-2 alternatives early in the screening process differ from the lengths analyzed in the DEIS due to a modification of the project limits.  As a result, and due to the conceptual level of detail at the time, the lengths and Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 43 Alternatives calculations presented during the screening process may differ from those presented in the DEIS and FEIS for the W-4, C-3 and E-2 alternatives. In addition, the assumptions made when determining residential and business impacts were also different resulting in different numbers. The initial 10 Action Alternatives are shown in Exhibit 11. Initial Alternatives, and described below.   Western Corridor  W-1 would be approximately 8.2 miles long. It would begin just south of Thorncreek Road and would be aligned east of Broenneke Road on its southern end.  As the alignment continues north it would then shift west of Jacksha Road. W-1 would reconnect to existing US-95 near the grain elevators south of the South Fork Palouse River Bridge. Overpass structures would be constructed over Jacksha Road, an unnamed private road, and Snow Road approximately 1,000 feet east of the Idaho/Washington State line. W-2 would be approximately 7.3 miles long.  It would begin just south of Thorncreek Road and would be aligned just east of Broenneke and Jacksha roads. W-2 would reconnect to existing US-95 on the north end of the project near the grain elevators south of the South Fork Palouse River Bridge.  Overpass structures would be constructed over Jacksha Road and Snow Road approximately three quarters of a mile west of the existing junction of US-95 and Snow Road.  W-3 would be approximately 7.8 miles long. It would begin just south of Thorncreek Road and would be aligned east of Broenneke Road and west of Jacksha Road. This alignment would reconnect to existing US-95 near the grain elevators south of the South Fork Palouse River Bridge.  Overpass structures would be constructed over Jacksha Road, an unnamed private road and Snow Road.   W-4 would be approximately 7.5 miles long.  It would begin at Thorncreek Road and would closely follow the existing US-95 alignment to approximately three quarters of a mile south of Zeitler Road. The alignment would then shift west of existing US-95. W-4 would reconnect to existing US-95 near the grain elevators south of the South Fork Palouse River Bridge.  An overpass structure would be constructed over Snow Road.  Central Corridor  C-1 would be approximately 7.3 miles long. It would begin at Thorncreek Road and would closely follow the existing alignment with minor realignments to flatten the horizontal curves and vertical grades.  C-1 would reconnect with existing US-95 near the grain elevators south of the South Fork Palouse River Bridge.  No overpass structures would be constructed.  C-1 would transition from a four-lane divided highway to a four-lane highway with center turn lane, curb, Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 44 Alternatives gutter and sidewalk at the south entrance to Clyde Road. Since this alignment primarily follows the existing US-95, no section of road would be turned over to the NLHD. C-2 would be approximately 7.4 miles long.  It would begin at Thorncreek Road and would closely follow the existing alignment to Zeitler Road. The alignment would then shift west of existing US-95 and continue north.  C-2 would reconnect with existing US-95 near the grain elevators just south of the South Fork Palouse River Bridge.  An overpass structure would be constructed over Snow Road.   C-3 would be approximately 6.8 miles long. It would begin at Thorncreek Road and would closely follow the existing alignment to approximately a quarter mile north of Eid Road. It would continue north running east of existing US-95.  C-3 would reconnect with existing US-95 at Cameron Road to just south of the South Fork of the Palouse River.  An overpass structure would be constructed at Zeitler Road. Eastern Corridor E-1 would be approximately 6.6 miles long. It would begin at Thorncreek Road and would closely follow existing US-95 to the top of Reisenauer Hill. From the top of Reisenauer Hill, it would run north to the power lines approximately one half mile from Cameron Road. E-1 would reconnect with existing US-95 near the grain elevators just south of the South Fork Palouse River Bridge.  E-1 would be further west than E-2 and E-3. An overpass structure would be constructed at Eid Road.  E-2 would be approximately 6.7 miles long. It would begin at Thorncreek Road and closely follow existing US-95 to the top of Reisenauer Hill.  From the top of Reisenauer Hill it would run north continuing to the power lines approximately one half mile from Cameron Road. E-2 would reconnect with existing US-95 near the grain elevators just south of the South Fork Palouse River Bridge.  E-2 would be located approximately one half mile east of the E-1 Alternative, closer to Paradise Ridge. An overpass structure would be constructed at Eid Road. E-3 would be approximately 6.6 miles long.  It would closely follow existing US-95 to the top of Reisenauer Hill.  From the top of Reisenauer Hill, it would run northwest to the power lines approximately one half mile from Cameron Road. E-3 would connect to existing US-95 just south of the South Fork Palouse River Bridge.  E-3 would be located between the E-1 and E-2 Alternatives. An overpass structure would be constructed at Eid Road.  Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 45 Alternatives 2.5.2 Screen	  Alternatives The initial alternatives were evaluated and screened based on environmental and engineering factors. An alternative screening matrix was prepared that displayed the key benefits and environmental resources that could be affected in the project area as a result of the No Action and the 10 Action Alternatives.  The criteria that were considered during the screening of the initial alternatives are listed below.  • Air Quality • Archaeological Sites • Design Standards • Displacements • Environmental Justice • Hazardous Materials • Noise • Prime Farmland • Right-of-Way Acres • Socio-Economic • Ungulates • Water Quality • Wetlands and Tributaries • Estimated Construction Cost • Historic Sites • Plant Species and Communities of Concern • Regulatory Floodways and Floodplains • Safety • State Sensitive Species • Threatened and Endangered Species • Visual Analysis • Weather As a result of the screening process, four alternatives were forwarded for detailed analysis in the DEIS; the No Action Alternative plus one alternative from the western, central and eastern corridors: W-4, C-3 and E-2.  Maintaining a representative alternative from each corridor ensured the evaluation of a full range of reasonable alternatives.  The remaining Action Alternatives were eliminated from further review.  The results of the Level Two Screening were presented in a public meeting on January 18 and 19, 2006.  The resource effects were based on a conceptual level of information and design, available at the time. The rationale for eliminating alternatives from further consideration or forwarding them for detailed analysis is summarized in Table 7. Level Two Screening Results.  The details of the benefits and effects that were considered are described in the Screening of Alternatives Technical Report. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 46 Alternatives Table	  7.	  Level	  Two	  Screening	  Results	  Alternative  Screening Results  Summary of Rationale	  for Eliminating or Forwarding Alternatives  No Action  Forwarded for detailed analysis  Minimal environmental effect.

All of the alternatives would affect wetlands, floodplains, noise, prime farmlands, visual quality and/or cultural resources.  The W-4 Alternative was forwarded for detailed analysis due to its low effects to floodplains, visual quality, ungulate habitat, rare plant communities and a lower crash rate. Based on preliminary information the W-4 Alternative was believed to have less effects to historic resources compared to the other western alternatives.  During the more detailed analysis of W-4 it was determined to affect a historic farmstead; however, due to the other factors involved, W-4 would still have been forwarded. The W-1 and W-3 alternatives were eliminated from further consideration due to their higher effects to ungulate habitat, prime farmlands and direct effects to two rare plant communities. In addition, W-1 had the highest crash rate in the western corridor, which does not meet the purpose and need to the same extent as the other alternatives.   Central Corridor The three central corridor alternatives would all affect cultural resources, wetlands, floodplains, prime farmlands and impact businesses and residences. The C-1 Alternative was eliminated from further consideration because it had the highest crash rate of the three alternatives.  It affected two historic resources and had the greatest number of displacements. In addition to these effects the C-1 Alternative also affected 2.9 more acres of wetland than the C-3 Alternative.  While the central corridor alternatives resulted in similar crash rates, C-2 was eliminated due to its higher impacts to wetlands, floodplains and visual effects. The C-3 Alternative was forwarded for detailed analysis because it had no adverse effects to historic resources and had the least wetland, cultural and visual effects compared to the other central corridor alternatives. Eastern Corridor The alternatives in the eastern corridor resulted in very similar effects. All of the alternatives in this corridor had effects to wetlands, residences and/or businesses, noise, visual, and prime farmlands.  The E-1 Alternative was eliminated from further consideration because it affected one historic resource while the other two alternatives avoided historical resources. In addition, the E-1 Alternative had the highest effects to wetlands and visual quality in the corridor. The E-2 Alternative was forwarded for further consideration because it had the least effect to wetlands, cultural resources and was the only alternative to not directly affect rare plant communities. The E-3 Alternative effects were very similar to the E-2 Alternative but E-3 resulted in three more residential impacts and twice as many business impacts than E-2. While the residential and business impact assumptions and numbers have been modified since the screening report was prepared, the E-2 Alternative still resulted in overall less impact. The E-3 Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 49 Alternatives Alternative directly affected two rare plant communities and resulted in slightly higher effects to prime farmlands compared to E-2. While the differences were small they were higher and more adverse. The E-2 Alternative was forwarded for detailed analysis because it had the least overall effects compared to the other alternatives in the eastern corridor.  The Action Alternatives alignments that were forwarded are shown in Exhibit 12.

The major differences between alternatives are described below and summarized in Table 8. Summary of Alternatives’ Benefits and Effects. See Chapters 3, Affected Environment and Chapter 4, Environmental Consequences for details regarding specific resources and environmental effects by alternative.

As a result the calculations presented during the screening process may differ from the calculations presented in the EIS for the W-4, C-3 and E2 alternatives. ** Identified Ungulate Impact Area which contains agricultural fields with nearby draws, small drainages, ponds, and cover as described in Melquist 2005a. ***Noise impacted receptors that would be removed due to right-of-way acquisition are not included in these numbers. ****The estimated construction costs includes excavation, rock ballast, plant mix, structures, traffic control and illumination. It excludes engineering, construction engineering, mitigation and right-of-way. After the Level Two Screening was completed, additional studies were completed and a more detailed level of analysis was used; therefore the project effects may differ slightly from those calculated during the initial screening of alternatives.  However, the differences were not substantial and would not result in different screening results.  No Action The No Action Alternative includes short-term minor restoration activities (safety and maintenance improvements, etc.) that maintain operation of the existing roadway. It would include projects such as turn lanes at public road approaches within the existing right-of-way.  It would also include pavement overlays and seal coats to maintain the continuing operation of the existing roadway.  The No Action Alternative would serve as a baseline and is required by FHWA NEPA regulations to be considered in the DEIS. The No Action Alternative would not involve major construction or new right-of-way acquisition.  It would continue to have stormwater and air quality effects, but would have the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 59 Alternatives least overall environmental effect.  However, the narrow roadway, roadway curvature and steep grades would still not meet AASHTO standards. It would ascend Reisenauer Hill at an approximately 4.3 percent grade and descend at an approximately six percent grade. With the projected increase in traffic volume the total crashes for the No Action Alternative is estimated to be 27.4 accidents in the year 2017 and 642.5 total crashes from 2017 through 2036.  The No Action Alternative would have a LOS D by 2037 and would be substantially more congested than existing conditions. The No Action Alternative would have the worst safety and LOS compared to any of the alternatives and would not meet the project purpose and need.  Modified W-4  After the DEIS was published, the W-4 Alternative centerline was shifted approximately 120 ft east to avoid a historic farmstead and Section 4(f) resource and is now presented in this FEIS as the Modified W-4 Alternative. It would be aligned west of existing US-95.  This alternative is 6.65 miles long transitioning to a four-lane with center turn lane, curb, gutter and sidewalk for the last 0.3 miles at the northern end of the project. 2.91 miles of the existing US-95 may be turned over to the NLHD. The Modified W-4 would ascend Reisenauer Hill at an approximately 3.5 percent grade and descend at an approximately 4.9 percent grade.  It would impact fewer residences than the E-2 Alternative and would avoid business impacts and potential business impacts.  It would impact the same number of hazardous material sites as the E-2 Alternative. It would use the greatest amount of total right-of-way and would result in the greatest number of tributary crossings. Modified W-4 would not affect potential long-eared myotis, northern alligator lizard and pygmy nuthatch habitat associated with ponderosa pine stands near the base of Paradise Ridge.  C-3 The C-3 alignment would run closest to the current highway near the center of the corridor. This alternative is 5.94 miles long transitioning to a four-lane with center turn lane, curb, gutter and sidewalk for the last 1.42 miles at the northern end of the project. 2.71 miles of the existing US-95 may be turned over to the NLHD. C-3 would ascend Reisenauer Hill at an approximately 3.4 percent grade and descend at an approximately 4.8 percent grade.  It would have the highest crash rate of the Action Alternatives.  It would require the least amount of new right-of-way compared to Modified W-4 and E-2 because it would utilize more of the existing roadway.  C-3 would potentially impact up to eight businesses, would encroach on the greatest number of hazardous material sites, and have the greatest impacts to floodplains.  It would have the longest urban section but would still operate at a LOS A; however, C-3 would have the least wetland and wildlife species effects. Similar to E-2, C-3 would have the fewest tributary crossings but would affect three times more linear feet of tributary channel compared to the E-2 Alternative.   Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 60 Alternatives E-2 (Preferred Alternative) E-2 would be aligned east of existing US-95 near the base of Paradise Ridge.  This alternative is 5.85 miles long transitioning to a four-lane with center turn lane, curb, gutter and sidewalk for the last 0.24 miles at the northern end of the project.  Approximately 5.43 miles of the existing US-95 may be turned over to the NLHD. E-2 would ascend Reisenauer Hill at an approximately 4.1 percent grade and descend at an approximately 4.4 percent grade.  The evaluation of effects during the screening process and the detailed analyses presented in the DEIS resulted in the lead agencies, FHWA and ITD, identifying the E-2 Alternative as the Preferred Alternative for the following reasons: • It would have the greatest safety improvement even considering weather and the safety of the existing US-95 loop. • It would have the fewest access points • It would have the shortest length of five-lane section, the shortest travel time, and the lowest road user cost • It would have the least effect to streams • It would avoid floodplains effects, business impacts and potential business impacts • It would best meet the project purpose and need The primary disadvantages of E-2 compared to the other alternatives are that it would be located closer to the base of Paradise Ridge, which provides moderate ungulate habitat. E 2 would also affect pine stands that are pygmy nuthatch habitat and potential habitat for long-eared myotis and northern alligator lizard. It would have the greatest number of residential impacts. The E-2 Alternative would also have the greatest indirect effects to Palouse remnants, planned and ongoing Palouse restoration projects, and a key conservation area for Spalding’s catchfly because it could result in more weed establishment and habitat degradation compared to the other alternatives due to its proximity to those sites.  While the difference between the total length of the C-3 and E-2 alternatives is just 0.09 miles, over a 20-year period the travel times and road user costs are substantial.  The E-2 Alternative would save 800 hours of travel time and is estimated to cost $19 million less than the C-3 Alternative. This is explained in the US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow; Mobility and Road User Cost Study on Alternatives Carried Forward (ITD 2014a), which is summarized in Sections 3.10 and 4.10.   An important difference as it relates to safety is the length of the five-lane sections (four-lane section with a center turn lane) between alternatives. The five-lane section has approximately three times more predicted crashes than the divided four-lane rural section because the travel lanes are closer together and the turning movements from the center lane and approaches are Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 61 Alternatives predicted to generate more crashes. Other factors also contribute to the differences in safety including intersections and approaches.  The E-2 Alternative would have the fewest country road intersections and the fewest residential and commercial approaches. An alternative will not be selected until the alternatives’ effects and comments on the DEIS and the FEIS have been fully evaluated. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 62 Affected Environment 3 AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT This section describes the existing conditions of the natural and human environment in the study area that could be affected by any of the alternatives presented in the FEIS.  Additional detail regarding the resources may be found in the respective technical reports. The data and level of detail are commensurate with the significance and degree of effects.  The following environmental resources are evaluated in this chapter: • Vegetation, Fish and Wildlife • Socio-economic and Environmental • Threatened and Endangered Species Justice • Transportation • Land Use and Recreation • Visual Quality • Farmland • Traffic Noise • Cultural Resources • Air Quality • Floodplains • Hazardous Materials • Wetlands and Tributaries • Energy • Groundwater 3.1 Socio-‐Economic	  Conditions	  and	  Environmental Justice 3.1.1 Regulatory	  Framework and	  Policies Social and economic conditions and environmental justice are governed by the following: • 23 CFR 771 FHWA Environmental Impact and Related Procedures • 49 CFR 24; Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, as amended • Executive Order (EO) 12898, Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations • USDOT Order to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations • Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 • Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) 3.1.2 Methodology Three detailed technical reports were prepared to evaluate socio-economic conditions and effects, highway-induced growth and effects to environmental justice (low-income and minority) populations. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 63 Affected Environment The Community Impact Assessment (HDR 2006) evaluated the demographic characteristics of Latah County as a whole as well as the project corridor. Population, including age, race and Hispanic origin, employment, and income were analyzed. General population trends, land use, potential impacts to residences or private property, community cohesion, visual and traffic noise effects were also evaluated.  Community members, local officials, and other stakeholders were interviewed to collect information regarding community resources and potential effects. The Community Profile-Induced Development report (HDR 2005a) evaluated existing socioeconomic conditions, land use and development trends in the project area.  A Delphi process, which utilized a panel of local experts, was used to predict highway-related growth. The Delphi process relies on the opinions of a panel of experts to provide their assessment of likely future outcomes by responding to several rounds of questions anonymously. The process is done iteratively with controlled feedback. Anonymity allows participants to focus on the issues, not the personalities of the participants. The repeated rounds with feedback from the moderators allow participants to reconsider their responses in light of new information but prevent lobbying for any point of view. The statistical group response gives the range of opinion as well as the most common response. The local panelists in the Delphi process for this project included:  • Michelle Fuson, Latah County Planning Director • Gundars Rudzitis, University of Idaho Professor • Shelley Bennet, Realtor • Walter Steed, City of Moscow Transportation Commission • Tom LaPointe, Moscow Valley Transit Executive Director • Travis Wambeke, Local Engineering Consultant • Orland Arneberg, North Latah Highway District • Jack Nelson, County Commissioner • Andrew Ackermann, City of Moscow Assistant Community Development Director • BJ Swanson, American West Bank • Cinthya Barnhart, Latah Economic Development Council Executive Director • Jeff Martin, CEO Gritman Medical Center The Environmental Justice Report (HDR 2005b) identified minority and low-income populations in the project area and evaluated the effects of each alternative on Environmental Justice populations.  Updated information for each of the reports was prepared in 2011.  The findings of the reports and updates are summarized in this section.  See the Community Impact Technical Reports. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 64 Affected Environment EO 12898 directs federal agencies to identify and prevent disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects to minority and low-income populations, as a result of federal activities, regardless of population size. According to USDOT, minority and low-income populations are any identifiable group of minority or low-income persons who live in geographic proximity, and if circumstances warrant, geographically dispersed/transient persons who will be similarly affected (FHWA 2009).  Effects are determined to be disproportionately high if the adverse effect is predominantly borne by a minority and/or low-income population and is appreciably more severe than the adverse effect that will be suffered by the remainder of the community. Minority populations are groups that are Black, Hispanic, Asian American, American Indian and Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander (FHWA 2009). Low-income populations are a group of persons whose household income is at or below the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) poverty guidelines (FHWA 2009). The HHS poverty guidelines were $22,050 for a family of four in both 2009 and 2010 (USDHHS 2010). Adverse effects are the combination of significant individual or cumulative human health or environmental effects, including interrelated social and economic effects, which may include, but are not limited to: injury or death, residential impacts, air quality, noise impacts, water pollution, soil contamination; diminution of aesthetic values; or disruption of community cohesion.  It also includes the denial of, reduction in, or significant delay in the receipt of benefits of programs, policies, or activities (FHWA 1998). The determination of whether there would be a disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects as a result of the alternatives was based on evaluating two factors:  • The presence of minority or low-income populations that could be affected by the alternatives. • If low income or minority populations are present, are the effects to those populations disproportionately high or adverse. 3.1.3 Existing	  Conditions This section discusses the demographic characteristics of Latah County and the Thorncreek to Moscow corridor. Characteristics of the population including age, race, Hispanic origin, employment, and income are presented in this section.  See the Community Profile - Induced Development Technical Report and update for details. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 65 Affected Environment The corridor consists of two areas called census block groups: census tract 54, block group 28, and census tract 57, block group 3. Those block groups were larger than the actual corridor boundaries, so the data presented in the profile is more inclusive than the actual demographics found in the corridor.  The City of Genesee population is excluded from the data for the corridor because the city is classified by the Census as its own unit of geography. By excluding this population center, the analysis area is more representative of the corridor study area as a whole. Population The Thorncreek Road to Moscow project consists of primarily undeveloped land dominated by dryland farming.  Public land borders a portion of the eastern edge of the project area.  The main population center associated with the project area is the City of Moscow with a population of approximately 23,800 according to the 2010 US Census data.  The population of the project corridor has experienced a six percent decrease in population between 2000 and 2010 whereas Latah County experienced an increase of nine percent.  See Table 9. Population.   Table	  9.	  Population Year  Latah County  Corridor  2000  34,935  1,307  2004  35,619  1,217  2010  37,244  1,231  Percent Change  +9%  -‐6%  Population and household forecasts to 2021 for Latah County were available from the Idaho Department of Labor. Latah County’s population is forecast to continue increasing moderately reaching 38,797 by 2021. This is an approximately four percent increase. See Table 10. Latah County Population Forecast. Table	  10.	  Latah	  County	  Population	  Forecast Year  Population  Estimated Households9  2010  37,244  14,708  2016  38,162  15,025  2021  38,797  15,349  8 Census Tract 54, Block Group 2 was listed as Census Tract 54, Block Group 6 in the original Community Profile report.

Yet, based on historic trends, low to moderate increases can be anticipated. Age In 2010, the largest concentration of Latah County’s population was in the 15 to 24 and 25 to 44 year old age groups.  These two age groups totaled more than one-half of the county’s entire population. The 45 to 59 year old age group was the next largest.  The median age for Latah County was 28 years old.  The population distribution, especially with a concentration of persons in the 15 to 24 year old age bracket, is consistent with that of a university town population. In the project corridor, the 25 to 44 year old and 45 to 59 year old age groups comprised approximately 49 percent of the population. The next largest age group was the under 15 age group.  In 2010 the median age in the corridor study area was 40 years old. The study area’s population is more similar to an area with families and children. Race and Hispanic Origin In 2010 approximately 92.8 percent of Latah County’s total population was white.  Hispanic origin and other races each comprised 3.7 percent of the populations.  The racial minority and Hispanic origin of Latah County in 2010 was nearly 11 percent of the county’s total population.  See Table 11. Race and Hispanic Origin and Table 12. Percentage Race and Hispanic Origin. Table	  11.	  Race	  and	  Hispanic	  Origin Race	  or Origin  Latah County	  2010  Corridor 2010  White  34,557  1,188  Black  293  5  American	  Indian  237  16  Asian  781  14  Other Races  1,376  8  Total Populations  37,244  1,231  Hispanic  824  20  Source: U.S. Census Bureau, 2010 Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 67 Affected Environment Table	  12.	  Percentage	  Race	  and	  Hispanic	  Origin Race or Origin  Latah County	  2010 (percent)  Corridor 2010 (percent)  White  92.8  96.5  Black  0.8  0.4  American	  Indian  0.6  1.3  Asian  2.1  1.1  Other Races  3.7  0.6  Hispanic origin  3.7  1.6  Source: U.S. Census Bureau, 2010 In the project corridor, 96.5 percent of the total population was white.  The racial minority and Hispanic origin population was five percent.   Housing Units Housing units refer to the structures in which people live, while households refer to the people living in them.  In 2010, Latah County had 15,988 housing units.  See Table 13. Housing Characteristics.  This is a 15 percent increase in housing since 2000.  Table	  13.	  Housing	  Characteristics Housing Variable  Latah County	  2010  Corridor 2010  Total Housing Units  15,988  604  Occupied Units  14,708  538  Owner-‐Occupied  8,265  407  Renter Occupied  6,443  131  Vacant Units  1,280  66  Source: U.S. Census Bureau, 2010 In the project corridor, there was no change in the numbers of housing units between 2000 and 2010.  The project corridor has approximately 20 percent more owner occupied homes than Latah County, and has three percent more vacant units compared to the county.

The services and government sectors contained the largest number of employees each accounting for about one-third of the county’s total employment. Retail trade employment was the third largest employment sector in the county.  The largest employers in Latah County are the University of Idaho and Gritman Medical.  Combined, they employ more than 40 percent of the workers in the county (Tacke pers. comm. 2011). Other major government employers include Latah County, the City of Moscow, and School District #281. The major employers in the service sector are Gritman Medical Center and the Good Samaritan Nursing Home. The primary employers in retail trade are Wal-Mart, Winco, and Rosauers Super Markets.  Employment data was not available for the forestry, fishing and mining employment sectors.  See Table 15.

Comm. Tacke, 2011 Detailed employment data or forecasts were not readily available for the project corridor. However, based on an inventory of the land use, farming, agricultural related services, and general service providers appear to be the primary sources of employment in the corridor. Latah County’s employment projections are based on forecasts prepared for each sector of the county’s economy.  Latah County’s full and part-time employment is forecast to increase by approximately ten percent by 2021. See Table 16. Latah County Employment Forecast. Detailed predictions showed the strongest employment gains are expected in the retail trade, government, and health care trade sectors. Table	  16.	  Latah	  County	  Employment	  Forecast Year  Employed Persons  2010  21,012  2016  22,582  2021  23,215  Source: Idaho Department of Labor, 2010 Income The largest concentration of households in Latah County had incomes below $15,000 in 2009.  That income distribution is consistent with an area with a large concentration of university students. The next largest concentration of households in Latah County was in the $50,000 to $75,000 income range.  See Table 17. Latah County Households by Income Range. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 71 Affected Environment Table	  17.	  Latah	  County	  Households	  by	  Income	  Range	  Income 	  Range  Latah County	  (# of	  Households)  Corridor (# of	  Households)  Under $15,000  2,874  147  $15,000	  to $25,000  2,405  137  $25,000	  to $35,000  1,638  57  $35,000	  to $50,000  1,889  118  $50,000	  to $75,000  2,705  186  $75,000	  to $100,000  1,245  132  $100,000	  to $150,00  998  63  $150,000	  and More  446  35  Total  14,200  875  The per capita income in the corridor remained higher ($24,370) than for Latah County ($19,921) in 2010 (HDR 2011a). The higher per capita income in the corridor area compared to the county, generally indicates that the area does not have a higher than average percentage of low-income residents.  3.1.4 Environmental Justice	  Populations An Environmental Justice population may include low-income or minority populations.  This section provides information regarding the presence of these populations within the study area.  Minority Populations While minorities are present in the study area, there do not appear to be distinguishable minority populations.  Based on the block level analysis, the largest percentage of minorities, 10.6 percent, occurs near the Hidden Village and Benson Mobile Home parks. Approximately 6.6 percent of the populations residing near the Woodland Heights Mobile Home Court are minorities (HDR 2011b). Low-income Populations A low-income population for the purpose of environmental justice is based on poverty levels established by Human and Health Services.  The poverty level standard in 2009 and 2010 was $22,050 for a family of four (USDHHS 2010).  See Table 17. Latah County Households by Income Range and Table 18. Families Living Below Poverty Level.  Rental housing can also be used as an indicator of income.  Currently, there are no recipients of rental assistance within the corridor (IDHF 2011). Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 72 Affected Environment Table	  18.	  Families	  Living	  Below	  Poverty	  Level	  Location  Families (2010)  Families Below Poverty Level (2009)  Latah County  8,268  871	  (9.4%)  Census Tract 54, Block Group	  2 (previously Block Group 6)  179  5	  (3%)  Census Tract 57, Block Group	  3  389  6	  (2%)  Source: IDHF 2011 Subpopulations of Concern A windshield survey of the project corridor identified subpopulations that could have low-income populations and a potential source of low-cost housing.  These were located at the Woodland Heights Mobile Home Court (previously Valhalla Mobile Home Park), Hidden Village Mobile Home Park and Benson Mobile Home Park. The residences in these facilities included a combination of wood-frame homes, manufactured or mobile homes, trailers and recreational vehicles (RVs).  RV’s are most commonly temporarily occupied and for the purposes of this description, RVs are distinguished from other types of residences.  Income data was not available for the residents and the mobile home park. However, records of need based rental assistance showed that there were no residents in the project area that obtained assistance. Many of the rentals in the corridor study area are located in the general vicinity of mobile home parks.   The Woodland Heights Mobile Home Court is located in the northern portion of the study area on the west side of US-95 approximately two miles south of Moscow (MP 342.5). The park contains 27 spaces for residences and RVs the majority of which are rentals.  It currently contains 18 residences and five RVs. Three additional RV spaces are vacant and one additional space for a residence exists. Two additional residences are not managed as part of the facility.  The Hidden Village Mobile Home Park is located on Eid Road on the east side of US-95 approximately five miles south of Moscow (MP 339.6). The park contains 32 residences, only one of which is a rental.   The Benson Mobile Home Park is located on Eid Road just east of the Hidden Village Mobile Home Park.  It contains eight residences  and two RV spaces all of which are rentals. 3.2 Land	  Use and	  Recreation 3.2.1 Regulatory	  and	  Policy	  Framework Land use and recreation are governed by the following:  Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 73 Affected Environment • 23 CFR 774-Parks, Recreation Areas, Wildlife and Waterfowl Refuges, and Historic Sites (Section 4(f)) • 1975 Land Use Planning Act of the State of Idaho, Title 67, Chapter 65 • Moscow Comprehensive Plan (City of Moscow 2009) • Moscow Zoning Ordinance • Latah County Comprehensive Plan (Latah County 2010) • Latah County Zoning Map • Latah County Land Use Ordinance (Latah County 2006) • Section 6(f) of the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCFA) • 23 USC 138: Preservation of Parklands NEPA requires that the project action be assessed to determine if it is compatible with existing land use plans.  The land use in the project area is regulated through city impact agreements, zoning ordinances and zoning classifications with incorporated areas falling within municipal jurisdiction and un-incorporated areas falling under county jurisdiction. 3.2.2 Methodology A technical report titled Community Profile - Induced Development (HDR 2005a) was prepared and is summarized in this section.  The report evaluated existing socio-economic conditions, land use planning documents and development data in the project area.  A Delphi process, involving interviews with a panel of local experts, was used to predict development trends and highway-related growth.  It was also used in the evaluation of the alternatives’ consistency with land use plans. Reports were prepared in 2011 to provide updated information.  See the Community Impact Technical Reports.   Planning documents that govern the land uses in the project area were evaluated to determine if the alternatives would be consistent with city, county and regional land use policies.  Existing land uses were verified by comparing geographic information system (GIS) data with the results of field visits in the study area.  City and county staff were interviewed and completed questionnaires regarding existing conditions and planned development in 2004 and 2011.  A regional analysis and local trends analysis were performed to describe effects related to projected growth within the study area.   3.2.3 Existing	  Conditions Land Use The majority of the corridor is surrounded by agricultural land with associated farmhouses and agricultural buildings. There are clusters of residential development along certain portions of the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 74 Affected Environment corridor (Zeitler Road, Cameron Road, and Clyde Road) and two areas (Woodland Heights Mobile Home Court and Hidden Village /Benson Park) that have a concentration of residences. The northern portion of the corridor is more highly developed with a mix of uses and an emphasis on auto-oriented businesses such as RV parts and service, automotive repair facilities, and trucking services.   Approximately 58 percent of all property in Latah County is privately owned. Nearly 16 percent of the county’s land is owned by the federal government with most of that land in the St. Joe and Clearwater National Forest. State held land accounts for five percent of the county and includes the US-95 right-of-way. Most of the state property is endowment land for education.  See Table 19. Latah County General Land Ownership. Table	  19.	  Latah 	  County 	  General 	  Land 	  Ownership Land Ownership  Acreage  Percentage  Private	   404,682  58.7  Forest Industry  126,701  18.4  US Government  108,285  15.7  State	   35,577  5.2  University  9,856  1.4  Highway  2,100  0.3  City Owned  1,990  0.3  Railroad	   665  0.1  Latah County	   493  0.1  School District  296  Less than 0.1  Nearly 96 percent of Latah County is in low intensity land use such as forest land and agriculture. The county contains 3,400 acres of land designated as urban, which accounts for about a half percent of the county’s total land. See Community Impact Technical Reports; Community Profile and Induced Development (HDR 2005a). Low-density residential development is the only type of residential development allowed in unincorporated Latah County. Commercial developments are expected along US-95 at the southern edge of the city limits. City of Moscow Comprehensive Plan The City of Moscow adopted a new Comprehensive Plan in 2009.  While most of the project area is located outside the City limits, Latah County has adopted the City of Moscow’s zoning ordinance and zoning classifications for the area of impact located in the northern end of the project. The land outside the city limits in the Area of City Impact is currently characterized in Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 75 Affected Environment the City of Moscow Comprehensive Plan as Auto Urban Industrial.  The future planned use includes Auto Urban Commercial, Industrial, Urban Residential and Auto Urban Residential.  Zoned by Latah County as Urban Residential, Auto-AF-Agriculture/Forestry with smaller areas of Motor Business Industrial and Commercial along US-95.  The City of Moscow Comprehensive Plan promotes a system of transportation and circulation within and around the city that will make it possible for all people utilizing various modes of transportation to reach their destination as safely and as easily as possible, with the least disturbance possible occurring upon adjacent uses. The plan also states that roads and intersections are to be designed to restrict and control vehicular access along state and federal highways in the Area of City Impact.  The area east of US-95 at the southern edge of the city is designated as light industrial use. The City of Moscow Comprehensive Plan update did not address any of the proposed US-95 alignments but does consider the following potential developments (City of Moscow 2009): • The City of Moscow plans to develop the Ring Road concept, which is a long range, unfunded improvement. The project is a planned loop around the City of Moscow that would permit through traffic on both US-95 and SH-8 to travel around the perimeter of the City to facilitate circulation in and around Moscow and to reduce congestion from regional through traffic.  The Ring Road would be on both sides of US-95 with a crossing just south of the Primeland Silos. The Ring Road Concept has been developed to a point that an alignment is proposed based on topographic conditions, expected design standards, and anticipated use. The concept and alignment have been based upon ITD design standards in the southwest quadrant (US-95 to SH-8) and Minor Arterial Standards in all other quadrants. • A proposed ball park (parks and open space) was rezoned and annexed into the City. Build-out of the park isn’t anticipated for several years but it is included in the Parks and Recreation Master Plan (City of Moscow 2009). • Future auto-urban commercial land uses are planned along the US-95 corridor entering Moscow. • Auto-urban residential growth areas have been extended further south of the City. • The City of Moscow recently worked on a new Master Plan for an Industrial Park that is located north of the South Fork of the Palouse River. Latah County Comprehensive Plan Latah County adopted a new Comprehensive Plan and Land Use Zoning (Resolution 2010-32) in December 2010.  However, the plan remains relatively unchanged from the previous plan with Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 76 Affected Environment the same goals to maintain the largely rural nature of the county.  The Comprehensive Plan goals are stated below: • Preservation of the rural character of Latah County to ensure the protection of the cultural, scenic and natural amenities presently found in the county. • Preservation of agricultural and forest land uses to ensure the continued viability of an agricultural and forest based economy in rural Latah County. • Fostering of other land uses which will help achieve a solid broad based and sustainable economic foundation. • Clustering of commercial and higher density residential uses in and around areas with adequate public services. • Ensure that land use policies do not unconstitutionally violate private property rights. The key policies related to transportation and the project in the new Comprehensive Plan includes:   • Limit the number of access points to state and federal highways. • Ensure that buildings are set back a safe distance from public roads. • The Ring Road concept is included as a transportation element in the project area (Latah County 2010). The plans reflect the goals of protecting productive agricultural and forested areas and to identify suitable areas for future residential, commercial, or industrial development. North Latah County Highway District Transportation Plan  The North Latah County Highway District (NLHD) Transportation Plan was completed in November 2006. This was an update to a previous transportation plan. The plan discusses the potential re-alignment of US-95. It verifies that three alignments are being considered and that once a final alignment is selected, approved, and constructed, the current US-95 roadway will be placed under the jurisdiction of the NLHD (Carscallen pers. comm. 2011). The plan also incorporates the Ring Road concept and alignments. Other Plans  The Moscow School District is preparing a Long-Range Facilities Plan. The City of Moscow began preparing a transportation plan in 2012 with anticipated completion in 2014. Recreation Primary recreational facilities in the project area are shown in Exhibit 19. Points of Interest and include the following: Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 77 Affected Environment • Frontier Park • Paradise Ridge Road (bicycling and hiking) • University of Idaho Golf Course • University of Idaho Arboretum • Planned recreational areas including multi-use ball fields, Latah Trail and an arboretum. • Planned linear park/pathway along the Southfork of the Palouse River • Paradise Ridge is privately owned land but is often used recreationally with landowner permission. The Latah County Comprehensive Plan goals for recreation are to encourage a variety of recreational opportunities in Latah County by implementing policies that: • Encourage the development of suitable land for recreational uses. • Ensure the compatibility of recreational areas with adjoining land uses. • Encourage the dedication of land within new developments for recreational use. 3.2.4 Paradise	  Ridge Paradise Ridge is a landform located southeast of Moscow.  It is a term used by the local community to describe not only the highest elevation of the ridge (3702 ft) but also the area surrounding the ridge.  There does not appear to be a defined geographic boundary associated with Paradise Ridge other than the boundary of the South end of Paradise Ridge remnant, which is described in Section 3.8.  Therefore, to facilitate the discussion in this FEIS, a boundary for Paradise Ridge was estimated based on topography near the 3100 ft contour. See Exhibit 20. Paradise Ridge. Paradise Ridge consists of privately owned parcels with primarily rural residential developments, commercial developments, actively farmed land, and Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) land. There are growing rural residential developments on and surrounding Paradise Ridge, which may have roads, driveways, fences, domesticated animals, and other associated human activity but is not considered dense development. It is zoned for one unit per acre.  Paradise Ridge has been used recreationally with permission from the private landowners as there is no public access to properties nor are there special protections from development. Paradise Ridge Road is used for biking and walking and local access.  It also offers scenic value as described in Section 3.11 and wildlife habitat as described in Section 3.8.   Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 78 Affected Environment Exhibit	  20.	  Paradise	  Ridge	  Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 79 Affected Environment 3.3 Farmland 3.3.1 Regulatory	  Framework and	  Policies Farmland is governed by the following: • The Farmland Protection Policy Act (FPPA) of 1981 • Guidelines for Implementing the Final Rule of the Farmland Protection Policy Act for Highway Projects • State of Idaho Local Land Use Planning Act The FPPA of 1981 requires that federal projects minimize the conversion of farmland to nonagricultural uses, and that projects consider state and local farmland protection policies to the extent that is practical. Farmland subject to FPPA includes prime and unique farmland and farmland of statewide importance.  Farmland considered under FPPA does not have to be currently used for agriculture but cannot be water, urban or developed land (FHWA 1989). 3.3.2 Methodology A technical report titled Farmland Protection Policy Act (Haagan 2006) was prepared to assess the farmlands in the project area and to determine the relative effects of the alternatives to farmland. The study area was evaluated for prime, unique, and farmland of statewide importance by reviewing farmland soil lists, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) maps and through consultation with Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS).  A Land Evaluation and Site Assessment were completed in order to rate and rank sites for agricultural importance (Haagen 2006).  The information for each alternative was recorded by NRCS staff in the NRCS Form NRCS-CPA-106 in December 3, 2006.  See Appendix 1, Key Agency Correspondence and Forms, Farmland Conversion Impact Rating for Corridor Type Projects. The 2006 report was reviewed by the author, Ed Haagen in 2011 and he determined that the crop rotations, farming operations, and leasing arrangements had changed slightly since the original analysis and will continue to change. However, the existing conditions in 2011 do not differ substantially from those in 2006.  Site assessment criteria that were considered in the farmland conversion impact rating score for each alternative included: • Area in non urban use • Perimeter in non urban use • Percent of corridor being farmed • Protection provided by state or local government • Size of farm unit compared to average • Creation of non farmable units • Availability of farm support Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 80 Affected Environment • On-farm investments • Effects of conversion on farm support services • Compatibility with existing agricultural use The USDA recommends that alternatives with farmland impact rating scores totaling 160 points or greater be given increasingly high levels of consideration for protection from conversion. See the Farmland Technical Report for more information.  Agricultural lands not considered prime farmlands or prime farmland soils under the USDA definition are also considered under NEPA. The farmland classification system identifies map units as prime farmland, unique farmland, farmland of statewide importance, and farmland of local importance.  Further clarification of farmland classifications may be found in the National Soils Survey Handbook (USDA 2007).  Prime farmland is land that has the best combination of physical and chemical characteristics for producing food, feed, forage, fiber, and oilseed crops and is available for these uses. Examples of these crops include grain, forage, fiber, oilseed, sugar beets, sugarcane, vegetables, tobacco, orchard, vineyard, and bush fruit crops. The land must have the soil quality, growing season and moisture supply needed to economically produce sustained high yields of crops when treated and managed according to acceptable farming methods (USDA 1991). Prime farmland soils currently located in or committed to urban development are not subject to the FPPA. Unique farmland is land other than prime farmland used for the production of specific high-value food and fiber crops. It has the special combination of soil quality, location, growing season, and moisture supply needed to economically produce sustained high quality and/or high yields of a specific crop when treated and managed according to acceptable farming methods. Examples of such crops include citrus, tree nuts, olives and cranberries. Farmland of statewide importance is classified by the NRCS as farmland of lesser quality than prime farmland by having the soil, water supply and other characteristics that, with good management, yield productive crops.  Farmland of local importance. In some local areas, there is concern for certain additional farmlands for the production of food, feed, fiber, forage, and oilseed crops even though these lands are not identified as having national or statewide importance.  Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 81 Affected Environment 3.3.3 Existing	  Conditions This section discusses general farmland trends, crops and farmland within the study area classified as prime, unique and farmland of statewide importance (Environmental Analysis Bureau 1997). There are approximately 265,000 acres of cropland in Latah County. Farming operations are generally privately owned family farms but in many cases include leased land. The average farm size in Latah County is 494 acres; however, considering rental property, many producers are farming more than 1,000 acres.  The principal crop is winter wheat with an average yield of about 80 bushels per acre. Other primary crops grown in the area include barley, field peas, garbanzo beans and lentils.  See Table 20. Latah County Crop Production.  These crops are usually grown in a rotation with winter wheat to prevent disease and control erosion. Spring barley or lentils followed by two or three years of winter wheat would be a normal rotation for the area. Rotations vary depending on the producer’s farming operation and the conservation programs in which the farm is enrolled. Table 20. Latah County Crop Production shows the acreages and percentages of crops in Latah County. Table	  20.	  Latah 	  County 	  Crop 	  Production Crop  Estimated Acres of Production (2005)  Estimated Percent of Total Production  Wheat  97,068  43  Barley  10,550  5  Peas  21,011  9  Lentils  31,976  14  Garbanzo  10,406  5  Canola  228  Less than 1  Rapeseed  452  Less than 1  Conservation	  Reserve Program (CRP)  46,410  21  Hay  5,027  2  Pasture  131  Less than 1  Total  223,259  100  There are an estimated 11,000 acres of land designated as crop fields in the project area of which approximately 98 percent is privately owned. The western corridor is considered to have the most productive farmland in the project area. Table 21. Farmland Classifications in Project Corridor shows the farmland types within the project corridor.  Farmland classified as Prime and Farmland of Statewide Importance are present in the study area. No farmland classified as Unique occurs in the project area or in Latah County. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 82 Affected Environment Table	  21.	  Farmland	  Classifications	  in	  Project	  Corridor	  Farmland Type  Estimated Land Currently in Production (acres)  Cultivated	  Crops  9,000  Hay or Pasture  500  Shrub Vegetation  550  Farms, rural residences, commercial areas, forest land, highway right-‐of-‐way and water  400  Conservation	  Reserve Program  1,500  Approximately 1,500 acres of land in the project area is enrolled in the CRP and administered by the Farm Service Agency (FSA).

The program is voluntary and offers no special protections or long-term protection. Farmers are paid rental rates and enrolled the land for 10-15 years but may cancel enrollment at any time. Offers for CRP contracts are ranked according to the Environmental Benefits Index (EBI) which is based on the relative environmental benefits in comparison to all other offers and selections made from that ranking. The following EBI factors are considered in the CRP lands: • Wildlife habitat benefits resulting from covers on contract acreage; • Water quality benefits from reduced erosion, runoff, and leaching; • On-farm benefits from reduced erosion; • Benefits that will likely endure beyond the contract period; • Air quality benefits from reduced wind erosion; • Cost The ecological value of CRP program lands as well as its function as matrix habitat is discussed in Section 3.8. 3.4 Cultural Resources 3.4.1 Regulatory	  Framework and	  Policies Cultural resources are governed by the following: • 16 USC 470-National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), Section 106 and Implementing Regulations • 36 CFR 800-Protection of Historic Properties • 23 CFR 774-Parks, Recreation Areas, Wildlife and Waterfowl Refuges, and Historic Sites (Section 4(f)) Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 83 Affected Environment • 49 USC 303-Policy on Lands, Wildlife and waterfowl refuges, and historic sites • 42 USC 1996 and 1996a-American Indian Religious Freedom Act (AIRFA) • 16 USC 431-433-Antiquities Act • 25 USC 3001-Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) • Idaho Graves Protection Act: Title 27, Idaho Statutes, Cemeteries, and Crematoriums Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA) requires federal agencies to take into account the effects of their undertakings on historic properties, and afford the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) a reasonable opportunity to comment. The historic preservation review process mandated by Section 106 is outlined in 36 CFR Part 800.  The NHPA defines the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) criteria for eligibility (A through D), explains the need for properties to retain enough elements of integrity (location, design, setting, workmanship, materials, feeling and association) to be eligible for the NRHP, and defines the meaning of the different effect determinations.  3.4.2 Methodology The area of potential effect (APE) established for the project was initially based on approximately 250 feet from the centerlines of the alignments and areas immediately adjacent to these locations for each of the Action Alternatives.  In 2011, the cultural resource survey technical report was updated and the evaluation area was expanded to approximately 500 feet from the centerlines of the alternatives.  In 2015, ITD Cultural Resources Staff was asked to consider impacts to historic properties as a result of the Modified W-4 Alternative. The footprint of the Modified W-4 Alternative, plus an additional 250 feet from the Modified W-4 Alternative centerline was considered during the evaluation.  The Idaho State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) along with the Nez Perce Tribe and Nez Perce Tribal Historic Preservation Office (THPO) were consulted throughout the process regarding the APE to identify any culturally important sites that should be considered during the survey and EIS development. Consultation between these parties included discussions regarding all proposed alignments, including the Modified W-4 Alternative.  ITD District 2 has been meeting quarterly with the Nez Perce Tribe to consult on planned projects since 2002.  This project has been discussed numerous times during that consultation. The dates of Tribal consultation are listed in Chapter 7, Public Involvement and Agency Coordination.  The most recent Tribal consultation letters and the ITD Memorandum of Understanding with the Nez Perce Tribe are included in Appendix 1, Key Agency Correspondence and Forms.   Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 84 Affected Environment Pre-field research including literature reviews, known historical sites, and ethnographic/ historic background were completed.  Field studies were completed in 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2011 to determine cultural resource probability, identify cultural resources, document and record historic building and structures, and complete archaeological survey. In addition to visual survey, subsurface shovel testing was completed in selected locations.  An initial report was prepared during the early project scoping but was not distributed with the DEIS Cultural Resource Technical Report due to the confidentiality of the content. The report is titled A Cultural Resources Probability Study for Idaho Transportation Department’s Proposed US 95 Thorn Creek Road to Moscow, Stage 1 Project, Latah County, Idaho (Sharley and Gough, 2005).  The report focused on the likelihood of encountering prehistoric Native American resources in the 12 square mile project area. It cited ethnographic/historic information about Native Americans including information regarding camas root grounds, hunting areas, travel routes, known and predicted camp locations, and the relationships of camps to landscape features such as Palouse highlands, camas meadows and stream valleys. This information helped to identify where sites were most likely to be located and where further investigation should be focused.  This report did not dismiss the possibility of significant tribal resources or sites in the project area.  Some of the same ethnographic citations were used in subsequent cultural resource surveys for the project. The following additional cultural resource survey technical reports were prepared to evaluate if archaeological and historic resources are present and would be affected by the alternatives. The information from the reports is summarized in this section. • Historic Resources Survey update to An Historic Buildings/Structures Survey for the Idaho Transportation Department’s Proposed US 95, Thorn Creek Road to Moscow, Stage 1 Project, Latah County, Idaho (November 2011) (Cardno-Entrix 2011) • Cultural Resources Surveys of Idaho Transportation Department Proposed US-95, Thorn Creek Road to Moscow, Phase 1, Project Latah County Idaho (AHS 2006) • Historic Buildings/ Structures Survey: US-95, Thorn Creek Road to Moscow, Stage 1 (Sharley 2005) The technical report titled Cultural Resources Surveys of Idaho Transportation Department Proposed US-95, Thorn Creek Road to Moscow, Phase 1; Project Latah County Idaho (AHS 2006) was submitted to the Idaho SHPO in 2006.  SHPO concurred with the suggested NRHP eligibility and determination of effects for the alternatives in January 2, 2007.  Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 85 Affected Environment An update to the 2006 Cultural Resources Survey Technical Report was prepared in November 2011 and was submitted to SHPO for review. In their responses of January 23, 2012 and March 8, 2012, SHPO determined that one additional resource, the Mountain Mart/Goodman Oil Convenience Store, is eligible for listing on the NRHP.  During the evaluation of the Modified W-4 Alternative in 2015, ITD discussed the APE and the level of effort needed with both the Idaho SHPO and the Nez Perce THPO. All parties agreed that no additional fieldwork would be required at this time. Because the Modified W-4 Alternative footprint is so close to the originally proposed W-4 Alternative, and based on the fact that the previous cultural resource (mainly archaeological investigations) fieldwork has not resulted in the identification of archaeological sites, there is little potential for archaeological resources to be present within the APE for the Modified W-4 Alternative.  An Addenndum to the 2006 Cultural Resource Survey Technical Report (ITD 2015c) was prepared and submitted to SHPO for review in April 2015.  The addendum evaluated the effects of the Modified W-4 Alternative on historic properties. On June 16, 2015, the SHPO provided a letter of concurrence to ITD stating that there would be No Effect to historic properties as a result of the proposed Modified W-4 Alternative.  See Appendix 1, Key Agency Correspondence and Forms for associated documentation.   3.4.3 Existing	  Conditions Cultural Resources in the APE Of the potentially historic sites identified within the project APE, three are eligible for listing in the NRHP; the Arthur Snow Farm (house and garage), the Deesten/Davis Farmstead and the Mountain Mart/Goodman Oil Convenience Store, which was demolished in 2014.  See the Cultural Resources Technical Report for additional detail. None would be affected by any of the alternatives and is further discussed in Section 4.4 Cultural Resource Effects and Chapter 5. Section 4(f) Evaluation. Prehistoric cultural resources are not known in the project APE, and while they are likely present, previous survey of more than 50 percent of the existing US-95 corridor has failed to locate any prehistoric sites (AHS, 2006). Native Americans undoubtedly used and traversed the APE; however, there was more ethnographically documented activity along major stream valleys. The large camas meadow at Moscow north of the APE would have been widely used, but no similar camas meadows are known to have existed within the APE. Exploited camas meadows should have associated camp and camas processing sites. Stream valleys in the project APE provided water, plant, and animal resources and relatively flat land for campsites. While valleys possess the greatest prehistoric site probability, this probability is moderate and the remaining project APE has low prehistoric site probability. The APE is Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 86 Affected Environment outside of the area of aboriginal village locations, and lacks a number of the environmental characteristics typical of the known distribution of Nez Perce camps (Sharley and Gough, 2005). Prehistoric camps or resource exploitation sites may be present in the project APE; however, in lower quantities than elsewhere in the region (Sharley and Gough, 2005). Arthur Snow Farm House and Garage (IHSI #57-13692) This residence is situated in a low-density residential area in the rolling Palouse hills two miles south of Moscow.  The residence was built in 1919 for Arthur Snow, an Idaho State Legislator.  It is a large, well-preserved craftsman style house with a matching detached garage that was constructed in 1921.  The buildings were once part of a large farm complex; however, the other structures burned down in 2003.  The house and garage are the only remaining structures.  Removal of the primary features, including the barn, and the absence of important physical information, renders the historic farm complex as a whole ineligible for listing in the NRHP.  However, the house and garage are individually eligible for listing in the NRHP under Criteria B for their association with Arthur Snow and Harold Snow, both Idaho State Legislators and influential community leaders.  They are both also eligible for listing under Criteria C as excellent, intact examples of craftsman residential architecture and for their artistic merits.  Deesten/Davis Farmstead, Farmstead (Field #US 95 22) This farmstead is located immediately west of US-95 and approximately four miles south of Moscow.  It consists of eight primary buildings; a farmhouse, garage, barn, granary, chicken house, smoke house, shop, and equipment shed.  The property is surrounded by actively cultivated Palouse farmland. See Exhibit 21. Deesten/Davis Farmstead as Viewed from US-95. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 87 Affected Environment Exhibit	  21.	  Deesten/Davis	  Farmstead	  as	  Viewed	  from	  US-‐95 The property also includes two groves of trees planted in the 1930s by the Civilian Conservation Corps, an orchard, cottonwoods, a conifer windbreak and a black walnut tree from Germany.  The farm was originally patented to William Plummer in 1882 as a cash entry land claim (BLM 2005) and is remarkably intact.  The house, barn and other primary buildings are in good condition with no intrusive modern elements. The property is eligible for NRHP listing under Criterion A, for its association with regional agricultural development.  The property is also eligible under Criterion C as an excellent example of early 20th century farmstead architecture and layout. Mountain Mart/Goodman Oil Convenience Store (HS-02) The Mountain Mart site, also known as Goodman Oil, is located immediately south of the South Fork Palouse River Bridge on the east side of US-95 and is currently abandoned.  The property had several buildings located on the site, including fuel pumps, garages and utility buildings. The Mountain Mart office/shop was built in 1963 and was the only structure determined to be eligible for the NRHP; however, the owner demolished it in 2014. The building was octagonal construction, prefabricated materials, and a modernist vernacular design, which is unusual and unique for a rural community in Idaho.  The building had a circular, flat roof.  Five of the sides were almost entirely glazed in metal units. Three of these sides were vertical, three were light windows, and the north and west faces had metal entrance doors at their center.  The central door had a louvered ventilation window.  The building was eligible under Criteria C as an excellent example of mid-century modern architectural design.  The octagonal/round form, the large glass Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 88 Affected Environment exposure, flat roof, metal components and cinderblock walls were all distinctive characteristics of the type, period and method of construction of the genre.  Although a comprehensive survey of gas stations has not yet been conducted in Idaho, this example was a rare survivor of the property type.  See Exhibit 22.

This includes all interstate waters, waters from which fish or shellfish could be taken and sold in interstate or foreign commerce, and all tributaries of the waters described above. Wetlands are defined as those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions.  Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas [33 CFR 328.3(b)].  The Clean Water Act (CWA) establishes national goals and policies to restore and maintain chemical, physical and biological integrity of the Waters of the US. Section 401 of the CWA regulates water quality of Waters of the US. Section 402 of the CWA regulates the discharge of pollutants from point and non-point sources (National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)).  Section 404 of the CWA regulates the discharge of fill or dredged material into Waters of the US and is implemented by the USACE and EPA.  Waters of the US, including wetlands, that are jurisdictional by the USACE and would be affected, would require a permit through the USACE.  Lands meeting the definition of wetland, but which are not considered jurisdictional by the USACE are still considered under 23 CFR 777 Mitigation for Wetlands and Aquatic Habitats which requires a no net loss of wetland function and value. IDEQ is the state agency responsible for implementing the 401 certification process. IDEQ develops and enforces water quality standards that are intended to protect beneficial uses of a Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 91 Affected Environment water body.  EPA is responsible for ensuring that the standards, which IDEQ adopts, are aligned with the requirements of the CWA.  IDEQ water quality standards consist of three components: 1) an anti-degradation policy to maintain existing water quality independent of designated uses; 2) beneficial uses designated for a specific water body based on plants and animals present and activities taking place in the waterway; and 3) criteria to protect water quality necessary to support the designated beneficial uses (for example, limits on temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, turbidity, and ammonia).  IDEQ considers physical, chemical, and biological characteristics, geographic setting, scenic qualities and economic and public values when designating a water body’s beneficial uses. The IDEQ releases a report listing and describing impaired segments of water bodies. All impaired waterways are required to have a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) prepared for each pollutant listed as impaired. TMDLs are calculations of the maximum amount of a pollutant that a water body can assimilate while still complying with water quality standards. 3.6.2 Methodology The following wetland technical reports were prepared to evaluate wetlands and tributaries that could be affected by the alternatives: • Thorncreek Road to Moscow Determination of Jurisdictional Waters of the United States (Gilmore 2005) - This report was incorporated into and replaced by Gilmore 2012. • Thorncreek Road to Moscow - Wetland Functions and Evaluation (Gilmore 2006) -This report was incorporated into and replaced by Gilmore 2012. • Thorncreek Road to Moscow, Wetland Delineation Report (Gilmore 2012) - This is the full and current Wetland Technical Report. In 2012, the earlier wetland delineations and functional assessments (Gilmore 2005 and Gilmore 2006) were reviewed, considering new guidance and the revised methodology (Regional Supplement to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Wetland Delineation Manual: Arid West Region (USACE 2008)). In addition, ITD worked with the USACE to identify tributaries and wetlands that occur in the project area.  In 2012, additional function and value ratings were completed for affected wetlands. The results of the wetland delineation and the function and value assessments for the affected wetlands, were updated and compiled into one comprehensive report titled Thorncreek Road to Moscow, Wetland Delineation Report (Gilmore 2012) which also contains detailed maps of the tributaries and wetlands in the study area.  The wetland and tributary impacts were recalculated based on the revised information in the Gilmore 2012 report and reflected in the DEIS.  Those calculations remain unchanged in the FEIS. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 92 Affected Environment Over 150 acres were evaluated for wetlands.  One hundred fifteen test sites were evaluated during the 2004 through 2005 field investigations. The findings were displayed on field data sheets in Appendix C of the 2012 report. The project area was revisited on September 15 and 16, October 3, and December 5, 2011 to determine if substantial land use changes had occurred at or near the resource. The original field data sheets were reviewed based on the changes between the USACE delineation manual (Environmental Laboratory 1987) and the 2008 supplement (USACE 2008) and in light of the most recent wetland regulations and guidance. The functions and values of the affected wetlands were assessed in accordance with the Washington State Wetland Rating System for Eastern Washington (Hruby 2004).  The project area borders Washington State and the Washington rating system provides a much more comprehensive assessment of wetland functions and values compared to the Montana Department of Transportation method that has also been used by ITD on projects. This rating system assigns wetlands a category between I and IV based on how well they provide water quality, hydrologic, and habitat functions.  Each function is scored on how well the wetland is providing that function and its potential to increase that function within a given area. The maximum score for water quality, hydrologic, and habitat functions are 24, 32, and 32 respectively. The higher the score and percentage of the total, the higher that wetland is functioning for the parameter. The total of the scores for the three functions determines the functional category.  Category I is considered the highest quality and is the most difficult to replace.  Category IV wetlands are typically disturbed and are considered the most easily replaced.   • Category I wetlands are those that 1) represent a unique or rare wetland type; or 2) are more sensitive to disturbance than most wetlands; or 3) are relatively undisturbed and contain ecological attributes that are impossible to replace within a human lifetime; or 4) provide a high level of functions. • Category II wetlands are difficult, though not impossible, to replace, and provide high levels of some functions. These wetlands occur more commonly than Category I wetlands, but still need a relatively high level of protection. • Category III wetlands are 1) vernal pools that are isolated, and 2) wetlands with a moderate level of functions. These wetlands generally have been disturbed in some ways, and are often smaller, less diverse than Category II wetlands. • Category IV wetlands have the lowest levels of functions and are often heavily disturbed. These are wetlands that should be replaceable, and in some cases may be improved. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 93 Affected Environment 3.6.3 Existing	  Conditions Tributaries The project area is in the Palouse River Watershed, Water Resource Inventory Area (WRIA) 34.  The Palouse River Watershed includes the South Fork Palouse River Subbasin and the Cow Creek Subbasin.  The upper three quarters of the project area is in the South Fork Palouse River Subbasin.  The lower one-quarter of the project area is in the Cow Creek Subbasin.  There are two primary tributaries in the project area; the South Fork Palouse River and Thorn Creek.  All other tributaries in the project area are unnamed and drain to one of these tributaries. Most of the tributaries are intermittent or ephemeral. None of the waterways are part of a National Wild and Scenic Rivers System or a river under study for designation to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System.  See Exhibit 28. Tributary Effects for locations of tributary crossings.  Maps and additional detail regarding the tributaries are included in the Wetland Delineation Technical Report (Gilmore 2012). South Fork Palouse River.  The South Fork Palouse River is a perennial stream and a primary tributary to the Palouse River.  The Palouse River drains to the Snake River, which flows to the Columbia River.  The South Fork Palouse River, the Palouse River, the Snake River and the Columbia River are considered by the USACE to be jurisdictional waters of the US. The South Fork Palouse River has high flows in the spring and early summer and low flows during the late summer and early fall. Most of the wetlands and floodplains in the Palouse have been drained, straightened, cleared of vegetation or otherwise affected by agriculture, urbanization and associated infrastructure. These areas once retained water during high flows and released water during the low flow periods; however, farming and other developments have affected the streams, wetlands and floodplains, resulting in diminished water storage and attenuation capacity.  Therefore, peak flows are intensified resulting in channel erosion, deeply incised channels and flooding (IDEQ 2007). The IDEQ 2002 Integrated Report lists the South Fork Palouse River as a 303(d) listed [33 USC 1313(d) Section 303], impaired waterbody for sediment, nutrients, stream temperature and bacteria (IDEQ 2005b). The Watershed Assessment and TMDL for the South Fork Palouse River Watershed describes the designated beneficial uses for the South Fork Palouse River Subbasin as cold water aquatic life10 , salmonid spawning, and secondary contact recreation11  (IDEQ 2007). 10 Cold water aquatic life is water quality appropriate for the protection and maintenance of a viable aquatic life community for cold-water species Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 94 Affected Environment Thorn Creek.  Thorn Creek is an interstate intermittent tributary to Cow Creek, which is a primary tributary of the Palouse River. Thorn Creek is considered by the USACE to be a jurisdictional water of the US.   Thorn Creek is typically dry in the summer and has high peak flows following storm events.  It has also been affected by agriculture, urbanization and associated infrastructure with similar intensified peak flows, high erosion, incised banks and sedimentation (IDEQ 2005a). The IDEQ 2002 Integrated Report listed Cow Creek as an impaired water body for nutrients, habitat alteration and stream temperature (IDEQ 2005a).  The Watershed Assessment and TMDL for the Cow Creek Subbasin (IDEQ 2005a) described Cow Creek’s beneficial uses as secondary contact recreation and cold-water aquatic life. Wetlands Forty-six wetlands were identified and delineated in the project area. The seventeen affected wetlands are shown on Exhibit 29. Wetland Effects.  No determination regarding jurisdiction has been made by the USACE at this time; however, all of the wetlands are considered by the FHWA under 23 CFR 777, Mitigation of Impacts to Wetlands and Natural Habitat. Wetlands may be classified by the dominant vegetation types.  Two primary wetland vegetation classifications in the project area are: emergent and scrub-shrub wetlands.  Emergent wetlands are characterized by low growing, non-woody vegetation such as grasses, sedges and forbs.  In the project area, these wetlands are typically used agriculturally.  Scrub-shrub wetlands are characterized by shrubs such as roses, hardhack or red-osier dogwood (Cornus sericea).   The majority of the wetlands in the project area are Category III Palustrine Emergent (PEM) wetlands associated with agricultural lands and have been altered by human disturbance. The wetlands are either being farmed or farmed to their boundaries reducing the wetland buffer and hydrologic improving capabilities. The wetlands in the northern half of the project primarily drain to the South Fork Palouse River while the wetlands in the southern half of the project primarily drain into Thorn Creek. Both of these water bodies are listed as impaired waters under Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act [33 USC 1313(d)].  While these wetlands provide some basic functions they have all been impaired and thus their functions degraded. All but a few of 11 Secondary contact recreation may include fishing, boating, wading, infrequent swimming, and other activities where ingestion of raw water is not likely to occur Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 95 Affected Environment these wetlands have only one vegetation class, emergent, which generally consists of crop or introduced species.  Generally, wetlands in the project area scored higher in water quality functions. This is due to the potential for the wetland to improve degraded water quality, as the two main surface waters are both 303(d) listed and surrounded by farming activities. A few wetlands have two predominant vegetation classes, emergent and scrub-shrub. These wetlands, while still impaired, offer higher functions and values to wildlife and greater diversity. These wetlands are still generally surrounded by agriculture.  The wetlands and tributaries in the project area were delineated and are described in detail in the Wetland Delineation Technical Report (Gilmore 2012).  Wetlands that would be affected by any of the Action Alternatives are shown in Exhibit 29. Wetland Effects and are described below.  Details regarding the other wetlands and tributaries in the project area may be found in the Wetland Delineation Report (Gilmore 2012). Wetland 9 is a Category III, PEM, drainage way.  The southern end of this wetland is being grazed while the western fringe is being farmed.  This wetland is dominated by jungle-rice (Echinochloa colona) and reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea).  Wetland 9 scored over 50 percent for water quality functions using the Eastern Washington Wetland Rating System.  The hydrology from Wetland 9 originates near the intersection of Jacksha Road and US-95 and flows in a northerly direction.  It continues toward the South Fork Palouse River through a series of wetlands, tributaries and road culverts. Wetland 9 abuts Tributary I, which drains to the South Fork of the Palouse River. The South Fork Palouse River is a tributary of the Palouse River, which is a major tributary to the Snake River. Wetland 10 is a Category III, PEM, grassed drainage in a gently sloped valley.

The South Fork Palouse River is a tributary of the Palouse River, which is a major tributary to the Snake River.   Wetland 13 is a Category III, palustrine scrub-shrub (PSS) wetland.  It is confined by a steep slope on the north and an area with predominantly higher elevation on the south side. CRP lands are to the north and south of the wetland. There is cropland along the wetland edges with farming Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 96 Affected Environment activities up to the grassy borders in the lower reaches. Wetland 13 is dominated by hawthorn (Crataegus douglasii), red-osier dogwood, cow parsnip (Heracleum maximum), and reed canarygrass.  There are also scattered cottonwood trees in the upper portions of the drainage.  This wetland scored over 50 percent for water quality functions. Due to its structural diversity, it also provides moderate function for wildlife habitat. Wetland 13 is contiguous with Tributary W, which flows westerly toward US- 95 through a farmstead and along Zeitler Road.  Tributary W continues through Wetland 34 and drains to the South Fork Palouse River through a series of open tributaries and wetlands. The South Fork Palouse River is a tributary of the Palouse River, which is a major tributary to the Snake River.  Wetland 20 is a Category III, PEM wetland in a large drainage way. Farming activities are occurring through the wetland along most of the reach. Vegetation in the wetland is dominated by reed canarygrass and cultivated spring grain. This wetland scored over 50 percent for water quality functions.  The wetland is contiguous with Tributary N, which flows in a westerly direction to the South Fork Palouse River. The South Fork Palouse River is a tributary of the Palouse River, which is a major tributary to the Snake River.   Wetland 23 is a Category IV, PEM wetland consisting of two grassed waterways that drain in an easterly direction toward US-95.  The predominant vegetation includes meadow foxtail (Alopecurus pratensis) and bromes (Bromus sp.). The northern and larger portion of the wetland is being farmed up to its border. The southern portion of the wetland is also being farmed. This wetland did not score over 25 percent for any of the functions. Wetland 23 does not appear to have a surface connection to other waters and does not appear to be adjacent to Tributary P.  Wetland 24 is a Category III, PEM wetland that includes two north-sloping drainage ways.  The western portion drains a relatively steep bowl of pastureland. The predominant vegetation includes reed canarygrass, jungle-rice grass, and grazed pasture grasses. The eastern-most portion includes a small pond and has a more gradual gradient. Both drainage patterns converge near the west side of US-95 into a relatively wide grassy area. This wetland scored over 50 percent for water quality functions.   The wetland is contiguous with Tributary Q, which flows in a northerly direction along the west side of US-95 toward Wetland 9. It then flows through a series of wetlands and open roadside Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 97 Affected Environment ditches to the South Fork Palouse River.

This wetland is currently mowed. The predominant vegetation includes meadow foxtail and cultivated grasses for hay. This wetland scored over 50 percent for water quality functions.  The wetland drains in a northerly direction along the west side of US-95 from the toe of the slope to the east toward Clyde Road. The wetland is adjacent to Tributary R which is conveyed through a series of wetlands, open roadside ditches and culverts and to the South Fork Palouse River. The South Fork Palouse River is a tributary of the Palouse River, which is a major tributary to the Snake River. Wetland 26 is a Category IV, PEM, drainage surrounded by annual cropland.  Farming activities are occurring through most of the wetland. A combination of hillside seeps and slow soil permeability within the cropland contribute to prolonged soil saturation into the spring.  Predominant vegetation includes quackgrass (Elymus repens), jungle-rice grass, spring grain, prickly lettuce (Lactuca serriola), mayweed (Anthemis cotula), Canada thistle (Circium arvense), and field horsetail. This wetland did not score over 25 percent for any of the functions. The wetland drains in a northerly direction along the west side of US-95 by Tributary R, to Tributary S which is conveyed through a series of wetlands, open roadside ditches and culverts and to the South Fork Palouse River. The South Fork Palouse River is a tributary of the Palouse River, which is a major tributary to the Snake River. Wetland 27 is a Category III, PEM, forked grassy drainage way that drains the toe slope of annual cropland across a flat area. Predominant vegetation includes wild oats (Avena fatua) and jungle ricegrass. A combination of upland runoff and the flat topography of the drainage way contribute to prolonged soil saturation in the spring. This wetland scored 50 percent for water quality functions.   The wetland, adjacent to Tributary T, is drained in a northerly direction along the west side of US- 95 toward the South Fork Palouse River. The runoff is conveyed through a recently created wetland along the South Fork Palouse River banks. The South Fork Palouse River is a tributary of the Palouse River. The Palouse River is a major tributary to the Snake River. Wetland 28 is a Category III, PEM, grassy forked drainage. This wetland is contained within the lower third of a forked drainage way on the east side of US-95. The upper two-thirds of the drainage way possess wetland and tributary characteristics previously defined as PC (Prior Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 98 Affected Environment Converted).  This wetland is predominantly reed canarygrass bordered by wheat and brome species. This wetland scored 50 percent for both water quality and habitat functions.   The drainage way conveys overland flow from upper croplands in a southerly direction toward US-95. The runoff is conveyed under the highway by a culvert, connecting the surface flow to Tributary P, on to Wetland 19 and Thorn Creek. Thorn Creek flows to Union Flat Creek, a tributary of the Palouse River. The Palouse River is a major tributary to the Snake River. Wetland 29 is a large Category III, PEM, multi-forked drainage way that carries overland flow in a westerly direction along Eid Road. The wetland consists mostly of wide grassy ditches that flow into defined narrow channels with upland trees just outside the wetland boundary.  Predominant vegetation is reed canarygrass. A relatively large man-made pond exists near the upper portion of the tributary of the most southern fork, identified as AW (Artificial Wetland). This wetland scored over 50 percent for water quality functions.   Surface water is conveyed from the wetland through Tributary U toward US-95, traveling under the highway through a culvert toward Tributary Q, to Wetland 9 and 10, and on down Tributary I to the South Fork Palouse River. The South Fork Palouse River is a tributary of the Palouse River. The Palouse River is a major tributary to the Snake River. Wetland 31 is a Category IV, PEM, long grassy waterway in the middle of annual cropland.  Predominant vegetation includes reed canarygrass and dagger-leaf rush (Eleocharis lanceolata).  Hydrology for Wetland 31 originates from overland flow in a westerly direction toward US-95. The grassy drainage way is relatively flat and extends into the draw beyond the wetland boundary. This wetland did not score over 50 percent for any of the functions.  Water draining from Wetland 31 is conveyed under the highway, and continues through Wetland 10 and Tributary I toward the South Fork Palouse River. The South Fork Palouse River is a tributary of the Palouse River. The Palouse River is a major tributary to the Snake River. Wetland 32 is a Category III, PSS wetland with an emergent component and grassed waterway. Predominant vegetation includes reed canarygrass, hawthorn and aspen (Populus tremuloides). This wetland originates in the foothills of the west-facing slope of Paradise Ridge. This area was defined by aerial photos as a farmed wetland (FW) and wetland (W) (USDA FSA 1979). A man-made pond is found in the upper most portion of Tributary W and is identified as an AW (Artificial Wetland). This wetland scored over 50 percent for water quality functions.  Due to its structural diversity, it also provides moderate function for wildlife habitat. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 99 Affected Environment The wetland has both a brushy draw and a wide grassed waterway that conveys overland flow and hillside seeps in a westerly direction through a channelized tributary that travels through a farmstead and along Zeitler Road toward the highway through Tributary W. Tributary W drains Wetlands 13 and 32 in a westerly direction toward US- 95.  It continues through Wetland 34, flows under the highway through a culvert and to the South Fork Palouse River through a series of open tributaries (Tributary I) and wetlands (Wetland 10). The South Fork of the Palouse River is a tributary of the Palouse River; the Palouse River is a major tributary to the Snake River. Wetland 35 is a Category III, PEM wetland area above a man-made pond in a drainage way that comes off Paradise Ridge. Predominant vegetation includes reed canarygrass. The wetland hydrology appears to come from a hillside seep and overland flow. This wetland scored over 50 percent for water quality functions.   Wetland 35 drains to a pond, which overflows to a roadside wetland and under Cameron Road toward Tributary X. Tributary X also carries overland flow from Wetland 14 and 33. The hydrology continues to flow toward US-95 through annually cropped land, through a culvert under the highway, and through a series of open tributaries until it flows into the South Fork Palouse River. The South Fork of the Palouse River is a tributary of the Palouse River, which is a major tributary to the Snake River. Wetland 39 is a Category IV, PEM wetland on the edge of an annually cropped field. Predominant vegetation includes reed canarygrass and mayweed. Water appears to pond at this edge near US-95. Hydrology is from a combination of upland and roadside runoff and possibly a high water table. This wetland did not score over 50 percent for any of the functions.   The wetland is adjacent to Tributary Y, which flows along the toe of the highway slope until it crosses under the highway in a westerly direction through a culvert.  It then flows through a series of tributaries and wetlands until it drains to the South Fork Palouse River. The South Fork of the Palouse River is a tributary of the Palouse River, which is a major tributary to the Snake River.   Wetland 40 is a Category III, PEM wetland in grassed drainage surrounded by tilled agricultural land.

Wells within 300 feet and within the footprint of each Action Alternative were identified in the DEIS.   A Hydrogeologic Analysis of Alternative Alignments of Highway 95 from Thorncreek to Moscow (Ralston 2014) was prepared after the DEIS was published to respond to public comments. This technical report assesses the hydrologic and geologic settings underlying the alternatives and compares the potential impacts.  The hydrogeologic analysis describes groundwater systems typical to each geologic environment and data obtained from well driller reports from the project area. 3.7.3 Existing	  Conditions Aquifers Most of the general project area is underlain by granite.  Basalt is present near the western and northern boundaries of the project area.  An outcrop of metaphoric rocks occurs in the northern portion of the project area (Ralston 2014). The project area includes two basalt aquifer systems that supply groundwater in the project area; the Grande Ronde and the Wanapum (Priest Rapids) aquifers.  The Wanapum Aquifer overlies the Grande Ronde Aquifer.  Neither of these aquifers are sole source aquifers. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 101 Affected Environment Municipal drinking water is generally drawn from the deeper Grande Ronde aquifer. As groundwater withdrawals have increased to meet demands, the Grande Ronde aquifer levels have been declining at a rate of one to two feet per year in some areas indicating little recharge (Hashmi 1995). The shallow Wanapum aquifer is a primary water source for rural residents, particularly in the eastern portion of the basin. The City of Moscow also draws approximately 30 percent of its water supply from the Wanapum aquifer (City of Moscow 2014).  The Wanapum aquifer responds to changes in precipitation and pumping and appears to be recharged from the surface (Palouse Water Conservation Network 2005). Wells The wells in the study area were evaluated as part of the new hydrogeological study.  Wells typically obtain water from any of three water-producing intervals typical of granitic environments.  First, some shallow wells obtain water from near the bottom of the weathered zone where weathering has progressed to produce sand-like material rather than the end result of weathering, which is clay.  Second, some wells obtain water from weathering along fractured zones. In some areas, weathering occurs along a fracture zone approximately parallel to land surface at a depth of 100 to 200 feet.  This zone may be the result of “unloading” of the weight of the material overlying the granite as erosion exposes it at land surface.  Deeper wells obtain water from isolated fracture zones with little weathering products, generally at depths greater than about 200 feet (Ralston 2014). Wells in the upper aquifer in the City of Moscow yield a maximum of 1,000 gpm; however, most of the wells are for domestic purposes and are pumped at rates less than 30 gpm.  All of the wells completed in the lower aquifer in the Moscow area are owned either by the City of Moscow or the University of Idaho.  The yields of these wells are large, some exceeding 2,500 gpm (Ralston 2014). Based on the IDWR database 94 wells were listed in the project area and all were listed as domestic uses. The domestic wells in the project area range from 60 to 650 feet in depth with an average depth of 267 feet (Ralston 2014).   3.8 Vegetation, Fish and Wildlife 3.8.1 Regulatory	  Framework and	  Policies Vegetation, fish and wildlife are governed by the following: Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 102 Affected Environment • FHWA TA 6640.8A – NEPA Implementation Guidance for Preparing and Processing Environmental and Section 4(f) Documents • 16 USC 1531-1544 – Endangered Species Act (ESA) • 16 USC Sections 1600-1614-National Forest Management Act • 16 USC Sections 661-667e- Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act • 16 USC Sections 668-668d -Bald Eagle Protection Act • 16 USC Sections 703-712-Migratory Bird Treaty Act • 16 USC Sections 1801-1882-Fishery Conservation and Management Act (1976) • EO 13186-Responsibilities of Federal Agencies to Protect Migratory Birds • Federal Noxious Weed Act of 1974 • Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (P.L. 104-297) • 49 USC 303-Policy on Lands, Wildlife and waterfowl refuges, and historic sites • IDAPA 20.02.01-Idaho 1974 Forest Practices Act • Idaho Code, Title 22, Chapter 24, Noxious Weeds 3.8.2 Methodology Several technical reports were conducted by experts to identify vegetation, wildlife and habitat in the study area and to assess the potential effects of the alternatives.  The technical reports are listed below: Vegetation Studies The following reports were prepared and are included in the Vegetation Technical Report or the Biological Assessment Technical Report. Vegetation Technical Report A Scientific Evaluation for Noxious and Invasive Weeds of the Highway 95 Construction Project between the Uniontown Cutoff and Moscow (January 2007). This report describes the potential weeds in the study area. It also describes the potential for the proposed project to spread weeds and discusses mitigation for the potential effects (Lass and Prather 2007). Memo Documenting Resurvey for Spalding’s catchfly in the Project Area (May 2014) was prepared after the DEIS publication.  No new plants were found (Lichthardt 2014). Memo: Effects Analysis of the US Highway 95-Thorncreek Road to Moscow Project for Plant Species and Communities of Conservation Concern was prepared (December 1, 2008).  This report prepared by IDFG provides information regarding indirect and cumulative effects to Palouse remnants and to communities of conservation concern.

This report discusses the potential occurrence and extent of Palouse remnants and rare plants in the project area.  It analyzes the potential effects for the proposed project on plant species of conservation concern and remnant native plant communities that potentially provide habitat for these species (Lichthardt 2005). Wildlife Studies Biological Assessment, Thorncreek Road to Moscow Highway Construction Project (December 2007).  This study describes the project effects to federally listed and proposed species and designated critical habitat (ITD 2007a).  This report was reviewed in November 2011.  USFWS provided concurrence that the findings are still valid in December 2011.  USFWS provided a clarification to the Spalding’s catchfly mitigation in April 2012. See Appendix 1, Key Agency Correspondence and Forms.  General Wildlife Assessment, Thorncreek to Moscow (December 2006).  This report is a general assessment of wildlife impacts for the US-95 Thorncreek to Moscow Project. IDFG evaluated alternatives’ impacts to a limited number of species that could serve as surrogates for all other wildlife species expected to be present in the project area (IDFG 2006). The initial list of wildlife species was generated from reviewing Idaho state sensitive species lists, primarily the Idaho Comprehensive Wildlife Conservation Strategy (WCS), which summarizes the Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN) information.  The Washington State Comprehensive WCS was also reviewed. Of the 229 SGCN, IDFG identified 32 species, including 13 vertebrate and 19 invertebrate species that could reasonably be expected to be present in the project area and, therefore, potentially be impacted by the project. Of these, various species were expected to be present in the project area for all, some or none of the proposed alternatives. Some species (e.g., Spur throated Grasshoppers, California Myotis) were retained for consideration because there was not sufficient information to remove them from the list and/or IDFG determined they could serve as an appropriate surrogate for other species. The giant Palouse earthworm was considered in the analysis due to high local and academic interest in the species (IDFG 2006). Habitat associations described in the WCS were compared with available habitat in the project area using maps (IDFG 2006; Lichtart 2005; Lichtart and Mosely 1997), aerial photos provided by ITD and local knowledge was used to determine whether suitable habitat was present in or near the project area. Species were removed from consideration if suitable habitat was not Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 104 Affected Environment present, even though the potential exists for some species to occasionally range far from suitable habitat. IDFG suggested protections and mitigations for unavoidable impacts. (IDFG 2006).   Biological Evaluation on the Potential Impacts of Corridor Alternatives from Thorncreek Road to Moscow on Large Ungulates (December 2005).  This report evaluates the potential effects of alignments through different corridors (west, central and east) on the habitat and survival of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), elk (Cervus elaphus), and moose (Alces alces) in the project area (Melquist 2005a).  Biological Evaluation on the Long-eared myotis and Pygmy nuthatch (December 2005). This report describes the potential effects of the proposed project on the long-eared myotis (Myotis evotis) and Pygmy nuthatch (Sitta pygmaea) which were classified as Species of Special Concern (SSC) by the IDFG (Melquist 2005b).   Final Review of Wildlife Mitigation for the Thorncreek Road to Moscow Highway Development Project (US-95) (September 2007).  This report reviews and summarizes the information in the Biological Evaluation on Potential Impacts of Corridor Alternatives (Melquist 2005a) and evaluates the effects of the alternatives to deer, elk and moose and makes mitigation recommendations (Ruediger 2007). Assessment of Potential Big Game Effects and Mitigation Associated with Highway Alternatives from Thorncreek Road to Moscow (December 2010).  This report summarizes the wildlife reports prepared by Melquist and Ruediger and provides ITD with an independent assessment of the project’s effects to potential big game.  It also discusses mitigation (Sawyer 2010). ITD commissioned four different wildlife experts to assess impacts and mitigation for large ungulates.  The general descriptions of the reports are in the Section 3.8.2 Wildlife Studies.  Each of the experts had similar conclusions regarding the quality of available habitat in the study areas and the relative impacts of the alternatives on that habitat which is stated; however, mitigation recommendations differed. The Sawyer report was intended to evaluate the mitigation recommendations for the project.  Sawyer evaluated and summarized ungulate habitat in the corridors and the relative impacts by alternative.  The Sawyer report found that the Melquist and Ruediger reports were consistent regarding general habitat quality and the relative alternatives' effects to habitat.  The Sawyer report also provided new information that was available since the previous reports were prepared which also supported the conclusions of the reports.  Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 105 Affected Environment Both Ruediger and Melquist stated that the alternatives would not have population level effects to ungulates and that no mitigation was required for population level effects.  Both offered optional recommendations that included wildlife crossing, fencing, habitat preservation and other measures that could benefit individuals and mitigate for animal vehicle collisions; however, these were not required, nor are they likely to be effective without land use control in the surrounding properties (Ruediger 2007). Melquist acknowledges that there may be impacts to individual ungulates through increased road kills, possible habitat avoidance, and increased risks to motorists and offers seven recommended actions that would benefit deer, elk, moose, and other wildlife should transportation corridors be constructed.  These recommendations include one or two possible wildlife crossings near draws, fencing associated with the crossings, habitat preservation near those crossings and other measures.  However, he further states that not implementing a recommended action would not jeopardize populations of any of the species.  Animal/vehicle collisions (AVCs) and associated risks to motorists were considered in the AASHTO Safety Analysis and are mitigated for in the proposed alternatives’ design.  Clearing vegetation from the clear zone (highway right-of-way), widening the roadway and improving the sight distance are all mitigating factors that are expected to significantly reduce the animal vehicle crashes (AVC).  On US-20 between MP 369 and 375, similar improvements reduced the AVC by 85 percent (ITD 2012a).  To further mitigate for the possible AVCs, if the E-2 Alternative is selected.  See Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments for details of this mitigation.   Ruediger did not recommend stand-alone large game crossings nor did he recommend replacement of lost wildlife habitat.  However, in recognition of the resource agencies’ desire for mitigation, he made three optional recommendations, all of which were considered and included in the DEIS Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments.  These were 1) to provide a wildlife/vehicle crossing at county road underpasses of US-95 where wildlife use is expected and where wildlife are welcome on private lands (deer, elk and moose), 2) to provide oversized culverts to allow for small terrestrial movement and 3) to replace water sources on the east side of the highway should water sources be impacted.  See Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments for a list of the mitigation measures that will be implemented for each alternative. 3.8.3 Existing	  Conditions The project area has an elevation of between 2,600 and 3,000 ft above sea level. The primary habitat in the project area is plowed and cultivated agricultural or CRP fields. Small patches of conifers, brush, and riparian habitat are retained on the edges of fields, in gullies and on rock Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 106 Affected Environment knobs.  These patches are too small and fragmented to provide useable habitat for most large terrestrial species (Ruediger 2007).  Paradise Ridge is a geologic landform located southeast of Moscow outside of the project area. It has forested components, grassland, Palouse prairie, rural residential and agricultural lands. Paradise Ridge does not have a specific geographic boundary but for the purposes of this study a boundary is approximately the 3100-foot contour line in Exhibit 20. Paradise Ridge. The Palouse Bioregion The project area is at the eastern edge of the Palouse Bioregion.  The Palouse Bioregion is an area of the Columbia Plateau characterized by rolling hills of moderate to high relief, with deep soils formed from loess.  Vegetation Historically the land was an Idaho fescue - wheatgrass vegetation zone which is land dominated by Idaho fescue (Festuca idahoensis), bluebunch wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria spicata) with patches of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), snowberry (Symphoricarpos albus), hawthorn (Crataegus douglasii), aspen (Populus tremuloides) and other associated plant species (Lichthardt 2005).  This vegetation zone is also classified by the Idaho Natural Heritage Program as Palouse Grasslands.  Approximately 89 percent of the ponderosa pine communities have been lost in Latah County and approximately 99 percent of the Palouse Grasslands have been converted to cultivated agricultural lands (Noss et al. 1995).  Loss of Palouse Grasslands has contributed to a number of plant species associated with the Palouse Bioregion being classified as species of conservation concern (Lichthardt and Moseley 1997).  The Palouse Grasslands are considered one of the most endangered ecosystems in the US (Noss et. al. 1995).  Palouse Grassland Remnants Thirty-two areas with remnant Palouse Bioregion vegetation were identified in the project corridor as a result of a study in 2005 (Lichthardt 2005).  These Palouse remnants are referred to differently in different reports and may also be referred to as Palouse Grassland remnants or Palouse Prairie remnants.  Palouse remnants may contain both grasslands as well as combinations of shrubs and trees. The Palouse remnants identified in Lichthardt’s 2005 report were categorized by quality.  About 18.3 acres are A-ranked (highest quality) remnants and 17 acres are B or C-ranked (medium high to medium low quality).  About 20 acres of grassland are too dominated by annual grasses to be considered a remnant. If the remnants were too infested by weeds (more than 50 percent) they were not considered Palouse remnants (Lichthardt 2005).  Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 107 Affected Environment The southern end of Paradise Ridge was designated the “South End Paradise Ridge” Conservation Site by the Idaho Conservation Data Center (ICDC) in 1996. It encompasses 106 acres, a little more than half of which is grassland and is the largest of the grassland remnants in the project area.  The site also has areas of open pine woodland, pine forest, hawthorn, and ninebark (Physocarpus (sp)).   The primary threat to the persistence of Palouse remnants in their present state is colonization by weeds.  All remnants identified in the project area are bordered completely or partially by weedy vegetation.  Annual grasses tend to dominate moderately moist upper slopes, and smooth brome or tall oatgrass occupy the margins of those areas. Among the perennial weedy grasses, tall oatgrass appears to be the most aggressive.  The perennial grasses have most likely moved into the remnants, either by rhizomes or seed, from nearby CRP plantings.  See the Biological Evaluation of Plant Species and Communities of Conservation Concern in the US Highway 95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow Project Area (Lichthardt 2005) for additional information. The project area lies near Paradise Ridge, which is considered a key conservation area for Spalding’s catchfly as identified in the Recovery Plan for Spalding's catchfly (USFWS 2007). In 2008 USFWS with IDFG began implementing a four phased pilot project in Latah County that included 1) delineation of areas with high potential to support Palouse Grassland remnant plant species, 2) landowner contact and education, 3) field surveys and assessment of potential remnant restoration areas, and 4) development of a comprehensive conservation strategy.  As part of the pilot project, two additional studies of Palouse remnants were completed in 2011.  The studies surveyed for Spalding's catchfly and identified potential sites for re-establishment of Spalding’s catchfly and identified potential restoration sites.  The potential restoration sites that were identified were selected based their potential to connect the Paradise Ridge with other potential remnant areas.  The sites were also selected based on soils, topography, and landowner willingness.  Landowner easements and agreements have been obtained to implement a variety of practices through several government programs, including Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP)12, Landowner Incentive Program (LIP)13, Grassland Reserve Program (GRP)14, 12 The Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) is a voluntary program administered through the NRCS that provides financial and technical assistance to agricultural producers through contracts up to a maximum term of ten years in length. The program plans and implements practices to assist with natural resource and farm production issues. 13 The Landowner Incentive Program (LIP) is administered by USFWS and provides grant funds to protect and restore habitats on private lands, to benefit federally listed, proposed or candidate species or other at-risk species. 14 The Grassland Reserve Program (GRP) is a voluntary program administered by USDA for landowners and operators to protect grazing uses and related conservation values by conserving grassland, including rangeland, pastureland, shrubland, and certain other lands. The program emphasizes support for working grazing operations; enhancement of plant and animal biodiversity; and protection of grassland and land containing shrubs and forbs under threat of conversion. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 108 Affected Environment and Partners for Fish and Wildlife (PFW)15.  The planned and current restoration practices include farming practices to reduce erosion and sedimentation, native plant establishment, conversion of fields from non-native to native seedings, planting Spalding’s catchfly, ecological weed control (such as hand pulling weeds) and other activities. These activities were implemented or are planned to be implemented on portions of the sites, which have landowner agreements or easements.  See Exhibit 33. Planned and Current Restoration Projects.  The actual restoration activities may occur on only a portion of the land that is under a landowner agreement or easement.   One site with landowner agreements for ecological weed control and Spalding’s catchfly establishment is approximately 200 feet from the E-2 alignment footprint. See Exhibit 33. Planned and Current Restoration Projects. ITD, FHWA and USFWS met on July 25, 2012, September 6, 2012 and May 7, 2014 to discuss current and planned conservation efforts, potential project effects and to collaborate on possible mitigation strategies.  Based on coordination with USFWS, Latah County Conservation District and Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) sites closer to Paradise Ridge and furthest from the alignments will be prioritized. Matrix Habitat The remaining land outside of remnants is primarily agricultural and CRP lands that function as matrix habitat. These matrix habitats (Daily 1997, Daily et al. 2001, Looney et al. 2009, Looney and Eigenbrode 2011, 2012, Ricketts 2001) may be important for wildlife browsing and movement corridors for ungulates, small mammals, bird species, and other wildlife.  Matrix habitat also supports a number of species including earthworms, bumblebees and beetles (Hatten & Looney 2013).  CRP fields are planted to perennial habitat (Fargione et al. 2009), which may not always be native vegetation. These CRP lands and other agricultural lands can provide refuge, food and movement corridors for animals that inhabit remnants (Daily 1997, Daily et al. 2001, Ricketts et al. 2001). Multiple studies show that CRP land benefits wildlife (Herkert 2007, Fargione et al. 2009, Stanley 2010, Grovenburg et al. 2012) including migratory grassland birds, ground-dwelling beetles and bumble bees; however, the composition and structure of vegetation in CRP land does not provide equivalent habitats for some animals such as grassland birds (Bakker and 15 The Partners for Fish and Wildlife (PFW) Program is administered by USFWS and procures short-term easements for restoration activities. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 109 Affected Environment Higgins 2009). Invasive, rhizomatous invasive plants including tall oatgrass were frequently abundant in the borders of remnants next to CRP fields in the project area (Lichthardt 2005). Rare Plants  Nine plant species listed by ICDC as Species of Greatest Conservation Need, are associated with the Palouse Bioregion and known to occur in Latah County (Lichthardt 2005).  See Table 22. Palouse Bioregion Rare Plant Species. IDFG surveyed the project area for these species in 2005.  Four of the nine target species were found in the study area; Palouse milkvetch, broad-fruit mariposa lily, Palouse thistle, and Palouse goldenweed.  The area was resurveyed near the project area between 2008 and 2010 as part of the IDFG 2011 study (Hill 2011). The rare plants found in the study area are described below. Table	  22.	  Palouse	  Bioregion	  Rare	  Plant	  Species Common	  name  Scientific Name  ICDC 	  rank*  Jessica’s aster	   Aster jessicae  G2/S2  Palouse	  milkvetch  Astragalus arrectus  G2/G4 Review  Green-‐band	  mariposa lily  Calochortus macrocarpus var. maculosus  G5T2/S2  Broad-‐fruit	  mariposa lily  Calochortus nitidus  G3/S3  Palouse	  thistle	   Cirsium brevifolium  G3/S2  Idaho 	  hawksbeard  Crepis bakeri ssp. idahoensis  G4T2/S2  Palouse	  goldenweed  Haplopappus liatriformis  G2/S2  Ample monkey-‐flower	   Mimulus ampliatus  G1/S1  Spalding’s catchfly  Silene	  spaldingii  G2/S1 (Federally listed as threatened)  * These ranks reflect the condition of the species rangewide. G-ranks are rangewide ranks that are assigned by Nature Serve and S-ranks are statewide ranks that are assigned by the ICDC. Rankings are explained in detail in Appendix 4. Palouse milkvetch.  Palouse milkvetch was rated between imperiled and secure globally (G2/G4) but based on updated data is now considered imperiled globally (Nature Serve 2011). Palouse milkvetch was found in two places in the study area; in a grassland remnant and on a road cut (Lichthardt 2005). Broad fruit mariposa lily.  Broad-fruit mariposa lily was considered vulnerable both globally and in Idaho State (G3/S3) but based on updated data is now considered imperiled globally (Nature Serve 2011). Five very small populations were found in the study area, ranging from 1 to 20 individuals.  This perennial occurs almost exclusively in Idaho in open habitats (Lichthardt 2005). Palouse thistle.  Palouse thistle is considered globally vulnerable and imperiled in Idaho State (G3/S2) but based on updated data is now considered globally vulnerable (Nature Serve 2011). Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 110 Affected Environment More than 20 populations were found in occasional stands of snowberry or ponderosa pine.  Palouse thistle spreads by creeping roots; therefore, it is difficult to determine what constitutes an individual.  This plant occurs in grasslands and scablands16 (Lichthardt 2005) ranging from northeast Oregon, Eastern Washington and east to Idaho. Palouse goldenweed.  Palouse goldenweed is considered both globally and state imperiled (G2/S2) but based on updated data is now considered globally vulnerable (Nature Serve 2011).  It was found in all but two grassland remnants as well as many patches too small or too weedy to qualify as remnants.  Moscow is near the center of the global range of this species. This perennial occurs primarily on the Palouse in rocky soils (Lichthardt 2005).  Invasive Plants Latah County has about 260 listed non-native, invasive plant species that affect agricultural, rangeland, pastures, and forests. Roadsides were sampled for invasive plants or weeds.  Weeds found at most sites included Canada thistle, common mullein, downy brome, and prickly lettuce. Established sites usually had reed canarygrass. Sites with exposed soil always had annual bromes and ventenata. Invasive plant species that are commonly encountered in and adjacent to the project area have demonstrated their ability to become problems within native grasslands with the ability to produce more than 20 percent foliar cover or to dominate other grasslands. These species are presented in Table 23. Invasive Plants for Prairie Habitats. See Scientific Evaluation for Noxious and Invasive Weeds of the Highway 95 Construction Project between the Uniontown Cutoff and Moscow (Lass and Prather 2007) for additional detail.

Invasive plants along the US-95 right-of-way with infestations greater than a half acre include ventenata, field bindweed, reed canarygrass, tall oatgrass, and blackgrass. Wildlife Species  The study area is highly modified through agriculture, rural residences and commercial development, and nearly all of the native pine stands and grasslands have been converted to other land uses. The remaining habitat supports both indigenous and non-native wildlife species.  Many species are habitat generalists, which, while important locally, are mainly species already adaptable to habitat modifications, fragmentation and high levels of human use (Sawyer 2010).   Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 113 Affected Environment Wildlife Conservation Strategy Species (WCS) The WCS is the State of Idaho’s guiding document for managing and conserving at-risk species. It divides the state into Ecological Sections based on habitat. The US-95 Thorncreek to Moscow project area lies entirely within the Palouse Prairie Ecological Section.  The WCS maps the majority of the study area as farmable land and non-native herbaceous.  It lists wildlife species expected to reside in or migrate through the Palouse Prairie Ecological Section for each habitat type. As described in Section 3.8.2, Methodology, IDFG prepared a report, General Wildlife Assessment; Thorncreek Road to Moscow Project (IDFG 2006), that evaluated species that could be affected by the proposed project. Although native habitat and wildlife have been severely altered in the project area, the Palouse remains home to many indigenous and introduced wildlife species – too many, for an inclusive impact analysis (IDFG 2006).  IDFG identified representative wildlife species that would provide an indication of impact for all species, but would also suggest suitable protections and mitigations for unavoidable impacts (IDFG 2006). The rationale for selecting wildlife species to evaluate is described in more detail Section 3.8.2 Methodology and in the General Wildlife Assessment (IDFG 2006). Through a filtering process, IDFG identified 32 species, including13 vertebrate and 19 invertebrate species that could reasonably be expected to be present in the project area and, therefore, potentially be impacted by the project.

Federal candidate species are species for which USFWS or National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) have sufficient information on biological vulnerability and threats to support a proposal to list it as threatened or endangered.  However, candidate species are not yet listed, do not have protection under ESA and are precluded due to higher priorities. These federal candidate species are described below. Listed threatened and endangered species and critical habitat are described in Section 3.9, Threatened and Endangered Species. Additional species that could potentially occur in the project area were of particular interest to agencies or the public included the long-eared myotis (Myotis evotis) and pygmy nuthatch (Sitta pygmaea). For these reasons a specific study was conducted regarding their occurrences and potential alternatives' impacts.  Details regarding the wildlife species considered are described in detail in the Wildlife Technical Reports. Long-eared myotis. Long-eared myotis is a small commonly occurring forest bat that ranges from British Columbia to Baja. In Idaho it is found in a wide range of habitats including grasslands, shrub-steppe habitat, forestland, forested riparian and wetland areas, and barren land with exposed rock (Gillies 2004).  A bat survey conducted on portions of the Palouse Ranger District by the USFS and IDFG suggest that the long-eared myotis is likely to occur in the study area and may utilize pine stands for roosting (Melquist 2005b). Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 115 Affected Environment Pygmy nuthatch. Pygmy nuthatch is a tiny bird that ranges from British Columbia to Central Mexico.  In Idaho, the pygmy nuthatch is generally limited in its distribution to the southern slope of mountains at elevations up to approximately 3,500 feet.  Pygmy nuthatches require mature pine stands and snags for foraging and nesting. They are known to be sedentary and young birds may move an average of 286 meters (m) or 938 ft, but have been observed to move up to 533 m or 1,749 ft from their natal area (Ghalambor 2006).  In 2005, pygmy nuthatches were observed in pine stands at the southern end of the study area (Melquist 2005b). Suitable habitat is limited along the project corridor but is available on Paradise Ridge and in other areas in Northern Idaho.  Pine stands are described in Section 4.8 under Pine Stands.     Northern alligator lizard.  Northern alligator lizard is a reptile that occurs from central California to southern British Columbia and east to Montana.  Idaho populations occur in the Panhandle region from Boundary County south to northern Clearwater County; however, it is rarely encountered and poorly documented. It occurs in coniferous forests, often in clearings or along forest edges. Sites typically have a prominent understory with leaf litter, bark, rotting logs or talus. They are thought to consume a variety of arthropods and perhaps mollusks and earthworms. There are no known occurrences of northern alligator lizard in the project area; however the pine stand in the southern end of the study area may be considered suitable habitat (IDFG 2006). Wolverine.  Wolverine was listed as a federal candidate species under the Endangered Species Act in December of 2010.  They occur within a wide variety of habitats, primarily boreal forests, tundra, and western mountains throughout Alaska and Canada.  However, the southern portion of the range extends into Washington and the northern Rocky Mountains in Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming. Wolverines tend to live in remote and inhospitable places away from human populations.  They naturally occur at low densities and are rarely and unpredictably encountered.  Female wolverines use birthing dens excavated in deep snow. Persistent, stable snow greater than five feet deep appears to be a requirement for birthing dens, because it provides security for offspring and buffers cold winter temperatures. Wolverines travel long distances over rough terrain and deep snow. The availability and distribution of food is likely the primary factor in determining wolverine movements and home range size; however, gender, age, and differences in habitat are also factors (USFWS 2010). There are no documented occurrences of wolverine near the project area.  The project area is primarily highly disturbed, cultivated, farmland without a persistent, deep snow pack.  Therefore wolverine and its habitat have a low likelihood to be present in the project area.   Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 116 Affected Environment Yellow-billed cuckoo.  The Yellow-billed cuckoo was identified as a federal candidate species in Latah County in 2012 when the DEIS was published but was proposed as threatened in November 2014. However, the species was not proposed as threatened in Latah County nor is there proposed designated critical habitat in Latah County (USFWS 2015). The Yellow-billed cuckoo is also a State of Idaho Species of Special Concern.  It prefers treed, riparian corridors with a heavy understory (Anderson and Laymon 1989).  Dense understory is important for nest site selection and cottonwood trees are important for foraging habitat.  Nesting pairs require large blocks of riparian habitat which do not occur in the project area (IDFG 2006).  Bumble bees. The western bumble bee (Bombus occidentalis) was common on the Palouse and throughout the western United States but populations have drastically declined (Cameron et al. 2011) including in the Palouse.  A population was discovered in Pacific Northwest bunchgrass grassland, approximately 150 miles south of the project (Kimoto et al. 2012); therefore, it is possible that the Palouse Prairie remnants and forest communities support this species. Bumble bees are important for plant conservation and biodiversity and their regional or local decline can impact plant communities (Biesmeijer et al. 2006; Vamosi et al. 2006). Native bees may pollenate agricultural crops and non-cultivated plants and forage on pollen to feed developing larvae (Michener 2007). Ten of the 15 species historically recorded from Whitman and Latah Counties, which represented most of the regional historically present species, were detected in a recent study of bumble bees, which included Paradise Ridge. (Hatten and Looney 2013). Habitat loss and fragmentation, pesticide use and exposure to pathogens contribute to the decline of bees (Goulson et al. 2008; Cameron et al. 2011). Bumblebee community composition has changed and genetic diversity has been lost due to agriculture in tall grass prairie habitat in Illinois (Grixti et al. 2009; Lozier and Cameron 2009), but very little is known about the bumble bee communities associated with small, isolated habitat remnants such the Palouse Prairie.  Bee communities in remnant habitats are influenced by numerous factors, including the composition and quality of the surrounding landscape or matrix habitat (Steffan-Dewenter and Tscharntke 1999; Steffan-Dewenter et al. 2002; Hines and Hendrix 2005; Hendrix et al. 2010). Bee diversity is correlated to floral diversity, density and matrix diversity (Steffan-Dewenter et al. 2002; Hines and Hendrix 2005).  Bumblebees can thrive in agricultural fields with flowering crops and nesting sites and some open grassland species are adept at utilizing agricultural lands (Diekotter et al. 2006). However, these likely provides limited resources for bees given its prevalence of non-pollen or nectar producing crops, suggesting that bumble bee persistence is due to weeds and native plants along Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 117 Affected Environment roads and crop margins and/or resources available within the remnants. Furthermore, diversity of flora is known to correlate with bumble bee diversity (Hendrix et al. 2010). The golden northern bumblebee (Bombus fervidus), which is associated with agricultural lands, is thought to be the primary pollinator of Spalding’s catchfly, a partially self-fertilizing species.  However, Spalding’s catchfly is also dependent upon pollinators for fruit development and seed set (Lesica 1993; Lesica and Heidel 1996). Grassland Nesting Birds. The conversion of prairie to cropland has affected communities of birds and other wildlife that rely on grassland habitats.  The Breeding Bird Survey, an annual bird count conducted by volunteer birders, has provided data for the past 30 years and shows evidence of declining populations of grassland birds, an important factor being the loss of suitable grassland-nesting habitat (Johnson 2000). The cropland that largely replaced prairie is avoided by many bird species, which cannot find the necessary habitat structure in cultivated fields. Most birds that do nest in cropland suffer reproductive failure because of frequent agricultural operations (Rodenhouse and Best 1983). Likewise, hayfields often are used by grassland birds, but mowing operations can be very detrimental to the birds and their nests (Bollinger et al. 1990, Frawley and Best 1991). Reproduction in both cultivated fields and hayfields are not likely to offset mortality and thereby maintain populations. (Johnson 2000). Grasslands established under the CRP program may mitigate some of the detrimental effects that have occurred to native grassland. Several studies have found CRP fields to be highly attractive to breeding grassland birds. The species that most commonly breed in CRP fields vary geographically (Johnson 2000).  Giant Palouse earthworm. The giant Palouse earthworm (Driloleirus americanus) is currently found in eastern Washington and Idaho and is poorly understood.  In July 2009, USFWS received a petition requesting that the species be listed as threatened and that critical habitat be designated under the Endangered Species Act.  On July 26, 2011, USFWS issued a 12-month finding on a Petition to List the Giant Palouse Earthworm [50 CFR Part 17] in which USFWS found that the listing was not warranted.  Early records by Smith in 1897 state that the worms were very abundant in the area (USFWS 2011).  They live in deep, semi-permanent burrows, and move to the surface to feed on fresh plant litter (James 2000). Two earthworm occurrences were found on Paradise Ridge in 2012 and two worms, were found in the large ridge-top prairie on Paradise Ridge in 2010.  One earthworm was found at Smoot Hill Ecological Preserve in Whitman County in a Palouse Prairie remnant in 2005. In 1986 or 1987, about five Palouse earthworms were found near Moscow. Around 1978 one Palouse earthworm was found near Moscow, and another at the top of the Lewiston Grade along US 95.   Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 118 Affected Environment Survey efforts in Washington State in the eastern Cascades and the Palouse found earthworms in 18 of the 54 sites evaluated in 2011 suggesting that the earthworms are more widespread.  In 2012, two of the additional 49 sites surveyed found earthworms, totaling 22 sites in Washington.  The giant Palouse earthworm has been found in grasslands, Pine stands and Douglas-fir stands suggesting that it may occur in a wider variety of environments and soils than originally thought. The giant Palouse earthworm was not found in recent surveys conducted in agricultural and urban locations in Latah County, Idaho (Johnson-Maynard et al. 2007, Smetak et al. 2007, ), and Whitman County, Washington (Fauci and Bezdicek, 2002). Ungulates Independent studies of big game or ungulate (i.e., moose, elk, and white-tail deer) effects were conducted by Dr. Wayne Melquist (Melquist 2005a) and Dr. Bill Ruediger (Ruediger 2007).  Both studies concluded that the project area does not include critical big game habitat or known migration corridors.  White-tail deer.  Compared to elk and moose, white-tail deer are less affected by human disturbances.  They thrive in agricultural and forested areas that contain adequate amounts of woody cover and herbaceous forage (Demarais et al. 2000).  White-tail deer need some structural cover adjacent to them in order to take full advantage of their foraging opportunities (Compton et al. 1988, Dusek et al. 1989, Vercauteren and Hygnstrom 1998). Because whitetails tend to occupy the lower elevations, unlike elk, they are not often forced to migrate in winter.  Instead, they will concentrate in timber where snow is less deep (Melquist 2005a). Moose.  Moose prefer shrubby forests with nearby lakes, wetlands, and bogs.  Moose diets consist primarily of woody regrowth (e.g., willow, aspen or fir) that follow disturbances such as fire, floods, and logging (Franzmann 2000).  Moose commonly use open areas to feed on grasses, sedges, and forbs, then will retreat to the security of tall shrubs and forests to rest. They migrate primarily along or between riparian areas and wetlands (Crenshaw pers. comm. 2005).  While random movements and dispersal by moose likely occur, the timing and direction of such movements are unpredictable (Melquist 2005a). Elk.  Elk rely heavily on forest cover and rugged terrain for avoiding human disturbances (Skovlin et al. 2002) and predators (Creel et al. 2005 and Kauffman et al. 2007).  Elk movements in and around the project area are often dictated, in large part, by the location and distribution of agricultural crops.  Although elk can thrive in non-forested regions, they rely on mature shrub communities and topography to provide adequate security cover (McCorquodale et al.1986, Sawyer et al. 2007).  Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 119 Affected Environment Available Ungulate Habitat Deer, elk and moose habitat should include four basic components: food, cover, water and space.  The arrangement of these components in the project area can influence foraging behavior and movement.  The categories that were used by Sawyer (Sawyer 2010) to rank the quality of habitat for target big game species are described below:  • Poor – does not provide basic habitat components and does not support big game in large numbers or on a year round basis • Marginal – provides some basic habitat requirements but is limited in quantity and quality. Area is unable to support measureable numbers year-round or seasonally • Moderate – provides reasonable habitat and has the potential to support big game on year-around or seasonal basis • Excellent – provides an abundance of high-quality habitat and supports big game on a year-round or seasonal basis. Table 27. Quality of Available Ungulate Habitat indicates the overall quality of habitat for each ungulate species in the western, central and eastern corridors.  The topography and general habitat components utilized by ungulates are summarized below:  Table	  27.	  Quality	  of	  Available	  Ungulate	  Habitat Corridor  Habitat Quality  Moose  Elk  White-‐tail deer  Western  Poor  Poor  Marginal  Central  Poor  Poor  Marginal  Eastern  Marginal  Marginal  Moderate  Source: (Sawyer 2010) Western Corridor The western corridor is characterized by gentle to rolling topography.  It is primarily cropped agricultural fields with sparse rural residences.  It is used for seasonable foraging by ungulates.  Small patches of suitable ungulate habitat are located in Washington State outside the project area (Melquist 2005a).  IDFG personnel have occasionally observed moose and elk in the general vicinity but there is no evidence that they utilize the western corridor on a regular basis. White-tail deer are believed to utilize the western corridor on a year-round basis (Sawyer 2010). Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 120 Affected Environment Central Corridor The central corridor is characterized by rolling topography.  It is also primarily agricultural fields with sparse rural residences.  It has more development, as it is closer to the existing US-95 alignment.  IDFG personnel have observed moose and elk in the general vicinity, but there is no evidence that they utilize the central corridor on a regular basis.  White-tail deer are believed to utilize the central corridor on a year-round basis (Sawyer 2010). Eastern Corridor The eastern corridor is characterized by rolling topography.  It is also primarily agricultural fields but has more CRP enrolled land that may be utilized by ungulates compared to the western and central corridors.  It also has several wooded draws and small ponds. Habitat exists near Tomer Butte north of Highway 8,  east of the eastern corridor and Paradise Ridge. IDFG personnel have observed moose and elk on Paradise Ridge, but the extent to which they use the area is unknown.  Most big game abundance estimates are derived from aerial surveys, typically flown during the winter months while animals are congregated and more visible. The project area has not been included in recent moose or deer surveys conducted by IDFG; however, in the past year four moose have been relocated by IDFG from the Moscow area.  The area is part of a larger elk unit that is stratified into high, medium, and low-density strata and flown each year.  However, survey emphasis is placed on the high and medium-density strata.  Since the eastern corridor and Paradise Ridge are part of a low-density stratum (Crenshaw pers. comm. 2005) there is no elk abundance data specific to the eastern corridor. The number of moose and elk that utilize Paradise Ridge is so low, and use is so unpredictable, that capturing an adequate sample of animals is considered by Sawyer to be infeasible (Sawyer 2010). IDFG has expressed that under suitable conditions it may be possible to survey and develop a population estimate for moose and elk in the project area (Henneky pers. comm. 2015).  Nonetheless, the wilidfe technical reports and IDFG agree that moose and elk use is more likely to occur in the eastern corridor compared to the western and central corridors. White-tail deer utilize the eastern corridor on a year-round basis (Sawyer 2010).  Ungulate Movement Varieties of habitat components are utilized by ungulates and may affect their movement in the project area. Paradise Ridge contains a mixture of tree stands, shrubs, grasslands and agricultural fields. Man-made ponds, patches of suitable habitat and forested draws are also located on the eastern side of the project area near Paradise Ridge. Although big game likely travel along the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 121 Affected Environment wooded draws that extend west from Paradise Ridge, the draws do not connect Paradise Ridge with other patches of higher quality habitat to the west. Based on the distribution of suitable cover and habitat, elk and moose could travel between Paradise Ridge, northeast towards Tomer Butte or southwest to the small patches of suitable habitat in Washington State.  The closest cover in the Paradise Ridge area to the complex of habitat in Washington is a small pine stand located just north of Eid Road.  Ungulates would likely utilize the small patches of trees or shrub habitat for cover while grazing in the agricultural fields nearby.  Moose are expected to only have occasional random movement through these areas. Deer move in all directions to and from Paradise Ridge and the patches of Washington habitat during all times of the year (Melquist 2005a).    The project area is located in a low priority wildlife linkage area of US-95 identified by IDFG. The number of wildlife collisions in this linkage area was much less than other segments of US-95 or similar type highways  (ITD 2013).  See Section 3.10 Transportation for additional information regarding wildlife collision data and the Safety Technical Report for details.  Aquatic Species Table 28. Fish Species Occurring in the South Fork Palouse River lists the fish species known to occur in the South Fork Palouse River.  The only salmonid native to the Palouse River is an isolated population of West-slope cutthroat trout; however, it does not occur in the South Fork Palouse River.  Idaho State Water Quality Standards do not distinguish between native and introduced salmonids for the designation and protection of salmonid spawning. Table	  28.	  Fish	  Species	  Occurring	  in	  the	  South	  Fork	  Palouse	  River	  Common	  Name  Scientific Name  Status  Longnose	  dace  Rhinichthys cataractae  Native  Speckled dace  Rhinichthys osculus  Native  Redside shiner  Richardsonius balteatus  Native  Largescale	  sucker  Catostomus macrocheilus  Native  Bridgelip	  sucker  Catostomus columbianus  Native  Brook trout  Salvelinus fontinalis  Introduced  Brown	  trout  Salmo trutta  Introduced  Rainbow trout  Oncorhynchus mykiss  Introduced  Northern pike minnow  Ptychocheilus oregonensis  Introduced  Source: Palouse River Watershed Assessment and TMDLs, February 2007 Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 122 Affected Environment 3.9 Threatened	  and	  Endangered	  Species 3.9.1 Regulatory	  Framework and	  Policies Threatened and endangered species are governed by the following: • 16 USC 1531-1544-Endangered Species Act • Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (P.L. 104-297) The ESA directs federal agencies to ensure that actions authorized, funded, or carried out by them are not likely to jeopardize the existence of any threatened or endangered species, or result in the destruction or modification of their critical habitat. 3.9.2 Methodology A Biological Assessment (BA) was prepared for the proposed project in February 2007. The purpose of the BA was to analyze the potential effects of the proposed project on threatened, endangered, proposed, and candidate species and designated critical habitat. The BA was submitted to USFWS for review.  USFWS concurrence was received on March 2007.  The BA was reviewed again in November 2011 and resulted in a verification email from USFWS that the original effect determination is valid.  A clarification to the proposed conservation measures outlined in the 2007 BA, and associated concurrence letters were provided in an email on April 2012. In assessing potential effects to listed species, one of the following effects findings is required: • “No effect” means there will be no effects, positive or negative, to listed or proposed resources. Generally, this means no listed resources will be exposed to the action and its environmental consequences. • “May affect, but not likely to adversely affect” means that all effects are beneficial, insignificant, or discountable. Beneficial effects have contemporaneous positive effects without any adverse effects to the species or habitat. Insignificant effects relate to the size of the impact and include those effects that are undetectable, not measurable, or cannot be evaluated. Discountable effects are those extremely unlikely to occur. • “May affect, and is likely to adversely affect” means that listed resources are likely to be exposed to the action or its environmental consequences and will respond in a negative manner to the exposure. Since publication of the DEIS, the project area was resurveyed for rare plants including Spalding’s catchfly.  The survey methods and findings are documented in a memo titled: Memo Documenting Resurvey for Spalding’s Catchfly along US-95 Thorncreek to Moscow Project Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 123 Affected Environment Area (Lichthardt 2014). The most recent USFWS species list was also reviewed in early 2015 but no new species were listed or proposed in the action area (USFWS 2015). 3.9.3 Existing	  Conditions Table 29. Federally Listed Threatened and Endangered Species shows species listed as threatened or endangered and designated critical habitat in Latah County, Idaho according to USFWS and NOAA.

The Canada lynx habitat occurs in older dense primarily coniferous/boreal forests with downed trees located above elevations of 4,000 feet.  The lynx utilize primarily Engelmann spruce, subalpine fir, and lodgepole pine habitats.  The lynx’s population and distribution is highly dependent on the distribution of its primary food source, the snow shoe hare, and to a lesser degree, other small mammals and birds.  The project area is located on agricultural land less than 3,000 feet in elevation and is located greater than 20 miles from the nearest potential Lynx Analysis Unit (ITD 2005) (USFWS 2009).  Spalding’s catchfly.  Spalding’s catchfly typically occurs in open native grasslands with minor shrub components occasionally with scattered conifers.  The majority of the project area is agricultural land; however, there are CRP lands, grasslands, scattered ponderosa pine stands and Palouse remnants that offer potential habitat for Spalding's catchfly. The project area is also included as a key conservation area for Spalding’s catchfly recovery and is the focus of numerous restoration projects including Spalding’s catchfly establishment.  See Section 3.8.3. Non-native annual grasses such as tall oatgrass and smooth brome are the largest threats to Spalding’s catchfly populations.  Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 124 Affected Environment The larger remnant portions of grassland are found along the south end of Paradise Ridge. Smaller remnant populations are scattered across the south end of the project. The project area was surveyed for Spalding’s catchfly during the summer of 2005.  No Spalding’s catchfly plants were found.  Two field visits were conducted in 2006, which resulted in the discovery of a Spalding’s catchfly population on Clyde Hill between the Modified W-4 and C-3 alignments, but outside of the alignment footprints.  The next closest known occurrences of the species are 8 miles from the project area in Genesee and 15 miles west of the project area near Colton, Washington (ITD 2005). USFWS and IDFG completed additional surveys from 2008 to 2010; however no new plants were identified in the project area (Hill 2011). After the DEIS was published, ITD also completed additional survey of the remnants in the project area and no new Spalding’s catchfly plants were found (Lichthardt, 2014). Water howellia.  Water howellia occurs in wetlands within forested, channeled, scablands.  It is mostly found in partly shaded vernal pools or shallow ponds that hold water into mid-summer but dry out by September. The only area where water howellia could potentially occur in the project area is the floodplain of the South Fork Palouse River. However, the floodplain is actively cultivated and the stream is channelized.  It is dominated by reed canarygrass, a nonnative invasive weed which does not provide suitable habitat.  Therefore it is highly unlikely that water howellia is present (ITD 2005). Steelhead Trout and Designated Critical Habitat.  NOAA designated critical habitat for steelhead on November 30, 2004. Designated critical habitat included areas in Latah County. The nearest occupied habitat is within the Snake River Basin Steelhead Evolutionary Significant Unit.  The Palouse Subbasin habitat was specifically excluded from the designated critical habitat in the final rule for the designation of Critical Habitat in the Federal Register [50 CFR Part 226] in 2005 (NOAA 2012). 3.10 Transportation 3.10.1 Regulatory	  Framework and	  Policies Transportation is governed by the following: • FHWA TA 6640.8A requires analysis of changes to travel patterns and accessibility, effects to highway and traffic safety for bicyclists and pedestrians, and overall public safety (FHWA 1987). 3.10.2 Methodology Data on existing highway and roadway facilities were obtained from ITD, Latah County, the City of Moscow, and local highway districts.

Existing access information was gained from field observations, aerial photographs and review of transportation plans.  In addition a technical report was developed to evaluate traffic operations and safety within the project corridor.  The technical report is titled, US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow; AASHTO Highway Safety Manual Analysis for Alternatives Carried Forward (ITD 2012a).   The following reports were prepared or revised since the DEIS was published: • US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow; AASHTO Highway Safety Manual Analysis on Alternatives Carried Forward (ITD 2013).

This report is a compilation and synthesis of several previous reports. It clarifies the methodology, data sets, meteorological principles and patterns, and presents additional information on snow accumulation and snowmelt. On-site measurements and variability across the study area were analyzed. Satellite remote sensing data from 2002 through 2012 documents the spatial distribution of snow. Additional data was provided to address comments on the short sampling duration in the original Weather Analysis. It describes the variability of weather related roadway conditions between the alternatives. On-site measurements collected include: • Instantaneous, and 24-hour maximum and minimum air temperature • Relative humidity • Average and gust wind speeds/directions • Incoming shortwave radiation • Precipitation type, rate and accumulation Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 126 Affected Environment • Snow depth • Visibility distance Wind speed/direction and incoming solar radiation on a horizontal plane were measured at 33 feet height; air temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, visibility distance, and snow depth were measured at approximately 6.5 feet in height. Wet bulb and dew point temperatures were calculated from the temperature and humidity data. The original weather analysis included monthly and total precipitation from January through May 2005, reported as liquid water equivalent depths, at the three weather corridors and the PSF. Comparing current year PSF values to the 30-year normal shows that January and February were dry months, March and May were excessively wet months, and April was similar to the climatological norm so that the study period included a good sampling of precipitation across the range of historically observed climatological values. There was a strong correlation between monthly precipitation at the PSF and at each of the three study corridors, which allowed an estimation of the monthly climatological normal precipitation at each of the three study sites.  It is common practice in scientific field studies to conduct short-term data collection, on the order of a few months, to determine spatial variability of weather characteristics (for example, the First International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Field Experiment (FIFE), (Hall and Sellers 1995) from which more than 1000 scientific publications were produced.   The five-month data set used in the DEIS Weather Analysis was not the sole source of weather data but is a valid methodology used to establish the relative conditions among the EC, WC and RH weather stations within their respective climate regimes.  The smaller five-month data set was used to establish the relative ranking of the short-term data within the larger PSF data set, which is about a mile from the study area.  Knowledge of the relative conditions among the three on-site weather stations and the UI weather station allowed estimation of the long-term climate at each of the on-site weather stations through calibration with the long-term UI climate records.    The relative weather conditions at the three stations behaved consistently with established principles of physics and thermodynamics, and compared to similar locations and/or elevation trends documented by scientific literature (Qualls 2014).  Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 127 Affected Environment 3.10.3 Existing	  Conditions Within Idaho, US-95 is classified as a principal arterial, providing the only continuous north-south highway connection between the Idaho Panhandle and the rest of the state. It supports multiple local uses, including primary access to agricultural, residential, commercial and industrial land located directly adjacent to the highway. Within the City of Moscow, US-95 connects with SH-8, which is a major east west highway.  Both US-95 and SH-8 serve as principal arterials within the local system and Regional Transportation System. Safety Crash data between 2003 and 2012 shows that this section of US-95 averages 25.3 crashes per year and would reach 27.4 crashes in the year 2017.  Safety issues within the study area relate primarily to the road geometry and accesses onto the roadway. Table 30. Crash Severity Data and Table 31.

These accidents occurred either at an intersection, because of an intersection or at a private access point. Accidents at intersections tend to have a higher severity than accidents outside of intersections.  Ten percent of these intersection-related crashes are rated as Type A for severity.  Approximately 40 percent of these intersection related crashes occurred at private approaches (ITD 2013). There were eight head-on collisions, which generally had the highest severity rating of all types of accidents. These types of accidents are generally associated with passing maneuvers.  By adding a lane in each direction and separating the direction of travel, the frequency of these accidents will be greatly reduced (ITD 2013). The National Highway Traffic Safety study on the cost of crashes shows that society generally pays for 75 percent of crash costs. Economic values for crashes in the project area have been calculated by crash severity. Fatal accidents in the project area cost approximately $6,200,000 whereas property damage only crashes cost approximately $6,700 per crash in 2012 (ITD 2013). Three HALs are located within the project limits based on information presented in the DEIS. See Table 32. High Accident Locations (HALs). These segments have the highest crash rates in ITD District 2 and are in the top 13 highest crash locations in the State of Idaho. The crash rates in these locations and throughout the corridor are expected to increase as traffic volumes increase (ITD 2012a).  Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 129 Affected Environment Table	  32.	  High	  Accident	  Locations	  (HALs) Milepost Location on US 95  HAL Ranking in Idaho  337.67	  -‐338.17  6  338.67	  -‐339.62  13  340.62	  -‐341.12  4  Accidents near MP 339.1 and MP 344.0 are primarily caused by failure to negotiate the existing curves. Most of these accidents can be attributed to curves in the project area that have substandard geometry and narrower than standard shoulders.  Between 2003 and 2012 approximately 40 percent of the accidents in the project area occurred while a driver was negotiating a curve.   Since the DEIS was published, the crash data was updated and the HALs were recalculated.  Two HALs are located within the project limits based on the updated crash data. See Table 33. Updated High Accident Locations (HALs).

US-95 Thorncreek to Moscow between MP 340 and 343.3 was identified as a low priority linkage area.  The frequency of wild animal crashes in the project area is much less than many other sections of US-95 and many other highways in Idaho (Ruediger and DiGiorgio 2007). See Table 34. Crashes by Ungulate Crossing Areas in Latah Countyfor a comparison between different US-95 segments identified by IDFG as Wildlife Linkage Areas in Latah County between 2003 and the end of 2012. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 130 Affected Environment Table	  34.	  Crashes	  by	  Ungulate	  Crossing	  Areas	  in	  Latah	  County Ungulate Crossing Area on US 95  Total Wild Animal *	  Crashes  Linkage	  Priority	  Status  Marsh Hill (MP 367.1 -‐370.1)  27  Moderate  Crooks Hill (MP 356.0 – 359.0)  19  Low  Steakhouse	  Hill (MP	  349.7-‐352.7)  47  Moderate  Thorncreek to Moscow (MP	  340	  -‐343.3)  17  Low  * Wildlife Crashes and Wild Animal Crashes refer to primarily big game such as elk, moose and deer.  Not all wildlife such as birds, amphibians, and small mammals are counted. Crash data from 2003 thru 2012 indicated that there were 476 wildlife crashes along US-95 in District 2.  There have been 32 wild animal crashes on US-95 within the project limits during that period.  Seventeen occurred within the identified Thorncreek to Moscow ungulate crossing area.  Of these only six were rated as type C (possible injuries). The rest of the crashes involving wildlife were property damage only (ITD 2013). Based on the low severity and randomness of the wildlife crashes, they are not anticipated to be a primary factor in the evaluation of the alternatives (ITD 2013).  Intersection related crashes are mostly multiple vehicle high severity crashes that involve head-on crashes, sideswipes, angle turning, and rear-ending crashes.  Of the intersection related crashes reported in the past 10 years between Thorncreek Road and Moscow to characterize existing conditions, 19 total injuries that were a combination of serious injuries (Type A), visible injuries (Type B), and possible injuries (Type C) were reported (ITD 2013). The ITD’s Strategic Highway Safety Plan has 11 emphasis areas, one of which is intersection crashes; however, there is no emphasis area for wild animal crashes due to their low severity (ITD 2010).  However, ITD is currently working with IDFG and wildlife resource agencies to identify the highest priority wildlife crossing area for statewide prioritization within the State of Idaho. Highway Capacity and Operations Capacity, the ability of a road to accommodate traffic volume, is an important component of mobility (ITD 2014a). When traffic volumes increase and the roadways reaches capacity, the LOS may be affected. With the existing Average ADT of 5,364, the current facility operates at a LOS-C, which is high-density traffic flow.  Approximately six percent of the vehicle traffic is commercial and 94 percent is estimated to be passenger vehicles.  At LOS C, speed and freedom to maneuver are severely restricted and the driver experiences a generally poor level of comfort and convenience. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 131 Affected Environment Time spent following slower vehicles is noticeably longer and occurs more frequently. With LOS C, there are few gaps in traffic to allow for passing, increasing overall delay. The existing roadway consists of two 12-foot undivided travel lanes with two-foot shoulders.  The clear zone and shoulder width, which are important elements for safety, vary throughout the corridor and do not meet AASHTO standards17.  This two-lane segment of US-95 is a bottleneck for the four-lane highway segments at the northern and southern ends of the project.  Access This stretch of US-95 is designated as Statewide Access Control. There are currently 66 at-grade intersections and approaches (public, commercial and field) in this 6.34-mile segment of US-95. Between 2003 and 2012 there were 26 crashes directly associated with private approaches or intersections (ITD 2013). The north end of the project is the most densely populated area.  It has the highest number of access points and the highest number of intersection related crashes. Currently, the many approaches along the existing alignment do not meet the ITD Access Control Policy due to spacing, sight distance, width and grade of approaches, which contribute to intersection related conflicts. The Latah County Comprehensive Plan requires that limits should be placed on the number of access points to state and federal highways (Latah County 2010). Mobility and User Cost Mobility refers to the efficiency and speed that motorist travel from one location to another and is defined by the AASHTO Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets as “trip travel time”. Capacity is an important component of mobility. The total travel time for motorists making the entire trip on existing US-95 from Thorncreek Road to Moscow in 2017 would be 380,000 hours with a total cost of travel time, cost of time related vehicle depreciation, and vehicle operating costs of $14,600,000 (ITD 2014a). Increased mobility reduces road user costs and is expected to improve economic opportunity according to the 2011 ITD Strategic Plan. See the Mobility and Road User Cost Technical Report (2014a) for additional Information. 17 AASHTO standards are outlined in the Roadside Design Guide 2011 (4th Edition) Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 132 Affected Environment Bicyclists and Pedestrians The existing US-95 travels primarily through an agricultural area and there are no formal bicycle and pedestrian facilities along the highway corridor. Currently bicyclists and pedestrians must use the shoulders, which vary, through the corridor.  The shoulders are not striped to accommodate dedicated bicycle or pedestrian paths. Mass Transit There is currently no mass transit available in the study area; however, there is mass transit available in the City of Moscow.  While service ends approximately a half-mile north of the project limits, consideration of future service extension is possible.  Moscow Valley Transit had bus routes between Moscow and Lewiston; however, the service was discontinued in 2010 due to low ridership and lack of funding. The City of Moscow operates a small vanpool between Moscow and Lewiston. Palouse Rideshare, an on-line carpooling match program, is available for commuters travelling the same routes on a regular basis. Weather Conditions During meetings held from 2004 to 2006, and during the DEIS public comment period, weather conditions as they affect safety were a major topic of concern. The public expressed concern that the topographic differences between locations of the different alternatives could influence safety differently.  A report titled Final Report for Weather Analysis of Proposed Realignments of U.S. Highway 95; Thorncreek Road to Moscow (Qualls 2005) was prepared. During the DEIS comment period, the public expressed concern about the weather data set, the influence of elevation on temperature, ice, and snow.  There were also comments regarding fog, wind, snowdrift and other weather related road conditions. The Weather Analysis was revised after the DEIS hearing and additional information, clarification and additional data was incorporated into this section. General Climate of the Region. Northern Idaho, including Moscow, Idaho and surrounding areas, has a maritime, dry-summer climate (Abramovich et al, 1998). The existing US-95 alignment from Thorncreek Road to Moscow and all of the proposed alternatives are subject to this climate. There is a lengthy history of climate information available as a reference for the region, such as data from the PSF located approximately one mile from the study area. The PSF has weather data extending back to 1892 (Qualls 2014). Associated with the general climate of the region, the study area can be expected to experience precipitation, snow, ice, wind and fog. Approximately 60 percent of crashes during the past 10 years occurred during inclement weather where the police reports list snow, rain, or fog as the weather condition during the crash incident. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 133 Affected Environment The weather analyses divided the project area into three distinct weather corridors: a western corridor, eastern corridor and Reisenauer Hill.  These do not specifically correspond to the individual alternatives (E-2, C-3, and Modified W-4 alternatives); however, based on the principles of physics and thermodynamics, the Modified W-4 Alternative was most closely represented by the western corridor, and the E-2 and C-3 Alternatives were best represented by the eastern corridor.  The southern two fifths of the study area for all the alternatives were best represented by Reisenauer Hill. Wind, snow, precipitation, ice, and fog were evaluated to determine if there were differences in conditions between the corridors as summarized in this section. Wind. Analysis of the data reported in the weather analysis showed the eastern corridor and western corridor to have wind speeds similar to each other, and Reisenauer Hill to experience faster wind speeds than either of the other two corridors. The predominant airflow in the region is in the east-west direction. Given the extent of Paradise Ridge, the northern two-thirds of the study area was dominated by flow over Paradise Ridge, and the southern third of the study region generally experienced air flow which moved around the southern end of Paradise Ridge. Fog. Fog or clouds are formed when the temperature of the air decreases enough that atmospheric water vapor reaches the saturation point, causing condensation of vapor into fine liquid water droplets.  This can happen because temperature decreases or by increasing atmospheric humidity. Multiple measurements were collected each minute, and these were reported as samples, averages or accumulations, depending on the variable, several times per hour.  Measurements of visibility distances associated with fog at the eastern corridor, the western corridor, and Reisenauer Hill showed Reisenauer Hill to have the poorest visibility conditions, followed by the eastern corridor and then the western corridor.  There were fewer hours of dense fog in the lowland areas but the worst fog in the study area was located in the southern project area south of Eid Road.  Precipitation and Snow. Snow accumulation is primarily a function of the amount of precipitation and the air temperature while precipitation is falling. Precipitation, especially as snow, is of significant interest in this project in terms of its impact on driving safety for each of the roadway alignment alternatives. Regionally, precipitation decreases on a gradient from Moscow south to the top of the Lewiston grade.  Countering this is the localized topography of Paradise Ridge and the fact that precipitation generally increases with elevation on the upwind side of a slope. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 134 Affected Environment Measurements during the study regularly showed the air temperature in the western corridor as 10 to 15 degrees Fahrenheit less than the air temperature in the eastern corridor.  The study showed that the eastern corridor was freezing four percent more than the western corridor; however, it was more common for all the corridors to be freezing at the same time. The data regarding snow accumulations showed that snow melts off most slowly from steep north-facing slopes and most quickly from steep south-facing slopes, with gradual variation between these extremes.  Precipitation studies showed that precipitation in the eastern corridor was the greatest and was approximately 25 percent more than the western corridor and near Reisenauer Hill. Annual precipitation at the eastern corridor and Reisenauer Hill weather stations are similar to the PSF and average 2.5 inches per year lower at the western corridor weather station. Due to the short horizontal distance in the upwind direction from the peak of Paradise Ridge to the valley floor, much of the precipitation lands and accumulates downwind of the ridgeline to the south and east of Reisenauer Hill and Paradise Ridge.  Data from the Revised Weather Analysis shows snow accumulation to be less further north of Reisenauer Hill. Both the on-site weather station measurements and the satellite images in the technical report provide useful information comparing snow accumulation between alternatives. Reisenauer Hill is the most critical location within the study area, including both the north-facing slope on the north end and the region to the south toward Thorncreek Road, due to greater accumulation and retention of snow compared to the rest of the study area.  Exhibit 23. Snow Cover shows an eastward looking view of the eastern corridor from Zeitler Road showing the contrast between either flat or south-facing slopes or slopes with a north-facing aspect. The snow covered slopes face northwest. Since the photographs were taken before 10 a.m., the sun was still to the east, so that northwestern slopes had not yet been exposed to direct solar radiation. Flat and south-facing slopes both in the low-lying foreground and at higher elevations in the background are free of snow. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 135 Affected Environment Exhibit	  23.	  Snow	  Cover Ice. Icy road conditions may result from condensation on road surfaces during freezing conditions. Reisenauer Hill had the highest total number of hours with frost conditions, followed closely by the western corridor.  The southern portion of the study area has the most severe frost conditions. The eastern corridor would both have less than half the number of hours with frost conditions than Reisenauer Hill and the western corridor.  See the Revised Weather Analysis (Qualls 2014) for more detail.  3.11 Visual Quality 3.11.1 Regulatory	  Framework and Policies Visual quality is governed by the following: • 23 USC-131 Control of Outdoor Advertising • 23 USC-136 Control of Junkyards • 23 CFR-750-Highway Beautification Act • FHWA’s visual quality assessment methodology • Context Sensitive Solutions (CSS) • TA 6640.8A NEPA Implementation-Guidance for Preparing and Processing Environmental and Section 4(f) Documents Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 136 Affected Environment 3.11.2 Methodology A technical report titled U.S.-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow Project Final Visual Resources Report (December 2005) was prepared and documents the methods and findings of the visual quality analysis. The purpose of the visual analysis is to assess the existing visual resources of the project corridor and to identify and describe positive and negative visual effects that may occur for each of the alternatives. Investigators completed site visits, reviewed aerial photographs and developed a three-dimensional (3-D) virtual model that was used at public meetings. The analysis consisted of two phases: an inventory and an assessment of data. During the inventory, investigators identified key observation viewpoints, assessed project visibility, variety classes and distance zones. See Table 35. Visual Variety Classifications.  During the second phase, data was analyzed to determine the potential effects of each alternative to visual resources.  See the Visual Resources Technical Report. Table	  35.	  Visual 	  Variety 	  Classifications Variety Classification  Description  Class A  These are areas where features of landform, vegetation patterns, and rock formations are	  outstanding	  within the	  study area. These	  features are	  typically unique	  and dominate the landscape.  Class B  These are areas where features contain variety in form, line, color, and texture or combinations	  of these. These features	  tend to be common throughout the study	  area.  Class C  These are typically areas with minimal variety in form, line, color, and texture or areas that	  have	  been substantially altered by human presence. These	  areas are	  typically associated with urban areas such as the	  City of Moscow.  Distance zones were established because visual perception of form, texture, color, and other visual criteria change as distance from a viewpoint increases. There are four thresholds: • Extreme Foreground (0 to 0.25 mile) • Foreground (0.25 miles to 0.5 mile) • Middle ground (0.5 to 1 mile) • Background (1 to 3 miles) After areas were delineated according to project visibility, variety class, and distance zone, the visual effects from different features of the alignments were evaluated. Additional visual assessment was completed as part of the DEIS Community Impact Assessment Technical Report (HDR 2006).  This report also provides design visualizations towards and from several angles and positions including views from the City of Moscow towards the highway.  Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 137 Affected Environment 3.11.3 Existing	  Conditions The rolling hills of the Palouse and small farms characterize much of the landscape. Paradise Ridge, a prominent feature, is located outside of the study area further to the east.  Dense urban areas associated with the City of Moscow are located to the north. Key observation viewpoints where viewers who are most sensitive to visual change or where viewers believed to have a high concern for visual change were most likely to be found, were identified.  The two key observation viewpoints for this project were identified as residential and recreation viewpoints.   Residential viewers included urban dwellers found in and around the City of Moscow and rural dwellers associated with outlying areas and farms.  Recreation viewpoints are typically associated with parks, golf courses, trails and scenic overlooks.  Viewers at these viewpoints are concerned with visual impacts because these impacts influence their perception of the recreation experience.  Several parks considered as recreation viewpoints are: • Frontier Park • Paradise Ridge Road (bicycling and hiking) • University of Idaho Golf Course • University of Idaho Arboretum See Exhibit 19. Points of Interest.  See the Visual Resources Technical Report for additional information. Information from the photogrammetric review, 3-D virtual model, and site visits were used to delineate areas into three variety classes; A, B, and C as described below:  A. The upper portions of Paradise Ridge were the only areas delineated as Class A. The high diversity in landform, vegetation, and uniqueness to the study area contributed to this classification. B. The rolling hills of the Palouse farmland and the lower slopes of Paradise Ridge were classified as B. While common to the Palouse country, these areas exhibit variety in color, texture, and landform. C. The urban areas associated with the City of Moscow were classified as C. These areas are heavily altered, dominated by structures, roads, and other man-made amenities. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 138 Affected Environment 3.12 Traffic	  Noise 3.12.1 Regulatory	  Framework and	  Policies Traffic noise is governed by the following: • 23 CFR 772-Procedures for Abatement of Highway Traffic Noise and Construction Noise • ITD Traffic Noise Policy TA 6640.8A NEPA Implementation-Guidance for Preparing and Processing Environmental and Section 4(f) Documents 23 CFR 772 Procedures for the Abatement of Highway Traffic and Construction Noise outlines the FHWA noise regulations.  It contains the criteria used for establishing noise impacts and mitigating those impacts.  FHWA and ITD require a traffic noise analysis of federally funded projects or federal aid highway projects that construct new highways or reconstruct existing highways if the project would significantly change either the horizontal or vertical alignment or increase the number of through-traffic lanes. The FHWA has established NAC standards for several categories of land use activities. See Table 36. FHWA Noise Abatement Criteria (NAC). A traffic noise impact occurs when the existing or future noise levels approach (1 dBA below the FHWA NAC) or exceed the FHWA Noise Abatement Criteria (NAC) or when the predicted future traffic noise levels substantially exceed the existing noise levels, even if the predicted noise levels may not approach or exceed the FHWA NAC.   Table	  36.	  FHWA	  Noise	  Abatement	  Criteria 	  (NAC) Activity Category  Leq (dBA) FHWA  Evaluation Location  Description of Activity Category  Category A  57  Exterior  Land on which serenity	  and quiet are	  of extraordinary	  significance and serve an important need and where the preservation	  of those qualities	  is	  essential if the area is	  to continue to serve its	  intended purpose  Category B  67  Exterior  Residential  Category C  67  Exterior  Active sport areas, amphitheaters, auditoriums, campgrounds, cemeteries, day	  care centers, hospitals, libraries, medical facilities, 	  parks,	  picnic 	  areas,	  places 	  of 	  worship,	  playgrounds,	  public meeting rooms, public or nonprofit institutional structures, radio studios, recording studios, recreation areas, Section 4(f) sites, schools,	  television 	  studios,	  trails,	  and 	  trail crossings  Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 139 Affected Environment Activity Category  Leq (dBA) FHWA  Evaluation Location  Description of Activity Category  Category D  52  Interior  Auditoriums, day care centers, hospitals, libraries, medical facilities, places of	  worship, public meeting rooms, public or	  nonprofit institutional structures, radio	  studios, recording studios, schools,	  and 	  television 	  studios  Category E  72  -‐ Hotels, motels, offices, restaurants/bars, and other developed lands, 	  properties 	  or 	  activities 	  not 	  included 	  in 	  A-‐D	  or F  Category F  -‐ -‐ Agriculture, airports, bus yards, emergency	  services,	  industrial,	  logging, 	  maintenance 	  facilities, 	  manufacturing, 	  mining, 	  rail	  yards, retail facilities, shipyards, utilities (water	  resources,	  water treatment, electrical), and warehousing  Category G  -‐ -‐ Undeveloped lands that are not permitted  Substantial Increase  15  -‐ A	  substantial increase of 15 dBA	  over the existing noise levels  Source: 23 CFR 772 and ITD Traffic Noise Policy 3.12.2 Methodology Noise is defined as unwanted sound. There are several different ways to measure noise, depending on the source of the noise, the receptor, and the reason for the noise measurement. Noise in these analyses was measured in terms of sound pressure levels expressed in A-weighted decibels (dBA). Noise levels stated in terms of dBA reflect the response of the human ear by filtering out some of the noise in the low and high frequency ranges that the ear does not detect well. A technical report titled Analysis of Noise and Impacts US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow was prepared in 2012 to evaluate the existing noise conditions and to determine if the alternatives, including the No Action Alternative, would result in noise impacts meeting or approaching the FHWA Noise Abatement Impact Criteria (NAC). An addendum to the 2012 Noise Analysis was prepared to evaluate the noise impacts of the Modified W-4 Alternative. Both of these reports were updated in 2015 to reflect revised impacts and potential impacts due to the project right-ofway.  The noise analysis was performed in accordance with 23 CFR 772 and the ITD Traffic Noise Policy dated May 2011.  Field measurements were taken and a computer noise analysis was performed using the FHWA Traffic Noise Model (TNM) 2.5.  The model was used to predict noise impacts to sensitive receptors in the project area in 2010 and the design year of 2037 for all of the alternatives.   Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 140 Affected Environment Vehicle speeds were 60 mph for the existing roadway and 65 mph for the No Action and Action Alternatives.  The posted speed limits change to 35 mph or 45 mph at the approach to Moscow, depending on the alternative.

The CAA amendments regulate projects in non-attainment and maintenance of National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) requiring conformance with the State Implementation Plan. Greenhouse gas (GHG), and specifically Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, are not currently regulated at the federal or state level.  However, FHWA is working nationally with other modal administrations through the USDOT Center for Climate Change and Environmental Forecasting to develop strategies to reduce the transportation sector’s contribution to greenhouse gases, particularly CO2 emissions, and to assess the risks to transportation systems and services from climate change. 3.13.2 Methodology MSAT standards establish stringent controls on gasoline, passenger vehicles, and gasoline containment to further reduce emissions of benzene and other MSATs. While MSAT releases to the environment may cause some level of pollution, scientific techniques, tools, and data analysis has not been developed to accurately estimate actual human health or environmental effects from MSATs from this transportation project (ITD 2007b). In order to evaluate the projected emissions and MSAT effects, a qualitative analysis was performed. Transportation-related emissions can be related to VMT. This qualitative analysis utilizes existing and projected traffic volumes, vehicle mixes and vehicle miles to calculate vehicle miles travelled (VMT).  VMTs are used to estimate the changes and relative differences Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) June 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 146 Affected Environment in MSATs for the project alternatives. GHG emissions, including CO2, are shown to be directly related to energy consumed.  3.13.3 Existing	  Conditions The project is not within a federally designated air quality non-attainment or maintenance area for carbon monoxide (CO) and/or particulate matter (PM10 or PM2.5), nor is it within an IDEQ air quality area of concern. No project level air quality concerns were identified that required evaluation and the project has minimal likelihood of exceeding federal air quality standards.  An air quality conformity analysis is not required; however, a qualitative analysis of air quality was conducted.  Sensitive receptors in the study area include schools, daycare facilities, hospitals, parks, and retirement facilities.  Greenhouse Gas (GHG) The transportation sector is the second largest source of total GHGs in the US and is the greatest source of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, a predominant GHG.  In 2004, the transportation sector was responsible for about 31 percent of US CO2 emissions.  The principal human-made source of CO2 emissions is the combustion of fossil fuels, which accounts for approximately 80 percent of human-made emissions of carbon worldwide.  Almost all (98 percent) of transportation-sector emissions result from the consumption of petroleum products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, and aviation fuel (FHWA 2011). Transportation related emissions, including CO2 can be correlated to VMT and fuel consumption, which is discussed in Section 3.15, Energy. The VMT for the existing US-95 is 34,008. VMT was calculated by multiplying the length of the alignment (6.34 miles) by the 2010 traffic volumes.  The 2010 data was compiled in 2011. 3.14 Hazardous Materials 3.14.1 Regulatory	  Framework and	  Policies Hazardous materials are governed by the following: • 40 CFR 1500-1508-CEQ Regulations • FHWA TA 6640.8A NEPA Implementation-Guidance for Preparing and Processing Environmental and Section 4(f) Documents • 42 USC 103-Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) • 42 USC 6901-6992k -Resource Conservation and Recovery Act  (RCRA) • 33 USC Section 1251-Clean Water Act • 40 CFR 61(M)-National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 147 Affected Environment • 29 USC 651-Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) • 42 USC 300(f)-Safe Drinking Water Act • 15 USC 2601-2629-Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) • Idaho Statutes Title 39 Health and Safety • Hazardous Waste Management Act (Chapter 44) • Hazardous Substance Emergency Response Act (Chapter 71) • Land Remediation Act • Idaho Rules\Regulations\Standards (Chapter 72) • IDAPA 37.03.09-Well Construction Standards Rules • Rules and Minimum Standards for the Construction and Use of Injection Wells • IDAPA 37.03.03 Rules and Minimum Standards for the Construction and Use of Injection Wells • IDAPA 58.01.05-Rules and Standards for Hazardous Waste • IDAPA 58.01.07-Rules Regulating UST Systems • IDAPA 58.01.15-Rules Governing the Cleaning of Septic Tanks • IDAPA 58.01.18-Land Remediation Rules • IDAPA 58.01.11-Ground Water Quality Rules • IDAPA 58.01.02-Water Quality Standards • IDAPA 17.10.01-General Safety and Health Standards • IDAPA 17.10.01-Idaho General Safety and Health Standards • Lead-based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act of 1971 • Residential Lead-based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 3.14.2 Methodology A technical report titled Hazardous Material Scan-US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow (Northwind 2005) was prepared to identify hazardous material risks in the study area.  Federal and state databases were reviewed again in 2011 to identify any changes to known sites within one half-mile of each alternative that could be affected. A survey for recorded and potentially hazardous materials was performed in 2005 within approximately one-half mile from the project area. Locations within the project area that potentially contained hazardous material were identified and marked on aerial photographs. Databases were reviewed and public safety personnel were interviewed.  In addition, a field review of the study area was completed. The following sources were investigated to complete a hazardous materials scan of the study area: Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 148 Affected Environment National Response Center Public Report Database • Latah County Solid Waste Department personnel interviews • DEQ and ITD Lewiston personnel interviews regarding previous spills or releases • Aerial photography • Field survey of the corridor  • Idaho State Police Community and Drug Information. • DEQ underground storage tank (UST) and leaking underground storage tank (LUST) database • EPA database for Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) • Superfund sites and RCRA sites water dischargers, hazardous waste sites, toxic releases and air emissions sites • Idaho State Police website for Region 2 was accessed to identify known hazardous materials sites, such as methamphetamine (meth) labs or meth production by-products dump sites • FINDS, ALLSITES databases 3.14.3 Existing	  Conditions The predominant hazardous materials observed during the field survey were small propane tanks and aboveground storage tanks (ASTs) for petroleum products.

Two UST sites were recorded on the DEQ UST list; Primeland Cooperative and Johnson’s Trucking.  Two other sites appeared to have USTs with visible gas pumps that may still be connected to USTs but were not listed by DEQ.  Two of these sites were located on Thorncreek Road on the southern end of the study area. The other site was located on US-95 and probably contains one tank used for diesel fuel. Other fuel storage containers noted in the study area are described below: • There was an abandoned 1,000-gallon tank observed along Jacksha Road.  It currently holds water from a spring. Four locations in the project area had 55-gallon drums on the property with unknown contents. • Seventeen properties were observed with ASTs and assumed to contain petroleum products such as gasoline, heating oil, or diesel fuel. The majority of the ASTs were approximately 200 to 500 gallons tanks. Thirty-four homes were observed to have an aboveground propane tank on the property. These ranged in size from 200 gallon to 500gallon tanks.  Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 150 Affected Environment • Three sites had numerous abandoned cars. One location on US-95 is currently used as an automotive repair shop. These sites have the potential for the presence of petroleum products, stained soils, and leaky car batteries, which could contaminate soils or water. One business within the project area services air conditioners and is anticipated to have Freon and other gases that pose a risk to the environment if not handled correctly. This location also included a stockpile of railroad ties, which are typically a source of leaking creosote. • There were two locations along US-95 within the study area that had methamphetamine lab related incidences (ISP 2005). Methamphetamine labs contain hazardous materials; therefore, it will be necessary to verify what level of cleanup has been completed prior to any construction activities (Denbleyder, pers. com. 2005). • Latah County has a solid waste transfer station located on SH-8, approximately five miles east of Moscow, outside the study area. Lead-based paints and a variety of asbestos containing products were commonly utilized in construction between the 1940s and the mid-1970s.  Lead-based paint was determined to be a hazardous material in the early 1970s. The vast majority of homes built before 1950 contained substantial amounts of lead-based paint.  Due to the age of many of the existing structures there is the potential risk of lead-based paint and asbestos contained in the structures that would be demolished by each alternative. 3.15 Energy 3.15.1 Regulatory	  Framework and	  Policies Energy is governed by the following: • 40 CFR 1502-Council on Environmental Quality NEPA Regulation • FHWA TA 6640.8A NEPA Implementation-Guidance for Preparing and Processing Environmental and Section 4(f) Documents 3.15.2 Methodology Energy requirements of a highway include the energy required to construct, operate, and maintain the highway. The operational energy consumption has been estimated using the average energy consumption for different vehicle types (heavy trucks and passenger vehicles) and the VMT.  VMT is estimated by multiplying the ADT by the length of the highway segment. Maintenance energy can also be estimated based on the VMT because the amount of roadway that needs to be maintained and the amount of traffic using the roadway relates to the frequency which maintenance would be needed. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 151 Affected Environment 3.15.3 Existing	  Conditions Operational energy Table 40. Existing and Projected Fuel Use shows the estimated fuel used for vehicle types travelling on the existing 6.34-mile long highway segment. Table	  40.	  Existing	  and	  Projected	  Fuel	  Use	  Vehicle type  Average Fuel Consumption	  (mpg)  Estimated Daily Fuel Use 2010 (gal)  Estimated Daily Fuel Use 2037 (gal)  Passenger Vehicle  22.2  1,445  2,252  Heavy Truck  5.9  329  687  Total Energy Use  −  1,773  2,939  The fuel consumption estimates used in this analysis are based on averages for fuel economy and do not take into account smoothness of traffic flow or average speeds traveled on a specific highway. Highly congested travel conditions with stop-and-start traffic, low speeds, and highly variable speeds all contribute to poor fuel economy (TRB 1995). To help measure the level of congestion or smoothness of traffic flow on a road, LOS standards have been developed.  See Exhibit 8. Level of Services (LOS) for a graphic description of LOS. Total fuel consumption for this segment of US-95 is estimated to be 1,773 gallons per day. Maintenance energy The vehicles and equipment used to maintain the highway include trucks, mowers, snow removal machines, tractors, and construction equipment. The frequency at which these vehicles are needed for maintenance activities and the energy needed to produce the material for the road maintenance can be correlated to the VMT for the roadway.  VMT would reflect the traffic volumes, the amount of roadway to be maintained and the associated degradation.  Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 152 Environmental Consequences 4 ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES The primary resource effects from the four alternatives are summarized in Table 41.

Visual quality and noise effects are evaluated in Section 4.11 Visual Quality Effects and 4.12, Noise Effects.  Community opinions regarding the effects of each alternative on the community, including noise and visual effects are detailed in the Community Impact Technical Reports.  There were strong differing opinions regarding the effects of the W-4 and E-2 alternatives presented during the July 2006 interview period. The Citizens for a Safe Highway 95, claiming to represent people collectively owning 80 percent of the land along E-2, were in favor of E-2 due to the “spectacular view” of the Palouse and of the City of Moscow from US-95 as the route traverses the west base of Paradise Ridge. They believed that the beauty of Paradise Ridge could transform the highway into a gateway for Moscow, and that E-2 could promote and preserve the Palouse landscape to a scenic highway status. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 154 Environmental Consequences The Paradise Ridge Defense Coalition, which opposed the E-2 Alternative, stated that the majority of the community would like to see the expansion of the roadway follow the existing route as much as possible to minimize the ecological footprint of new roadwork and the view towards US-95 from Paradise Ridge.  The argument against E-2 centered on Paradise Ridge as a unique and valued feature in the community. To those opposed to E-2, the ridge should remain untouched because it provides aesthetic value.  Paradise Ridge serves as a reason both for and against the E-2 Alternative (HDR 2005a). Potential Property Impacts Table 42. Residential and Right-of-Way Impacts shows the numbers of residences impacted and right-of-way needs by alternative.  Table	  42.	  Residential	  and	  Right-‐of-‐Way 	  Impacts Alternative  Residential Impacts  Additional Potential Residential Impacts  New Right of Way (acres)  Existing Right of Way (acres)  Total Right of Way (acres)  No Action  0  0  0  0  0  Modified W-‐4  3  2  206  45  251  C-‐3  2  5  154  55  209  E-‐2  7  6  207  22  229  Residential impacts may be due to direct impacts to structures and homes, removal of access, or right-of-way acquisition that would substantially impair the property. If during right-of-way acquisition, displacement is required then displacements would be compensated under the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (Uniform Relocation Act). The Uniform Relocation Act established minimum standards for federally funded projects that require the acquisition of real property or displace persons from their homes, businesses, or farms. See Appendix 5. Uniform Relocation Act Summary. The DEIS was based on a conceptual level of detail without the design, topographic, survey and geotechnical data, needed to accurately determine specific displacements. The displacements listed in the DEIS were based on a worst-case scenario where access impacts and close proximity to the alignments were assumed to result in displacement. After the DEIS hearing, displacement numbers were reviewed, specific assumptions were defined, and impacts were recalculated based on the assumptions.  It was assumed that “impacted” residences (and businesses) would be directly impacted by the cut and fill lines resulting in relocation, whereas “potentially impacted” residents (and businesses) would be near the cut and fill lines and right-of-way or outbuildings could possibly Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 155 Environmental Consequences be impacted but relocation of primary buildings or residences was not assumed.  However, more detailed design or topographic information is needed to make that determination. If an action alternative is selected and the project is forwarded for design, then additional topographic, survey and design detail will allow ITD to accurately determine the right-of-way needs and the specific residential and business impacts. Impacts to those properties may be further minimized at that time. Table 42. Residential and Right-of-Way Impacts shows residential impacts and potential residential impacts by alternative. Proximity impacts including visual and noise impacts are discussed in Section 4.11 Visual Quality Effects, 4.12 Noise Effect and Section 6.1 Indirect Effects. No Action Alternative The No Action Alternative would not impact or potentially impact residences or require right-ofway acquisition.  Modified W-4 Modified W-4 would impact three residences.  Two additional residences may be potentially impacted due to proximity. If the Modified W-4 Alternative is selected then during the design period when topographic, geotechnical and design detail is available, impacts may be further minimized. The potentially impacted residences would require that right-of-way be purchased but residential relocation is not assumed.  Access would be consistent with the Expressway Access Control and ITD’s Access Control Policy. Modified W-4 would require the greatest amount of right-of-way, but it would have fewer residential impacts and potential impacts than the E-2 Alternative. C-3 C-3 would impact two residences and potentially impact five additional residences.  If the C-3 Alternative is selected then during the design period when topographic, geotechnical and design detail is available, impacts may be further minimized. The C-3 Alternative would have the fewest direct impacts to residences of the Action Alternatives. The six RV stalls that are potentially impacted are not considered residences because use is temporary.  They are considered as one business impact. E-2 (Preferred Alternative) E-2 would impact seven residences; five of which are located in the Benson Mobile Home Park.  Approximately 2.9 acres of the mobile home park would be acquired. The E-2 Alternative would also potentially impact six additional residential stuctures, including a shop and garage which would not likely result in full displacements. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 156 Environmental Consequences Community Cohesion Based on an assessment of the important community resources and interviews with community members during the Community Impact Assessment, none of the alternatives would cause a major disruption to community cohesion.  See Exhibit 19. Points of Interest. No community resources would be more difficult to reach or become over utilized.  Regardless of the alternative chosen, the origins and destinations of most travelers would remain similar to existing conditions.  Residents located on existing US-95 would still be able to use the existing US-95 loop but traffic volumes would be reduced 95 to 97 percent compared to existing conditions.  Some backtracking may be necessary at the northern end of the project to reach businesses on existing US-95; however, it would be offset by a reduction in waiting time to enter the highway. All of the Action Alternatives would provide sidewalks and shoulders that would improve community cohesion in the northern end of the project.  4.1.2 Economic Effects The majority of the businesses located in the study area are in the northern project limits near Moscow. The existing commercial development south of Palouse River Drive is comprised of a mix of construction, transportation, fabrication, and specialty retail establishments (e.g., building supplier, hair salon).  These are businesses that do not typically rely heavily on high traffic volumes and drive up customers. The No Action, Modified W-4 and E-2 alternatives would have no right-of-way impacts or potential impacts to businesses. The C-3 Alternative has businesses located along it and eight would be potentially impacted by the road widening; a cabinet shop, RV park, Singar Inc. and some home based businesses. Visibility and access to some existing businesses could change as a result of the Modified W-4 and E-2 Alternatives in the current US-95 corridor south of Moscow for regional traffic because the Modified W-4 and E-2 Alternatives would be realigned.  This could adversely affect businesses, particularly the retail businesses that rely, at least in part, on traffic passing through the area. However, the remaining US-95 loop may be turned over to the NLHD and used for local circulation, therefore businesses could still be visible but to a smaller volume of motorists. See Table 43. Business Effects. Table	  43.	  Business	  Effects Alternative  Business Impacts  Additional Businesses Potentially impacted  No Action    Modified W-‐4  0  0  C-‐3  0  8  E-‐2  0  0  Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 157 Environmental Consequences The indirect effects of the alternatives on businesses are discussed in Chapter 6, Indirect and Cumulative Effects. The majority of the right-of-way required for each of the alternatives is agricultural land.  The effects to farmland production are summarized in Section 4.3, Farmland Effects.  The Uniform Relocation Act also provides compensation and equitable treatment for acquisition of agricultural land. 4.1.3 Environmental Justice	  Effects Minority Populations While there are minorities in the study area there are no distinguishable minority populations.  Therefore, none of the alternatives would result in a disproportionately high or adverse effect to minority populations. Low-Income Populations There are three mobile home parks identified within the study area that may provide a source of low-cost housing: the Hidden Village Mobile Home Park, the Benson Mobile Home Park and the Woodland Heights Mobile Home Court.  The residents living in the mobile home parks and court are not considered low-income populations. See Environmental Justice Technical Report (HDR 2005b) for details of the analysis. All of the alternatives would benefit park residents by improving the safety of US-95 and improving highway access and mobility. Construction of additional travel lanes would improve the roadway’s level of service, reducing commute times and facilitating more efficient access to services. Ingress and egress of vehicles, including emergency response units, would be enhanced by the use of a turn bay. No Action Alternative The No Action Alternative would not adversely affect the mobile home parks through residential impacts or right-of-way acquisition; however as traffic increases by the 2037 design year, the safety and capacity issues would intensify and community safety and traffic noise would increase.  See Section 4.12 Traffic Noise Effects. Modified W-4 Modified W-4 would avoid all of the mobile home parks.  One manufactured home would be impacted but it is not located within a mobile home park. Modified W-4 would benefit all park residents by improving the safety of US-95 and highway access issues. Based on the above Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 158 Environmental Consequences discussion, Modified W-4 would not cause disproportionately high and adverse effects to any low-income populations as per EO 12898. C-3 would closely follow existing US-95 near the Hidden Village and Benson Mobile Home parks.  It would impact two residences located in the Hidden Village Mobile Home Park.  Two acres of right-of-way would be required from the Hidden Village Mobile Home Park. C-3 would not cause disproportionately high and adverse effects to any low-income populations per EO 12898. E-2 (Preferred Alternative) E-2 would result in the greatest number of impacts to the mobile home parks. It would affect the eastern edge of Benson Mobile Home Park, impacting five residences and potentially impacting five additional residences. The residences are configured linearly from east to west along Eid Road. The E-2 Alternative was aligned to the far east of the mobile home parks to minimize harm and maintain community cohesion for the remaining residences. E-2 would require acquisition of 2.9 acres of the Benson Mobile Home Park.  It would include constructing a bridge structure over Eid Road, which would result in a substantial increase in noise effects to seven receptors (residences); however six of these residences are assumed to be impacted due to right-of-way acquisition and only one noise impacted receptor would remain after construction. The bridge structure and new, elevated roadway would cause high visual effects. See Section 4.11 Visual Effects and Section 4.12, Traffic Noise Effects for additional detail.  Hidden Village and Benson Park residents would still be able to use existing US-95 with similar access as existing conditions but with about 95 to 97 percent less traffic.  Access to the new US95 would be approximately one mile south of Eid Road. Shifting the E-2 Alignment further west to minimize impacts in the Benson Mobile Home Park was evaluated in the E-1 Alternative but would result in different impacts and other resource effects.  Impacts to this mobile home park could not be totally avoided.  It would adversely affect the community cohesion for the remaining residents. The E-1 Alternative that was evaluated early in the screening process was aligned across Eid Road and between Hidden Village and Benson Mobile Home parks formally differentiating the development into the two respective parks. This alignment would more directly affect Hidden Village, requiring the relocation of three residences and was not desirable to the business owner. E-1 was eliminated because it would impact four residences and one business. One of the impacts was a NRHP listed historic Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 159 Environmental Consequences site and a Section 4(f) resource. It would also directly affect two rare plant communities and would have greater wetland effects. See Chapter 2, Alternatives for additional detail. Based on interviews with the mobile home park owner and some residents in 2004 and 2011, most of the residents of the mobile home parks do not have major concerns should it be necessary to relocate.  A property management company representative with several rentals in the area stated that there are other opportunities available for displaced residents to find equitable living accommodations; however, not all of the residents feel they would be able to find equitable replacement housing as expressed during the DEIS comment period.  All relocations will be completed in accordance with the Uniform Relocation Act, which will ensure fair and equitable treatment and relocation into safe and secure housing. The residents in the mobile home park are not considered to be minority or low-income populations and there would be no disproportionately high and adverse effects to low-income or minority populations as defined by EO 12898 (HDR 2005a). 4.2 Land	  Use and	  Recreation	  Effects The alternatives would have differing effects to existing and proposed land uses.  However, all Action Alternatives would be consistent with city and county land use plans and regulations. The proposed action alternatives would intersect the existing US-95 alignment just south of Moscow, near the area where the proposed Ring Road alignments are proposed. The E-2 and W-4 alternatives would pose more challenges associated with connectivity of the proposed Ring Road alignments than the C-3 Alternative but none would conflict with or preclude construction of the Ring Road project. ITD will work closely with the City of Moscow to ensure that the design of any of the action alternatives is consistent with and does not preclude construction of the Ring Road concept regardless of which alternative is selected. The county will enforce the current zoning and land use designations regardless of which alternative is chosen.  All Action Alternatives would have Expressway Access Control that would restrict new accesses as described in FEIS Sections 2.4.2, 4.10 and Table 76. General Responses to Issues under Access.  All of the Action Alternatives would involve coordination with the City of Moscow, Latah County and university officials to identify scenic turnout locations and potential signage for the University of Idaho and Paradise Ridge.  All of the Action Alternatives would also include lane striping to accommodate bicycles and pedestrians along the roadway.  No Action Alternative The No Action Alternative would not require property acquisition and there would be no changes to land use.  However, the No Action would not address safety and capacity issues in the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 160 Environmental Consequences corridor.  Accesses onto the highway would not be limited and would continue to grow.  Therefore, the No Action would be inconsistent with the Latah County and City of Moscow Comprehensive Plans. Modified W-4 Modified W-4 would convert more highly productive farmland to other uses, which is inconsistent with Latah County’s primary land use goal of preserving productive farmland.  To promote an efficient and safe transportation system, the Latah County Comprehensive Plan requires that limits be placed on the number of access points to the highway and encourages bicycle, pedestrian, and mass-transit options. All alternatives would maintain access to Paradise Ridge and other recreational resources.  However, the accesses to different resources on existing US-95 would differ. Modified W-4 would have Expressway Access Control similar to the other Action Alternatives but would have a shorter center turn lane section than C-3, with more right in and right out turning movements which is less desirable for development. However, due to its location further west closer to planned development, development pressures are expected to be higher than the E-2 Alternative; however the Expressway Access Control will be enforced.  C-3 C-3 is viewed by the City of Moscow as the most consistent with land use goals because the areas along the existing US-95 are already established.  However, it would have a longer five-lane section with a center turn lane with more access points. The longer center turn lane could have greater development pressure; however, the Expressway Access Control will be enforced.  See the comment letter from the City of Moscow (City of Moscow 2014).  The C-3 Alternative could increase property values along its alignment; however, it would be to a lesser degree than W-4.  C-3 would present the least challenge for connectivity to the planned Ring Road Project. E-2 (Preferred Alternative) E-2 would affect the same types of land use categories as the other alternatives; but would affect more CRP land than other alternatives. It could increase property values and could have growth along its alignment. E-2 would have a shorter center turn lane section than C-3, with more right-in and right-out turning movements, which is less desirable for development. 4.3 Farmland	  Effects E-2 is expected to have less development pressure than Modified W-4 because it is located further from planned development to the west and existing development along the center corridor.  E-2 would be consistent with the City of Moscow goals for development and planned development west of US 95. However, it would have Expressway Access Control similar to the other action alternatives, which will be enforced. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 161 Environmental Consequences All of the Action Alternatives would affect both prime farmlands and farmlands of statewide importance.  See Exhibit 25. Farmland Effects and Table 44. Farmland Effects for the acreage effects to farmland classifications as a result of each alternative.  Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 162 Environmental Consequences Exhibit	  25.	  Farmland	  Effects Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 163 Environmental Consequences Table	  44.	  Farmland	  Effects Alternatives  Farmland Conversion	  acres) *  Prime	  Farmland (acres)  Farmland of Statewide	  Importance (acres)  CRP Land	  (acres)  Other** (acres)  Segmented Farms (number	  of	  farms)  Farmland Conversion	  Impact Rating (points)  No Action  0  0  0  0  0  0  N/A Modified W-‐4  171.3  49.7  117.3  9  7.0  4  190  C-‐3  101.7  25.1  69.7  9  6.9  4  188  E-‐2  158.2  50.8  94.8  43.5  12.6  4  190  * This acreage excludes the existing road right-of-ways **Other=unclassified farmland NRCS staff completed USDA Farmland Conversion Impact Rating Forms for the three Action Alternative corridors.  The form for the W-4 Alternative was updated for the Modified W-4 Alternative.  All of the Action Alternatives were determined to have a Farmland Conversion Impact Rating of greater than 160 points, which is the threshold for requiring additional measures for protection from conversion of farmland to other uses.  See Section 3.3.2 and the Farmland Technical Report for details regarding how the score was determined.  The most direct effects to farms would be the loss of farm production to transportation use for the area within each alternative’s right-of-way. See Table 44. Farmland Effects. Direct effects would also include erosion and sedimentation from cut and fills.  Construction of a highway alignment through farmland could result in farm segmentation.  It could change access to fields and require farm equipment to cross the highway in order to access the segmented farms.  It could also split farming operation into smaller, less economically feasible operations.  Effects to farm operations are shown in Exhibit 26. Farm Operation Effects. The effects of alternatives on the ecological functions of CRP land are discussed in Section 4.8 Vegetation, Fish and Wildlife Effects. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 164 Environmental Consequences Exhibit	  26.	  Farm	  Operation	  Effects Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 165 Environmental Consequences Measures that would minimize the conversion of farmland to other uses include controlling access points along US-95 and working with farmers to identify necessary field accesses and to construct farmable slopes.  See Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments under Farmland.  See Chapter 6, Indirect and Cumulative Effects for the descriptions of effects from farm segmentation and effects to farm service operations. No Action This alternative would involve only minor safety and maintenance of the existing roadway and would not result in farmland conversion, segmentation or right-of-way acquisition.  As congestion increases on the roadway, access to fields and farm related transport may become more difficult. Modified W-4 The Modified W-4 Alternative would affect the greatest number of acres of statewide important farmland and the greatest number of acres of farmed land.  The average farming operation in the Modified W-4 corridor is 882 acres. Approximately 5.6 percent of this assessment unit is CRP land. Modified W-4 would cross 11 farms, splitting four farming operations; however, this would not result in any farming operations less than 20 acres. C-3 The C-3 Corridor has the fewest acres of prime and statewide important farmland.  Approximately 8.8 percent of the land in this assessment unit is in CRP and planted with grasses. The C-3 Alternative would convert the least acres of prime farmland and farmland of statewide importance to other uses. The average farming operation in the C-3 corridor is 699 acres. C-3 would cross 13 farming operations and would split four farms.  This would create two farming operations under 20 acres. The C-3 Alternative would utilize more existing right-of-way and would convert the least amount of farmland to other uses. E-2 (Preferred Alternative) E-2 would affect slightly more prime farmland than the other Action Alternatives.  Approximately 27.7 percent of the land in the assessment unit is CRP land, primarily in the southern end of the corridor.  However, the E-2 Alternative would affect the greatest acres of actively farmed land even after the CRP land is subtracted. E-2 would affect approximately twice as much CRP land compared to the other alternatives. The average farm size along the E-2 Alternative is 636 acres.  E-2 would cross nine farming operations and would split four farms.  This would result in four farming operations less than 20 acres. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 166 Environmental Consequences 4.4 Cultural 	  Resource 	  Effects There are three sites that are eligible for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) within the APE. The No Action, C-3 and E-2 alternatives would have no effect to cultural resources.  The W-4 Alternative evaluated in the DEIS would adversely affect the Deesten/Davis farmstead.  Following the DEIS publication, the W-4 Alternative centerline was shifted approximately 120 ft east to avoid the historic farmstead.  This shifted alignment, the Modified W-4 Alternative, would have no effect to cultural resources.  See Chapter 5, Section 4(f) Evaluation for additional detail. See Appendix 1, Key Agency Correspondence and Forms. 4.5 Floodplain	  Effects Exhibit 27. Floodplain Effects displays the location of each alternative in relation to the 100-year floodplain.  None of the alternatives would be located in the regulatory floodway, which is associated with the South Fork Palouse River. All Action Alternatives would be constructed with the roadbed greater than three feet above the level of a 100-year flood event.  This will allow for a one-foot rise to the 100-year floodplain. Table 45. Floodplain Effects lists the type and amount of effects to floodplains for each alternative.  See the Floodplain Technical Report for more information. Table	  45.	  Floodplain	  Effects Alternative  100 year Floodplain Effects (acres)  Description of Effects (traverse	  or longitudinal)  No Action  0  None  Modified W-‐4  1.6  Transverse  C-‐3  1.8  Longitudinal  E-‐2  0  None  No Action The No Action Alternative would not affect floodways or 100-year floodplains as no new roadway would be constructed.  Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 167 Environmental Consequences Exhibit	  27.	  Floodplain	  Effects Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 168 Environmental Consequences Modified W-4 Modified W-4 would have a transverse encroachment upon 1.6 acres of a 100-year floodplain near the South Fork Palouse River. This is a highly modified floodplain on agricultural land with degraded floodplain functions.  It is associated with the headwaters of the South Fork Palouse River. The roadway would cross the floodplain but would be designed to hydraulically pass the 25-year storm event. This could potentially impair the hydraulic flow and floodplain functions on the east side of the roadway fill, potentially resulting in an increase of flood elevations. These risks could be minimized through the use of an oversized pipe, or pipes to accommodate flood backwater. Effects to the natural and beneficial values of the floodplain would be minimal since the area is currently used as farmland.  The affected beneficial values of the floodplain are further described in Section 4.6, Wetland and Tributary Effects and in the Wetland Delineation Technical Report. C-3 C-3 would encroach upon one 100-year floodplain on the north end of the project in a headwater associated with the South Fork Palouse River.  It would be a longitudinal encroachment of 1.8 acres, on agricultural land resulting from roadway widening.  There are a few buildings in the vicinity of the floodplain; however, it would still be considered a low risk to buildings or other structures (ITD 2012b). Effects to the natural and beneficial values of the floodplain would be minimal since the area is currently used as farmland.  The beneficial floodplain values that would be affected are discussed in Section 4.6, Wetland and Tributary Effects. E-2 (Preferred Alternative) E-2 would not encroach upon any 100-year floodplain and would be a practicable alternative to avoid floodplain effects. While Modified W-4 and C-3 would encroach upon floodplains, all roadways for any of the alternatives would be designed to pass the 25-year storm event. The roadway would be designed to be three feet higher than the flood elevation to allow for a one-foot rise in elevation. Therefore, the effects would be minimized per the requirements of EO 11988 and 23 CFR 650, Subpart A.  Measures to minimize floodplain effects have been incorporated into the project, as have measures to restore and preserve the natural and beneficial floodplain values. E-2 would be the most practicable alternative under EO 11988 since it would not encroach on floodplains and would pose the least risk to the human and natural environment. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 169 Environmental Consequences 4.6 Wetland and Tributary Effects 4.6.1 Tributary	  Effects All of the alternatives, including the No Action Alternative, could contribute transportation related pollutants to tributaries.  Accumulated pollutants from operation and maintenance would build up on impervious surfaces such as the new alignments and existing loop road then run off as stormwater during rain events. The runoff may contain; gasoline, oil, hydraulic fluids, litter, dust, salt, sand, de-icing chemicals such as magnesium chloride, and tire and brake particulates such as zinc, copper, lead and other heavy metals.  Stormwater could also contribute to increased erosion and sedimentation, increased peak flows, habitat alteration, and increased stream temperature. Stormwater is not commonly a source of bacterial pollutants or nutrients; therefore the alternatives should not contribute to increased bacteria or nutrient levels. The degradation of water quality, effects to riparian habitat and soil disturbance could adversely affect the fish and other aquatic species that utilize the streams.  Vegetation removal can increase stream temperatures and can lower the dissolved oxygen levels. Increased peak flows can increase erosion and sedimentation affecting spawning beds and fish migration.  See Exhibit 28. Tributary Effects. No Action The No Action Alternative would not result in additional tributary crossings, new impervious surfaces, channel alteration, culvert removal, vegetation removal or other associated effects.  However, the lack of formal stormwater collection and treatment along existing US-95 would continue to contribute to the degradation of water quality and could adversely affect fish and other aquatic species.  There would continue to be temporary water quality effects due to maintenance activities.  Action Alternatives The potential effects to tributaries common to all Action Alternatives include: • Increased numbers of tributary crossings and lengthening of culverts • Increased runoff due to new impervious surfaces such as roadways, parking lots or sidewalks. • Increased erosion and sedimentation due to general construction activities near tributaries (i.e., road fill or culvert installation) • Vegetation removal near tributary crossings and encroachments • Utility relocations near waterways • Placement of fill near waterways • Improved hydraulic conveyance through culverts under reconstructed roadways Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 170 Environmental Consequences Exhibit	  28.	  Tributary 	  Effects Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 171 Environmental Consequences All Action Alternatives would involve construction of temporary and permanent BMPs to ensure compliance with the CGP, TMDLs and other regulatory requirements. The TMDLs and 303(d) listings for tributaries in the project area list sediment, stream alteration and temperature as pollutants.  BMPs will be installed along the perimeter of the work area during construction and maintained throughout construction to reduce sediment from entering waterways. Turbidity testing will occur daily during in water work. Riparian areas that are disturbed will be reestablished with native vegetation that can provide shade, which could contribute to decreased downstream temperatures.  Chemicals used during construction will be stored away from waterways or will have secondary containment measures in place to minimize the potential for contamination and spills. All of the Action Alternatives would be designed to pass a 25-year storm event. Increasing the area of impervious surface and removing vegetation has the potential to increase water temperatures and lower dissolved oxygen levels, which could affect aquatic species.  The numbers of tributary crossings, channel effects, new and total impervious surface area for each alternative is shown in Table 46. Tributary Effects. Table	  46.	  Tributary 	  Effects Alternatives  Crossings (number)  Channel Effects (linear	  feet)  Impervious 	  Surface Proposed Alignments (acres)  Impervious 	  Surface Remaining Loop	  Road	  (acres)  Total Impervious Surface	  (acres)  No Action  0  0  0  21  21  Modified W-‐4  10  3,592  58  10  68  C-‐3  5  7,808  49  9  58  E-‐2  5  2,592  55  17  72  Modified W-4 Modified W-4 would have the greatest number of tributary crossings but less than half the linear feet of stream impacts than the C-3 Alternative. Modified W-4 could result in greater water quality degradation compared to C-3 and E-2 due to the greater number of crossings. There may also be a corresponding effect to the aquatic species that occur in the streams. See Section 4.8, Vegetation, Fish and Wildlife Effects. C-3 would have the same number of tributary crossings as E-2 but would affect approximately three times more linear feet of tributary channel than E-2 primarily due to the encroachment of the roadway on the sides of stream channels.  It would have the fewest acres of new impervious and total impervious surface because it would follow existing US-95 for much of the alignment. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 172 Environmental Consequences E-2 (Preferred Alternative) E-2 would have the same number of tributary crossings as C-3 but would affect approximately one-third of the length of tributary channel; therefore, E-2 would result in less removal of riparian vegetation and less erosion and sedimentation due to channel realignments and scour. This would result in fewer effects to aquatic species and water quality in the tributaries.  E-2 would affect some wetland areas that are the headwaters to the downhill tributaries or included within wetlands but are not individually classified as tributaries.  The E-2 Alternative would have the greatest acres of total impervious surface but would cross the fewest feet of stream channel. The E-2 Alternative would increase the acres of impervious surface near the headwaters and tributaries which would result in increased stormwater discharge. This could result in increased scour, erosion, sedimentation and pollutant discharge into the receiving waters. Avoidance, Minimization and Mitigation All of the Action Alternatives would impact tributaries. Culverts would be aligned to follow the natural channel of the stream or creek whenever possible and will be designed to accommodate the hydraulic flows.  Stormwater treatment will be implemented, and the SWPPP will address temporary construction measures to minimize harm. Once all practicable measures for avoidance and minimization are in place, remaining impacts will be mitigated through compensatory mitigation, which will be met through use of the Cow Creek Mitigation site, which has already been constructed.  See Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments for details. 4.6.2 Wetland Effects The FHWA requires consideration of all wetlands regardless of whether they are jurisdictional by the USACE.  The wetland effects of each alternative are shown in Table 47. Wetland Effects. Only the wetlands affected by any of the alternatives are described in this section.  See the Wetland Delineation Technical Report for information regarding all the wetlands. No Action The No Action Alternative would not directly affect wetlands. Action Alternatives The Action Alternatives would affect from 0.99 acres to 3.61 acres of 17 different wetlands.  See Table 47. Wetland Effects and Exhibit 29. Wetland Effects.  The majority of the wetlands in the project area are rated as Category III, Palustrine Emergent (PEM) wetlands.  These are typically small wetlands that have been disturbed and have low vegetative diversity compared to Category I and II wetlands. Most of the wetlands that are affected drain into either the South Fork of the Palouse River or Thorn Creek, both of which are on the 303(d) list and are waters of the US. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 173 Environmental Consequences Table	  47.	  Wetland 	  Effects Wetland  Modified W 4	  (acres)  C 3 (acres)  E 2 (acres)  PEM*  PSS**  PEM  PSS  PEM  PSS  W9  −  −  −  −  −  −  W10  0.15  −  −  −  −  −  W13  −  −  −  −  −  0.19  W20  0.36  −  −  −  −  −  W23  0.31  −  0.30  −  0.20  −  W24  0.15  −  0.16  −  −  −  W25  −  −  0.02  −  −  −  W26  −  −  0.23  −  −  −  W27  0.78  −  −  −  −  −  W28  0.04  −  0.04  −  0.04  −  W29  −  −  −  −  1.32  −  W31  0.06  −  −  −  −  −  W32  −  −  −  −  −  0.73  W35  −  −  −  −  0.75  −  W39  −  −  0.24  −  −  −  W40  −  −  −  −  0.25  −  W44  −  −  −  −  0.13  −  Subtotals  1.85  0.00  0.99  0.00  2.69  0.92  Totals  1.85  0.99  3.61  *PEM=Palustrine Emergent **PSS=Palustrine Scrub-shrub Modified W-4 The majority of the wetlands affected by the Modified W-4 Alternative drain to the South Fork of the Palouse River. The remainder drains into Thorn Creek. Wetlands help to improve the water quality of these two water bodies, which are both listed on the 303(d) list. Filling wetlands could potentially increase the amount of pollutants and sediments that reach these waters. The Modified W-4 Alternative would affect PEM wetlands all of which have been modified and are surrounded by active farming.  Modified W-4 would affect 1.79 acres of Category III wetlands and 0.06 acres of a Category IV wetland. 1.48 acres of affected wetlands scored 50 percent or higher for improving water quality.  Wetland 28, of which 0.04 is affected, scored 50 percent for wildlife habitat. Wetland 23 and Wetland 31 did not score over 50 percent in any of the three categories for wetland functions (Gilmore 2012). Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 174 Exhibit	  29.	  Wetland 	  Effects Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 175 Environmental Consequences Most of the wetland effects are the result of the new alignment crossing wetlands. Wetland 23 would have 0.31 acres of fill from widening and straightening the road on its existing alignment. The Modified W-4 would affect more wetland acres than C-3 but less than E-2. The C-3 Alternative would have the least effects to wetlands out of the Action Alternatives. All six of the wetlands affected are Category III PEM wetlands and are either farmed or surrounded by farmland. Four of the affected wetlands (0.67 acres) scored a 50 percent or higher rating for improving water quality.  There would be 0.04 acres of effects to Wetland 28 that scored 50 percent for wildlife habitat.   The wetlands affected by the C-3 Alternative are located near the existing highway and currently receive pollutants from road runoff. Four of the affected wetlands drain to the South Fork of the Palouse River.  The remainder drains to Thorn Creek. The wetland effects would result from widening US-95 along its current alignment.   E-2 (Preferred Alternative) Most of the wetlands affected by this alternative are Category III PEM wetlands. The remainder of the effect is to palustrine scrub-shrub (PSS) wetlands surrounded by farming activities. Approximately half of the wetlands affected by E-2 are associated with man-made ponds. Five of the affected wetlands (3.03 acres of impact) scored 50 percent or higher for improving water quality functions.  Only one of the affected wetlands (0.04 acres of impact) scored a 50 percent or higher for improving habitat functions.  Two of the affected wetlands are PSS (13 and 32) with more diverse structure and wildlife habitat function compared to the PEM wetlands.  These would be more difficult to replace compared to the PEM wetlands because woody vegetation takes longer to establish than emergent vegetation. However, because the proposed wetland mitigation involves applying mitigation credit from the Cow Creek Mitigation Area, which is already established and fully functioning, there would be no temporal loss. Two of the wetlands affected drain to Thorn Creek and five drain to the South Fork of the Palouse River.  One does not appear to have surface connection to other wetlands or tributaries.  Most of the effects would be due to new sections of alignment. These wetlands are already disturbed and many of them have been altered or artificially created through the addition of ponds.  The E-2 Alternative would affect more wetlands that are functioning higher for habitat. The C-3 Alternative would have the least effect to wetlands in terms of acreage, function and value. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 176 Environmental Consequences Executive Order 11990 Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines require all appropriate and practicable steps be taken to minimize adverse effects to the aquatic ecosystem.  EO 11990, Protection of Wetlands states that wetlands may not be impacted unless there is no feasible or practical alternative to the proposed construction. All practical measures to minimize harm must be considered. The E-2 Alternative, FHWA’s and ITD’s Preferred Alternative, would have 3.61 acres of unavoidable wetland impacts. This evaluation of compliance with EO 11990 is for the Preferred Alternative (E-2).  During the initial screening of alternatives process, the E-1 and E-3 alternatives which had greater wetland impacts compared to the E-2 Alternative, were eliminated from further consideration. Compared to the action alternatives evaluated in the DEIS, the C-3 alternative would have the least impact and the E-2 Alternative would have the greatest impact. While the E-2 Alternative would have 2.62 acres more impact on wetlands compared to the C-3 Alternative, it would result in 43 fewer projected total crashes and nine fewer fatal and injury crashes between 2017 and 2036. This would have a significant benefit to the community and the travelling public and would best meet the project purpose and need. Before final design, ITD will evaluate the use of crossings and other engineering solutions at the PSS wetlands to minimize harm to the more diverse wetlands and to help facilitate wildlife movement through the riparian area. This may also include evaluating slope angles to minimize wetland fill in a manner that still meets safety standards.  Providing adequate temporary and permanent stormwater BMPs to comply with the CGP, TMDLs and the NPDES requirements will further minimize effects to wetlands and tributaries.  Culverts in drainages will be oversized as possible to allow continued hydrological connectivity under the roadway and small mammal movement. Where practicable, trees and shrubs will be salvaged for reuse. BMPs, minimization measures and compensatory wetland mitigation measures are further discussed in Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments. FHWA requires replacement of lost functions and values for all impacted wetlands, including wetlands non-jurisdictional by the USACE. Wetland impacts that cannot be avoided or minimized further will be mitigated through a compensatory mitigation process. Permitting will be completed in accordance with Section 404 of the CWA. Mitigation will be implemented in accordance with 33 CFR 332 Compensatory Mitigation for Losses of Aquatic Resources and will replace any lost functions and values. A watershed approach will be used to identify compensatory mitigation for affected wetlands and tributaries. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 177 Environmental Consequences Within the project vicinity the Cow Creek Mitigation Area has already been constructed and will compensate for effects from this and other ITD projects. The Cow Creek Wetland Mitigation Area was constructed with extra mitigation capacity in 2005 as part of the US-95, Top of Lewiston Hill to Genesee and Genesee to Thorn Creek Highway projects and is in the same watershed as the impacts. Because the site is already constructed and successfully functioning, there would be no temporal loss. The remaining credit has been approved by the USACE to compensate for the wetland impacts for the action alternatives for this project. See Appendix 1, Key Agency Correspondence. The Cow Creek Wetland Mitigation Area included excavation, grading, irrigation, well drilling, placing brush piles, large woody debris, nest boxes, plantings for the mitigation area and other habitat features. Plantings consisted of 1,400 trees, 20,500 shrubs, 4,400 willow stakes, and 34,500 wetland species plugs.  Unsuccessful plants were replaced and emergent vegetation was over-seeded with wetland mix as necessary. The site was monitored and the mitigation was considered by the USACE to be successfully completed with 80 percent plant survival and site stabilization after three years. If an action alternative is selected, and if during the design process, more wetland is impacted than is stated in the FEIS, then additional wetland mitigation will be required. This requirement could be met by purchasing credits from the Valencia Wetland Mitigation Bank, which services the project area. The bank was assessed and was given credits based on functional units. With the USACE approval, Valencia can provide mitigation in a cost effective manner and will ensure that all of the affected functions and values are successfully mitigated because the functions and values have already been successfully established.  This method would also have no temporal loss of wetland functions and values. The Valencia Wetland Mitigation Bank is approved to provide the following mitigation: • Listed/Proposed Threatened and Endangered Species • Idaho Natural Heritage Species Habitat • Wildlife Habitat • General Fish/Aquatic Habitat • Flood Attenuation • Short and Long Term Surface Water Storage • Sediment/Nutrient/Toxicant Removal • Sediment/Shoreline Stabilization • Production Export/Food Chain Support • Groundwater Discharge/Recharge • Uniqueness • Recreational/Education Potential Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 178 Environmental Consequences Other wetland mitigation measures are included in Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments. Based upon the above considerations, and in consideration of the proposed mitigation, it is determined that there is no practicable alternative that avoids all construction in wetlands and tributaries and that the proposed action includes all practicable measures to minimize harm to wetlands and tributaries which may result from such use. 4.7 Groundwater Effects Potential transportation related effects to groundwater could include: • Slower recharge rates due to increased impervious surface areas (such as roadways, parking lots or sidewalks) • Hazardous material spills from the travelling public or construction equipment • Accidental spills during utility relocation • Discharge of untreated stormwater into underground injection wells • Contamination during well decommissioning • Altering groundwater discharge and recharge areas The project is located over the Wanapam and Grand Ronde aquifers, which are overlain by rich loess soils with high water holding capacity.  The potential effects of the alternatives to groundwater due to hazardous material sites and hazardous material handling are discussed in Section 4.14 Hazardous Materials Effects. A Hydrogeologic Analysis was prepared after the DEIS hearing to address concerns regarding possible groundwater impacts from construction of the alternatives (Ralston 2014).  The No Action Alternative would continue to use existing US-95, which has no formal stormwater treatment areas.  It would not increase impervious surface but untreated stormwater would continue to flow to tributaries and groundwater.  The potential alternatives’ impacts to groundwater are very low.  All Action Alternatives would increase impervious surfaces that could contain highway related pollutants that could drain to groundwater; however, the amount of new impervious surface is a small percentage of the total recharge area. Snow accumulated along the roadway and road runoff could recharge to groundwater.  The amount of this increase will be very small and is balanced by a decrease in recharge from the paved areas.  In addition, the aquifers used for water supplies are generally more than 100 ft below the surface with a very limited hydraulic connection to the surface waters. The surface water crossings will be through culverts and bridges (Ralston 2014). Most of the road alignments are underlain by granitic or metamorphic rock and any discharge to groundwater in these areas would occur in topographically low areas such as streams. The Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 179 Environmental Consequences highway in these areas would be elevated on fill or bridges and surface water would flow through culverts or under the bridges.  Stormwater would be discharged to the road fill, which would treat the stormwater and minimize potential water quality impacts. The emergence of seeps could shift from under the fill to the toe of the roadway fill (Ralston 2014). See Section 4.6.1, Tributary Effects for a description of transportation related effects.  All Action Alternatives would be designed and constructed to comply with the CGP and TMDLs. A SWPPP that will identify temporary and permanent BMPs such as grassy swales or check-dams will be prepared and implemented.  With the implementation of these BMPs, there would be a low risk of aquifer contamination from stormwater. 4.7.1 Affected Wells There are numerous domestic and irrigation wells within the project area. Most of these wells exceed 100 feet in depth and obtain water from a producing zone at the bottom of the well.  Wells that are completed in basalt are located mostly at the north end of the project.  These wells obtain water from the Wanapum Formation, which hosts the upper aquifer in the Moscow area. The No Action Alternative would not require right-of-way acquisition or construction; therefore, it would not affect wells within the project area. The Modified W-4 and E-2 alternatives would affect wells, all of which are domestic. Both wells impacted by the E-2 Alternative are located along Eid Road but neither would be replaced because the residences would be impacted and the well would not be replaced.  The well impacted by the Modified W-4 Alternative would be replaced.  Well relocations may cause a short-term interruption of water service during construction.  Drinking water may be temporarily affected by suspended sediments caused by well drilling. Exhibit 30. Affected Wells and Table 48. Affected Wells show the known or registered wells that would be affected by each alternative. See Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments. Table	  48.	  Affected	  Wells Alternatives  Affected	  Domestic Wells  Domestic Wells within 300	  ft  No Action  0  10  Modified W-‐4  1  3  C-‐3  0  6  E-‐2  2  5  Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 180 Environmental Consequences Exhibit	  30.	  Affected	  Wells Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 181 Environmental Consequences 4.8 Vegetation, Fish and Wildlife	  Effects 4.8.1 Vegetation	  and	  Habitat Effects All of the Action Alternatives would pass through similar agricultural or rural residential lands, which constitute low to marginal quality wildlife habitat.  See Table 49. Habitat Type Effects for acres of agricultural land.  The Action Alternatives also transect habitat types that support a greater diversity of vegetation, fish and wildlife species including wetlands, riparian areas, pine stands, Palouse remnants and areas with water sources. A pine stand that provides potential habitat for long-eared myotis and habitat for pygmy nuthatch would be affected by the E-2 Alternative. The ungulate impact area includes the impacts to this pine stand. See Table 49. Habitat Type Effects. Table	  49.	  Habitat	  Type 	  Effects	  Alternative  Agricultural/ Grassland (acres)*  Pine	  Stands (acres)  Ungulate	  Impact Area (acres)**  New Right of Way (acres)  No Action  0  0  0  0  Modified W-‐4  162  0  0  206  C-‐3  101  0  0  154  E-‐2  158  3.9  4.4  207  *Source: (Haagen 2006) **Source: (Melquist 2005a) Pine Stand Effects The No Action, Modified W-4 and C-3 alternatives would not affect pine stands that could provide potential nesting habitat for pygmy nuthatch, long-eared myotis, northern alligator lizard or other species.  The E-2 Alternative would affect a pine stand. Melquist in his report stated that suitable habitat for pygmy nuthatch is limited along the edge of the eastern corridor.  He identified pine stands along the project corridor that could offer suitable pygmy nuthatch habitat.  One stand is located at the lower end of a forested draw with up to 60 mature ponderos pine trees and would not be affected by the action alternatives. A pine stand and woodlot owned by the Dumroese family has approximately ten snags and an estimated four mature pine trees with dead tops. This pine stand is small and isolated from the larger pine stand that occurs on Paradise Ridge. It offers potential habitat for long-eared myotis, northern alligator lizard and other species.  Pygmy nuthatches are reported to utilize this pine stand (Melquist 2005b). The E-2 Alternative would affect 3.9 acres of this pine stand leaving approximately six acres of pine stand on the west side of the highway and approximately 20 acres of pine stand on the east Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 182 Environmental Consequences side of the highway. The remainders of the pine stand could still be utilized by pygmy nuthatch but use could be reduced due to fragmentation and other factors. See Section 6.1 Indirect Effects under Fragmentation.  Pygmy nuthatch territory size may range from approximately one to 20 acres (0.54 to 8.15 ha) (Norris 1958, Balda 1967, Storer 1977).  Territory size varies with the number of nuthatches present, pine tree density, and availability of snags or nest boxes (Ghalambor 2006). Territory size on heavily logged plots versus thinned plots (Braun and Balda 1988a) and on plots with nest boxes in snag-poor habitats is significantly larger (Brawn and Balda 1988a, Bock and Fleck 1995). While Melquist stated there would be no direct impact to long-eared myotis or pygmy nuthatch due to construction of any of the alternatives, the loss of habitat is expected to result in indirect impacts to resident populations. (Melquist 2005b). See Section 6.1 Indirect Effects. Melquist identified other suitable habitat nearby at Paradise Ridge and throughout Northern Idaho (Melquist 2005b). In his report Melquist states that other pygmy nuthatch suitable habitat is located near the Dumroese property, near the Robinson Lake Park in Moscow, Idler’s Rest and most of the areas of the Palouse that still have ponderosa pine (Melquist 2005b; figure 3).  The WCS (IDFG 2005) generally describes the Palouse Prairie Ecosystem and provides mapping of dry conifer forest, listing it as habitat for many species including pygmy nuthatch and northern alligator lizard.  Dry conifer forest is shown to cover approximately 42 percent of the Palouse Prairie Ecosystem (IDFG 2005). The pygmy nuthatch is protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and no active nest sites can be destroyed or removed. Tree removal would occur outside of the nesting season (April 1 to August 1) to avoid impacts to nesting birds. Measures that would mitigate for the loss of the pine stand include adding nest boxes (Melquist 2005b) as described in Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments. Riparian Habitat Effects The No Action Alternative would not directly affect any riparian habitat.  All of the action alternatives would cross tributaries; however, crossings would be designed to allow for hydraulic flow to continue under the roadway.  Crossings may include, bottomless box culverts, culverts placed at-grade or use of stream simulation designs. Where practicable, provisions for terrestrial species movement would be incorporated into the crossing design. See Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments.  C-3 would affect the greatest length of tributaries, whereas the E-2 alternative would affect the least.  See Section 4.6, Wetland and Tributary Effects for additional detail.  See the Wildlife Technical Reports for additional detail. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 183 Environmental Consequences Palouse Remnant Effects The No Action Alternative would not involve road realignment, major soil disturbing activities or removal of existing vegetation, and therefore would not directly affect the Palouse remnants.  The Modified W-4, C-3 and E-2 alternatives would not directly affect Palouse remnants. See Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments for mitigation measures.  Indirect effects are discussed in Chapter 6, Indirect and Cumulative Effects. Matrix Habitat Effects The action alternatives would all bisect agricultural land and CRP land that can be considered as matrix habitat. These, while non-native, may still provide some level of function for wildlife and pollinators. The greater impacts to CRP lands by the E-2 alternative could affect bees, grassland birds, and other wildlife more than the Modified W-4 and C-3 alternatives; however, bees and other species would also utilize roadside weeds, Palouse remnants and the surrounding agricultural matrices.  The greater proximity of the E-2 Alternative to Palouse remnants could adversely affect the native plants utilized by bumblebees but would be minimized through the implementation of mitigation measures including weed control as described in Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 184 Environmental Consequences Exhibit	  31.	  Habitat	  Feature	  Effects Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 185 Environmental Consequences Exhibit	  32.	  Farmed	  Land	  on	  the	  E-‐2	  Alignment Palouse Restoration Projects Effects The No Action, Modified W-4 and C-3 alternatives would not directly affect planned or current restoration projects.  The E-2 Alternative would directly affect a property with an easement for restoration activities under the USFWS Partners Program. However, the section of the property that would be affected is an actively producing wheat field and any on-going or planned restoration activities are approximately 200 feet from the alignment.  Those restoration activities include ecological weed control (hand-pulling weeds) and planting Spalding’s catchfly.  While the E-2 Alternative would not directly affect the areas where restoration activities are occurring or are planned; it would bring the roadway closer to the projects compared to the other alternatives. See Exhibit 33. Planned and Current Restoration Projects. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 186 Environmental Consequences Exhibit	  33.	  Planned	  and	  Current	  Restoration	  Projects	  Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 187 Environmental Consequences ITD and FHWA recognize that there has been substantial agency and community involvement in restoration activities in the area (See Exhibit 33. Planned and Current Restoration Projects) and while none of the alternatives directly affect the projects, all could increase weed dispersal to these areas. FHWA and ITD have worked with the resource agencies involved in the restoration activities to prioritize projects on land furthest from the alignments. Indirect and cumulative effects to Palouse Restoration Projects are described in Chapter 6, Indirect and Cumulative Effects. Rare Plant Effects None of the alternatives would directly affect any known occurrences or populations of rare plants.  Indirect and cumulative effects are discussed in Chapter 6, Indirect and Cumulative Effects. Invasive Plant Effects Additional information regarding weed species, weed dispersal and potential effects have been incorporated from the DEIS Technical Report titled A Scientific Evaluation for Noxious and Invasive Weeds of the Highway 95 Construction Project between Uniontown Cutoff and Moscow (Lass & Prather 2007) and the Biological Evaluation of Plant Species and Communities of Conservation Concern in the US Highway 95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow Project Area (Litchardt 2005). Non-native invasive species, or weeds, may establish in the road right-of-way resulting in direct effects and may potentially continue to spread outside of the right-of-way in later years resulting in indirect effects.  These effects could occur for any of the alternatives.  Weeds could diminish habitat quality and adversely affect biodiversity (Parker et al. 1993) by altering the native plant communities. Weeds are already present in the project area and are predicted to spread as a result of soil disturbance and vehicular travel through the corridor. The potential for weeds to move from the roadside into a remnant will be dependent on their dispersal methods, distance to the remnant, and the surrounding land use. Common weed sources include stockpiled material, staging areas, imported soils, construction equipment, and workers. Alignments with steep road cuts and fills with south and west aspects will be drier sites and it will be difficult to establish native vegetation resulting in more open spaces for infestation. Section 6.1 Indirect and Cumulative Effects provides more information regarding indirect and cumulative effects due to weed dispersal. In May 2014, ITD and IDFG met to further discuss impacts and agreed on suitable mitigation measures for vegetation, fish and wildlife effects, which have been added to Chapter 9, Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 188 Environmental Consequences Environmental Commitments.  ITD will continue to work with IDFG before final design to further refine the mitigation measures and help ensure their successful implementation. 4.8.2 Wildlife Species Effects To assess the relative effects of the alternatives to all vegetation, fish and wildlife species would be difficult.  IDFG prepared an assessment of project effects to Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SCGN) that were likely to be found in the project area which were identified through a filtering process and determined to be representative of wildlife species in the area.  The rationale for identifying these species for evaluation is described in Section 3.8.2 Methodology and the rationale for making the effect determinations are explained in the General Wildlife Assessment (IDFG 2006).  For each of the representative species, project effects were based on occurrence of the species in the project area and the presence of suitable habitat in the area. If the species were not known to occur in the project area and no suitable habitat was present for the species, then it was determined the alternatives would not affect the species.  However, if suitable habitat for the species was present, regardless of whether there were known or recorded occurrences, the project was assumed to affect the species (IDFG 2006). IDFG also assumed that all new right-of-way required by each alternative was suitable habitat for those species affected; therefore, the relative difference in right-of-way required for each alternative relates to the relative effects to the species.  Based on this method, the E-2 Alternative would have the greatest effects to wildlife and would impact Northern alligator lizard, Pygmy nuthatch and Long-eared myotis because it would affect a pine stands that is considered suitable habitat for these species, whereas the other alternatives would avoid the pine stand. The C-3 Alternative would have the least effect to the wildlife because it would require the least amount of new right-of-way. Table	  50.	  Representative	  Wildlife	  Species	  Effects − Species  Potential Species Effects  No Action  Modified W 4  C 3  E 2  Woodhouse’s toad  No Impact  No Impact  No Impact  No Impact  Mountain quail  No Impact  No Impact  No Impact  No Impact  Peregrine	  falcon  No Impact  No Impact  No Impact  No Impact  Yellow-‐billed	  cuckoo	   No Impact  No Impact  No Impact  No Impact  Townsend’s big-‐eared bat  No Impact  No Impact  No Impact  No Impact  Nimapuna tigersnail  No Impact  No Impact  No Impact  No Impact  Pale	  jumping-‐slug  No Impact  No Impact  No Impact  No Impact  Fir pinwheel  No Impact  No Impact  No Impact  No Impact  Salmon coil  No Impact  No Impact  No Impact  No Impact  Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 189 Environmental Consequences − Species  Potential Species Effects  Lyre	  mantleslug	   No Impact  No Impact  No Impact  No Impact  Dry land forest snail  No Impact  No Impact  No Impact  No Impact  Oregonian (2 species)  No Impact  No Impact  No Impact  No Impact  Humped coin  No Impact  No Impact  No Impact  No Impact  Giant Palouse earthworm  No Impact  No Impact  No Impact  No Impact  Northern alligator lizard  No Impact  No Impact  No Impact  Potential Impact  Ring-‐necked	  snake  No Impact  Potential Impact  Potential Impact  Potential Impact  Swainson’s hawk  No Impact  Potential Impact  Potential Impact  Potential Impact  Long-‐billed	  curlew  No Impact  Potential Impact  Potential Impact  Potential Impact  Short-‐eared owl  No Impact  Potential Impact  Potential Impact  Potential Impact  Grasshopper sparrow  No Impact  Potential Impact  Potential Impact  Potential Impact  Pygmy nuthatch  No Impact  No Impact  No Impact  Potential Impact  Long	  eared myotis  No Impact  No Impact  No Impact  Potential Impact  California myotis  No Impact  Potential Impact  Potential Impact  Potential Impact  Stonefly (5	  species)  No Impact  Potential Impact  Potential Impact  Potential Impact  Mayfly (2 species)  No Impact  Potential Impact  Potential Impact  Potential Impact  Spur-‐throated grasshopper	  (2 species)	   No Impact  Potential Impact  Potential Impact  Potential Impact  Other Species Considered and Habitat Effects No Action The No Action Alternative would have no direct effect to vegetation and wildlife habitat. Wildlife collisions would continue to climb with increased traffic volumes. Modified W-4 Modified W-4 would run primarily through agricultural land that functions as foraging and breeding habitat for many wildlife species including the Giant Palouse earthworm. The Modified W-4 Alternative would convert the greatest amount of farmland that functions as foraging and breeding habitat for many wildlife species.  It would avoid the pine stands.  Modified W-4 would cross 10 tributaries that provide habitat for resident wildlife species. The C-3 Alternative would pass through some agricultural areas including potential habitat for the giant Palouse earthworm but would utilize much of the existing US-95 roadway. C-3 would result in the fewest acres of conversion of farmland that currently functions as foraging and breeding habitat for many wildlife species. It would avoid the pine stands. The C-3 Alternative would cross five tributaries that possess habitat for resident wildlife species. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 190 Environmental Consequences E-2 (Preferred Alternative) The E-2 Alternative would pass through cultivated agricultural lands and CRP lands located west of Paradise Ridge. The farmland along E-2 is considered more suitable for ungulates because of nearby cover and water sources.  See Exhibit 32. Farmed Land on the E-2 Alignment.  It would not disturb the large stands of forested habitat on Paradise Ridge but is closer to Paradise Ridge than the other alternatives. It would, however affect a planted pine stand near Eid Road that could provide suitable habitat for representative wildlife species including the northern alligator lizard and long-eared myotis and provides habitat for pygmy nuthatch. See Section 4.8 under Pine Stand Effects.  It may also provide habitat for the giant Palouse earthworm. The E-2 alternative would cross fewer tributaries compared to the Modified W-4 Alternative, however; the tributaries that are affected by E-2 have greater habitat value for resident wildlife species than tributaries that are affected by either the Modified W-4 or C-3 alternatives. Ungulate Effects A study titled Assessment of Potential Big Game Impacts and Mitigation Associated with Highway Alternatives from Thorncreek Road to Moscow (Sawyer 2010) evaluated the ungulate studies prepared for the project by Melquist and Ruediger.  The study summarized the conclusions regarding quality of ungulate habitat in the project area, the potential effects of the alternatives to those habitats, and provided an independent assessment of potential impacts. The report found that the Melquist and Ruediger reports were consistent regarding general habitat quality and the relative alternatives' effects to habitat.  It also made an independent recommendation for ungulate mitigation.  See Table 51. Ungulate Habitat Effects.  The studies concluded that none of the Action Alternatives would bisect important ungulate habitat or known migration corridors and that population-level effects from highway construction were unlikely.  Table	  51.	  Ungulate	  Habitat	  Effects Alternative  Habitat Quality*  Moose  Elk  White-‐tail deer  No Action  None  None  None  Modified W-‐4  Poor  Poor  Marginal  C-‐3  Poor  Poor  Marginal  E-‐2  Marginal  Marginal  Moderate  Source: (Sawyer 2010) *Ungulate habitat on scale of increasing value is: none, poor, marginal, moderate and high. Ungulates utilize and move to all types of habitat but frequently utilize areas with shelter and cover, riparian areas, and areas with water sources. Ungulates have been sighted and utilize habitat in the project area; however, only poor to moderate quality ungulate habitat is present.  The primary ungulate habitat affected by all alternatives is cultivated agricultural land, much of which is presently enrolled in the CRP; however, CRP enrollment is voluntary and landowners may withdraw at any time. It offers no special or long-term protection from development. See Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 191 Environmental Consequences Section 4.10 Transportation and the Safety Technical Report for information regarding wildlife collision data factors. Future effects to agricultural lands and wildlife habitat due to development are further discussed in Chapter 6, Indirect and Cumulative Effects.  No Action The No Action Alternative would not directly affect ungulate habitat.  It could however, result in more wildlife collisions due to an increase in projected traffic volumes on US-95 by the 2037 design year. The substandard curves, steep grades and narrow typical section would not be improved making it difficult to spot and avoid wildlife.  The projected increase in traffic and the density of traffic flow could result in greater numbers of wildlife collisions on this segment of US-95.  The No Action Alternative would not meet the project purpose and need. For the Action Alternatives, realigning a highway to an area where no road currently exists and clearing vegetation near the roadway would result in direct habitat loss, a visual change to the area and may displace wildlife less adaptable to human modification, fragmentation and high levels of human use such as elk and moose (Ruediger 2007). For all of the alternatives, clearing vegetation will be limited to the project right-of-way.  Noise and increased human presence could displace ungulates in the area during construction and roadway operation. The Action Alternatives could result in effects to poor to moderate quality ungulate habitat. See the Wildlife Technical Reports for additional detail regarding the degrees of effects and the differing quality of the affected habitat. A straighter roadway alignment, additional lanes and a wider roadway would improve the visibility of wildlife crossing the roadway, and would improve the ability of the driver to avoid and recover from potential wildlife collisions. Safety related to wildlife was evaluated as part of the Safety Analysis Technical Report (ITD 2013, ITD 2015b) and is discussed further in Section 4.10.1 under Wildlife-Related Safety.  Modified W-4 Modified W-4 would pass through primarily agricultural land without suitable cover near foraging areas.  Therefore, it is considered poor habitat for elk and moose.  This alternative would also pass through marginal white-tail deer habitat.  C-3 would pass through poor habitat for elk and moose.  It would pass through marginal whitetail deer habitat.  The C-3 would bring the curves and grade to AASHTO standards and would improve sight distance over existing conditions. (ITD 2013 pg 12).  Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 192 Environmental Consequences E-2 (Preferred Alternative) E-2 would pass through marginal habitat for elk and moose located in the southern half of the study area, primarily on CRP land and farmed fields. Moderate white-tail deer habitat would also be affected.  E-2 would be aligned between an existing man-made farm pond that may be used by wildlife, and Paradise Ridge. E-2 could affect the movement of moose and elk that currently travel between the pond and Paradise Ridge. Elk tend to stay closer to security and escape cover than deer. A pine stand located in the southern half of the project may be used for cover by ungulates as they forage in the nearby agricultural fields.  The E-2 Alternative would affect 3.9 acres of the pine stand as well as surrounding agricultural land that is used for foraging which would affect elk.  A total of 4.4 acres of suitable ungulate habitat that was identified as the Ungulate Impact Area by Melquist in 2005 would be affected by the E-2 Alternative (Melquist 2005a). The E-2 Alternative posed the largest concern for ungulates due to its proximity to small patches of native habitats not yet converted to agriculture (i.e., pine stands and Palouse remnants) (Sawyer 2010).  More suitable habitat for ungulates is available in the surrounding areas east of Paradise Ridge and in the gullies further west in Washington State (Ruediger 2007).  Regionally and statewide, the area is considered to have low ungulate populations (Ruediger 2007) and low to moderate quality ungulate habitat (Sawyer 2010). While the E-2 Alternative would pass through approximately 1.98 miles of ungulate impact area; the sight distance will be greater on the E-2 Alternative because the length and radius of horizontal curvature is greater than the other action alternatives.  Greater sight distance may reduce the crash potential of the wild animal crashes of the E-2 Alternative and offset the additional wild animal crash potential caused from the E-2 Alternative being in an ungulate impact area.  (ITD 2015 pg. 12). See Table 51. Ungulate Habitat Effects for a summary of the alternatives’ effects to ungulates. See the Wildlife Technical Reports for additional detail. 4.9 Threatened	  and	  Endangered	  Species Effects This section summarizes the effects of the alternatives on federally listed threatened and endangered species and critical habitat.  A discussion of federal candidate and proposed species is included in 3.8, Vegetation, Fish and Wildlife and 4.8, Vegetation, Fish and Wildlife Effects. No Action. The No Action Alternative would not involve right-of-way acquisitions, major construction or a large amount of soil disturbance; therefore, it would have no effect to threatened or endangered species and designated critical habitat.  The higher projected traffic volumes and the density of traffic flow could result in greater numbers of wildlife collisions on this segment of US-95. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 193 Environmental Consequences Modified W-4, C-3 and E-2 (Preferred Alternative).  The Action Alternatives would result in no effect to Canada lynx, water howellia, steelhead trout and its designated critical habitat.  Modified W-4, C-3 and E-2 may affect but are not likely to adversely affect Spalding’s catchfly due to indirect effects.  The W-4 and Modified W-4 Alternative represent only a slight shift and would not differ in effects to the evaluated species or their habitats; therefore the effect determination for the W-4 Alternative is determined to be valid for the Modified W-4 Alternative.  See Table 52. Threatened and Endangered Species Effects and Section 6.1 Indirect Effects.  See the Biological Assessment Technical Report (ITD 2007a) for details.  Table	  52.	  Threatened 	  and 	  Endangered 	  Species	  Effects Common	  Name  Scientific Name  Federal Status  Action	  Alternatives’ Effects Determination  Canada lynx  Lynx	  Canadensis  Listed Threatened  No Effect  Spalding’s catchfly  Silene	  spaldingii  Listed Threatened  Not Likely to Adversely Affect (NLAA)  Water howellia  Howellia aquatilis  Listed Threatened  No Effect  Steelhead trout  Oncorhynchus mykiss  Listed Threatened  No Effect  Steelhead trout Critical Habitat  Oncorhynchus mykiss  Designated Critical Habitat  No Effect  Canada Lynx The Action Area is located on agricultural land less than 3,000 feet in elevation and is located greater than 20 miles from the nearest potential Lynx Analysis Unit (LAU) (i.e., the Umatilla or Saint Joseph National Forests). Haul roads, staging areas, waste sites, material sources and stockpile sites would not be located within an LAU. The project would have no effect on Canada lynx. Spalding’s catchfly A population of Spalding’s Catchfly was discovered within the project area between Alternatives Modified W-4 and C-3 near Clyde Hill; however, no plants are in the footprint of the alternatives.  All of the alternatives have Palouse remnants that occur within a mile of the proposed alignment, which could be indirectly affected.  This resulted in a determination that all of the Action Alternatives may affect but are not likely to adversely affect Spalding’s Catchfly as a result of indirect effects. The alternatives could increase weed dispersal to private lands that have been identified as high priority areas for Palouse prairie restoration and a key conservation area for Spalding’s Catchfly establishment; however, the alignments would not go through any portion of the properties for which restoration activities are ongoing or planned.  In addition, FHWA, ITD, USFWS, NRCS and the Latah County Conservation District have collaborated and future restoration activities Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 194 Environmental Consequences closer to Paradise Ridge and further from the proposed alternatives will be prioritized to minimize the possibility for weed infestation.  See Chapter 6, Indirect and Cumulative Effects regarding potential weed dispersal. See the Biological Assessment Technical Report for additional details.   Water howellia Water howellia occurs in seasonal ponds, often associated with potholes.  The only potentially suitable habitat for water howellia in the action area would be the floodplain of the South Fork Palouse River. However, a field survey revealed that the floodplain is under cultivation, channelized and dominated by reed canarygrass, a non-native invasive weed; therefore, the site is not suitable for water howellia.  The project would have no effect to water howellia. Steelhead Trout and Designated Critical Habitat  No steelhead trout or designated or proposed critical habitat for steelhead trout is within the action area. Therefore, this project would have no effect to steelhead trout or its designated critical habitat. 4.10 Transportation	  Effects 4.10.1 Public Safety A safety analysis was completed using the First Edition of the AASHTO Highway Safety Manual (ITD 2012a). The results show that all three Action Alternatives will be safer than the existing alignment and the No Action Alternative.  The results also show that the E-2 Alternative would be the safest proposed alignment for total crashes, as well as total injury related crashes and fatalities. The Safety Analysis was revised in 2013 to include predicted crashes on the remaining US-95 loop that may be turned over to the NLHD and used for local circulation.  An addendum to the Safety Analysis (2013) was prepared to evaluate the Modified W-4 (2015b).  Table 53. Projected Crashes for Proposed Alternatives and Remaining US-95 Loop shows the fatal and injury and total crashes in 2017 for each alternative and for 2017 through 2036. The predicted crashes are based on the assumption that the number of approaches does not increase or decrease on any alignment.  This will be ensured through ITD’s enforcement of the Expressway Access Control for the proposed alternatives.  See Sections 2.4.2 for additional information regarding access.  The 20-year forecast for crashes was modeled using predicted traffic volumes.  See the Revised Safety Technical Report (ITD 2013) and the Addendum to the Safety Technical Report (ITD 2015b) for additional information. Societal costs can be calculated for the predicted accidents using costs of crashes published by the FHWA for different crash types. Due to the shift in the W-4 Alternative, the Safety Analysis was updated to incorporate the Modified W-4 Alternative and the information is provided below.  See Table 53. Projected Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 195 Environmental Consequences Crashes for Proposed Alternatives and Remaining US-95 Loop and Table 54.

The No Action Alternative would still not meet AASHTO standards. The two typical sections presented in Exhibit 2. Typical Section: Four-Lane Divided Highway and Exhibit 3. Typical Section: Four-lane Highway with Center Turn Lane and Curb, Gutter and Sidewalk are common to all Action Alternatives.  See Section 2.4.2. Design Elements and Typical Section for All Action Alternatives.   The four-lane divided highway sections would have lower predicted crash rates than the four-lane highway with center turn lane, curb, gutter and sidewalk. The center turn lane would allow for two-way left turns, which have a higher predicted numbers of crashes than the highway section with the 34-foot median.  The posted speed limit in the urban four-lane section with center turn lane, curb, gutter and sidewalk would be reduced to 35 mph or 45 mph, depending on the alternative.  This would mitigate some of the safety factors associated with turning movements. Table 55. Length of Typical Sections compares the lengths of the two different typical sections by alternative. The four-lane with center turn lane would have approximately three times more predicted crashes than the four-lane divided highway typical section and while it would still operate at a LOS A it would have higher volumes compared to the four-lane divided highway Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 196 Environmental Consequences section. The higher crash rate for the four-lane with center turn lane is primarily due to turning movements from the center turn lane. Table	  55.	  Length 	  of	  Typical 	  Sections Alternative  Length of Four lane Divided (miles)  Length of	  Four lane 	  	  with 	  center 	  turn lane, 	  curb, 	  gutter 	  and 	  sidewalk 	  (miles)  Total Length of Alignment (miles)  No Action  0  0  6.34  Modified W-‐4  6.35  0.30  6.65  C-‐3  4.52  1.42  5.94  E-‐2  5.61  0.24  5.85  All of the action alternatives would improve the vertical grades through the project area.  The approximate grade of the ascent near Reisenauer Hill, (the steepest hill in the project project limits), would range from 3.4 to 4.3 percent and the approximate grade of descent would range from 4.4 to 4.9 percent north of Reisenauer Hill. The Modified W-4 and C-3 alternatives would transition to a rolling hill condition as they approach Moscow. The E-2 Alternative would descend from Reisenauer Hill at a flatter grade and would not pass through the same rolling hill conditions approaching Moscow compared to the other action alternatives. See Table 56. Vertical Grades at Reisenauer Hill. See Table 56. Vertical Grades at Reisenauer Hill. Table	  56.	  Vertical	  Grades	  at	  Reisenauer 	  Hill Alternative  Approximate Ascending Grade (percent)  Approximate Descending Grade (percent)  No Action  4.3  6  Modified W-‐4  3.5  4.9  C-‐3  3.4  4.8  E-‐2  4.1  4.4  Weather Conditions As a result of public concern expressed during the early public involvement process, a report titled Final Report for Weather Analysis of Proposed Realignments of US Highway 95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow (Qualls 2005) was prepared.  The study concluded that while there may be minor variations in climatic conditions in the three corridors evaluated, they were unpredictable and not considered substantial. Unpredicted weather occurrences are included in the historical base crash rate data obtained from the safety evaluation manual and are also included as safety factors in the safety analyses.  Since the DEIS was published, clarification and supplemental data was provided in a report titled Weather Analysis and Climate Study for US Highway 95, Thorncreek Road to Moscow, Four Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 197 Environmental Consequences Proposed Alternatives, No-Build, W-4, C-3 And E-2 (Qualls 2014). Information from the revised report was used to update this section to address public comments on specific weather related conditions, elevation and conditions at Reisenauer Hill. Since the report was prepared, the W-4 Alternative was shifted and named the Modified W-4 Alternative; however, since there is no exact boundaries relating weather to the alternatives, the findings related to the W-4 Alternative are valid for the Modified W-4 Alternative.  As stated in Section 3.10 the weather stations were placed in three weather regimes and are referred to the Western, Eastern and Reisenauer Hill corridors. A Central Corridor, which runs in a north-south direction, generally encompasses the existing US-95 and the central alternatives.  The West Corridor encompasses the western alternatives, and the East Corridor encompasses the east alternatives.  The Reisenauer Hill corridor represents the southern sections of all the alternatives. These corridors are used to describe variations of weather and climate within the study area, but do not have precise boundaries.  Except in cases referring to data from satellites and historical accident records on the existing US-95, no attempt is made to specify exact weather or climate conditions for a particular alternative, but instead general corridors are discussed.  The Central Corridor does not have a specific weather station; instead the corridor was described based on interpolation of weather data from the eastern and western corridors. Elevation, Temperature, and Ice. Weather stations were placed at different elevations within the study area to capture the elevation effects. There is an approximately 400-foot difference in elevation between the western corridor and the eastern corridor weather stations with the central corridor being slightly lower in elevation. Elevations within the study area range from approximately 2540 feet above mean sea level (amsl) to a high of approximately 3000 feet amsl. The elevations within and near the project area are offered for reference: • Palouse River Drive 2050 amsl • Western Corridor weather station 2550 amsl • Eastern Corridor weather station 2950 amsl • Paradise Ridge 3702 amsl • Moscow Mountain 4983 amsl To capture the climate effects at the elevation extremes the weather stations were installed below 2600 feet and at or above 2900 feet. The topography of the region is shown in the Revised Weather Analysis Figure 1.2, Study Area Map (Qualls 2014). Horizontal and vertical grade calculations based on the conceptual level alternatives are included in Appendix 6. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 198 Environmental Consequences The western corridor weather station was often colder than the higher eastern weather station, by 15 to 20 °F.  This is due to cold air drainage, when cold air, which is denser, flows downhill and pools in low elevation areas during unmixed conditions. When the western corridor was colder than the eastern corridor, the average temperature difference is 5.4 °F and the western corridor was colder than the eastern corridor by 12 °F about five percent of the time. This creates greater potential for frost formation, freezing roads, and black ice on low areas of the western corridor compared to most of the length of the eastern corridor. Temperatures were below freezing at the low elevation western corridor weather station when the higher elevation eastern corridor weather station was above freezing approximately three times longer compared to when the eastern corridor station was below freezing and the western corridor station was above freezing. The observations agreed well with principles of physics and thermodynamics, as well as published scientific studies (Qualls 2014). Air temperature may decrease with increasing elevation under well-mixed atmospheric conditions (e.g., windy weather or a sunny day with strong solar heating of the ground).  Across the 400 feet of elevation difference between the western corridor and the eastern corridor, this averaged about 1.8 °F if only the data when the western corridor was warmer than the eastern corridor are included.  This difference exceeds 2.9 °F less than 5 percent of the time.  Under these well-mixed circumstances, the eastern corridor at its highest point could average 1.8 °F cooler than the lowest point of the western alternative. Combining all the data when either the western corridor or the eastern corridor is colder than the other, yields an overall average temperature difference of about 1 °F with the western corridor being colder on average, because of the significantly colder temperatures which occur at the western corridor due to cold air drainage compared to the mildly colder temperatures at the eastern corridor associated with well-mixed atmospheric conditions. Precipitation and snow accumulation. Most often when snow accumulates, it occurs across the entire study area; however, snow persists longer near Reisenauer Hill than along the middle and northern portion of the study area. All alternatives would be impacted by the persistence of snow in the southern portion of the study area, since all of the action alternatives pass Reisenauer Hill and at least partially descend the north face of Reisenauer Hill with grades ranging from 4.4 percent to 4.9 percent. The study results show that there will be slightly greater precipitation in the eastern corridor than on the western corridor. . There would be approximately five to seven inches more snowfall per year in the eastern corridor and Reisenauer Hill compared to the western corridor, or a melted snow liquid depth (also called Snow Water Equivalent, SWE) difference of 0.5 to 0.7 inches. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 199 Environmental Consequences Landsat satellite images of the study area and the surrounding region provide an excellent picture of the spatial distribution of snow.  Examples of these images spanning 2002 through 2012 are provided in the Revised Weather Analysis (Qualls 2014).  The key findings based on the satellite images are: 1. When there is six to eight inches depth or more at the PSF, the satellite images show coverage over the entire study area and surrounding region by snow. 2. When the snow depth at PSF drops below about six inches during melting, the middle portion (E-2 and C-3 Alternatives) will have patchy conditions. The emergence of these patches is strongly controlled by hill slope orientation. South-facing slopes, which have much greater exposure to the sun, melt off faster than north-facing slopes.  The patch quickly spreads westward, and then begins to melt off north-facing slopes in the central area defined above and including west of US-95.  3. Snow persists substantially longer south and east of the ridgeline of Paradise Ridge, including the ridgeline as it passes Reisenauer Hill, which during the winter months is usually the downwind side of the ridgeline.  Snow also persists down the north-facing slope of Reisenauer Hill, particularly from the existing US-95 toward the west.  Additionally, snow persists on the north end of the study area on north-facing slopes north of Clyde Hill and the east-west power lines of the eastern alignment, though it does not persist there for as long as on either the north face or the south side of Reisenauer Hill. 4. Regional coverage snowfall of a few inches can provide relatively complete coverage of the study area, and it begins to melt off following the pattern described in 2 and 3 above. The distinction between alternatives considered road alignment characteristics such as length, slopes, and curvature. The E-2 Alternative would descend Reisenauer Hill at a relatively flatter grade further north where there is less snow accumulation.  The C-3 and Modified W-4 Alternatives would descend Reisenauer Hill at slightly steeper grades further south than the E-2 Alternative where snow accumulation is greater; however, all action alternatives are designed to meet AASHTO standards and are therefore safe. Vertical grades of the alternatives are further described in Section 4.10.1 Public Safety. Fog. The western corridor and Reisenauer Hill showed Reisenauer Hill to have the poorest visibility conditions, followed by the eastern corridor and then the western corridor.  The Revised Weather Analysis (Qualls 2014) explains that with the exception of one accident related to a tire defect, none of the accidents during foggy conditions occurred at high elevations such as near the top of Reisenauer Hill, where measurements show the worst visibility conditions in the study area.  More accidents occurred in mid to low elevation areas of the study area.  The report Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 200 Environmental Consequences concluded that fog should not be a primary factor for selecting an alternative, because there were few accidents reported during foggy conditions and other contributing circumstances were reported, specifically, negotiation of tight radii curves in on icy roads.  This indicates that the locations of the fog related accidents were controlled by the location of challenging road characteristics (e.g. curve radii and slopes rather than the spatial distribution of reduced visiblitity conditions).  Since all roadway alternatives pass Reisenauer Hill, all alternatives will be subject to the poorest visibility conditions of the area. However, with the improved typical section the safety of the Action Alternatives would be greatly improved over the No Action Alternative.  Wind. Wind speeds were similar between all-weather corridors. Measurements at the eastern corridor showed winds were modestly lower than at the western corridor for high wind speeds. The fastest individual gusts and highest average wind speeds were at Reisenauer Hill. Gust speeds of 30 mph or greater correspond to sustained wind speeds of 25 mph or greater.  This would be typical of wind speeds warranting a Wind Advisory from the National Weather Service.  Gusts generally come from a westerly direction except Reisenauer Hill, which have some gusts up to 38 mph from the east.  However, all the alternatives must pass through the Reisenauer Hill area (Qualls 2014).  Consequently, the direct effect of wind on vehicles and large trucks should be no worse than existing US-95 for any of the alternatives. The improved typical sections with wider roadways, increased shoulder widths, and medians will greatly improve the safety over existing conditions. There is no detectable difference in wind effects to fill sections between alternatives and weather is already sufficiently considered in the safety analysis. Additional information regarding weather is provided in the Revised Weather Analysis (Qualls 2014). Microclimates. The local microclimates have been captured through weather station measurements, evaluation of the satellite remote sensing images, consideration of principles of physics and thermodynamics, and published scientific studies. The weather study included measurements from a weather station installed west of Paradise Ridge on the bench traversed by the E-2 Alternative which represents the eastern corridor.  There were also weather stations that collected data for the Reisenauer Hill and the western corridor. Summary of Findings. All the action alternatives would be an improvement over the No Action Alternative, which has an approximate six percent grade on descent.  The Modified W-4 and C-3 alternatives would both descend at least 300 feet on the north side of Reisenauer Hill and include the 3 (Modified W-4) or 4 (C-3) shortest radii curves of the respective alternatives on this descent. E-2 would descend approximately 100 feet with only two, longer radii curves on Reisenauer Hill and make its primary descent further north where snow is less persistent. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 201 Environmental Consequences The spatial distribution of weather-related accidents on the existing US-95 from Thorncreek Road to Moscow is predominantly associated with the spatial distribution of road characteristics such as tight radii curves located down slope on hills, and ingress/egress associated with road junctions and driveways, rather than due to spatial distribution of weather.  Since all proposed alignments are designed to current AASHTO standards, all will result in a great improvement over existing conditions and will be safe.  Because the road characteristics, rather than the spatial distribution of weather dominate the distribution of accidents, the prescribed Safety Analysis (ITD 2013) for each of the proposed alternatives, reflects the relative safety between alternatives. The road alignment characteristics such as length, slopes, and curvature, are already considered in the Safety Analysis (ITD 2013). The findings in the Safety Analyses as they pertain to weather remain valid for the following reasons: • The five-month data set used to rank the larger 30+ year data set is an accepted method for correlating the data. • Satellite-based remote sensing of snow cover was collected to further verify conditions. • A Revised Weather Analysis, Weather Analysis and Climate Study for US Highway 95, Thorncreek Road to Moscow, Four Proposed Alternatives, No-Build, W-4, C-3 and E-2 (Qualls 2014) has been prepared to incorporate additional data. • Higher elevations are not always colder and the eastern corridor is more often 10-15 degrees F warmer than the western corridor. The western corridor was sub-freezing while the eastern corridor was above freezing twice as often (3.8 percent) as the converse situation (1.9 percent). • For this area, cold air drainage frequently results in lower temperatures with associated ice in the lower elevations. • There is little variability in snow accumulation, fog, wind and microclimates between the western corridor and eastern corridor. Safety in relation to winter road conditions is more significantly a factor of the steepness of the grades, the curvature, the locations of the descent, amount of north facing slopes, and safety elements in the roadway (Qualls 2014).  The small variability in weather conditions and microclimate are mitigated through the improvement of the existing roadway to meet AASHTO standards and is already considered in the assumptions in the Safety Analysis and reflected in the predicted crashes (ITD 2013 and 2015b). Additional information is provided in Sections 3.10 and in the Revised Weather Analysis (Qualls 2014). Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 202 Environmental Consequences Wildlife-related Safety The frequency of wild animal crashes in the project area is much less than many other sections of US-95 and many other highways in Idaho (Ruediger 2007).  In addition, wildlife crashes are not typically severe.  Based on the low frequency, randomness and low severity for drivers due to wildlife crashes, they are not considered to be a major contributor to the crash rates (ITD 2013).  The improvements to the roadway curvature and grade as well as the wider typical section, would improve the ability for drivers to spot wildlife and maneuver if wildlife enter the roadway (Couch 2010). All of the action alternatives would be designed to AASHTO standards and would be safe. Wild animal crash potential is expected to be greater on the E-2 Alternative based on opinions of wildlife experts because it would pass through 1.98 miles of low to moderate quality ungulate habitat. Design features such as improved typical sections (i.e. wider roadways with additional lanes, shoulders, clear zones, and wide medians) as well as the straighter alignment and improved sight distance may also mitigate crashes by allowing drivers more time to spot wildlife and react to wildlife (ITD 2013). The use of oversized culverts and wildlife crossings may provide wild animals the opportunity to cross under the roadway and further mitigate the wild animal crash potential. Sight distance on E-2 is greater than Modified W-4 and C-3 due to its straighter roadway geometry and may offset the higher wild animal crash potential in that corridor caused from E-2 being in an ungulate impact area.  Roadside clearing is predicted to greatly reduce wild animal crash potential on all action alternatives, because brush and vegetation where wild animals can hide would be removed close to the highway. This would also improve driver reaction time.  The roadside clearing technique was found to reduce wild animal crashes up to 90 percent as described in the Revised Safety Analysis (ITD 2013). 4.10.2 Highway Capacity This segment of US-95 currently has an ADT of 5,364 and operates at a Level of Service (LOS) C.  It would reach an average of 8,524 ADTs by 2037 and would operate at a LOS D, which has restricted movements and delays during peak volume. The No Action Alternative would have a LOS D.  All of the Action Alternatives would add a travel lane in each direction, widen shoulders, clear zones and upgrade the roadway to meet the ITD Design Manual and AASHTO standards.  All the Action Alternatives are projected to have a LOS A in both the rural area and urban areas just south of Moscow by the 2037 design year. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 203 Environmental Consequences 4.10.3 Access Effects Access control on the State Highway System is based on the type of facility, its functional classification, highway safety, vehicle operations, and preservation of highway utilities, zoning, and route consistency.  The functional classification would determine the type of access control applied to the highway.  With the Action Alternatives, US-95 would be a multi-lane principal arterial with a rural functional class. This segment of existing US-95 is designated as Statewide Access Control.  The proposed Action Alternatives were re-designated as Expressway Access Control within the project limits through an Idaho Transportation Board action on January 15 & 16, 2014. (See the Safety Analysis Technical Report for the agenda and board minutes). Expressway Access Control is a segment of a highway designated by the Idaho Transportation Board for use as a through highway, with partially controlled access, accessible only at locations specified by ITD, and characterized by medians, limited at-grade intersections, and high speeds. An existing segment of state highway may only be designated as an expressway if payment is made to adjacent property owners for the restriction of existing access rights [IDAPA 39.03.42]. The FHWA and ITD would purchase access rights in accordance to Idaho Board Policy-4005, which incorporated the recently revised IDAPA rule 39.03.42 Rules Governing Right-of-Way Encroachments on State Rights-of-Way and Management of Department-Owned Property. The appraiser will perform a before and after appraisal that will specifically address the access. The deed for the properties will specify the access points at specific locations discussed with the property owner stating width, location, and the type of use of the access. While the District Engineer has the authority to approve a decrease in the spacing requirements for other access types, the Expressway Access Control does not have spacing requirements; therefore, access is allowed only at locations designated by ITD in collaboration with the landowner during the right-of-way process. Existing approaches18 would be allowed to remain at locations where construction of joint access is not economically justified. In the event that the Ring Road concept proceeds to design, ITD will coordinate and negotiate with the City of Moscow regarding access. The access to the proposed Ring Road is expected to be through an interchange located at the north end of the project where growth is expected to 18 IDAPA 39.03.42 definition of approach is a connection between the outside edge of the shoulder or curb line and the abutting property at the highway right-of-way line, intended to provide access to and from said highway and the abutting property. An approach may include a driveway, alley, street road or highway”. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 204 Environmental Consequences occur.  An interchange would be the safest type of access and would result in similar effects to safety between the Action Alternatives. See Section 2.4.2 and Table 76. General Responses to Issues under Access for additional detail. The Action Alternatives would have fewer accesses onto US-95 compared to existing conditions. See Table 57. Access Types for the types and numbers of access points per alternative.  Table	  57.	  Access	  Types Alternative  Field  Residential  County Road  Commercial  Total Access Points  No Action  14  28  7  17  66  Modified W-‐4  17  10  4  5  36  C-‐3  11  14  5  17  47  E-‐2  9  6  2  5  22  The alternatives would have differing effects to access due to alignments locations.  The No Action Alternative would maintain the existing accesses and would have the highest number of access points of all the alternatives.  It would not meet the ITD Design Manual, AASHTO Standards, or ITD’s Spacing Policy. C-3 would have the greatest number of approaches; five public road intersections, the most residential and commercial approaches. E-2 would have the fewest number of public road intersections, residential and commercial approaches. 4.10.4 Mobility Effects	  and	  User Cost All Action Alternatives would shorten the projected travel times through this section of US-95 compared to the No Action Alternative; however, E-2 would result in the greatest travel time reduction.  Shortened travel times could improve the economic vitality of the area and could benefit freight transport, emergency service response, school access, bicyclists/pedestrians, and mail delivery. All Action Alternatives would have an overpass structure and would change access onto US-95 at these locations, which could affect travel times (ITD 2013). See Table 58. Overpass Structures and Total Travel Times, which was updated with new information based on the Mobility and Road User Cost Study (ITD 2014a).  Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 205 Environmental Consequences Table	  58.	  Overpass	  Structures	  and 	  Total 	  Travel 	  Times Alignment  Overpass Locations  Total Travel Time by 2037	  (minutes: seconds)  No Action  None  6:49  Modified W-‐4  Snow Road  6:16  C-‐3  Zeitler Road  6:05  E-‐2  Eid Road  5:31  Source: ITD 2014 Cost of travel time, cost of time related vehicle depreciation, and vehicle-operating costs are components of road user cost that were calculated in the Mobility and Road User Cost Study (ITD 2014a).  Crash costs are also a component of road user cost.  Table 59. Total Road User Cost shows the total calculated cost over a 20-year period based on all motorists making the entire trip from Thorncreek Road to Moscow. All action alternatives have less travel time than the No Action Alternative, which may be translated to a monetary cost. The E-2 Alternative has the lowest total road user cost. The C-3 and Modified W-4 alternatives are expected to cost approximately 3.5 and 5.5 million dollars more than the E-2 Alternative between 2017 and 2036, respectively. See the Mobility and Road User Cost Study (ITD 2014a) and the Community Impact Technical Report. Table	  59.	  TotalRoad	  User	  Cost Alternative  2017	  ($)  2036	  ($)  Total 20	  Year ($)  No Action  14,600,000  19,700,000  339,000,000  Modified W-‐4  14,300,000  19,500,000  336,000,000  C-‐3  13,300,000  18,000,000  311,000,000  E-‐2  12,600,000  17,200,000  295,000,000  Source: (ITD 2014a; ITD 2014b) Includes travel time cost, time related vehicle depreciation and vehicle operating costs. 4.10.5 Bicyclists and	  Pedestrians Currently the roadway has substandard shoulders and is not striped for bicycles and pedestrian use. All Action Alternatives would improve safety and access for bicyclists and pedestrians by constructing wider shoulders and improving sight distance.  The four-lane highway with center turn lane, curb, gutter and sidewalk sections would provide sidewalks that would be designed to meet the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements.  The C-3 Alternative would have the greatest length of the four-lane with center turn lane, curb, gutter and sidewalks. The Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 206 Environmental Consequences shoulders on the outside lanes of the highway on the rural and urban sections would be shared use but would not be specifically marked for bicycle use.      4.10.6 Emergency	  Response Time No need was identified for additional emergency service facilities as a result of construction of any of the alternatives. The ability for emergency service providers to turn around within the project limits to access the on-coming lanes is critical. All of the alternatives would improve the ability to patrol the highway (HDR 2006). The C-3 Alternative would provide the most convenient access and best emergency response times to the population on the existing US-95, while the E-2 and Modified W-4 alternatives would provide improved access and quicker response times to some of the more outlying areas and cities.  The C-3 Alternative would have a longer four-lane with center turn lane section that would allow for easier access and more frequent opportunities to turn around in the urban areas.  The E-2 Alternative would have the greatest improvement on mobility (10 percent) (Arnzen pers. comm. 2012).  The segments of existing US-95 that may be turned over to the NLHD would be utilized for local circulation and emergency service access. 4.10.7 Safety	  of Alternatives No Action The No Action Alternative would have the highest crash rates of the alternatives.  It would include maintenance and minor safety improvements along existing US-95; however, it would not correct the substandard curves and grades, reduce access points or widen shoulders or clear zones.  The roadway would still not meet the current AASHTO standards.  As ADT’s between Thorncreek and Moscow grow and the two-lane highway approaches its capacity, passing opportunities will decrease and crashes on US-95 are expected to increase.  Travel times and access for freight, emergency services, postal delivery, schools, and commuting would be longer than current conditions.  The No Action Alternative would worsen safety for all users and would not meet the project purpose and need.  Modified W-4 Modified W-4 would be the longest alignment of the alternatives with four proposed public road intersections; Eid Road, Jacksha Road, North Old US-95 and South Old US-95.  While the Modified W-4 Alternative is predicted to reduce fatal and injury crashes by more than half of the No Action Alternative, it has the highest fatal and injury crashes of the Action Alternatives from 2017 thru 2036. The Modified W-4 Alternative would have the highest cost to both human life and societal monetary costs associated with crashes of the action alternatives. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 207 Environmental Consequences The C-3 Alternative would have the highest predicted total crashes of all the Action Alternatives but fewer fatal and injury crashes than the Modified W-4 Alternative.  The greater number of intersections, approaches, and longer suburban section compared to the other action alternatives would create turning traffic across US-95. This would still reduce the predicted crashes by half compared to the No Action Alternative over the 20-year period (2017 through 2036). It would have the longest suburban five lane section with center turn lanes, which would have higher crash rates than the rural four lane section with a divided median. Crashes for the suburban section are predicted at a rate of 3.4 crashes per mile while the rural four-lane divided section has a predicted rate of 1.1 crashes per mile. The C-3 Alternative with frontage roads added along the five-lane suburban section was evaluated after the DEIS comment period to determine if safety could be further enhanced. If frontage roads are added to the C-3 Alternative, the five-lane section would be changed to a four-lane section with two-lane frontage roads on each side of US-95 from the top of Clyde Hill to the grain elevators. The C-3 Alternative even considering additional frontage roads would have less safety benefit than the E-2 Alternative.  Each frontage road would have two 12-foot lanes with curb, gutter and sidewalk, with a minimum of two-foot shoulders. The width of the C-3 Alternative would increase from 120 feet (for the five-lane section), to 250-300 feet (for the C-3 Alternative with frontage roads).  The wider right–of-way footprint would result in approximately $7.2 million additional cost for construction, which does not include the additional right-of-way or relocation costs. Adding the frontage roads would result in greater impacts to 11 businesses, six of which were not originally considered impacted by the C-3 Alternative. There would also be greater impacts to floodplains, prime farmland and more impervious surface compared to the original C-3 Alternative. Adding frontage roads to the C-3 Alternative would reduce the number of predicted crashes because the length of the five-lane suburban section with a two-way left turning lane would be reduced and the four-lane divided highway would be increased. The five-lane suburban section with a two-way left turning lane generates 3.4 crashes per centerline mile and the four-lane divided highway generates 1.1 crashes per mile.  However, the C-3 Alternative would still have a higher crash rate than the E-2 Alternative because it would still have more county road intersections than the E-2 Alternative. E-2 (Preferred Alternative) The E-2 Alternative would have the shortest alignment, the fewest public road intersections, the fewest commercial and residential approaches compared to the action alternatives.  Furthermore, safety in relation to winter road conditions is more significantly a factor of the steepness of the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 208 Environmental Consequences grades, the curvature, the locations of the descent, amount of north facing slopes, and safety elements in the roadway (Qualls 2014). The small variability in weather conditions and microclimate are mitigated through the improvement of the existing roadway to meet AASHTO standards and is already considered in the assumptions in the Safety Analysis and reflected in the predicted crashes.  Wildlife crashes while predicted to be greater for the E-2 Alternative, may also be mitigated through the improvements of the typical section.  However, all action alternatives would meet AASHTO standards and would be safe. E-2 would also have the greatest length of the four-lane divided highway. These factors all contribute to E-2 having the lowest predicted crashes compared to the other alternatives.  The E-2 Alternative is predicted to reduce the crash rate of the existing alignment by about 69 percent over the 20-year study period (2017 through 2036).  4.11 Visual Quality Effects Construction of the US-95 project may have direct effects to visual quality.  Effects are likely to occur in locations where construction of the proposed project would affect undisturbed landscapes, in close proximity to sensitive viewers (e.g. residences), and along areas where additional development is proposed.  These effects are directly related to new cut and fill slopes, bridges and new linear features created by the road itself (Visual Genesis 2005).  Visual quality effects as perceived by the community are discussed in the Community Impact Technical Reports.  The W-4 and Modified W-4 Alternatives centerlines are a maximum of 120 feet apart for less than a quarter mile and pass through similar environments; therefore the findings for the W-4 are valid for the Modified W-4 Alternative.   4.11.1 Visual Quality Assessment Findings Visual effects may vary depending on each person’s perception of the view, their values and their perception of the change in the landscape. The degree of visual effects were categorized as low, moderate, moderate high and high as defined below. Low. These conditions occur where viewers are less sensitive to change or the project follows existing portions of transportation routes or other heavily altered landscapes. Effects may cause no change or minimal change to existing visual resources. These effect levels were established to create a context for evaluating potential effects of alternative alignments to visual resources. Moderate. These conditions occur where viewers would be sensitive to changes to the landscape, where changes are visible, but the project does not dominate the viewshed.  Effects may cause some adverse change to visual resources. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 209 Environmental Consequences Moderate High. These conditions occur where viewers are sensitive to change to the landscape, changes are moderately visible and they may dominate the viewshed. Effects may be adverse but not substantial. High. These conditions occur where viewers are sensitive to changes to the landscape, changes may be highly visible, and they may dominate the viewshed. Because these conditions may result in a substantial or substantial change to visual resources, they may warrant mitigation. Table 60. Visual Quality Effects shows the estimated percentages of visual effects to different visually sensitive areas.  See Visual Resources Technical Report for more information. Table	  60.	  Visual	  Quality	  Effects Alternative  Degree of Visual Effect  Percent of Alignment  No Action  0  0  Modified W-‐4  Low  11  −  Moderate  58  −  Moderate High  23  −  High  8  C-‐3  Low  9  −  Moderate  68  −  Moderate High  15  −  High  8  E-‐2  Low  3  −  Moderate  47  −  Moderate High  25  −  High  25  No Action The No Action Alternative would only involve minor improvements and would not involve major soil disturbing activities, large structures, and realignments in new areas.  Therefore, the No Action Alternative would have no effect to visual quality. Modified W-4 Modified W-4 would traverse a relatively undisturbed pastoral landscape.  Direct effects would occur where residences are within the foreground or middle ground views of other residences and are not screened by terrain. This would occur near the City of Moscow, Snow Road, Jacksha Road, and Thorncreek Road. A new bridge at Snow Road would create a long-term visual effect.  During interviews with community representatives during the Delphi Panelist interviews, concern was expressed regarding the W-4 Alternative’s light pollution effects on the University Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 210 Environmental Consequences of Idaho Observatory and general visual effects to the University of Idaho Arboretum, surrounding neighborhoods, and planned recreational and residential facilities. This would be similar for the Modified W-4 Alternative. C-3 would follow existing US-95 along some of its alignment.  It traverses both disturbed and relatively undisturbed pastoral landscapes.  Effects are anticipated to occur where US-95 leaves the existing US-95 corridor and is within the foreground and middle ground views of residences and not screened by terrain.  This would occur near South Clyde Road, Zeitler Road and near Eid Road. A new bridge at Zietler Road would create a long-term visual effect. This would affect the residential and recreation viewpoints located near the alignment, particularly the residences along Eid Road and the residential developments from near MP 342 to Cameron Road along the northern end of the alignment.  E-2 (Preferred Alternative) E-2 would traverse both disturbed and relatively undisturbed pastoral landscapes.  It would also traverse landscapes along the base of Paradise Ridge and could affect recreational viewpoints from Paradise Ridge and views from the University of Idaho Golf Course.  Direct effects are anticipated to occur where US-95 leaves the existing US-95 corridor and is within the foreground and middle ground views of residences and not screened by terrain.  This would occur at the residential viewpoints near the City of Moscow, Cameron Road, and Eid Road. A new bridge at Eid Road would create a long-term visual effect to residences. See Exhibit 34.

The Citizens for a Safe Highway 95, claiming to represent people collectively owning 80 percent of the land along E-2, were in favor of the E-2 Alternative due to the “spectacular view” of the Palouse and of the City of Moscow for travelers as the route traverses just west of Paradise Ridge. They believe that the beauty of Paradise Ridge could transform the highway into a gateway for Moscow, and that E-2 could promote and preserve the Palouse landscape through scenic highway status. The group opposed the W-4 Alternative stating that it would disrupt westerly views and promote farmland conversion disrupting the agricultural setting (HDR 2005a). This is expected to be similar for the Modified W-4 Alternative. The Paradise Ridge Defense Coalition, who opposed the E-2 Alternative, felt the expansion of the roadway should follow the existing route as much as possible in order to minimize the ecological footprint of the road.  The argument against the E-2 Alternative centered on Paradise Ridge as a unique and valued feature in the community. In the view of those opposed to an E-2 alignment, the ridge should remain untouched because it provides both aesthetic and environmental value as the last remaining natural prairie in the area. As a focal point for community pride, Paradise Ridge serves as a reason both for and against the E-2 Alternative (HDR 2006). Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 212 Environmental Consequences The views of some individual property owners will be impacted differently compared to existing conditions.  The visual impacts of the roadway on the community was assessed from various perspectives and illustrated using simulated photographs which replicated the view of each of the three action alternatives from seven locations. The locations were assessed at 30-ft above the ground to provide a “worst case scenario,” since none of the locations are expected to have views from that height. See the Community Impact Assessment (HDR 2006) for additional detail (HDR 2006). See Exhibit 35. Community Visual Impacts, Exhibit 36. Community Visual Impacts (Location 1), Exhibit 37.

FHWA Noise Abatement Criteria (NAC). See Table 61. Predicted Noise Effects. A traffic noise impact occurs when the existing or future noise levels approach (1 dBA below the FHWA NAC) or exceed the FHWA Noise Abatement Criteria (NAC) or when the predicted future traffic noise levels substantially exceed the existing noise levels, even if the predicted noise levels may not approach or exceed the FHWA NAC.  The ITD Noise Policy for a substantial increase is 15 dBA over existing conditions, which would be considered over twice as loud to the human ear. A Leq, A-weighted, one-hour, (Leqah) noise measurement is used as the basis to assess the impacts that a roadway has on the sensitive receptors that are located along the proposed road. Table	  61.

*Receptor/residence will be impacted by the project right-of-way and assumed to no longer exist after project construction. These are not considered in the totals for noise-impacted receptors.  **Residential or business structure(s) potentially impacted by the project right-of-way but residence or business assumed to exist after construction.*** Only garage is impacted by the project. Residence is assumed to remain. ****Receptors 47-52 are Green Acres RV Park spaces and considered one business impact. The details regarding predicted noise levels at receptors by 2037 are shown in in Table 61. Predicted Noise Effects.  Table 62. Summary of Noise Effects summarizes the noise impacted receptors by alternative. Several noise receptors (residences and businesses) may be physically impacted or potentially impacted by project right-of-way.  The noise receptors that are physically impacted by right-ofway are assumed to no longer exist after project construction. Potentially impacted receptors (residences and businesses) could result in removal of residential or business structures but not the actual residence or business.  These receptors are assumed to be present after the project is constructed.  In addition, four empty trailer spaces, a garage and a shop were considered as potential residential or business impacts but they are not included as noise receptors and therefore not listed under this section. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 224 Environmental Consequences If the residence or business impacts would approach or exceed NAC but would result in relocation due to right-of-way impacts, it was not counted as noise impacted receptors as they would no longer exist after project construction. Residential and business impacts will be determined more accurately during the design process when more detailed topography, design detail and survey data are available. This is indicated with the astrices in the table below.  The seven noise impacted receptors for the E-2 alignment would result from substantial increases from the existing noise levels of 15 dBA or more. Six of these noise-impacted receptors are impacted and removed due to right-of-way acquisition. The remaining  receptor (Receptor 7) would be impacted by traffic noise and would remain after construction. The Modified W-4 and C-3 alternatives would have no remaining noise impacted receptors after construction. Receptor 18 shows a substantial increase with the Modified W-4 alignment, however it is a Category G receptor, undeveloped and unplatted lands; therefore it has no NAC threshold and is not considered an impact. Table	  62.	  Summary 	  of	  Noise	  Effects Alternative  Number of Noise Impacted Receptors in 	  2037 	  (number 	  of impacted receptors after ROW acquistion)  No Action  9  Modified W-‐4  1* (no noise impacted receptors would remain after construction)  C-‐3  1* (no noise impacted receptors would remain after construction)  E-‐2  7** (one noise impacted	  receptor	  would remain after construction)  *This receptor exceeds FHWA NACs but is impacted by ROW and would no longer exist. ** Six of these impacted receptors are residences impacted by ROW and would no longer exist. Compression brakes could be used on the prominent hill descents and increase noise for any of the alternatives. 4.12.2 Traffic Noise	  Abatement 23 CFR 772 requires that if a noise impact is identified then noise abatement must be considered. Measures which are determined to be both reasonable and feasible should be incorporated into Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 225 Environmental Consequences the project. The ITD Traffic Noise Policy uses Noise Barrier Abatement Checklists and Noise Abatement Decision Checklists as the basis for determining if traffic noise abatement measures are reasonable and feasible. The checklists are included in the Traffic Noise Technical Report. The required considerations for abatement include: • Acquisition of property rights for construction of noise barriers • Construction of noise barriers • Noise insulation of public use or non-profit institutional structures Optional considerations for abatement include: • Traffic management measures • Alteration of horizontal and vertical alignments • Acquisition of real property or interests therein for buffer zones The required and optional abatement measures were not considered feasible and reasonable for the impacted receptors. However, any future receptors should be required to adhere to setback regulations deemed appropriate by the local jurisdiction. The remaining receptor that is not impacted by the E-2 Alternative right-of-way, receptor 7, is located along Eid Road.  The E-2 Alignment would be on an elevated bridge structure near the receptor. Construction of a noise wall on the bridge structure would be feasible but would not be reasonable based on the cost benefit calculations.  See the Traffic Noise Technical Report for details.  4.13 Air Quality Effects 4.13.1 Air Quality The project is not within a federally designated air quality non-attainment or maintenance area, nor is it within an IDEQ air quality area of concern.  Therefore, the project has minimal likelihood of exceeding federal air quality standards. 4.13.2 Mobile Source Air Toxins (MSAT) The realigned and additional travel lanes resulting from the Action Alternatives would move some traffic closer to nearby homes, schools, and businesses. Therefore, each alternative may have localized areas where ambient concentrations of MSAT could be higher than the No Action Alternative. The localized increases in MSAT concentrations would likely be most pronounced along the realigned roadway sections that would be built as part of alternatives Modified W-4 and E-2.  The magnitude and the duration of these potential increases resulting from the Action Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 226 Environmental Consequences Alternatives compared to the No Action Alternative cannot be reliably quantified due to incomplete or unavailable information in forecasting project-specific MSAT health effects. Effects could be offset with increased speeds and reduced congestion that is associated with lower MSAT emissions for the Action Alternatives.  Also, MSAT would be lower in other locations such as near the existing US-95 alignment when the majority of the traffic shifts away from most of the sensitive receptors in the area.  On a regional basis, EPA's vehicle and fuel regulations, coupled with fleet turnover, would over time, in almost all cases, cause region wide MSAT levels to be significantly lower than today. 4.13.3 Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG) While there are no accurate methods for predicting project effects to climate change, climate change is believed to be associated with the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) such as CO2.  GHG emissions, including CO2, are directly related to energy consumed.  Surface transportation-related emissions can be related to VMT. Table 63. Estimated Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) shows the calculated and projected VMTs for the No Action and Action Alternatives.  Fuel consumption by alternative is in Section 4.15 Energy Effects. Table	  63.	  Estimated	  Vehicle	  Miles	  Traveled	  (VMT) Alternative  Existing 2010	  VMT  Projected 2037	  VMT  No Action  34,008  54,042  Modified W-‐4  35,671  56,685  C-‐3  31,862  50,633  E-‐2  31,433  49,951  E-2 is expected to have the lowest projected VMT and to generate the least amount of GHGs by 2037.  E-2 would result in a 7.6 percent decrease in VMTs compared to the No Action Alternative. Examples of strategies being implemented to reduce GHG levels include providing alternatives to driving alone (such as carpooling, vanpooling, and transit); developing transportation facilities that encourage transit, high-occupancy vehicle (HOV), bike, and pedestrian modes; supporting land use planning and development that encourage such travel modes (such as concentrating growth within urban growth areas); and optimizing system efficiency.  While the project would not preclude implementation of these strategies, due to the rural nature of the project area they are not included as part of the project alternatives. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 227 Environmental Consequences 4.14 Hazardous Materials Effects The Hazardous Materials Scan prepared for the project identified sites with Underground Storage Tanks (USTs), Aboveground Storage Tanks (ASTs), and other sites containing hazardous materials and requiring cleanup.

Therefore, there would be no effects to hazardous material sites.  Modified W-4 This alternative would affect four sites, primarily ASTs associated with farms and residences such as propane tanks and petroleum tanks of 500 gallons or less.  These would be properly handled and disposed of during right-of-way acquisition and would pose a low risk.  C-3 C-3 would affect 13 sites, one of which is Goodman Oil, a listed site with a contaminated plume.  This would need to be remediated if acquired.  Acquisition, liability and remediation of this site would result in greater cost but it would result in an environmental benefit after the clean up or abatement.  Goodman Oil would pay the cost of cleanup but the liability for cleanup could also transfer to ITD if ITD purchases it.  The remaining sites are low risk because there are no records of leakage and they are easily visible.  E-2 (Preferred Alternative) E-2 would affect four sites, primarily ASTs that contain primarily propane or petroleum in tanks of 500 gallons or less.  These would pose a low risk to the project because they are not leaking and are easily visible.  The vast majority of homes built before 1950 contained substantial amounts of lead-based paint.  Due to the age of many of the existing structures there is the potential risk of lead-based paint and asbestos contained in the structures that would be demolished by each alternative.  Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 229 Environmental Consequences Exhibit	  43.	  Hazardous	  Material	  Site	  Effects Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 230 Environmental Consequences 4.15 Energy	  Effects The alternatives are expected to result in slightly different operational energy usage.  The alignments presented have been designed utilizing the same criteria.  All have a posted speed of 65 mph in the rural section and 35 mph or 45 mph, depending on the alternative, at the north end, in the urban section.  All alternatives would traverse the rolling terrain of the Palouse and have similar maximum grades and curvature for the purposes of estimating energy usage.  Operational energy usage by alternative was estimated by projecting the alternatives’ ADTs for the 2037 design year then calculating the projected VMTs.  The fuel usage per alternative was based on vehicle type (heavy truck or passenger vehicle) consumption rates and the highway length for each alternative. Table 65. Estimated Operational Energy Use summarizes the results per alternative. Table	  65.	  Estimated 	  Operational 	  Energy 	  Use Alternative  Alternative Length	  (miles)  Projected 2037	  VMT  Projected 2037	  Fuel Use	  (gal/day)  No Action  6.34  54,042  2,939  Modified W-‐4  6.65  56,685  2,955  C-‐3  5.94  50,633  2,753  E-‐2  5.86  49,951  2,716  Total fuel consumption for this segment of US-95 is currently estimated to be 1,773 gallons per day.  The No Action Alternative is estimated to utilize 2,939 gallons of fuel per day by the 2037 design year. Based on the results, E-2, which is the shortest alignment, would result in the least fuel usage through the project corridor. ITD will negotiate the transfer of the remaining US-95 loop to the NLHD who will be responsible for the safe maintenance of the roadway. NLHD budgets consist of revenues from local, state and federal funding sources which are used for road maintenance, such as plowing, dust control, equipment maintenance and labor costs. The existing US-95 loop will be within the county road system and traffic volumes will decrease by 95 to 97 percent compared to current volumes. Significantly lower traffic volumes will result in less maintenance. NLHD already travels US-95 to access country roads for snow removal so snow removal energy for mobilization is not expected to rise dramatically. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 231 Environmental Consequences 4.16 Relationship between Local Short-‐Term Uses of the	  Environment and	  the	  Maintenance and Enhancement of Long-‐Term Productivity Council for Environmental Quality (CEQ) NEPA Regulations [40 CFR 1502.16] requires discussion of the “relationship between short term uses of the environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity” as part of an EIS. The proposed action was evaluated to determine whether long-term benefits are worth the short-term effects. Short-term effects are anticipated with the construction of any Action Alternative. These include, but are not limited to, travel delays, traffic congestion, restricted access to residences and the commercial establishments in the project area, visual intrusions to residents and motorists, noise to residents and other effects. The C-3 Alternative would have the greatest short-term effects because a greater portion of it is located along existing US-95 and adjacent to businesses and residences resulting in greater delays, congestion, noise, visual effects and access restrictions. The need for short-term and long-term transportation improvements is analyzed in an iterative, on-going planning effort at all levels of government. The maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity of resources of an area is based on a number of different factors, including transportation systems.  The need for present and future transportation improvements is programmed and analyzed as part of the compilation of the Idaho Transportation Investment Program (ITIP).  These plans take into account the requirements for long-term productivity of the transportation system.  There would be a long-term benefit to the travelling public due to improved safety and capacity, increased mobility, and maintenance of the long-term economic viability locally, regionally and state-wide due to availability of safe and reliable transportation and reduced road user costs. The improvement of the aging transportation infrastructure contributes to the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity of the communities in the project area and would outweigh the short-term effects.  Additionally, US-95 is identified as a NAFTA route, which connects Canada to Mexico through Idaho and other western states, and contributes beyond the local and regional long-term productivity of this community.  ITD is committed to mitigating both short-and long-term effects to the environment. 4.17 Irreversible 	  and 	  Irretrievable 	  Commitment 	  of 	  Resources CEQ’s NEPA regulations require discussion of any irreversible or irretrievable commitment of resources in implementing a federally funded project [40 CFR 1502.16]. This applies primarily to use of nonrenewable resources, such as minerals or cultural resources, or to those factors, such as soil productivity, that are renewable only over long periods of time. The irretrievability of those resources applies to the loss of production, harvest, or use of natural resources. The implementation of any of the Action Alternatives would require a commitment of a range of Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 232 Environmental Consequences natural, physical, human, and fiscal resources. The conversion of private land from existing residential, agricultural, commercial, and native habitat uses to public highway is considered an irreversible commitment of resources. Despite that, if at some future time a greater need arises for use of the land or if the proposed public highway is no longer needed, the land could be converted to another use. The Action Alternatives would utilize existing right-of-way (ROW) where possible. Existing ROW would be used to differing extents between alternatives to meet the project purpose and need.  See Table 66. Right-of-Way Effects. Table	  66.	  Right-‐of-‐Way 	  Effects Alternative  New ROW (acres)  Existing ROW (acres)  Total ROW (acres)  No Action  0  0  0  Modified W-‐4  206  45  251  C-‐3  154  55  209  E-‐2  207  22  229  Regarding fiscal resources, the Action Alternatives would require the commitment of funds for constructing, operating, and maintaining the proposed roadway. Funds would be required for right-of-way acquisition, construction, mitigation, and long-term maintenance of the new facilities. Maintenance of the existing US-95 loop would also be required but would be less due to the reduction in traffic volumes on that roadway by 95 to 97 percent compared to existing volumes. The use of public funds for the proposed action would be irreversible and irretrievable. Considerable amounts of labor, fossil fuels, and highway construction materials would be expended and would not be retrievable. Concrete, aggregate materials used in concrete and asphalt production such as sand and gravel, along with steel, water, and bituminous material, would all be used for the proposed action. Additionally, large amounts of labor and natural resources would be used in the fabrication, preparation, and transportation of construction materials. Such expenditures generally are not retrievable. The proposed action has the potential to change land use patterns in the project area by increasing visibility of, and accessibility to, developable land. Such change in land use patterns could result in different effects on the social, built, and natural environment, than otherwise would occur with existing development patterns. Where historic resources are adversely affected such use would be irretrievable but would be minimized and mitigated. The proposed action also would replace land currently functioning as wildlife habitat, riparian areas, and wetlands with highway lanes and approaches. Where wetlands or floodplains cannot be avoided or effects cannot be further minimized, the proposed action would compensate for lost functions and values through compensatory mitigation. While wetland and floodplain mitigation are intended to create additional wetlands or floodplains that restore functions, the loss of the actual habitat affected is considered irreversible. The Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 233 Environmental Consequences commitment of the aforementioned resources is based on the concept that residents in the immediate area, region and state would benefit from the improved facility, as would NAFTA related travel.  These benefits would consist of improved safety, and increased capacity to accommodate current and future traffic demand. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 234 Section 4(f) Evaluation 5 SECTION 4F	  EVALUATION 5.1 Regulatory Framework and Policies Section 4(f) Resources are governed by the following: • 23 CFR 774-Parks, Recreation Areas, Wildlife and Waterfowl Refuges, and Historic Sites (Section 4(f)) • 49 USC 303-Policy on Lands, Wildlife and Waterfowl Refuges, and Historic Sites Section 4(f) of the United States Department of Transportation Act of 1966, codified in Federal law at 49 USC 303, states that “It is the policy of the United States Government that special effort should be made to preserve the natural beauty of the countryside and public park and recreation lands, wildlife and waterfowl refuges, and historic sites.”  Section 4(f) specifies that “The Secretary [of Transportation] may approve a transportation program or project…requiring the use of any publicly owned land of a public park, recreation area, or wildlife and waterfowl refuge of national, state, or local significance, or land of a historic site of national, state, or local significance (as determined by the federal, state or local officials having jurisdiction of the park area, refuge, or site), only if:  • There is no prudent and feasible alternative to using that land, and • The program or project includes all possible planning to minimize harm to the park, recreational area, wildlife and waterfowl refuge, or historic site resulting from the use.” Section 4(f) further requires consultation with the Department of the Interior and, as appropriate, the involved offices of the Departments of Agriculture and Housing and Urban Development. Section 4(f) “use” is defined as:    • When Section 4(f) land is permanently incorporated into a transportation facility; • When there is a temporary occupancy of land that is adverse in terms of the statute’s preservation purpose; or when there is a constructive use of a Section 4(f) property.  Constructive use occurs when the transportation project does not incorporate land from a Section 4(f) resource, but the project's proximity impacts are so severe that the protected activities, features, or attributes that qualify a resource for protection under Section 4(f) are substantially impaired.  Substantial impairment occurs only when the protected activities, features or attributes of the resource are substantially diminished [23 CFR 774.17]. 5.2 Proposed Action and Purpose	  and Need The purpose of this project is to improve public safety and increase highway capacity on US-95 south of Moscow between Thorncreek Road (MP 337.67) and the South Fork Palouse River Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 235 Section 4(f) Evaluation Bridge (MP 344.00).

The primary deficiencies of the roadway are described in detail in the DEIS, Chapter 1, Introduction and Section 3.10, Transportation. 5.3 Section	  4(f)	  Properties The Deesten/Davis Farmstead is the only National Register of Historic Properties (NRHP) eligible cultural resource that could be affected by the Action Alternatives presented in the DEIS and is the only Section 4(f) resource considered in this Section 4(f) Evaluation.  See Exhibit 44. Deesten/Davis Farmstead as viewed from US-95. Exhibit	  44.	  Deesten/Davis	  Farmstead	  as	  viewed	  from	  US-‐95 The Deesten/Davis Farmstead (Field #US-95-22) is located immediately west of US-95 and approximately four miles south of Moscow between Zietler Road and Jacksha Road.  It consists of eight primary buildings: a farmhouse, garage, barn, granary, chicken house, smoke house, shop, equipment shed and groves of trees.  Within the historic site boundary, the property is estimated to be 10.43 acres and is surrounded by actively cultivated Palouse farmland. The Civilian Conservation Corps planted the two groves of trees in the 1930s. There is also an orchard, cottonwoods, a conifer windbreak and a black walnut tree from Germany.  The farm was originally patented to William Plummer in 1882 as a cash entry land claim (BLM 2005) and Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 236 Section 4(f) Evaluation is remarkably intact with the house, barn and other primary buildings in good condition with no intrusive modern elements. The property is eligible for NRHP listing under Criterion A, for its association with regional agricultural development.  The property is also eligible under Criterion C as an excellent example of early twentieth century farmstead architecture and layout.  5.4 Section	  4(f) Use The W-4 Alternative as presented in the DEIS would result in an adverse effect to the Deesten/Davis Farmstead under Section 106 of the NHPA and would constitute a use under Section 4(f) of the USDOT Act.  The No Action, C-3 and E-2 alternatives would not result in Section 4(f) use.  The DEIS W-4 Alternative would encroach upon approximately 1.73 acres of the Deesten/Davis Farmstead. This encroachment would not adversely affect any of the historic buildings but would remove several of the trees, which were planted in the 1930s by the Civilian Conservation Corps. These trees provide a partial visual screen between the roadway and the farmstead. Removing the trees could alter the views of the farmstead adversely affecting the setting. Acquiring rightof-way and removing the trees would result in a Section 4(f) use. There are approximately 2.23 acres of Wetland 9 within the boundary farmstead.  The DEIS W-4 Alternative would affect 0.84 acres of the wetland located on the farmstead. See Sections 3.6 and 4.6 for a discussion of wetlands. See Exhibit 45. Deesten/Davis Farmstead Section 4(f) Use by DEIS W-4 Alternative.  Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 237 Section 4(f) Evaluation Exhibit	  45.	  Deesten/Davis	  Farmstead	  Section	  4(f) 	  Use	  by	  DEIS	  W-‐4	  Alternative Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 238 Section 4(f) Evaluation 5.4.1 Avoidance	  Alternatives Based on the DEIS, the avoidance alternatives would include using either the C-3 or E-2 Alternatives. Shifting the roadway approximately 300 feet to the east in the vicinity of the farmstead would also avoid the historic site boundary.  This would require W-4 to follow the existing alignment in this area, which experiences many accidents due to the substandard curvature. Realigning the W-4 Alternative in this location to follow the existing US-95 alignment would not improve the substandard curvature of roadway in that area and while constructible, it would not meet the project purpose and need and would not be prudent. Modified W-4 Alternative During the development of the FEIS, the DEIS W-4 Alternative centerline was shifted approximately 120 feet east for approximately 2000 ft to avoid the historic farmstead boundary. This realignment begins south of MP 340 and extends to Snow Road. This alternative is feasible and constructible using accepted engineering standards (AASHTO). This new avoidance alternative is referred to as the “Modified W-4 Alternative”.  See Exhibit 46. Modified W-4 and DEIS W-4 Alternatives. The Modified W-4 Alternative is 0.04 miles shorter than the DEIS W-4 Alternative. The safety analysis for the Modified W-4 Alternative shows no substantial difference in projected crash rates and the road user costs would not change noticeably. There would be no severe social, economic or environmental impacts as a result of the avoidance alternative.  The primary differences between the W-4 alternatives are shown in Table 66. Comparison of W-4 Alternatives. As shown in Table 67. Comparison of W-4 Alternatives, the Modified W-4 Alternative compared to the DEIS W-4 Alternative would have slightly more than one less predicted crash, less right-of-way needs, less wetland and floodplain impacts and would avoid cultural resources and Section 4(f) use.  However, it would have one additional well impact, one additional impact to a tributary but less stream channel would be affected.  It would also have more impervious surface and more prime farmland effects. This avoidance alternative in this location does not result in a severe impact and is prudent. The Modified W-4, C-3 and E-2 alternatives are feasible and prudent avoidance alternatives; therefore, no further Section 4(f) evaluation or approval is required.  Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 239 Section 4(f) Evaluation Exhibit	  46.	  Modified	  W-‐4	  and	  DEIS	  W-‐4	  Alternatives Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 240 Section 4(f) Evaluation Table	  67.	  Comparison 	  of	  W-‐4	  Alternatives	  Resource  Modified W 4	  Alternative  DEIS W 4	  Alternative  Length (miles)  6.65  6.69  Predicted Crashes (total crashes 2017	  through 2036)  244.9  246.2  Right-‐of-‐Way new/existing/total (acres)  206/45/251  210/49/259  Prime	  Farmland (acres)  49.7  46.7  Cultural Resources/Section	  4(f)  0/0  1/1  Impervious 	  Surface 	  (acres) 	  New 	  alignment/New 	  alignment 	  plus US-‐95	  Loop  58/68  57/67  Wells (#)  1  0  Wetlands (acres)  1.85  5.45  Tributaries (#/length (ft))  10/3,592  9/5,517  Floodplain (acres)  1.6  3.6  5.5 Coordination The following coordination relevant to Section 106 of the NHPA and Section 4(f) of the DOT Act of 1966 has been completed.

Indirect effects may include highway-related growth inducing effects and other effects related to induced changes in the pattern of land use, population density or growth rate, and related effects on air and water and other natural systems, including ecosystems [40 USC 1508.8]. In this analysis, indirect effects are primarily resulting from land development, which could occur due to improved accessibility and mobility in the area as a result of the project.  Indirect effects can have either beneficial or adverse effects on communities and natural resources. The Delphi process was used to evaluate the project’s indirect effects resulting from induced development.  The process relies on the opinions of a panel of experts to provide their assessment of likely future outcomes by responding to several rounds of questions. This process included: 1. Collecting information about factors that are the most likely to influence future land development patterns 2. Making an estimate of the probable magnitude and direction of change in development patterns (i.e., indirect land use effects) Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 243 Indirect and Cumulative Effects Several types of data were used to identify factors that would affect development patterns: • Socio-economic conditions (population, employment by sub-area, and household characteristics) • Land use patterns (location, type and extent of land development in the study area vacant land, building permits by type and location, development capacity) • Transportation system characteristics • Public services (primarily the availability of water and sewer connections) and • Public policy (land use plan designation and zoning, economic development) The induced growth analyses and findings are presented in the Community Profile and Induced Development Technical Report (December 2005).  Additional interviews were conducted in November 2011 and the findings were summarized in a supplemental report (HDR 2011a).  After the DEIS comment period, Latah County and the City of Moscow were contacted regarding new permits and growth in the project area. 6.1.3 Existing	  Conditions Growth Trends and Land Use The majority of the study area is agricultural with accompanying farmhouses and accessory buildings. There are clusters of residential development along portions of the corridor (Zeitler Road, Cameron Road, Eid Road, and Clyde Road) and two areas that have a concentration of residences (Woodland Heights Mobile Home Court and Hidden Village/ Benson Mobile Home parks). The northern portion of the corridor is more highly developed with a mix of uses emphasized on auto-oriented businesses. Paradise Ridge consists of privately owned parcels with a mix of residential and commercial developments.  Paradise Ridge Road provides the primary access to Paradise Ridge.  There are approximately 55 existing residential and commercial developments on and around the ridge based on aerial photography and county parcel data. The developments have associated disturbances such as roads, driveways, soil disturbance, fences, pets and human disturbance.  These developments as well as other developments in the project corridor would be regulated under the city and county land use regulations. The Latah County portion of the Thorncreek corridor is primarily zoned AF –Agriculture/Forest with some RR-Rural Residential along US-95 by Clyde Road.  Paradise Ridge is zoned AF.  The purpose of AF is to continue agriculture and forestry use in the county. Low-density residential development is the only type of residential development allowed in unincorporated Latah County. Until 1997, the maximum density was one dwelling unit per acre. That requirement has been changed to one single-family residence per eligible parcel and the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 244 Indirect and Cumulative Effects minimum size for eligible parcels is one acre. The Latah County Ordinance details permitted uses, conditional use permits and other regulatory requirements.  With a conditional use permits existing single-family dwellings may have additional dwellings at a density of one per 40 acres. The northern project limit extends into the City of Moscow Area Of Impact, which is zoned commercial and industrial.  South of Moscow, the area was recently rezoned for auto-related commercial. The rural, southern portion of the project area is zoned to support continued agricultural and forestry use in the county. Development along existing US-95 is concentrated at the main county and private roads.  Indirect Effects South of Moscow all the Action Alternatives would have a moderate to low potential to induce development in the corridor. Land use in the study area is expected to remain very similar to current conditions.  Eighty-three percent of the Delphi panelists acknowledged that development is already occurring at a slow rate in the project area.  They acknowledge that once the final alternative is selected, pace and intensity would increase due to the alleviation of uncertainty as to the location of the alignment. The Delphi panelists felt that the growth would occur in the area approximately one mile south of the Moscow city limits, regardless of the alternative selected. Due to the proximity to Moscow this growth would be consistent with planning documents and existing land uses. Panelists also felt that additional development is likely to occur along the US-95 alignments that are transferred to the NLHD. The No Action Alternative would only include safety improvements on the existing alignment and would not induce development or result in substantial indirect effects.  Any of the Action Alternatives would benefit regional trade and could facilitate new commercial and industrial uses locating to the south of Moscow in areas which are already zoned for these purposes. They would all have increased development along their alignments, however, they would be limited by the City and County land use and zoning designations.  All alternatives would tie into existing county and private roads and therefore, the trend of development at these intersections and roadways would continue.  A majority of the Delphi panelists felt that the type and pace of development along the county roads of Eid, Zeitler, Snow, and Sand roads would remain constant due to the lack of direct access to the proposed alignments. Property values in the general corridor area for all of the Action Alternatives would be expected to increase immediately south of Moscow and would remain unchanged in the rest of the corridor. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 245 Indirect and Cumulative Effects To promote an efficient and safe transportation system and to maintain the agricultural and rural character of the area, the Latah County Comprehensive Plan requires that limits be placed on the number of access points to state and federal highways; and encourages bike and pedestrian routes and mass-transit as transportation options.  See Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments. Highway-induced development and other indirect effects are expected to be moderate due to the following:  • The Action Alternatives would have Expressway Access Control that would limit the number and spacing of approaches and access points.  • Latah County would continue to enforce the zoning regulations, which only allow low-density residential development. • The agricultural and rural character of the corridor will be maintained and will ensure consistency with the existing land use plans.  Indirect Effects by Resource Social. The indirect effects of development may include increased noise, light and visual effects on surrounding areas; however, visual effects are very subjective and may be perceived differently by different individuals. Visual quality could be degraded due to exposed soils, erosion, unnatural slopes, the addition of new roadways and structures, and changes in vegetation. There could be increased use of recreational facilities, public resources, schools, and emergency services, utility distribution, buildings and traffic along the highway and south of Moscow. Areas south of Moscow and adjacent to the existing highway that are currently identified for development may experience higher noise levels over time. ADT volumes on this section of US 95 are expected to increase and noise levels would increase proportionately.  However, they would not result in noise levels that would approach or exceed FHWA noise impact levels. Modified W-4 would have increased noise and visual effects to the University of Idaho Arboretum, located on a hill approximately three-quarters of a mile north of Modified W-4. Modified W-4 could have potential noise and visual effects to a master-planned community approximately one-quarter mile north of Modified W-4. A new development planned near the C3 Alignment could potentially increase traffic and traffic related conflicts and access issues in the area. In early 2015, these planned developments had not yet been constructed.  C-3 would be closer to more businesses and affect more approaches along the existing US-95 alignment compared to the other alternatives. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 246 Indirect and Cumulative Effects The C-3 alternative is already close to many residences and businesses compared to other alternatives, except on the area of new alignment,.  This could have increased visual, noise and access effects to the greatest numbers of businesses; however, as described in the Economic section that follows, maintaining businesses with similar access and visibility along existing US95 is preferred by many business owners (HDR 2006). The primary indirect social effect of E-2 would be a visual effect to residents on Paradise Ridge due to the roadway alignment and acceleration of development south of Moscow and at intersections.  See Community Impact Technical Reports for more details. Economic. Indirect effects to economic conditions could involve changes to visibility and access or result from declining sales or client bases that may cause existing businesses to move to new locations or cause new businesses to locate in other areas.  Vehicular access is important for customers to access the business establishments and for suppliers and shipment ingress and egress.  Temporary disruptions to access could adversely affect businesses.  Visibility could affect retail businesses requiring drive-by traffic but could also affect non-retail businesses. C-3 is believed by business owners to have the least indirect effects because the access would be similar, although it would be changed to a limited access facility. Traffic would continue to pass by the existing businesses, which would encourage businesses to stay or locate in the area.  The Modified W-4 and E-2 would have greater effects to visibility and access to existing businesses.  These new alignments could potentially encourage new growth in the area. This new growth would be limited because direct access would be limited by the enforcement of Expressway Access Control.  While safety and direct routes to and from Moscow and Lewiston are also believed to be important considerations for area businesses and goods movement, the travel times and safety between Action Alternatives do not differ substantially for goods movement.  Road user costs, which estimate the cost of the delays to travelers, were calculated after the DEIS was published to determine economic effects of the alternatives.  See the US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow; Mobility and Road User Cost Study on Alternatives Carried Forward (ITD 2014a). Farmland. There could be more conversion of farmland up to one mile south of Moscow where growth is predicted with any of the alternatives. The Modified W-4 could result in greater indirect effects compared to the other alternatives because there are larger tracts of farmed land and the highest yielding fields on the western corridor compared to the farmland near the E-2 corridor.  The rate of farmland conversion for the Modified W-4 could also be expected to be higher because it would be closer to the universities, more accessible to the cities and closer to planned developments.   Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 247 Indirect and Cumulative Effects Increased development could result in farmland fragmentation for any of the alternatives. Farming smaller fields and having to transport equipment across roadways or between separated fields could decrease efficiency and affect the viability of farming.  Additional expenses to the producer caused by smaller operational units and the increased demand for development property could result in the land being used for purposes other than agricultural production. The loss of agricultural land would also be felt by farm services within the area.  The effects to farmland would be minimized through the implementation of Expressway Access Control. For additional information regarding indirect effects to farmlands see the Farmland Technical Report.  Wetlands and Tributaries. Wetlands and tributaries are present throughout the corridor including at the north end of the project within the City of Moscow area of impact. Development is already expected to occur within the City of Moscow area of impact regardless of the project.  Sections 401, 402 and 404 and of the Clean Water Act regulate activities in waters of the US and would require the replacement of lost functions and values of waters of the US including wetlands.  Development could increase the amount of impervious surfaces, thus increasing the potential for high peak flows, increased sediment, incised banks, pollutants, and increased water temperatures.  Since development is likely to be concentrated south of Moscow, developers would also be required to comply with City stormwater ordinances, TMDLs and other stormwater requirements to minimize those effects. See the Wetland Technical Report for more detail. Floodplains. Indirect effects to floodplains may result from induced residential and commercial growth. These may involve placing fill in the floodplains/floodway, vegetation removal, soil tilling, grading, and channel modification. These actions would degrade floodplain function including flood storage. The floodplains (and a regulatory floodway) in the project area are concentrated at the north end of the project within the Moscow Area of Impact where growth is expected and along the W-4 alternative.  There is no floodplain along the southern parts of the C-3 and E-2 alternatives. Development is required to comply with local floodplain regulations which would not allow a more than a one-foot rise in base flood elevations; therefore, none of the alternatives would likely result in indirect effects to floodplains. Groundwater. The groundwater in the project area could be indirectly affected by the increase in impervious surface, increased development primarily south of Moscow where induced growth is anticipated.  Development impacts to groundwater will be minimized through the compliance with the NPDES Construction General Permit and BMPs, which will require quantity and quality Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 248 Indirect and Cumulative Effects treatment for most new developments.  Limited access to US-95 would also minimize the potential induced growth and would minimize potential impacts to groundwater. Vegetation. Vegetation may be affected indirectly through development, weed establishment, dispersal, and degradation of native habitats, rare plant populations and restoration areas.  Thirty-two areas were identified as Palouse remnants during the 2005 inventory (Litchardt 2005).  Many of these are known to support species of concern that could be affected by degradation of the remnants.  The primary threat to the persistence of Palouse remnants in their present state is colonization by weeds; expansion of those present as well as invasion by new arrivals. Pesticide drift is also a threat.  All remnants identified in the project area are bordered completely or partially by weedy vegetation; however, even with weed populations, many of the identified remnants are high-ranking. See the Vegetation Technical Reports and the Biological Assessment Technical Report.  New roadway alignments induced development and weed dispersal by vehicles can contribute to the establishment and spread of weeds and could contribute to the degradation of nearby Palouse remnants. Environmental effects of roads including the spread of weeds can extend more than 300 feet from the roadway (Forman 2000). However, other studies indicate that remnants within 0.6 miles of the highway are at greatest risk to weed invasion. (Lass and Prather 2007). There are no known Palouse remnants within one mile south of Moscow; however, two remnants are within 1.25 miles south of Moscow and could potentially be affected by induced development. Since the Modified W-4 alternative requires the greatest total right-of-way, it would have the greatest amount of soil disturbance and exposed soils; therefore, the greatest degree of weed establishment. The numbers of Palouse remnants near the alignments are presented in Table 68. Palouse Remnants Near Alternatives. Table	  68.	  Palouse	  Remnants	  Near	  Alternatives Alternative  Palouse	  Remnants near Alignment  No Action  0  Modified W-‐4  12  C-‐3  14  E-‐2  24  Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 249 Indirect and Cumulative Effects C-3 would be within 1000 feet of the nearest remnant.  The distances from the Modified W-4 Alternative to the nearest remnants was measured and the Modified W-4 Alternative would also be within approximately 1000 feet of the nearest remnant and would have similar findings as the W-4 Alternative. This could introduce new weeds contributing to the degradation of the remnant.  Six Palouse remnants occur within 1000 feet of alternative E-2 and the closest is within 300 feet (Lass and Prather 2007). This includes the South End Paradise Ridge Conservation Site documented by the Idaho Conservation Data Center (CDC) in 1996 and a smaller remnant documented by CDC in 2005 as a conservation site.  The Paradise Ridge area is already being affected by new residential development independent of the proposed project with approximately 55 homes and businesses on or around the ridge.  The CRP land could be affected by weed invasion.  The E-2 Alternative would have the greatest indirect effects to Palouse remnants and rare plant restoration projects due to its proximity to more remnants and to the South Paradise Ridge Remnant, which is a high quality remnant but is not weed free.  The E-2 Alternative is also closer than the other alternatives to ongoing rare plant and prairie restoration projects.  The E-2 Alternative would not go over the top of the ridge, but would parallel the grasslands on Paradise Ridge, about 0.7 mi from the summit and about 0.25 mi from the large Palouse remnant associated with the ridge summit. The E-2 Alternative would not directly impact any rare plants, threatened or endangered species or Palouse prairie remnants. Weed populations could affect potential habitat for rare and native plant species affecting their future success. Noxious weeds that are known to occur in and around Moscow, which are known to be a threat to bunchgrass grasslands, but are not currently in the delineated remnants include yellow-star thistle (Centaurea solstitialis), spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa), teasel (Dipsacus fullonum), and Dalmatian toadflax (Linaria dalmatica).   There are many others that could prove to be threats (Tim Prather, pers. comm. 2005). Spalding’s catchfly is the only federally listed plant known to occur in the project area. The USFWS determined that all of the alternatives may affect, but are not likely to adversely affect Spalding’s catchfly based on potential indirect effects including degradation of habitat by weeds, as stated in the DEIS and FEIS Section 4.9.  An additional survey for Spalding’s catchfly in the project area was conducted in the summer of 2013 and no new populations were identified (Lichthardt 2014). The project area is within a key conservation area for Spalding’s catchfly recovery with planned and existing restoration projects that could be indirectly affected by weeds. Indirect effects from the alternatives will be mitigated as described in Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 250 Indirect and Cumulative Effects There are sites in the project vicinity for which restoration activities (ecological weed control, native plant establishment and establishment of Spalding’s catchfly) are occurring or planned.  The E-2 Alternative would not directly affect these areas but it would bring the roadway closer compared to the other alternatives.  While invasive weeds are already present to differing extents on the sites, the closer alignment could contribute to weed establishment in sites near the road. The number of road cuts and fills and the amount of soil moved to construct the road will directly affect introduction of weeds. Planning and implementing successful revegetation may minimize weed establishment and spread. Measures that will minimize impacts due to potential weed infestations include, limiting access through the corridor which will limit future development, constructing farmable slopes, implementation of the SWPPP, and development of a weed control plan and seed mixes that will minimize weed establishment during and after construction. BMPs will be used to stabilize and vegetate bare soils. Grass cover will be patchy initially, allowing weed seeds to germinate. Intensively managed cropland is believed to provide a more efficient buffer to new weed invasion compared to native vegetation or CRP plantings. ITD will implement their Vegetation Management Plan, which includes ensuring successful establishment of roadside vegetation, pesticide and fertilizer application, erosion control and maintenance of native vegetation.  ITD will consult with USFWS, IDFG, NRCS and Conservation District staff during the project design to develop measures to further minimize weed establishment and spread, particularly to Palouse remnants and restoration sites within 0.6 miles of the selected alternative that could be degraded by weeds. ITD will also monitor the effectiveness of the weed control measures and make corrective actions as needed. See Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments. While none of the alternatives would directly affect federally listed threatened or endangered plants, they would bring the road closer to the Spalding’s catchfly population and Palouse remnants. This could introduce weeds or have other indirect effects that could affect Spalding’s catchfly plants found near the project area. The distance of each alternative from the Spalding’s catchfly plants is shown in Table 69. Alternative Distances to Spalding’s Catchfly. The Modified W-4 Alternatives’ distance to Spalding’s catchfly populations and Palouse remnants would be similar to the W-4 Alternative. The project May Affect but is Not Likely to Adversely Affect (NLAA) Spalding’s catchfly due to these potential indirect effects. See Biological Assessment Technical Report.  There could also be effects to the Spalding’s catchfly Key Conservation Area and associated restoration efforts.  Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 251 Indirect and Cumulative Effects Table	  69.	  Alternative	  Distances	  to	  Spalding’s	  Catchfly Alignment  Approximate Distance	  to Spalding’s Catchfly Population	  (ft)  No Action  1,640  Modified W-‐4  1,573  C-‐3  2,102  E-‐2  4,757  ITD will implement its Vegetation Management Plan in conjunction with USFWS, IDFG and landowners within the project area, this may include providing funds to landowners for weed control in prairie restoration sites, constructing farmable slopes to minimize weed establishment and spread, and revegetating slopes and fills with native grasses and forbs to minimize weed establishment and spread along the roadway.  Species will be determined in consultation with USFWS and NRCS to help ensure compatibility and successful establishment. The Action Alternatives will have Expressway Access Control, which would help minimize future development along the roadway and associated indirect effects. Additional information regarding indirect and cumulative effects to Palouse remnants and Paradise Ridge has been added to FEIS Chapter 6, Indirect and Cumulative Effects. The full list of mitigation measures as well as applicable standard specifications and BMPs for weed control are provided in the FEIS Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments. Fish and Wildlife. Growth would occur with or without the project.  There would likely be more dense development at the north end of the project, which is already more developed and has little suitable wildlife habitat.  Development in suitable wildlife habitat and movement corridors or increased development density could further restrict migration across the US-95 corridor. The types of developments that could have the greatest effect to wildlife movements are commercial, industrial, and higher density residential (i.e. subdivisions or apartment complexes) that would occur in or near Palouse remnants, pine stands, ungulate habitat, wetlands or water resources.  Any residential development however, would have an effect. This development could reduce habitat connectivity, increase habitat fragmentation, and create isolated blocks of habitat. It could also displace wildlife causing them to move to other available habitats. For elk, which are a species that appear to be severely disrupted by roads and highways, Ruediger estimated the reduced use to be equivalent to the loss of approximately 732 acres of habitat. The effects of displacement are complex and likely influenced by the species of animal, terrain, vegetation, harassment factors (like hunting), traffic volume and how the highway is designed. In the long-term, displacement Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 252 Indirect and Cumulative Effects and the minimal landscape fragmentation could result in more isolated subpopulations and reduction in genetic diversity (Ruediger 2007). See the Wildlife Technical Reports for more information.  Roads constructed due to indirect development can introduce weeds and transportation related pollutants like salt and automobile emissions. Historically, concentrations of lead in vegetation tended to be higher near roadways and could be ingested by deer. Today, lead is no longer an issue due to use of unleaded gasoline.  Fragmentation While it is known that highways fragment landscapes, most of the native landscapes in the project area are already fragmented with the exception of the Paradise Ridge remnant (Lichthardt 2005). The E-2 Alternative would come closer to Paradise Ridge and could affect some local deer and elk winter range and other seasonal or year-round habitat. The Bald Butte area, a few miles west of existing US-95, has limited amounts of coniferous habitat and remnant Palouse Prairie, and it is already separated from Paradise Ridge and other similar habitat. The alternatives would increase fragmentation for ungulates as well as other smaller wildlife, in an already fragmented environment. However, there is little evidence that significant habitat fragmentation will occur with any of the three action alternatives, even the E-2 Alternative (Ruediger 2007). Elk and moose habitat is limited in quantity and quality and confined to the Paradise Ridge vicinity. Since nearly all the elk and moose habitat is on Paradise Ridge and eastward, habitat fragmentation for these species is minimal. There will be some fragmentation of habitat, mostly along drainages and draws for small terrestrial species such as raccoon, skunks, coyotes, amphibians and reptiles (Ruediger 2007). Deer move throughout the entire project area and are not confined to the timbered areas of Paradise Ridge. While development and associated road improvements may fragment the properties and temporarily displace deer, they are highly adaptable to human activities (Melquist 2005a).  The development in areas that might serve as suitable habitat would have minimal effects and no measurable indirect effects are anticipated. Elk tend to stay closer to security and seek cover more than deer. Therefore, induced growth along the E-2 corridor would have the greatest effect on elk because the route passes through existing cover and foraging areas in agricultural fields or CRP land adjacent to cover. Modified W-4 passes to the east of an area of suitable habitat near the Idaho-Washington border; therefore, any development in that area could also result in indirect effects to elk. However, no long-term indirect effects on elk populations are expected to occur as a result of corridor construction within the project area (Melquist 2005a).  While elk are not nearly as tolerant of humans as Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 253 Indirect and Cumulative Effects whitetail deer, elk have become more plentiful and expanded their range into more populated areas in recent years, and in doing so, they have become more tolerant of humans and human activity (Melquist 2005a).  Elk will continue to move between Paradise Ridge and the patches of habitat along the Washington border (Rand per. com. 2005). Elk have been shown to use habitat adjacent to roads less than similar habitat that is not affected by roads (Rowland et al. 2005, Wisdom 1998, Johnson et al. 2000, Ager et al. 2003, Perry and Overly 1977, Lyon 1979). Elk responses to highways and roads vary by topography, vegetation, traffic volumes, how the highway is designed and whether or not elk are hunted. Generally, elk use decreases as the proximity to roads and highways increases. (Rowland et al. 2000) found that there was a measurable decline in elk use up to 5,500 feet from roads. (Roloff 1998) and (Rowland et al. 2000) suggest assessing elk habitat using distance band approaches (Ruediger 2007). There are likely other species also impacted, such as deer, moose and birds that would be included within the elk displacement impact described by Ruediger, however, the deer, moose, and birds are more widespread and less sensitive to human development; therefore, displacement and loss of habitat is expected to be low for either the species involved (at a population level) or on the total amount of habitat available in Latah County, the region or state (Ruediger 2007). Movements of moose west of US-95 are less common, as habitat is limited and separated by three to four miles of agricultural fields. Nonetheless, exploratory movements by moose are likely to occur throughout the project area. The greatest indirect effect of development in this corridor might be the restriction of western movement by moose. However, their movement is random and occasional and there is ample suitable habitat outside of the area. See the Wildlife Technical Reports for more detail. Approximately 3.9 acres of a pine stand will be affected by the E-2 Alternative leaving approximately six-acres on the west side of the highway and approximately 20 acres on the east side of the highway.  The roadway would increase fragmentation of this forest habitat due to tree removal, and having a roadway located between remaining pine stands. This could affect wildlife including pygmy nuthatch. Pygmy nuthatches are known to be sedentary and young birds may move an average of 286 meters (m) or 938 ft from their natal area, but have been observed to move up to 533 m or 1,749 ft (Ghalambor 2006). Tree removal for road construction or other development may increase the distance between habitats (Ghalambor 2006) and could affect access to patches of pine stands.  Research in Europe shows that habitat fragmentation affects the dispersal process in the closely related European nuthatch (Sitta europea) (Matthysen and Currie 1996).  The rate of territory Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 254 Indirect and Cumulative Effects settlement was rapid and associated with rapid pair formation in a large forest tract, nuthatches fill vacant territories at a slower rate and experienced lower pairing success in the small forest fragments (Matthysen and Currie 1996).  The expected use of the remainder of the segmented pine stand is described in Section 4.8 under Pine Stand Effects. Melquist in his report states that pygmy nuthatch suitable habitat, mature ponderosa pine stands, are located nearby near the Dumroese property, near the Robinson Lake Park in Moscow, Idler’s Rest and most of the areas of the Palouse that still have ponderosa pine (Melquist 2005b; figure 3).  The remaining fragments of the pine stand along the E-2 Alternative may still offer pygmy nuthatch habitat.  See Section 4.8 under Pine Stand Effects. The remaining pine stands locally, regionally and statewide are expected to be sufficient to continue to support pygmy nuthatch populations. The alternatives could also have effects to birds due to traffic noise.  A study of the effects of busy roads on wildlife indicated that traffic noise from busy roadways could affect communication for grassland birds (Foreman, 2000); however, the effects of noise on birds vary with traffic volume, speed, wildlife species and habitats. The study was based on a road with traffic counts measured between 45,000 to 150,000 vehicles per day, which is between five and 18 times greater than the Thorncreek Road to Moscow project.  The study also did not measure the noise levels. The predicted traffic volumes and predicted noise levels for the roadway in the study are much higher than the predicted levels for this section of US-95. In a Massachusetts study highways with moderate traffic volume (8,000-15,000 ADT) showed no effect on bird presence, although breeding was affected for 400 m (Foreman et. al 2003).  For relatively light traffic volumes (3,000-8,000 ADT) there was no significant effect on grassland bird distribution (Foreman et. al., 2003). The volumes of the action alternatives are predicted to have 8524 ADT in 2037. 6.2 Cumulative	  Effects This section evaluates the potential cumulative effects of the Action Alternatives. 6.2.1 Regulatory	  Framework and	  Policies Relevant laws, regulations and guidance that pertain to indirect effects include: • 40 CFR 1508.7 Cumulative Effects • FHWA Interim Guidance: Indirect and Cumulative Impacts in NEPA • FHWA Position Paper on Secondary and Cumulative Impact Assessment Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 255 Indirect and Cumulative Effects • FHWA TA 6640.8A NEPA Implementation-Guidance for Preparing and Processing Environmental and Section 4(f) Documents • CEQ Guidance on the Consideration of Past Actions in Cumulative Effects Analysis • CEQ Considering Cumulative Effects under the National Environmental Policy Act 6.2.2 Methodology The methodology for determining the cumulative effects of the proposed project is based on Considering Cumulative Effects under the National Environmental Policy Act (CEQ 1997). Cumulative effects (impacts) are defined by the CEQ regulations as “the impact on the environment which results from the incremental impact of the [proposed] action when added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what agency (federal or non-federal) or person undertakes such actions.  Cumulative impacts can result from individually minor, but collectively significant, actions taking place over a period of time” [40 CFR 1508.7].  Cumulative impacts include the direct and indirect impacts of a project together with the reasonably foreseeable future actions of other projects. According to CEQ’s cumulative impacts guidance, the cumulative impact analysis should be narrowed to focus on important issues at a national, regional, or local level.  The analysis should look at other actions that could have similar effects and whether a particular resource has historically been affected by cumulative actions. During the scoping period, letters were sent to the resource agencies asking them to identify issues to be studied in the EIS.  Ongoing coordination with the resource agencies has continued to evaluate the potential resource effects and to address agency concerns.  Based on the concerns identified during the scoping process and the potential for direct and indirect effects from the project, the cumulative effect analysis focuses on four key resources. • Farmland -This includes conversion of farmland to other uses. • Wildlife and Vegetation – This includes barriers to wildlife movement, fragmentation of habitat and loss of habitat for wildlife, fish and vegetation. • Wetlands and Tributaries -This includes degradation of water quality, loss of wetlands, effects to tributaries and effects to floodplains. • Visual effects -This includes effects to the aesthetics of the area. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 256 Indirect and Cumulative Effects 6.2.3 Cumulative Effects to 	  Resources Development All of the Action Alternatives would have a moderate to low potential to induce development. Land use is likely to remain very similar to current conditions in the project area. The area immediately south of Moscow within the area of impact is zoned for more dense land uses and is being developed accordingly. The southern part of the project is designated for agricultural and rural residential land uses; therefore, the existing farmland is expected to be retained.  US-95 is currently designated as a Statewide Access Control highway and the Action Alternatives were desigated as Expressway Access Control, which restricts future access to US-95 and limits induced development along the highway corridor. The key past, present and reasonably foreseeable future development projects that were considered are discussed in the Community Impact Technical Reports.  Potential developments that are considered in the City of Moscow Comprehensive Plan and considered in the evaluation of cumulative effects include: the Ring Road concept, a proposed rezoning and annex for a ball park, auto-urban commercial land use along US-95 south of Moscow, auto-urban residential growth south of Moscow and an industrial park north of the South Fork of the Palouse River. See Section 3.2.3 for additional information. Wildlife and Vegetation Past Effects. The project is within the Palouse Bioregion. Historically, the area had scattered Ponderosa pine stands with shrubs and native bunchgrasses. Beginning in the early 1800s, with the settling of the area, the native vegetation was cleared and converted to agricultural use, grazing, and urban development.  Currently up to 99 percent of the Palouse have been converted and only remnants of the Palouse Prairie vegetation remain.  The remaining Palouse remnants continue to be eliminated through weed invasion and residential development. The remnants are primarily located in isolated, rocky, unproductive farmland soils and have been degraded to varying extent by weeds. Degradation of Palouse remnants through weed infestation is the greatest threat to the remnants. Rare plants including Spalding’s catchfly also historically occurred in this area and have suffered from decline.  Ongoing human impacts to Palouse remnants in the study area include 1) herbicide drift from adjoining cropland, 2) tracking by farm and recreational vehicles, 3) invasion by perennial pasture grasses from adjoining retired fields, and 4) invasion of exotic species in general.  Effects of pesticide use on pollinators could be added to this list, assuming pollinators are limiting to reproductive success. (Lichardt 2008). Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 257 Indirect and Cumulative Effects Big game was relatively scarce in the early 1900s, but agricultural crops and construction of stock ponds created desirable browsing areas, which attracted elk and deer.  This newly created habitat, in combination with a reduction in predators allowed continued growth of deer and elk populations through the mid-1950s, when populations peaked.  The number of homes in the wooded areas and areas on and near Paradise Ridge continues to increase. The continual elimination of trees and shrubs that provide suitable cover for browsing ungulates and other wildlife has degraded the availability of quality habitat in the project area. Project Effects. Palouse remnants and rare plants. There would be no direct effects to Palouse remnants or rare plants from the project. There could be indirect effects to Palouse remnants, rare plants where project-induced development such as roads are constructed near (approximately 300 feet) from remnants, which could spread weeds. The potential for those weeds to move from the roadside into a remnant will depend upon dispersal methods, distance to the remnant and the intervening land uses. Intensively managed land such as cropland might provide a more efficient buffer for new weed invation than native vegetation or Conservation Reserve Plantings. New highway construction could accelerate weed introduction due to bare soils, although revegetation will be implemented.  However, planting perennial pasture grasses or species and invasive species in the right-of-way could accelerate weed infestation.  The chance of weed invasion decreases with increasing distance from the development or roadway. (Lichthardt 2005). Pine stands. There would be direct effects to 3.9 acres of pine stands as described in Section 4.8 under Pine Stand Effects.  This habitat provides habitat for many wildlife species including pygmy nuthatch, long-eared myotis and northern alligator lizard. The construction of the E-2 Alternative may have indirect effects to species using the pine habitat through habitat fragmentation, noise and closer human activity.  See Section 6.1 Indirect Effects. Remaining pine stands could be indirectly affected due to induced development on the north end of the project and near county road intersections where pine stands occur. Ungulates. The southern section of the project is considered to have the highest occurrences of ungulates in the project area. It is within the Thorncreek (ID2-04) linkage area, an area identified in an IDFG and ITD wildlife corridor study as a highway segment that intersects a movement corridor for deer, elk, moose and small mammals.  However, the linkage area is determined to be low priority compared to other linkage areas in the IDFG Linkage Database (ITD 2013).  Impacts to moose and elk would include direct loss of poor to marginal habitat, increased risk of collisions, possible loss of connectivity to habitats, and displacement (Melquist 2005a). Impacts to white-tailed deer would include direct loss of habitat, increased risk of vehicle collisions, and Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 258 Indirect and Cumulative Effects possible loss of connectivity to marginal habitats between E-2 and the existing alignment (Sawyer 2010). The increased projected traffic volumes through the area could deter wildlife movement and increase wild animal crashes in the area; however, the effects would be mitigated by the wider typical section that would allow for improved sight distance and recovery. . See Section 4.8 Vegetation, Fish and Wildlife Effects and Wildlife Technical Reports for more detail. Future Effects. Delphi panelists predicted growth would primarily occur just south of Moscow, west of existing US-95 and along the highway alignments near county road intersections.  Habitat loss and fragmentation resulting from the increased development on Paradise Ridge will continue, irrespective of the construction of the highway. Palouse remnants and rare plants. Foreseeable future human impacts to Palouse remnants and rare plants include land development and invasion by weed species –those that have been introduced to the area, but have not yet spread. Land development is expected to spread outward from Moscow, into the north end of the study area, affecting Palouse remnants, grassland communities and pine stands where present. Current agricultural practices are expected to continue through the study area.  Cumulative effects may include pesticide drift from adjoining cropland, tracking by farm equipment and RVs, which can lead to sedimentation and weed dispersal. Harvesting and plowing may also affect grassland nesting bird species and functions of matrix habitat.  However, agricultural operations are not expected to significantly affect bumble bee populations or giant Palouse earthworms due to the types of crops being planting and the fact that past earthworm occurrences were not in active agricultural lands.  A private loop road for development was constructed near Clyde Hill.  Increased development on or near Spalding’s catchfly plants in this area may adversely affect this federally protected plant as well as the private lands that are identified for restoration efforts within the key conservation area. Weed dispersal and infestation may also adversely affect the populations of Spalding’s catchfly. Numerous weed species that currently exist in the Moscow area were not found in any of the remnants (Lass and Prather 2007) and represent a future threat to remnants in the study area.  Some are known to be a threat to bunchgrass grasslands and others are too recently introduced to predict their impacts.  Based on the number of weed introductions and rapidity of their expansion Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 259 Indirect and Cumulative Effects in recent years, it is easy to foresee new species entering and degrading remaining remnants (Lichthardt 2008) Ungulates. Because deer commonly feed on lawns, ornamental plants, and fruit trees, the effects on deer would be minimal as deer thrive near humans. However, moose would likely be negatively affected as complaints by homeowners that moose are eating ornamental shrubs in their yards or tearing down fences often lead to the removal of animals. In the Paradise Ridge area, if removal exceeds replenishment from immigration, moose would become temporary and intermittent residents. Habitat fragmentation and habitat loss as a result of continued rural residential development on Paradise Ridge would have the greatest effect to elk. (Melquist 2005a).  There are approximately 55 residences and commercial operations on and around Paradise Ridge; however, there are were no new permits for developments recorded with Latah County when researched in 2014 year (ITD 2014b). The cumulative effects of primarily current and future residential development and fragmentation and loss of habitat could be sufficient to eventually discourage elk use of the Paradise Ridge area. However, more important to the presence of elk in the Paradise Ridge area is maintaining connectivity to larger tracts of suitable habitat to the north and east, and ensuring the suitability of eastern corridor habitat patches. Unlike deer, elk are more sensitive to both temporary and permanent human intrusion into their habitats (Melquist 2005a). Cumulative Effects. Changes in land use as a result of the project would largely determine cumulative effects to wildlife. Potential increases in the rate of development due to the project and development unrelated to the project, added to the past effects of development and farming, which initially eliminated most of the native plant communities, could result in cumulative effects to native plant cummunities including Palouse prairie, rare plants and pine stands. There is a high probability of cumulative effects of future weed movements.  Minimizing the proximity of the disturbance to remnants, especially high quality remnants, will minimize the degree to which species and communities of conservation concern are affected. (Lichardt 2008). Further loss of Palouse remnants, rare plants and pine stands can be prevented by encouraging landowners, government entities, or conservation groups who value the habitats to purchase the parcels and preserve them or place land use restrictions on developing such sites. (Lichardt 2008). Many of the wildlife species that would occur in the project area are non-native species and habitat generalist species like raccoon, white-tail deer and a variety of other common species. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 260 Indirect and Cumulative Effects These species, while important locally, are mainly species already adaptable to habitat modifications and high levels of human use (Ruediger 2007). Elk and moose are more sensitive to human use patterns such as development compared to deer. Regardless, the suitable habitat for elk and moose is limited in quantity and quality and confined to the Paradise Ridge vicinity. While they may forage in the agricultural fields, they typically stay close to cover (Melquist 2005a). Since nearly all of the suitable elk and moose habitat is on Paradise Ridge and eastward, the cumulative effects to their habitat and to their movement is expected to be minimal. The effects of this project when combined with effects of past, present and future private and public developments in the area could result in cumulative adverse effects to wildlife habitat and movement.  It could also result in cumulative effects to Spalding’s catchfly.  These cumulative effects would include habitat loss, increased mortality, increased habitat fragmentation, and decreased habitat connectivity.  However, IDFG expects that overall healthy populations would continue (USFWS 2007).  Finally, thousands of acres of public lands with more suitable wildlife habitat are available north and east of Paradise Ridge and just over the Washington State Line.  Because of the availability of suitable habitat and species, there is not expected to be substantial cumulative effects to wildlife and the effects would not reduce population viability. Farmland Past Effects. The project is located in the rolling Palouse hills of southwestern Latah County. It lies on the eastern margin of the Columbia Plateau where lava flowed into low-lying areas leaving higher hills exposed. Over succeeding millennia, streams cut into the bedrock, windblown loess was thickly deposited over the surface, and seasonal flooding added alluvial sediments to valley floors (Bush, Provant, and Gill 1998; Othberg 1982). Highly fertile silt loam soils developed in the wind-deposited loess (Barker 1981). These geologic conditions created the basis for the highly productive Palouse soils, which are farmed today. Prior to Euro-American agricultural encroachment, the area was native grasslands and ponderosa pine, Douglas fir, and other tree species occurring in riparian zones and on some north-facing slopes (Franklin and Dyrness 1988). Today most of the region is farmed, with wheat and legumes being the primary crops.  There are also agricultural lands, typically low yielding areas that are voluntarily enrolled in CRP and removed from farming.  These lands are planted with native grasses and vegetation but landowners may withdraw from this program at any time.  See Section 3.3 Farmlands for a characterization of the farmland in Latah County and the project area. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 261 Indirect and Cumulative Effects Project Effects. Direct and indirect effects of the alternatives to farmland are discussed in Section 4.3 Farmland Effects and 6.1 Indirect Effects.  The effects include conversion of farmland to other uses, farm fragmentation and creation of smaller less efficiently farmed areas.  Future Effects. Future development south of Moscow and near planned developments in the western corridor could increase property values and encourage conversion of farmland to other uses.  However, the Latah County Comprehensive Plan designates much of the area as agricultural.  Those areas that are not zoned agricultural are closer to Moscow where growth has already been planned.  Cumulative Effects. The majority of the study area has already been converted to farmland with scattered urban and rural residential areas.  Any effects from the project in combination with the projects in the foreseeable future are not expected to result in a cumulative effect to farmland and farming practices.  There is abundant farmland available and the comprehensive plan is consistent with maintaining agricultural land uses. Wetlands and Tributaries Past Effects. Wetlands and tributaries in the South Fork Palouse River Subbasin have been extensively altered as a result of urban and agricultural development.  Approximately 97 percent of the wetlands in the Palouse have been converted to crops, hay, or pasture since 1870 (Black et al. 2003). Less than one percent of the historic grassland wetlands exist today. Most of the remaining small patches of grassland and riparian vegetation disappeared between 1940 and 1989 due to the increase in agricultural activities in the Palouse. Euro-American missionaries and settlers arrived in the Palouse region converting the land to a privately owned commodity. Faming removed much of the native vegetation, which led to increased soil erosion and down cutting of tributaries. As a result of the down cut channels, the water table receded, permitting bottom lands and small meadows formerly considered too wet to farm, to be farmed. The introduction of reed canarygrass, which was reportedly planted to reduce stream channel erosion, resulted in an aggressive colonization of reed canarygrass dominated lowlands. The grass invaded wet meadows and provided aggressive competition to native plants. Wetland drainage further reduced the extent of the native camas meadows; during the 1950s, many of the wet depressional areas of the Palouse were drained (Weddell 2001). Agricultural and urban development resulted in the channelizing of streams, removal of riparian vegetation, increased erosion and sedimentation and other water quality impacts (including high nutrient loading and high water temperatures).  This adversely affects fish and wildlife habitat.  Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 262 Indirect and Cumulative Effects Project Effects. The majority of the wetlands affected by the alternatives are rated as Category III, palustrine emergent wetlands.  Most are small, disturbed and less diverse than the surrounding environment. The E-2 Alternative will also impact 0.92 acres of palustrine scrub-shrub wetlands that offer greater habitat function, are less common and are considered to be more difficult to replace compared to the PEM wetlands.  Loss and degradation of additional wetlands and streams resulting from the alternatives would negatively affect the wetland system by further degrading water quality, vegetation removal and fill.  However, temporary and permanent stormwater best management practices will also be implemented which will help mitigate for water quality effects.  23 CFR 777 and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act require mitigation for affected wetland functions and values which will compensate for wetland and surface water effects. See Chapter 9. Environmental Commitments for how effects to wetlands and tributaries will be mitigated. Future Trends. Reasonably foreseeable urban and rural residential developments and farming activities could affect wetland and tributary functions and value through wetland fill, sediment deposit, pesticide use, vegetation removal and degradation of wildlife habitat. Many of the wetlands and tributaries located in the sub basins are in floodplains and subject to strict development restrictions.  Overall, there will continue to be conversion of wetlands to increasingly dense levels of urban development or farming in some areas.  Wetland functions will be lost in some portions of the area since all mitigation will likely not be accomplished at the site of the impacts. Tributaries that are impacted will likely be relocated or replaced which could result in degradation. Wetlands and tributaries that are determined to be jurisdictional by the Corps of Engineers are subject to the requirements of the CWA, Section 404(b)(1) guidelines and mitigation outlined in the Compensatory Mitigation for Losses of Aquatic Resources; Final Rule, April 10, 2008, [33 CFR 325] and [33 CFR 332, 40 CFR 230]. Cumulative Effects. The loss of wetlands and effects to tributaries resulting from this project, along with the loss of wetlands and degradation of tributaries due to past and future urban and agricultural development, could contribute to cumulative effects.  Ongoing agricultural activities and urban and rural residential growth, in addition to the project impacts, could result in cumulative impacts to wetlands, particularly to PSS wetlands. The successful implementation of wetland mitigation is expected to offset these potential cumulative effects. Floodplains Past Effects. Floodplains in Latah County have been degraded primarily as a result of past and ongoing farmland conversion. Road construction, scattered residential and industrial development has also contributed to the degradation. As a result, there has been vegetation Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 263 Indirect and Cumulative Effects removal, sedimentation and erosion and to a lesser extent bank shaping, channeling and other historical riparian modifications. Project Effects. The Modified W-4 and C-3 alternatives would encroach on the 100-year floodplain.  Prior to construction, a detailed floodplain study, floodplain development permit and hydraulic analysis will be completed.  The project will be designed to not result in a rise in base flood elevations and all structures in the floodplain will be designed to sufficiently pass hydraulic flow.  Therefore the alternatives are not expected to result in a substantial effect.  The E-2 Alternative would not encroach on the 100-year floodplain. Future Effects. Predicted growth in the study area is concentrated south of Moscow and west of existing US-95 so the potential effects to floodplains are primarily associated with the South Fork Palouse River.  However, that area has a designated floodway where no development is allowed.  Any proposed development within the mapped 100-year floodplain is required to complete a hydraulic analysis and to apply for a floodplain development permit.  Therefore it can be expected that any future developments would not substantially adversely affect the floodplains. Cumulative Effects. Effects to floodplains in Latah County have occurred primarily as a result of past and current agricultural activities, urban and residential development.  The proposed effects from the Modified W-4 and C-3 alternatives in combination with the past, present and reasonably foreseeable future effects could contribute to cumulative effects to floodplains. However with strict floodplain development regulations these are not expected to be significant. Since the E-2 Alternative would not encroach on floodplains, there would be no cumulative effects to floodplains as a result of the E-2 Alternative. Visual Effects Past Effects. The Palouse was dominated by native grasslands with scattered tree stands before euro American settlement.  Beginning in the early 1800s the area has continuously been converted to agricultural land with scattered urban and rural residential development.  Currently the agricultural views characterize the area.  Palouse remnants, the largest being Paradise Ridge, are also visible.  Most of the urban development is concentrated just south of Moscow and is continuing on Paradise Ridge.  Existing roadways and the power lines are now the most visible linear features in the area. Project Effects. The project would cause a high effect to residential viewpoints.  The project would result in moderate to low visual effects where the alternatives approach the City of Moscow and the setting is more developed.  Effects would be the result of grading, exposed Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 264 Indirect and Cumulative Effects soils, erosion, and unnatural slopes.  The addition of a new highway, structures, development and vegetation removal would also potentially affect the visual quality.  Future Effects. The projects in the reasonably foreseeable future would be primarily located south of Moscow and in the western corridor near the universities.  The area south of Moscow is already developed and therefore there would not be a substantial effect to visual quality.  Continued development on Paradise Ridge would result in changes to the viewshed.  These changes could be perceived as better, worse, or mixed depending on the perceptions and feelings of those viewing the area. Future transmission lines may potentially follow the alternatives’ alignment to facilitate access and to consolidate impacts into a single corridor.  This may further contribute to the additional contrast in the existing natural landscape. Direct effects to visual quality resulting from the alternatives are discussed in Section 4.11 Visual Quality Effects.  Cumulative Effects. The project would cause an overall high increase in cumulative impacts to sensitive viewers (residential viewpoints) due to the general lack of current viewshed impacts and the relatively natural setting for the majority of the alternatives, with a moderate to low increase in cumulative impacts where the alternatives approach the City of Moscow and the setting is more developed. Potential Mitigation Measures for Cumulative Effects While cumulative effects would result primarily from actions outside of the control of FHWA and ITD, CEQ regulations require that mitigation measures for cumulative effects be identified and discussed in this FEIS.  Potential mitigation measures could include the following: • Development projects will be required to implement mitigation for unavoidable adverse effects to wetlands and waters of the US according to the mitigation rule issued on March 31, 2008, by the EPA and the USACE under Section 404 of the CWA.  These regulations are designed to improve the effectiveness of compensatory mitigation to replace lost aquatic resource functions and area, expand public participation in compensatory mitigation decision making, and increase the efficiency and predictability of the mitigation project review process [33 CFR 332] [40 CFR 230]. • Many of the wetlands and streams are within a regulatory floodplain. The implementation of the National Floodplain Insurance Program (NFIP), a program managed by FEMA, should reduce negative effects to floodplains in the future.  Through the NFIP, FEMA has established minimum federal standards for floodplain regulation that are administered locally by cities and counties with state oversight by IDWR.

This will be based on adjacent property conditions and landowner preferences. • Latah County and the City of Moscow could pass protective ordinances for development on Palouse remnants including Paradise Ridge.  They could encourage planting of native plant species, such as Spalding’s catchfly, throughout the county.  • Latah County and the City of Moscow could pass additional protective ordinances for development in wetlands, streams associated riparian areas, farmland and wildlife habitat areas. • Latah County and the City of Moscow could encourage installation of watering areas further from the roadway and east of Paradise Ridge.  • Latah County, the City of Moscow or other agencies or conservation organizations could purchase properties, place development restrictions or implement other protective measures to protect Paradise Ridge and identified wildlife movement corridors from development.  They could establish protective ordinances for viewsheds or noise, which would benefit residents, travelers and wildlife. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 266 Public Involvement and Agency Coordination 7 PUBLIC	  INVOLVEMENT	  AND AGENCY COORDINATION A Public Involvement Plan has been developed to identify key goals, objectives and methods for this process. The public has had numerous opportunities to participate throughout the project including attending open houses, public workshops, breakfast meetings, and/or submitting written comments. A comprehensive list of the public involvement and meeting summaries and notes are available at www.itd.idaho.gov/Projects/D2/.  Details of the stakeholder, agency meetings and public comments are on file at the Idaho Transportation Department District 2 office. A multitude of public involvement activities and tools were employed as listed below: • Press Releases-38 Press Releases were used to announce public meetings • Breakfast Meetings-32 Breakfast Meetings were held between 2006 and 2009 to provide a forum for the public to get project updates, learn about the environmental analyses and to ask questions. • Newsletters-32 Newsletters were distributed between 2004 and 2007. The newsletters included project updates, feature stories, technical information and next steps. • Project Video-A video was shown during the public scoping meetings in 2005 to introduce the project purpose and need.  It was made available on the website and continuously updated on the project website. • Project Brochure-A project brochure was produced in 2006 and updated in 2010.  It provided the public with an overview of the project, including its background, components and the opportunities for public participation. • Public Meetings were held between 2004 and 2006 − Public scoping meetings were held November 3 and 4, 2004 to obtain preliminary input from the public regarding problems, solutions and possible alternatives.  There were approximately 500 attendees and 300 comments received. − Alternative Alignment Workshops were held on January 19 and 20, 2005.  These workshops presented a range of possible alternatives and alignments to the public based on previous input and analysis. There were approximately 200 participants and 550 comments received. − Public Open House Meeting-An open house was held April 13, 2005.  The meeting presented results from the Alternative Alignment Workshops and showed the next steps for the project.  There were over 100 attendees and 27 comments received. − Public Open House-Additional open house meetings were held January 18 and 19, 2006.  The 11 initial alternatives (No action and 10 Action Alternatives) were presented for public input. ITD’s recommendations for alternatives and environmental studies were also presented.  There were approximately 600 participants and 695 comments received. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 267 Public Involvement and Agency Coordination • Community Presentation/workshops and Interviews were held throughout the project development. • Information Kiosks-Mobile kiosks were placed at two public locations to provide project information and to collect public input between November 2004 and June 2005. • Community Impact Assessment-This study included three days of completing community member interviews, questionnaires and all day drop-ins, which were compiled in 2006 and updated in 2011. See the Community Impact Technical Reports. • Fact sheets and handouts were developed when detailed information about a particular issue was needed for distribution to a wide audience or for meetings. • A Project Website was developed and is maintained for the project duration.  It is available at www.itd.idaho.gov/Projects/D2/.  The website provides the public with information including progress updates and public involvement activities and allows questions to be raised or comments to be made. The website is updated continuously with milestones, press releases, relevant project materials, reports, and comments collected. • Property owner meetings and stakeholder interviews were conducted throughout the project development process Stakeholder interviews were conducted at two stages in the environmental process: during initial scoping, and during the development and evaluation of potential alternatives.  This enabled ITD and FHWA to gain an in-depth understanding of community issues, values, and constraints regarding the proposed action. During the initial scoping, interviews were conducted with local elected and appointed officials, community transportation and planning officials, and business owners in and near the study area. Stakeholder interviews were conducted during the development and evaluation of potential alternatives. These were documented in the scoping report on file at ITD District 2. Federal, state, and local agencies and The Nez Perce Tribe representatives that would have an interest in the project participated in the scoping and development of alternatives. The agencies reviewed and provided input on goals and the purpose and need statement, assessed the transportation needs for the corridor, evaluated and reviewed screening methodologies, and provided input on a range of alternatives. Coordination meetings were held with the agencies to explain the process, define the agencies’ roles, and to solicit feedback at various stages in the development of the proposed action. The Nez Perce Tribe reservation boundaries are located south of the project area and do not occur within the project study area.  The Nez Perce Tribe was consulted with throughout the development of the project.  They were provided copies of all the cultural resource documents prepared for the project. In addition, the ITD District Administrator has been meeting with the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 268 Public Involvement and Agency Coordination Nez Perce Tribe quarterly since 2002 to discuss ITD District 2 projects, which included US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow. ITD has a Memorandum of Understanding with SHPO and the Nez Perce Tribe.  See Appendix 1. Key Agency Correspondence and Forms.  Tribal consultation meetings occurred on the dates listed below:  • December 9, 2004 • September 8, 2005 • December 8, 2005 • March 9, 2006 • November 27, 2006 • March 26, 2007 • February 27, 2008 • July 14, 2008 • November 13, 2008 • March 12, 2009 • June 11, 2009 • December 10, 2009 • February 11, 2010 • April 15, 2010 • October 14, 2010 • August 22, 2011 • March 1, 2012 Public and agency comments received during the public involvement process were used to identify the range of reasonable alternatives and to identify environmental issues to be evaluated.  The summaries of the public involvement opportunities are posted on the project website and located at the ITD District 2 office.  The major themes of the public concerns included: • Opposition to western alternative due to noise and visual effects to University Arboretum and effects to historical and residential properties • Opposition to the eastern alternative due to possible effects to Paradise Ridge. • Support for the eastern alternative because it is an ecologically sound and cost-effective alternative and because it is the safest and shortest alternative. • Support for the central alternative because it uses less undeveloped land and causes the least effect to the community and wildlife. It is also the closest to current route. • Support to improve the existing highway because it is the least costly.  Passing lanes could be added and Reisenauer Hill could be modified to reduce hazards. • ITD has not been clear in showing how the eastern and western alternatives would be seen from the city of Moscow. • Safety and efficiency should be the most important criteria used in selecting an alternative. • The public needs to attend the upcoming public hearing to voice input and ask questions. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 269 Public Involvement and Agency Coordination • ITD has not altered any of the three proposed alternatives after extensive public input. • The Giant Palouse Earthworm was petitioned to the U.S. Department of Interior for listing on the Endangered Species Act; however, the earthworm was not listed. The Earthworm’s habitat is within the scope of this project and should be included in ITD’s environmental analysis. • How did ITD draw their conclusions from the public meeting comments? • Did ITD include all comments received from the public in their analysis? • What is the time frame for a decision? How would the public be notified of the decision? • How many miles would a five-lane with center turn lane alternative be? • How many miles would be turned over to the Latah County Highway District? • Has ITD conducted a storm water analysis? • Bird watchers on the Palouse submitted a petition with 14 signatures that opposed moving US-95 near Paradise Ridge, specifically opposing the E2 alternative. • A second petition was submitted by a separate group, with 361 signatures opposing the E-2 Alternative. There was a 45-day public comment period during which oral and written testimonies regarding the DEIS and alternatives were collected.  A public hearing was held during the public comment period. 7.1 Public	  Involvement Since DEIS	  Publication 7.1.1 Public Hearing A public hearing was held to provide the public with information regarding the project, the alternatives and impacts in compliance with 23 CFR 771.

It describes any physical or fiscal constraints associated with implementing an Action Alternative should one be selected. 8.1 Regulatory Framework and Policies FHWA is required to identify physical and funding limitations associated with constructing an entire project at one time, including phasing and fiscal constraints.  NEPA also requires that construction effects be evaluated and disclosed to the public. 8.2 Methodology The project phasing for this project is consistent with FHWA’s objective of analyzing and selecting transportation solutions on a broad enough scale to provide meaningful analysis. Construction phasing was evaluated by considering construction effects of each alternative as applicable.  Funding effects were determined by evaluating if the project would need to be phased due to funding or logical construction constraints. 8.3 Construction Phasing The US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow alternatives vary in length from 5.85 miles (E-2) to 6.65 miles (W-4) which are feasible to construct in one construction package. It is the intent of ITD and FHWA to implement the selected alternative in its entirety in one construction phase.  However, this section also describes construction phasing should the funding become available in phases.  The following timeline is anticipated but is contingent on completion and approval of the EIS process and funding availability.  Construction for any of the Action Alternatives is anticipated to take two full seasons and would begin in the spring of 2016.  See Table 70. Project Milestones. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 273 Construction Phasing and Funding Table	  70.	  Project	  Milestones Phase  Year  ROD issued  2015  Preliminary Design begins  2015  Right-‐of-‐way Acquisition begins  2015  Final Design begins  2016  Construction	  begins  2016  Construction	  completed  2017  Sequencing of the construction activities for this project would largely be dependent on the locations of areas requiring large cuts or excavation of native material and areas requiring large amounts of fill material for the roadway.  While the construction phasing would be determined based on funding, it is expected that the selected alternative would be constructed in one phase in its entirety.  Construction of any of the Action Alternatives would most likely begin with the bridge structure and the areas where the road is realigned.  In areas where the existing roadway will be widened, building one side of the highway would allow it to operate during construction.  All of the Action Alternatives would utilize commercial material sources.  Staging areas, stockpile sites and waste sites would be determined by the contractor.  Waste sites and haul roads may be off-site but would be approved by ITD.  All construction activities would be completed according to the ITD Standard Specifications (c) with amendments and would comply with applicable laws, regulations, and the environmental commitments listed in Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments.  All transitions and connections to the existing highways, public and private roadways would be designed to AASHTO standards. 8.4 Project Funding The estimated total project cost for any of the Action Alternatives would range between $55 and $62 million. Engineering is estimated at approximately $1.6 million for any of the Action Alternatives. See Table 71. Cost Estimate for Alternatives. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 274 Construction Phasing and Funding Table	  71.	  Cost	  Estimate	  for	  Alternatives Alternative  Construction	  Cost (million $)*  Total Project Cost (million $)  No Action  Minimal  Minimal  Modified W-‐4  52  62  C-‐3  43  58  E-‐2  46  55  *Note: The estimated cost includes excavation, rock ballast, plant mix, structures, traffic control and illumination.

ITD also maintains a set of standard specifications that state the requirements and standards for construction of ITD projects.  The ITD Standard Specifications (ITD 2012c) and its updates would be used to prepare the contract documents for the construction of the alternative if an Action Alternative is selected. The ITD Standard Specifications requires that a SWPPP be prepared and implemented for this project.  This would include Best Management Practices (BMPs) for protection of wetlands, water quality, floodplains, and other sensitive areas.  It requires BMPs for erosion and sediment control, spill prevention, revegetation, and environmental construction compliance monitoring.  The most current versions of the ITD Standard Specification for Highway Construction, the ITD Maintenance Manual and Best Management Practices may be found at the ITD website: http://itd.idaho.gov/manuals/manualsonline.htm. ITD standard specifications also include provisions for: • Unanticipated discovery of cultural resources • Preparation of a revegetation plan • Preparation of a Traffic Control Plan • Use of weed free materials and noxious weed control on the construction site • Maintain access to all roadways during construction • Handling and disposal of waste • Approval of material sources, waste sites, haul routes, staging areas and stockpile sites • Control of fugitive dust ITD also maintains a set of standard drawings that provide guidelines for highway design elements.  These standard drawings incorporate several measures that would minimize visual impacts of the project including: • Reseeding exposed soils with native grasses. • Farming to the bottom of the ditch on slopes of 4:1 or flatter. • Creating rounded slopes and gradually tying slopes back to blend with the existing terrain. • Balancing cuts and fills which would reduce the overall scaring of the landscape. Avoidance and measures to minimize adverse effects are described in Chapter 4, Environmental Consequences.

The responses to individual comments may reference the general comments and responses in Table 76. General Responses to Issues. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 297 Table	  76.	  General	  Responses	  to	  Issues General Response Name  General Comment  General Response  Access  What will the access be for the new highway? How will access control be enforced? Will growth along the highway result in	  more approaches and accesses and worsened safety for	  the alternatives?  The access control for this segment of US-‐95	  is currently Statewide Access Control. The proposed	  US-‐95	  Action Alternatives 	  were 	  designated 	  as 	  Expressway Access Control through an Idaho Transportation Board	  action on January 15 & 16, 2014.	  (See the Safety Analysis Technical Report for	  the agenda and board minutes). Expressway Access Control is a	  segment of a highway designated	  by the Idaho	  Transportation Board for	  use as a through highway, with partially controlled access, accessible only	  at locations	  specified by	  ITD,	  and 	  characterized 	  by 	  medians,	  limited 	  at-‐grade	  intersections, and high speeds. An existing segment of state highway may only be designated as an expressway	  if payment is made	  to adjacent property	  owners for the	  restriction of existing access rights [IDAPA 39.03.42].	  While the District Engineer has the authority to approve a decrease in the spacing requirements for	  other	  access types,	  the Expressway Access Control does not	  have spacing requirements; therefore, access is allowed only at	  locations designated	  by ITD which	  will be determined	  in	  collaboration with the landowner during the right-‐of-‐way process. This is stated in the IDAPA 39.03.42 Section 400.03, which is reflected in ITD’s 0606 Form for Current Access Purchase Determination. A	  blank sample of the ITD 0606 Form that	  would be used is provided in the Safety Analysis Technical Report.	  ITD will	  be required to comply with their access	  policy	  and will have the regulatory power	  to limit	  access. The FHWA and ITD would purchase access rights in accordance to Idaho Board Policy-‐4005, which incorporated 	  the 	  recently 	  revised 	  IDAPA 	  Rule 	  39.03.42 Rules Governing	  Right-‐of-‐Way Encroachments on	  State Rights-‐of-‐Way and Management of Department-‐Owned Property.	  The appraiser will perform a	  before	  and after appraisal that will specifically address the	  access. The	  deed	  for the properties will specify the access points at specific locations discussed with the	  property owner stating width, location	  and	  the type of use of the access. This is expected to reduce development pressures and associated environmental impacts along the new highway alignment	  and preserve the safety benefit of the alternatives. Ultimately, development is regulated	  by land	  use planning agencies in	  the City of Moscow and	  Latah	  County. See	  FEIS	  Chapter 6, Indirect and Cumulative	  Effects.	  Additional	  information was added regarding past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future impacts to Paradise Ridge and Palouse	  remnants as a	  result of the	  project. Expressway Access Control is discussed in the	  FEIS, Sections ES.6, 2.4.2	  and 4.10.3.  General Response Name  General Comment  General Response  Agency  Idaho 	  Department 	  of 	  Fish	  and Game	  (IDFG), US	  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and	  the US Fish and Wildlife	  Survey (USFWS)	  prefer	  the central route. Why did ITD identify the E-‐2	  Alternative as their Preferred Alternative?  The IDFG, EPA and USFWS	  expressed support for the C-‐3	  Alternative based upon their respective missions to prioritize natural resources including wildlife, water resources and threatened and endangered species.	  National	  Environmental	  Policy Act (NEPA) requires	  FHWA and ITD to evaluate	  and consider the	  alternatives’ impacts to both the	  human and natural environment while taking into account the public’s need for a safe and efficient transportation system. See DEIS and FEIS Section 1.4. See the DEIS and FEIS Section 2.6, Preferred Alternative for additional information 	  regarding 	  why 	  the 	  E-‐2	  Alternative was identified as ITD’s and FHWA’s Preferred Alternative. Although	  individual resource agencies and	  others focus on	  their specific resource issues,	  FHWA 	  and 	  ITD 	  have 	  avoided 	  and 	  minimized 	  the 	  overall 	  environmental 	  impacts 	  as practicable and	  will implement the mitigation	  measures outlined	  in	  the FEIS Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments to further mitigate the environmental impacts. ITD met with IDFG during the FEIS development and	  agreed	  upon	  the mitigation	  measures described	  in	  Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments. ITD will collaborate with IDFG on refining the details of mitigation before final design	  to	  help	  ensure mitigation	  success. For clarification, the US Army	  Corps	  of Engineers	  did not support or object to any	  of the alternatives. They will make	  their decision regarding	  the	  Least Environmentally Damaging	  Practicable	  Alternative	  (LEDPA) during the	  project permitting process and after the	  Section 404(b)(1) Analysis has been completed.  Alternative  Why did FHWA and ITD identify 	  the 	  E-‐2	  Alternative as their preferred alternative?  The E-‐2	  Alternative was identified as FHWA’s and ITD’s Preferred Alternative because it balances the human and natural resource impacts with the public need for	  a safe and efficient	  transportation system. Some of	  the considerations are: • It 	  would 	  have 	  the 	  greatest 	  safety improvement • It 	  would 	  have 	  the 	  fewest 	  access 	  points • It 	  would 	  have 	  the 	  shortest 	  length of five lane section	  and	  therefore would	  be safer • It 	  would 	  have 	  the 	  least 	  effect 	  to 	  streams • It 	  would 	  avoid 	  effects 	  to 	  cultural/Section 	  4(f) 	  resources,	  floodplains and business impacts. The primary disadvantages of E-‐2	  compared to the other	  alternatives are that	  it	  would be located along	  the	  base	  of Paradise	  Ridge and would be	  closer to it but would not go over it. This could increase 	  weed 	  establishment 	  and 	  spread 	  up 	  to 	  0.6 	  miles 	  from 	  the 	  roadway.	  	  Paradise 	  Ridge provides moderate or marginal ungulate habitat and	  E 2 would	  affect pine stands that offer long General Response Name  General Comment  General Response  eared myotis, northern alligator lizard and pygmy nuthatch habitat. See General Response NEPA	  for	  detail regarding the NEPA process.  Displacement-‐1  Why were there inconsistencies 	  between the number	  of	  displaced residences and businesses published	  in	  the DEIS and	  what was communicated by ITD’s 	  right-‐of-‐way staff during the public hearing? −  ITD 	  reviewed 	  the 	  residential	  and 	  business 	  displacements 	  after 	  the 	  public 	  hearing. 	  The displacement numbers in	  the DEIS are based	  on	  a conceptual level of detail using conservative estimates; however, they were	  correct based upon the	  assumptions used at the	  time. Determination of exact displacements requires a greater level of detail than is available at this time because detailed topographic, survey data; geotechnical information and design detail is currently	  not available. If an action alternative is 	  selected, 	  then 	  the 	  design 	  process 	  would 	  use specific	  topographic, detailed survey data and geotechnical information to determine right-‐ofway needs and design detail. ITD will work with landowners and business owners one-‐on-‐one during the right-‐of-‐way and design processes to explore	  engineering	  solutions that could minimize visual or other proximity impacts. All residents and	  property owners will be compensated equitably	  according to the Uniform Relocation Act. The assumptions and	  terminology for residential and	  business effects were reviewed	  and	  revised	  in 	  the 	  FEIS.	  Residential and business effects are	  now described as “impacts” and “potential impacts”.	  	  An 	  “impact” 	  was 	  considered 	  to 	  be 	  when 	  the 	  conceptual	  level	  alignment cut and fill boundaries and	  right-‐of-‐way encroached upon a	  structure, well, septic, access or otherwise	  appears to substantially impair the	  property so that relocation is	  assumed.	  A “potential	  impact” was considered where the conceptual level alignment cut and	  fill boundaries and	  right-‐of-‐way falls close to a structure, well, septic, access or	  other	  important	  property features and have the potential to	  result in impact 	  but 	  does 	  not 	  physically 	  encroach 	  upon 	  it so relocation is not	  assumed. The residential and business effects are shown in the tables below: Table	  75. Residential Effects DEIS Residential FEIS	  Residential FEIS	  Potential Alternative Displacement Impacts Residential Impacts No Action 0 0 0 W-‐4/Modified W-‐4 3 3 2 C-‐3 7 2 5 E-‐2 5 7 6  General Response Name  General Comment  General Response  Table	  76. Business Effects Alternative DEIS Business FEIS	  Business FEIS	  Potential Displacements Impacts Business Impacts No Action 0 0 0 W-‐4/Modified W-‐4 0 0 0 C-‐3 8 0 8 E-‐2 0 0 0 The revised numbers resulted in relative differences in the residential and business impacts so that	  the C-‐3	  Alternative would have 5	  fewer	  residential impacts than the E-‐2	  Alternative and 8	  potential business impacts. The Green Acres RV Park spaces	  were counted as	  one business	  impact.	  The potential business impacts include; Mr. Cabinet, an RV park, Singar Inc., and home based	  businesses.	  The residential	  and business effects are revised in the FEIS Sections ES.6, 2.6, and 4.1 and 4.12.	  Indirect and cumulative effects are	  discussed in the	  FEIS	  Chapter 6. See	  Appendix 5, Uniform Relocation	  Act for detail regarding the requirements under the Act.  Displacement-‐2  There are inconsistencies in numbers of residential and	  business displacements between	  different parts of the documents. E.g., C-‐3	  eliminates 7 residences in Table 8	  of the DEIS	  but only 3	  in the Screening of Alternative document on	  page 17.  The FEIS	  distinguishes the residential and business right-‐of-‐way impacts by categorizing them into	  term “impact” and “potential impact” . Determining exact	  displacements requires a greater	  level of detail than	  is currently available. The differences between	  displaced	  residences and	  businesses that	  are referenced in the comments differ	  because Table 8 of	  the DEIS refers to the displacements from the alternatives analyzed	  in	  the DEIS while page 17 refers to	  the 11 initial alternative	  alignments which were	  screened, which had different project limits, a	  more	  conceptual level of detail without cut and fill lines, and with differing	  assumptions for what constituted a displacement. This	  difference in numbers	  of displacements	  is	  explained in the DEIS Section 2.5.1, in the	  middle	  of page	  39. “It should be	  noted that the	  lengths of the	  W-‐4, C-‐3	  and E-‐2	  alternatives early in the	  screening	  process differ from the	  lengths analyzed in the DEIS due to a	  modification of the	  project limits. As a	  result, the	  lengths and calculations presented during	  the	  screening process	  may differ from those presented in this	  FEIS	  for the Modified	  W-‐4, C-‐3	  and E-‐2	  alternatives.” The	  DEIS, page	  53	  and The	  footnote	  to Table	  8, Summary of Alternatives’ Benefits and Effects at the	  top of page	  54	  also make	  similar statements. This statement has been further clarified to explain the differences	  in the assumptions for	  what	  constituted a displacement. The displacements and	  differences in	  the numbers are clarified	  in	  the FEIS Sections 4.1. The  General Response Name  General Comment  General Response  discrepancy between	  displacement numbers in	  the DEIS has been	  corrected. Displacements of the noise receptors were reviewed and updated based upon the changes to the assumptions for residential and business impacts and potentially impacted	  residences and	  business structures.	  There are some residential	  structures and trailer spaces that were not listed	  as noise	  receptors because	  there	  were	  no permanent structures when monitored. Noiseimpacted 	  receptors that	  meet	  the FHWA noise abatement	  criteria but would be physically impacted and assumed not to exist after construction were noted. Those structures that would	  only be potentially impacted	  were assumed	  to	  exist after construction. This information	  was reconciled and explained in the different	  FEIS sections. See the FEIS Section 4.12. The impacts and potential impacts in	  the Noise 	  Analyses 	  were 	  also 	  corrected.	  	   Maintenance-‐1  Will the remaining US-‐95	  loop 	  be 	  maintained? 	  How much will winter maintenance cost?  ITD 	  will	  negotiate 	  the 	  transfer 	  of 	  ownership 	  of 	  the 	  remaining 	  US-‐95	  loop to the North Latah Highway District (NLHD). If the NLHD accepts ownership	  of the remaining US-‐95	  loop, they will be responsible for	  safely maintaining it. The NLHD budgets consist	  of	  revenues from local, state and federal funding sources, which are used for road maintenance, such as	  plowing and dust control, equipment maintenance	  and labor costs. Funding for maintenance	  is allocated based on priorities and annually approved budgets, which would also consider the	  remaining	  US-‐95	  loop. The additional pavement may eventually require improvements over the	  long	  term; however, the	  lower 	  traffic 	  volumes and reduced truck travel on the	  remaining	  US-‐95	  loop would result in less overall maintenance requirements. Information	  regarding alignment lengths and	  the lengths that may be	  turned over to NLHD is in the	  DEIS	  Summary of Alternatives. Additional information regarding total pavement	  length by alternative and maintenance has been added to the FEIS, Section 4.10. The	  NLHD crews currently travel through this section of US-‐95 during winter maintenance of the county roads; therefore, additional mobilization costs for winter maintenance would not be substantial. Also see DEIS and FEIS Section 4.15 for a discussion of maintenance energy effects.  Maintenance-‐2  Will	  the 	  remaining 	  US-‐95	  loop 	  continue 	  to 	  have 	  the existing	  safety hazards?  ITD 	  will	  negotiate 	  the 	  transfer 	  of 	  the 	  remaining 	  US-‐95	  loop with the NLHD. While it is not known yet what the conditions of the transfer will be, NLHD will be responsible 	  for 	  safely 	  maintaining 	  it as part of their local roadway system. While	  some	  of the	  remaining	  deficiencies may still be	  present on	  the existing US-‐95	  loop, the traffic volumes will be reduced by 95 to 97 percent depending on	  the alternative	  and the	  numbers of crashes are	  predicted to decrease	  significantly. See	  the	  Revised Safety Analysis (ITD 2013).  General Response Name  General Comment  General Response  NEPA  What is the required environmental process?  FHWA and ITD are	  required to follow the	  National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1966 as amended and the	  FHWA NEPA implementing	  regulations [23	  CFR 771]. NEPA requires Federal agencies to prepare	  environmental impact statements (EISs) for major Federal actions that significantly affect the quality of the human environment and consider the	  effects of the	  alternatives. As stated in the	  DEIS	  and FEIS, Chapter 1, the	  US	  District Court for the	  District of Idaho 	  in 	  the 	  judgment 	  for 	  Civil	  Case 	  number 	  03-‐0156-‐S-‐BLW decided	  an	  EIS would	  be required	  for the northern 4.6 mile segment	  between Thorncreek Road and Moscow to allow full consideration of the impacts by the public and	  agencies. An	  EIS is a full disclosure document that details the process through	  which	  a transportation	  project was developed, includes consideration of	  a range of	  reasonable alternatives, analyzes the potential impacts resulting from the alternatives, and	  demonstrates compliance with	  other applicable	  environmental laws and executive	  orders. FHWA TA 6640.8A NEPA ImplementationGuidance for Preparing	  and Processing	  Environmental and Section 4(f) Documents provides detailed	  guidance on	  the preparation	  of the EIS. Four milestones in	  the EIS process are listed	  below. 1. Notice of Intent (NOI) 2. Draft EIS	  (DEIS) 3. Final EIS	  (FEIS) 4. Record of Decision	  (ROD) The NOI was published in the Federal Register by FHWA in November 2003	  and signaled the initiation 	  of 	  the 	  EIS 	  process.	  	  Scoping, 	  an 	  open 	  process 	  involving 	  the 	  public 	  and 	  other 	  federal, state and local, agencies, identified the major and important issues	  for consideration during the study. Public	  involvement and agency coordination has	  continued throughout the entire process. See	  FEIS	  Chapter 7, Public Involvement and Agency Coordination, for details. The DEIS	  provided a	  detailed description of the	  proposal, the	  purpose	  and need, a	  range	  of reasonable alternatives, the affected environment, and presented analysis of	  the anticipated beneficial and	  adverse environmental effects of the alternatives. The DEIS evaluated	  the No	  Action, W-‐4, C-‐3	  and E-‐2	  alternatives in detail. The DEIS	  was made available for public comment from January 4 to March 25, 2013. The FEIS	  was prepared after the end of the DEIS	  public comment period. It addresses the substantive public	  comments, makes	  corrections and provides additional information as a result	  of public comment. It identifies the Preferred	  Alternative and	  lists the mitigation	  measures that  General Response Name  General Comment  General Response  would offset the environmental effects. A Notice of Availability 	  was published	  in	  the Federal Register. The ROD will select an action alternative, a	  combination of the action alternatives, or the No Action	  Alternative. The ROD will also	  provide the rationale for the decision	  and	  identify mitigation measures.  Safety-‐1  Could	  the C-‐3	  Alternative be as safe	  as the	  E-‐2	  Alternative if frontage roads are added to the fivelane 	  suburban 	  section? −  The C-‐3	  Alternative with frontage roads added along the five-‐lane 	  suburban 	  section 	  was evaluated after the	  DEIS	  comment period. The	  additional frontage	  roads would create an excessively wide	  right-‐of-‐way footprint, would have high impacts to businesses,	  would 	  increase environmental impacts and would have	  less safety benefit than	  the E-‐2	  Alternative. If 	  frontage 	  roads 	  are 	  added to the C-‐3	  Alternative, the five-‐lane 	  section 	  would 	  be 	  changed 	  to 	  a four-‐lane 	  section 	  with 	  a 	  two-‐lane 	  frontage 	  roads 	  on 	  each 	  side 	  of 	  US-‐95	  from the top of Clyde Hill to the grain elevators. Each frontage road would have two-‐12-‐ft. lanes with curb, gutter	  and sidewalk, with a minimum of two-‐ft. shoulders. The width of	  the C-‐3	  Alternative would increase from 120 feet	  (for	  the five-‐lane 	  section), 	  to 	  250-‐300	  ft (for the C-‐3	  Alternative with frontage roads). The wider	  footprint	  would result	  in approximately $7.2 million additional	  cost for construction, which does	  not include the additional right-‐of-‐way or relocation costs. Adding the frontage roads would result	  in greater	  impacts to 11 businesses,	  six of which	  were not originally considered impacted by	  the C-‐3	  Alternative. There would also be greater impacts to floodplains,	  prime farmland and more	  impervious surface	  compared to the	  original C-‐3	  Alternative. Adding frontage roads to the C-‐3	  Alternative would reduce the number of predicted crashes because the length	  of the five-‐lane 	  suburban 	  section 	  with 	  a 	  two-‐way left turning lane would be reduced and the four-‐lane 	  divided 	  highway 	  would 	  be 	  increased.	  	  The 	  five-‐lane 	  suburban	  section	  with a two-‐way left turning lane generates 3.4 crashes per centerline mile and the four-‐lane divided	  highway generates 1.1 crashes per mile. However, the C-‐3	  Alternative would still have a	  higher crash	  rate than	  the E-‐2	  Alternative because it 	  would 	  still	  have 	  more 	  county 	  road intersections 	  than 	  the 	  E-‐2	  Alternative.  Safety-‐2  Why doesn’t the Safety Analysis include crash	  factors to account	  for	  a greater number of predicted	  wild	  animal crashes on	  the E-‐2	   The frequency of wild animal crashes is 	  difficult 	  to 	  predict;	  however, 	  the 	  severity 	  is 	  observed 	  to be very low compared	  to	  other crash	  types. Wild	  animal crash	  potential was expected	  to	  be greater on the	  E-‐2	  Alternative based on opinions of wildlife experts because it would pass through 1.98 miles of	  low to moderate quality ungulate habitat; however, crash	  counter measures (improved typical sections,	  straightened 	  alignments 	  and 	  accommodating 	  wildlife crossing)	  may mitigate for	  this.  General Response Name  General Comment  General Response  Alternative	  than W-‐4	  and  The Highway Safety Manual (HSM) Analysis Technique predicts some wild animal crashes within  C-‐3	  alternatives?  the base formula; therefore, the predicted crashes for	  each alternative generated using the Safety Analysis include	  wild animal predictions. The	  crash countermeasures are	  predicted to reduce the total number	  of	  wild animal crashes to a rate similar	  to the number	  of	  wild animal crashes predicted in the	  base	  rate	  of the	  HSM. Sight distance	  on E-‐2	  is greater than Modified W-‐4	  and C-‐3	  due to its straighter roadway geometry	  and may	  offset the	  higher wild animal crash potential in that corridor. Roadside	  clearing is	  predicted to greatly	  reduce	  wild animal crash potential on all action alternatives, because brush	  and	  vegetation	  where wild	  animals can	  hide would	  be removed	  close to	  the highway. This would	  also	  improve driver reaction	  time. The roadside clearing technique was found to reduce wild animal crashes up	  to	  90 percent as demonstrated	  on	  US-‐20	  between MP	  369	  and MP	  375	  which had similar improvements (ITD 2013). Under-‐crossings	  at county	  roads	  and fencing will be used to direct wildlife to appropriate crossing locations 	  and 	  accommodate 	  wildlife.	  	  Culverts 	  at 	  drainages 	  will	  also 	  be 	  designed 	  to 	  accommodate movement of small terrestrial and aquatic species. If the E-‐2	  Alternative is selected, ITD will monitor wild animal crashes to determine whether future mitigation	  is warranted. More detailed	  information 	  regarding 	  wild 	  animal	  crashes 	  was 	  added 	  to 	  the 	  FEIS 	  Section 	  3.10 	  and 	  4.10 	  and 	  the Revised	  Safety Analysis (ITD 2013). See FEIS Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments for additional mitigation measures.  Safety-‐3  If 	  the 	  safety of the remaining US-‐95	  loop is considered, would the relative safety of	  the alternatives change? −  After the DEIS comment period, ITD revised	  the Safety Analysis to	  include the predicted	  crashes on the remaining US-‐95	  loop which may be turned over to the NLHD. Only a	  fraction of the motorists that use US-‐95	  today are predicted to use the remaining US-‐95	  Loop if an action alternative	  is selected. The	  traffic on the	  rural section of the	  remaining	  US-‐95	  loop is expected to decrease by 95 to	  97 percent depending upon	  the alternative. The traffic in	  the suburban	  section	  south of Moscow is	  expected to reduce by 80 percent. This	  significant predicted reduction will result	  in much fewer	  crashes on the 	  remaining US-‐95	  Loop than existing conditions. The Revised Safety Analysis (ITD 2013) predicts that even considering the existing safety deficiencies on	  the remaining US-‐95	  Loop, the relative safety benefits of the alternatives are consistent with	  the findings in	  the DEIS, although	  the total numbers of predicted	  crashes have changed for the alternatives. The E-‐2	  Alternative would still result in the greatest safety benefit compared to the other alternatives. The E-‐2	  Alternative would have 9	  fewer predicted fatal and injury 	  crashes 	  than 	  the 	  C-‐3	  Alternative and 16	  fewer fatal and injury crashes than the Modified  General Response Name  General Comment  General Response  W-‐4	  Alternative in the 20-‐year design period. See General Response Safety-‐6	  for a	  summary of the differences in the safety between alternatives.	  See 	  FEIS 	  Section 	  4.10 	  Transportation 	  Effects and the	  Revised Safety Analysis (ITD 2013) for more	  detail.  Safety-‐4  Can	  improvements such	  as adding	  signage, flashing	  lights, 	  rumble 	  strips, medians or guardrails and speed limit reductions, be made to	  existing US-‐95	  to address the	  safety deficiencies?  Safety improvements on existing US-‐95	  that do not require realignment may offer modest improvements 	  but 	  would 	  not 	  provide 	  a 	  comprehensive, 	  long-‐term solution, nor	  would it	  effectively address the	  project purpose	  and need because	  they would not effectively address the	  most serious roadway deficiencies related to access, horizontal and vertical grade and sight distance. Realigning the road	  along a flatter grade and	  creating a straighter road	  alignment would	  improve 	  sight 	  distance, 	  curvature 	  and 	  grade.	  It 	  would 	  also 	  reduce 	  accidents 	  due 	  to 	  maneuvering steep grades	  or sharp curves, which can be more dangerous	  on hazardous	  road conditions. Reduction	  in	  Speed	  Limit: Speed	  limits are based	  on	  guidance	  from the	  Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), which	  is used	  by all 50 State Departments of Transportation	  (DOTs) and the	  ITD Traffic Manual. Adoption and use	  of the	  MUTCD is a	  regulatory requirement (23CFR 655.603) and it is incorporated into Idaho Administrative Code, IDAPA 39.03.41. The manuals follow fundamental concepts based on engineering studies to establish realistic and reasonable speed zones	  so that the majority of motorists	  observe it voluntarily. The MUTCD states	  that speed	  zones should	  be posted	  within	  five miles per hour (mph) of the 85th	  percentile speed	  (the speed at or below which 85 percent of the vehicles	  travel) of free-‐flowing traffic. The lowest crash rate occurs when vehicles are traveling one standard deviation above the mean speed, which is	  approximately equivalent to the 85th percentile speed or slightly above. If speed limits 	  are 	  arbitrarily 	  posted 	  low, 	  people 	  will	  disregard 	  them, 	  which 	  results 	  in 	  vehicles 	  traveling 	  at varying	  or differential speeds, which	  would	  result in	  more crashes (ITD Traffic Manual Section	  103.3). FHWA Report No. FHWA-‐RD-‐92-‐084	  supports these basic engineering principals. The report was written to determine the effects of arbitrarily raising and lowering the posted speed limits on different highways on	  driver behavior. In	  34 locations, the posted	  speed	  limit was within	  5 miles per hour of the 85th	  percentile speed. When	  the speed	  limits were reduced	  by 5, 10, 15, or 20 miles per hour at these locations the mean difference in percentile	  speeds were	  less than one	  mile per hour. Lowering the speed limit does not mean that traffic will slow down. A	  speed	  study conducted	  on	  US-‐95	  between Thorncreek Road and Moscow by the	  ITD from September 17	  through September 20, 2012	  confirmed that a	  60-‐mile per hour speed limit is appropriate	  because	  the	  85th percentile	  speed is 64	  miles per hour.  General Response Name  General Comment  General Response  Warning Signs and Flashing Warning Beacons: The MUTCD provides the standards that all 50 State	  DOT’s use	  for guidance	  on signing and pavement marking. The	  MUTCD states, “The	  use	  of warning signs should be kept to a minimum as the unnecessary use of warning signs tends to breed	  disrespect for all signs.” It also	  states that if warning signs are used	  in	  excess, they lose their	  effectiveness. The existing highway	  already	  has	  28 warning signs	  relating to county	  road intersections, 	  horizontal	  curvature, 	  school	  bus 	  stop 	  locations, 	  and 	  merging 	  lanes.	  	  In 	  the 	  judgment of the District 2 Traffic Engineer, additional warning signs would	  not reduce the crash rate. No flashing warning beacons are attached to the existing warning signs. Flashing warning beacons are typically used	  in	  a short term application	  for a night time work zone and	  the MUTCD does not recommend	  adding the flashing warning beacons to	  the permanent warning signs on	  rural highways. Rumble Strips: Adding rumble strips to	  the existing highway would	  add	  some safety benefit to	  the highway; however, the existing shoulder is very inconsistent and	  is too	  narrow to	  add the	  rumble	  strips. While they could offer a safety benefit, they would not be a comprehensive solution to address the	  other identified safety deficiencies. Median and Side Barriers (Guardrail): Median and side barriers, also known as guardrail, have varying levels of	  effectiveness; however, the existing highway is too narrow to add the barriers without reducing the lane or shoulder width. Adding the barriers without widening the existing highway would	  increase the crash	  rate and	  is not recommended. Widening the highway just to	  add the	  barriers would be	  costly and is not recommended because	  the	  Thorncreek to Moscow project is currently proposed. Adding barriers close to	  the travel lanes of the highway would	  decrease the severity of crashes, but would	  increase the frequency of crashes because of the additional crashes into the	  barrier. Adding two	  more lanes to	  the existing alignment would	  improve capacity and	  allow slower vehicles to pass; however, there could still be head-‐on	  crashes due to	  lack of median,	  the 	  steep grades and sharp curves would not be	  repaired and the	  accidents that are	  caused by	  traffic entering	  and exiting	  the	  highway through the	  numerous accesses would continue	  to occur and would worsen as traffic volumes increase.  Safety-‐5  How will the action alternatives improve	  safety at Reisenauer Hill?  All three action	  alternatives would	  improve roadway safety over the existing conditions at Reisenauer Hill.	  The new roadway in this section would be a four-‐lane 	  divided 	  highway 	  and designed	  to	  AASHTO Standards with	  greatly improved	  sight distance, clear zone distance, vertical alignment, horizontal alignment, and shoulder widths. The maximum grade of decent on	   General Response Name  General Comment  General Response  Reisenauer Hill for any of the action	  alternatives would	  be 4.9 percent. The Modified W-‐4	  and C3	  alternatives would descend Reisenauer Hill near the existing location at 4.9	  to 4.8 percent grades	  respectively but at a reduced grade	  compared to existing	  conditions. The	  descent from Reisenauer Hill with	  the E-‐2	  Alternative would be more gradual (4.4 percent) and	  located	  further north	  where weather conditions are better compared	  to	  the Modified W-‐4	  and C-‐3	  alternatives. See	  FEIS	  Section 4.10	  and the Revised Safety Analysis (ITD 2013) for details regarding the improvement 	  to 	  Reisenauer 	  Hill.	  All	  action 	  alternatives 	  would 	  safe 	  and 	  would 	  greatly 	  improve 	  the safety of US-‐95	  between Thorncreek Road and Moscow	  compared to existing conditions since they would add additional lanes, a divided median and would be	  upgraded to meet AASHTO Standards.  Safety-‐6  Is 	  there 	  a 	  significant difference in	  length, safety and travel time	  between alternatives?  The total lengths of the alternatives are shown in the table below. Table	  77. Alignment Lengths Five lane 	  Section 	  (four lane Travel Time divided	  with	  center turn	  New Alignment (minutes: Alternative lane) 	  (miles) Length (miles) seconds) No Action N/A 6.34 6:49 Modified W-‐4 0.3 6.65 6:16 C-‐3 1.42 5.94 6:05 E-‐2 0.24 5.85 5:31 Source: Mobility and Road User Cost Study, (ITD 2014a) − The differences in total length between alternatives range from 0.09	  miles and 0.84	  miles. While the	  difference	  between the	  total length of the	  C-‐3	  and E-‐2	  alternatives is just 0.09	  miles, over a	  20-‐year period the travel times and travel user costs are	  substantial. The	  E-‐2	  Alternative would save 800 hours	  of travel time compared to	  the C-‐3	  Alternative. When monetary value is applied to the travel hours, the E-‐2	  Alternative is estimated to cost $19	  million less over a	  20	  year period compared to the C-‐3	  Alternative. This is explained in the US-‐95	  Thorncreek Road to Moscow; Mobility and Road User Cost Study on Alternatives Carried Forward (ITD 2014a), which is summarized in the FEIS Sections	  3.10 and 4.10. An	  important difference as it relates to	  safety is 	  the 	  lengths 	  of 	  the 	  five-‐lane 	  sections (four-‐lane section with a center turn lane) between alternatives. The five-‐lane 	  section 	  has 	  approximately  General Response Name  General Comment  General Response  three times more predicted crashes than the divided four-‐lane 	  rural	  section 	  because 	  the 	  travel	  lanes 	  are 	  closer 	  together 	  and 	  the 	  turning 	  movements 	  from	  the center lane and approaches are predicted	  to	  generate more crashes. Other factors also	  contribute to	  the differences in	  safety including 	  intersections 	  and 	  approaches.	  	  The 	  E-‐2	  Alternative would have the fewest country road intersections 	  and 	  the 	  fewest residential and commercial approaches.

These crash rates were determined on a	  per year basis with a	  1.63	  percent increase per year for all alternatives to account for an increase	  in traffic volume. Societal costs can be	  calculated for the predicted accidents using costs of crashes published	  by the FHWA	  for different crash	  types. More information on crash predictions and the economic costs of the predicted crashes can be found in the FEIS Section 4.10 and the Revised Safety Analysis (ITD 2013).  Safety-‐7  Is 	  the 	  data 	  in 	  the 	  Safety Analyses (ITD 2012a), in	  the DEIS and FEIS valid?  The crash predictions are based on calculations from the First Edition of the American Association of State Highway and	  Transportation	  Officials (AASHTO) Highway Safety Manual (HSM). The HSM provides the most current and	  accepted	  knowledge and	  practices relating to	  safety management  General Response Name  General Comment  General Response  according	  to AASHTO and Transportation Research Board Task Forces. The	  FHWA and all 50	  State	  DOTs have reviewed and accepted the HSM methods for	  crash predictions. A better	  method of	  crash prediction does	  not exist. Nearly	  2000 pages	  of calculations	  for the 20-‐year design period were used to make the safety predictions reported in the FEIS and the Revised Safety Analysis, Appendix E. More detail regarding the methods of	  calculations used by the HSM are on Pages 9 through 11 of	  the Safety Analysis (ITD 2013).  Schedule  What steps in the environmental process remain? When will the project be constructed?  The EIS	  process is a	  lengthy but thorough process. It	  requires that	  a range of	  reasonable alternatives be	  evaluated for their impacts to the	  human and natural environment before	  a	  decision	  is made. In	  making their decision, FHWA	  and	  ITD must balance the environmental impacts 	  with 	  the 	  engineering/safety benefits to	  the public. The public and	  agency comments have been	  considered	  and	  are responded	  to	  in	  the FEIS. A	  Notice of Availability for the FEIS was published	  in	  the Federal Register. After 30 days, FHWA	  will issue a Record	  of Decision	  (ROD) selecting an Action Alternative, a combination of the Action Alternatives, or the No Action Alternative. After the ROD is issued, if an	  action	  alternative is selected, ITD can	  proceed	  with	  project design20 and right-‐of-‐way acquisition. Design will require collecting detailed geotechnical data, survey data, determining specific rightof-‐way needs and	  producing detailed	  designs for the roadway. ITD will contact affected	  landowners 	  regarding 	  right-‐of-‐way acquisition, access and design details during the design process. Any improvement to	  properties prior to	  acquisition	  will be compensated	  for according to the Uniform Relocation Act. See the Uniform Relocation Summary in the FEIS Appendix 5. Construction	  will occur after the ROD is issued	  and	  after the right-‐of-‐way and design processes have been	  completed. The anticipated schedule is as follows: • Published 30	  day Notice of Availability of FEIS	  in Federal Register-‐2015 • Issue ROD-‐2015 • Begin	  Preliminary Design-‐2015 • Begin	  Right-‐of-‐way Acquisition Process-‐2016 • Construction	  2016-‐2017  20 Should an action alternative be selected in the ROD, ITD will perform design concurrently with the 150-day statutory appeal period. General Response Name  General Comment  General Response  FHWA and ITD recognize	  that 6	  fatalities and 152	  injuries have	  occurred in 253	  total crashes between	  2003 and	  2012 on	  this section	  of highway (ITD 2013) during this lengthy environmental process; however, we remain	  committed	  to	  implementing a comprehensive solution	  to	  the identified 	  deficiencies.	  In 	  doing 	  so, 	  we 	  must 	  comply 	  with 	  NEPA 	  regulations.	  See 	  General	  Response NEPA for a description of the NEPA process. See the FEIS Chapter, 8, Construction Phasing and Funding for additional details regarding construction and funding.  Water  How will the project impact the water	  table and wells?  A	  Hydrogeologic Analysis (Ralston 2014)	  was prepared to addresses possible ground-‐water impacts 	  from 	  construction 	  of 	  the 	  alternatives.	  	  Information 	  from 	  the 	  report 	  has 	  been 	  prepared and is incorporated into the	  FEIS, primarily in Section 4.7. This analysis concluded that there	  is very	  low to no potential to	  impact groundwater or wells from any of the alignments. Granite underlies most of the length of the proposed alternative routes of Highway 95 south of Moscow. The Modified W-‐4	  has the greatest length of roadway that overlies basalt. All three alternatives overlie	  basalt at the	  northern end of the	  project. Most of the existing wells in the area are completed to obtain water from local ground-‐water flow	  systems	  in granitic	  or metamorphic	  rock. Most of these wells	  exceed 100 feet in depth	  and	  obtain	  water from a producing zone at the bottom of the well. Wells that are completed	  in	  basalt are	  located mostly at the	  north end of the	  project. These	  wells obtain water from the	  Wanapum Formation, which hosts the	  upper aquifer in the	  Moscow area. The potential for highway construction along any of the three alignments to impact ground-‐water flow systems in either	  recharge and discharge areas is very low. Highway construction has the potential to	  increase recharge to	  shallow ground	  water because of runoff from paved	  areas and	  snow drifts	  created by plowing. The amount of this	  increase will be very small. Impacts	  on topographically low ground-‐water discharge areas should be minimal because these portions of the roadway will be constructed on fill or	  using bridges.	  The potential	  for impacts on domestic wells is extremely small except for those wells, which will be destroyed because they are located within the selected road alignment. Relocation	  of utilities will	  be 	  specified 	  during 	  final	  design.	  Best 	  Management 	  Practices 	  (BMPs)	  will be implemented	  during construction	  to	  minimize impacts to	  water resources including groundwater and wells. ITD will coordinate with residents and businesses and notify them in advance	  of utility relocation activities. See	  the	  FEIS	  Section 4.7	  and the	  Hydrogeologic Analysis Technical Report for supplemental information regarding impacts to groundwater.  General Response Name  General Comment  General Response  Weather-‐1  Was there sufficient data and evaluation of the	  C-‐3	  Alternative in	  the Weather Analysis?  The weather analysis was revised after the DEIS	  hearing in order to help clarify the information and to provide	  additional data. In the	  weather	  analysis (Qualls 2014), three climatic regions were identified 	  which 	  corresponded 	  to 	  air 	  flow 	  over 	  and 	  around 	  Paradise 	  Ridge and elevation and were	  named	  and	  mapped	  as Lowland, Flow-‐Over Ridge (LFO), Highland, Flow-‐Over Ridge (HFO) and Highland, Flow-‐Around	  Ridge (HFA). One climate station	  was placed	  in	  each	  of these regions and	  referred to in the Revised Weather	  Analysis. The LFO is the Western Corridor	  (WC)	  and best	  encompasses the	  W Alternatives, the	  HFO is the	  Eastern Corridor (EC)	  and best	  represents the E Alternatives and	  the HFO is the Reisenauer Hill area	  (RH) and represents the	  southern section of all of the	  alternatives. While	  there	  is no specific climate	  station for the	  C Alternatives, A Central Corridor (CC) is referenced	  in	  the report, which	  runs in	  a north-‐south direction generally encompassing	  the	  existing	  US-‐95	  and the C Alternatives. Weather and climate within the Central Corridor is determined	  either by interpolation	  between	  the Western	  and	  Eastern	  corridor measurement sites or by spatially and temporally distributed satellite observations. Except in some cases	  with spatial data from satellites	  and historical accident records	  on the existing US-‐95, no	  attempt is made in	  this report to	  specify weather	  or	  climate conditions exactly on a particular	  existing	  or potential roadway alignment but rather the	  conditions within the	  general corridors are	  discussed. See	  the	  FEIS	  Sections 3.10	  and 4.10	  and the	  Revised Weather Analysis (Qualls 2014) for clarifications	  and additional information.  Weather-‐2  Why did the DEIS Weather Analysis only include five months of data during a dry and mild weather year?	  The study should include more months and additional years of data.  The five-‐month data set was not	  the sole source of	  weather	  data but	  is a valid methodology used to establish the relative conditions among the EC, WC and RH weather	  stations within their	  respective climate regimes. This smaller	  five-‐month data set was used to rank the larger 30+-‐year data set available at the UI Plant Sciences Center, which	  is about a mile from the study area. Knowledge	  of the	  relative	  conditions among the	  three	  on-‐site weather stations	  and the UI weather station allowed estimation of the long-‐term climate at	  each of	  the on-‐site weather stations	  through calibration with the long-‐term UI climate records. This is an accepted method for correlating the data and the weather information since the relative weather	  conditions at	  the three stations behaved in accordance with	  established	  principles of physics and	  thermodynamics, and	  comparisons with	  similar locations and/or elevation trends published in scientific literature	  (Qualls 2014). It Is common practice	  in scientific field studies to conduct	  short-‐term data collection, on	  the order of a few months, to	  determine spatial variability of weather characteristics	  (for example, the First International Satellite Land  General Response Name  General Comment  General Response  Surface	  Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Field Experiment (FIFE), (Hall and Sellers 1995) from which more than 1000	  scientific publications were produced. A	  Revised	  Weather Analysis (Qualls 2014) has been	  prepared	  which	  provides more detail about additional weather elements, additional weather data	  collected after the	  2005	  weather study, including 	  year-‐around coverage,	  which 	  generally 	  includes 	  winter 	  weather 	  conditions. Additionally, satellite remote sensing data from 2002 through	  2012, document the spatial distribution	  of snow ranging from mild	  to	  harsh	  winters. Additional information	  regarding the methodology and findings has also	  been	  added	  to	  the FEIS Section	  3.10 and	  4.10.  Weather-‐3  How does elevation affect the temperature and ice formation temperature? Would there be differences in 	  safety between	  alternatives due	  to the	  higher elevation	  and	  weather conditions such as frost	  and ice?  Weather stations were placed at different elevations within the study area to capture the elevation effects. There	  is an approximately 400-‐foot	  difference in elevation between the WC and EC weather stations. Satellite 	  remote 	  sensing 	  was 	  also 	  used 	  to 	  observe 	  the 	  spatial	  distribution 	  of snow accumulation and melting across	  the study area and at different elevations. The WC weather station, which is lower in elevation, was often colder than the higher EC weather station, by 15 to	  20 °F. This is due to	  cold	  air drainage, when	  cold	  air, which	  is denser, flows downhill and	  pools in	  low elevation	  areas. When WC was colder than EC, the average temperature difference is 5.4 °F and WC was colder than EC by 12 °F about	  5 percent of the time. This creates greater potential for frost formation, freezing roads, and black ice on low areas of	  the Modified W-‐4	  and C-‐3	  alternatives compared to most of the length of the E-‐2	  Alternative. Temperatures were below freezing at the low elevation WC weather station when the	  higher elevation EC weather station was above	  freezing	  approximately three	  times longer than when the	  EC station was below freezing and the WC station was above freezing. The observations agreed well with principles of physics	  and thermodynamics, as	  well as	  published scientific	  studies	  (Qualls	  2014). Air temperature may decrease with	  increasing elevation	  under well-‐mixed atmospheric conditions	  (e.g., windy	  weather or a sunny	  day	  with strong solar heating of the ground). Across the 400 feet	  of	  elevation difference between WC and EC, this averaged about	  1.8 °F if	  only the data when	  WC	  was warmer than	  EC	  are included, due to	  atmospheric thermodynamics. This difference exceeds 2.9 °F less than	  5 percent of the time. Under these well-‐mixed circumstances, the E-‐2	  Alternative at its highest point could average 1.8	  °F	  cooler than the	  lowest point of the Modified W-‐4	  Alternative alignment. Combining all the data when	  either WC	  or EC	  is colder than	  the other, yields an	  overall average	   General Response Name  General Comment  General Response  temperature difference of	  about	  1 °F with WC being colder	  on average, because of	  the significantly colder temperatures	  which occur at WC due to cold air drainage compared to the mildly colder temperatures at EC associated with well-‐mixed atmospheric conditions. All of the action	  alternatives have a similar peak height in	  elevation	  on	  Reisenauer Hill at around 2875	  ft. However, the E-‐2	  Alternative would be on level grade through this area	  and would descend	  in	  elevation	  further north	  where weather conditions are improved. The C-‐3	  and Modified W-‐4	  Alternatives would descend in elevation near Reisenauer Hill at a	  slightly steeper grade. The spatial distribution of weather-‐related accidents on the existing US-‐95	  from Thorncreek Road to Moscow is predominantly associated with the spatial distribution of	  road characteristics such as tight radii curves located down slope	  on hills, and ingress/egress associated with road junctions 	  and 	  driveways, 	  rather 	  than 	  due 	  to	  spatial distribution	  of weather. Since all proposed	  alignments are	  designed to current AASHTO standards, all will result in a	  great improvement over existing	  conditions and will be	  safe. Because	  the	  road characteristics, rather than the	  spatial distribution	  of weather dominate the distribution	  of accidents, the prescribed	  Safety Analysis (ITD 2013) for each of the proposed alternatives, reflects the relative safety between	  alternatives. The distinction	  between	  alternatives considered	  road alignment characteristics such as length, slopes, and curvature, which are	  already considered in the	  Safety Analysis (ITD 2015b). Weather was discussed in the DEIS 3.10 and 4.10. A Revised Weather Analysis (Qualls 2014) was completed and additional information has been added to the respective sections in the FEIS.  Weather-‐4  How would precipitation and snow accumulation differ between	  alternatives?  Regionally, precipitation	  decreases on	  a gradient from Moscow south	  to	  the top	  of the Lewiston	  grade. Countering	  this is the	  localized topography of Paradise	  Ridge and the	  fact that precipitation	  generally increases with	  elevation	  on	  the upwind	  side of a slope. Both	  the on-‐site weather station measurements	  and the satellite images	  provide	  useful information 	  pertaining 	  to 	  snow 	  accumulation 	  between 	  alternatives.	  Reisenauer 	  Hill is 	  the 	  most critical location within the study	  area, including both the north-‐facing slope on the north end and the region to the south toward	  Thorncreek Road,	  due 	  to 	  greater 	  accumulation 	  and 	  retention 	  of snow compared to the rest of the study area. Annual precipitation	  at the EC	  and	  RH weather stations are similar to	  the UI long-‐term climate station, and are an average	  of 2.5 inches per year lower at the	  WC weather station. Due	  to the	  short horizontal distance in the upwind direction from the peak of Paradise Ridge to the valley floor, much of	  the precipitation lands and accumulates downwind of	  the ridgeline to	  the south	   General Response Name  General Comment  General Response  and east of Reisenauer Hill and Paradise	  Ridge. There would be approximately 5	  to 7	  inches more snowfall per year at EC and RH compared to WC, or a melted snow liquid depth (also called Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) difference of 0.5 to	  0.7	  inches. On-‐site measurements	  and satellite remote sensing, summarized below, show greater persistence of snow around	  Reisenauer Hill than along the central and northern portion of	  the E-‐2	  Alternative’s alignment. Landsat satellite	  images of the	  study	  area and the	  surrounding	  region provide an excellent picture	  of the spatial distribution	  of snow. Examples of these images spanning 2002 through	  2012 are provided	  in	  the FEIS Sections 3.10 and	  4.10 and	  in	  the Revised	  Weather Analysis (Qualls 2014). The key satellite findings are: When there is six to eight inches depth or more at the UI Plant Sciences Farm (PSF), either accrued as a	  single, large	  snowfall event, accrued in small increments over multiple 	  days, 	  or 	  while melting down to 6-‐8	  inches from greater depths at PSF, the satellite images show continuous spatial coverage of the study area and surrounding region by snow. When the snow depth at PSF drops below about six inches during melting, the central portion (E2	  and C-‐3	  Alignments) will have patchy conditions. The emergence of these patches is strongly controlled by	  hill slope orientation. South-‐facing slopes, which have much greater	  exposure to the sun, melts	  off faster than north-‐facing slopes. The patch quickly spreads westward, and then begins to	  melt off north-‐facing slopes in the central area defined above and including west	  of	  US 95. Snow persists substantially longer south and east of the	  ridgeline	  of Paradise	  Ridge,	  including 	  the ridgeline as it	  passes Reisenauer	  Hill,	  which 	  during 	  the 	  winter 	  months 	  is 	  usually 	  the 	  downwind side of the ridgeline. Snow also persists	  down the north-‐facing slope of	  Reisenauer	  Hill, particularly from the existing US-‐95	  toward the west. Additionally, snow persists on the north end of the	  study area	  on north-‐facing slopes north of	  Clyde Hill and the east-‐west power lines of the eastern alignment, though it	  does not	  persist	  there for	  as long as on either	  the north face or	  the south side of	  Reisenauer	  Hill. Regional coverage snowfall of a few inches can	  provide relatively complete coverage of the study area, and it begins to melt off following	  the	  pattern described in 2	  and 3	  above. All of the action	  alternatives would	  be upgraded	  to	  meet AASHTO standards and	  safety would be greatly	  improved compared to the	  No Action Alternative. Therefore	  considering	  only	  spatial distribution	  of weather, especially snow, Modified W-‐4	  and C-‐3	  will be exposed to greater snow  General Response Name  General Comment  General Response  accumulation during	  descent of Reisenauer Hill compared to the E-‐2	  Alternative which is flatter near Reisenauer Hill but descends in	  elevation	  further north	  in	  the study area with	  less snow accumulation. Since	  all proposed alignments 	  are 	  designed 	  to 	  current 	  AASHTO 	  standards, 	  all	  will	  result 	  in 	  a 	  great improvement 	  over 	  existing 	  conditions 	  and 	  will	  be 	  safe.	  	  Because 	  the 	  road 	  characteristics, 	  rather than the spatial distribution of	  weather	  dominate the distribution of	  accidents, the prescribed Safety Analysis (ITD 2013) for each of the	  proposed alternatives, reflects the	  relative	  safety between	  alternatives. The distinction	  between	  alternatives considered	  road	  alignment characteristics	  such as	  length, slopes, and curvature, which are already considered in the Safety Analysis (ITD 2015b). See the FEIS Sections 3.10 and 4.10 and the Revised Weather	  Analysis (Qualls 2014)	  for	  additional information.  Weather-‐5  How will fog vary between alternatives?  Fog or clouds are	  formed when the temperature of	  the air	  decreases enough that	  atmospheric water vapor reaches the saturation point, causing condensation of vapor into fine liquid water droplets. This can	  happen	  because temperature decreases or by increasing atmospheric humidity. Measurements of visibility distances associated	  with	  fog at EC, WC, and	  RH showed	  RH (Southern Highland Flow)	  to have the poorest	  visibility conditions, followed by EC and then WC. Since	  all roadway alternatives pass RH, all alternatives will be	  subject to	  the poorest visibility conditions	  of the area. However, with the improved typical section the safety of the action	  alternatives would be	  greatly improved over the	  No Action Alternative. The	  relative	  safety between	  alternatives is therefore	  reflected in the	  results of the	  Revised Safety Analysis (ITD 2013). See FEIS	  Section 3.10	  and 4.10	  and the Revised Weather Analysis (Qualls 2014) for additional information.  Weather-‐6  How will wind vary between	  alternatives? How will blowing snow	  and snowdrifts	  vary between alternatives?  As stated	  in	  the DEIS, wind	  speeds were similar between	  all corridors. Wind	  was measured	  at all three stations, whose locations are shown on the Study Area Map of	  the Climate Report	  (Qualls 2014), and on the ITD alignment 	  maps.	  	  These 	  included 	  one 	  station 	  in 	  each 	  of 	  the 	  three 	  climate regimes, Highland Flow Around (HFA-‐(RH)), Highland Flow Over	  (HFO-‐(EC)), and Lowland Flow Over (LFO-‐(WC)), as defined in the Climate Report. Measurements at EC showed winds were modestly lower than	  at WC	  for high	  wind	  speeds. The fastest	  individual gusts and highest	  average wind speeds were at	  RH. The fastest	  individual gusts and highest average	  wind speeds were	  at Reisenauer Hill.	  Gust speeds of 30 mph or greater correspond to sustained wind speeds	  of 25 mph or greater. This	  would be typical of wind speeds	  warranting a Wind Advisory from the National Weather Service. Gusts generally come from a  General Response Name  General Comment  General Response  westerly direction except Reisenauer Hill, which have some gusts	  up to 38 mph from the east. However, all the alternatives must pass through the Reisenauer Hill area (Qualls 2014). Consequently, the direct effect of wind	  on	  vehicles in	  general, and	  on	  large trucks in	  particular, should be no worse for any of the proposed	  alternatives than	  what is currently experienced	  on	  the existing US-‐95. As stated in General Response Weather-‐1, while there is no specific climate station for the C Alternatives, The Central Corridor referenced in the report, runs	  in a north-‐south direction generally encompasses the existing US-‐95	  and the C Alternatives. Weather and climate within the Central Corridor is determined either by interpolation between the WC and EC measurement sites or by spatially and temporally distributed satellite observations. Each of the proposed alternatives will be designed to have an elevated roadbed on fill material, which will produce localized acceleration of wind across the road surface (Qualls 2014), which will help	  prevent accumulation	  of drifted	  snow on	  the road surface. There may be specific features in this area which locally reduce the wind such as trees along the roadway, or	  deep road cuts which can have localized effects	  on road ice and snow accumulation, and sudden exposure to wind gusts during	  transitions 	  from 	  road 	  fill	  to 	  cut 	  sections.	  With 	  the 	  improved 	  typical	  section 	  the 	  safety of the action	  alternatives would	  be greatly improved	  over the No	  Action	  Alternative. The relative safety between alternatives	  is	  therefore reflected in the results of the Revised	  Safety Analysis (ITD 2013). Additional information regarding weather is provided in the	  FEIS	  Section 4.10	  and in the Revised	  Weather Analysis (Qualls 2014).  Weather-‐7  How were the microclimates in the study area	  evaluated and considered?  The local microclimates have been captured through weather station measurements, evaluation of the satellite remote sensing images, consideration	  of principles of physics and	  thermodynamics, and published scientific studies. The weather study included measurements from	  a weather station installed west of Paradise Ridge on	  the bench	  traversed	  by the E-‐2	  Alternative in the EC. There were also weather stations that	  collected data for	  the RH and WC (Modified W-‐4	  Alternative). Multiple 	  measurements 	  were collected each minute, and these were reported as	  samples, averages	  or accumulations, depending on	  the variable, several times per hour. Satellite	  remote	  sensing images also provided information about the	  spatial distribution of snow across the	  study area	  under a	  wide	  range	  of winter weather conditions. These	  provide	  a	  detailed high	  spatial resolution, and	  consistent description	  of the microclimates of the study area. These measurements were compared with measurements from	  other weather stations in	  the study area	  to determine	  the	  relative	  severity of various weather elements in different parts of the	  study  General Response Name  General Comment  General Response  area. Additional detail is provided in the	  FEIS	  Sections 3.10	  and 4.10	  and the	  Revised Weather Analysis (Qualls 2014).  Weather-‐8  Would the limited data set and the	  difference	  in weather conditions between	  alternatives change the findings	  in the Safety Analysis?  The findings in the Safety Analyses as they pertain to weather remain valid for the following reasons: • Spatial variability of weather exists across the study area. • Weather-‐related accidents are predominantly associated with frozen surface conditions (i.e., snow/ice/slush). • Most often when frozen surface conditions exist, they occur across the entire study area. • Very few accidents 	  are 	  associated 	  with 	  wind 	  and 	  fog.	  • The spatial distribution of weather-‐related accidents on the existing US-‐95	  from Thorncreek Road to Moscow is predominantly associated with the spatial distribution of	  road characteristics such	  as tight radii curves located	  downslope on	  hills, and	  ingress/egress 	  associated 	  with 	  road 	  junctions 	  and 	  driveways, 	  rather 	  than 	  due 	  to 	  spatial	  distribution	  of weather. • All proposed	  new alignments (i.e., Modified W-‐4, C-‐3	  and E-‐2) are designed in accordance	  with current AASHTO (American Association of State	  Highway Transportation Officials) standards, which are much safer than the existing US-‐95. • Because road	  characteristics, rather than	  the spatial distribution	  of weather, dominate the distribution of	  accidents, the	  prescribed AASHTO safety analysis of each of the	  proposed	  alternatives (Arnzen, pers. comm 2012)	  should be taken at	  face value for	  the comparison of the accident safety	  of the proposed alternatives. Additional information	  is provided	  in	  the FEIS Sections 3.10 and	  4.10 and	  in	  the Revised	  Weather Analysis (Qualls 2014).  Weeds  Will the E-‐2	  Alternative destroy Palouse remnants, rare plants, and endangered plants and native vegetation? −  As stated	  in	  the DEIS, Palouse remnants, rare plants and populations of	  native vegetation occur	  within the project study area. These are described, mapped and assessed in Biological Evaluation of Plant Species and	  Communities of Conservation	  Concern	  in	  the US Highway 95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow Project	  Area (Lichthardt	  2005), which was distributed with the DEIS. The study identified 	  different 	  vegetative 	  communities, 	  located 	  rare 	  plants 	  and 	  generally 	  assessed 	  condition based	  on	  size and	  exotic species infestations. Paradise Ridge contains	  the largest remaining Palouse	  remnant in the	  study area. The E-‐2	  Alternative would not go over the top of the ridge, but would parallel the grasslands on  General Response Name  General Comment  General Response  Paradise	  Ridge,	  about 	  0.7 	  mi 	  from 	  the 	  summit 	  and 	  about 	  0.25 	  mi	  from 	  the 	  large 	  Palouse 	  remnant associated with the	  ridge	  summit. The	  E-‐2	  Alternative would not directly impact any rare plants, threatened or	  endangered species or	  Palouse prairie remnants. The E-‐2	  Alternative could result in indirect effects such as	  increased spread of weeds, establishment of new weeds	  as	  a result of the closer alignment as	  stated in the DEIS and FEIS Chapter 6, Indirect and Cumulative Effects.	  Weeds populations could affect potential habitat for rare	  and native	  plant species affecting	  their future	  success. Additional information	  regarding weed	  species, weed	  dispersal and	  potential effects has been	  incorporated 	  into 	  the 	  FEIS 	  Sections 	  3.8 	  and 	  4.8.	  This 	  information 	  was from the DEIS Technical Report titled	  A	  Scientific Evaluation	  for Noxious and	  Invasive Weeds of the Highway 95 Construction	  Project between	  Uniontown	  Cutoff and	  Moscow (Lass & Prather 2007). Spalding’s Catchfly is the	  only federally listed plant known to occur in the project area. The USFWS determined that all of the alternatives may affect but are not likely to adversely affect Spalding’s Catchfly, a	  federally listed plant, based on potential indirect effects as stated in the	  DEIS and FEIS	  Section 4.9. An additional survey for Spalding’s catchfly was conducted in the project area in	  the summer of 2013 and	  no	  new populations were identified. The alternatives could increase weed dispersal to private lands	  that have been identified as	  high priority areas for Palouse prairie restoration	  and	  for Spalding’s Catchfly establishment. As stated	  in 	  the 	  DEIS 	  Section 	  4.8 	  the 	  E-‐2	  Alternative crosses a	  property which is enrolled in a	  USFWS	  restoration program, however,	  the 	  alignment 	  would 	  not 	  go 	  through 	  any 	  portion 	  of 	  the 	  property for	  which restoration activities are ongoing or	  planned. The Paradise Ridge remnant	  is ranked as a high-‐quality remnant, but is not a pristine, weed-‐free, or a publicly 	  accessible 	  resource, 	  although 	  several	  landowners 	  allow 	  some 	  public 	  use.	  Paradise Ridge consists of privately owned	  parcels with	  approximately 55 existing residential and	  commercial developments	  which are continuing to increase and develop on and around the Ridge. Additional information	  about rare plants, Palouse remnants, and	  restoration	  sites has been	  added	  to	  the FEIS Sections 3.8 and	  4.8. Additional information	  regarding the indirect and	  cumulative effects	  of the alternatives	  to Palouse remnants	  and rare plants in combination with past, present and	  reasonably foreseeable future impacts, including residential and	  commercial development, has been	  added	  to	  the FEIS Chapter 6, Indirect and	  Cumulative Effects.	  The indirect effects from the alternatives will be mitigated through a number	  of	  different	  commitments: implementing ITD’s	  Vegetation Management Plan in conjunction with USFWS,  General Response Name  General Comment  General Response  IDFG,	  NRCS and landowners within the	  project area; providing	  funds to landowners for weed	  control in prairie restoration sites, constructing farmable slopes	  to minimize weed establishment and spread, and revegetating	  slopes and fills with native	  grasses and forbs to minimize	  weed establishment and spread along	  the	  roadway. Species will be	  determined in consultation with USFWS and NRCS to help ensure compatibility and successful establishment. The action alternatives would have	  Expressway Access Control, which would help minimize	  future	  development along the roadway and	  associated indirect	  effects. See General Response Access. Additional information	  regarding indirect and	  cumulative effects to	  Palouse remnants and	  Paradise	  Ridge has been	  added	  to	  FEIS Chapter 6, Indirect and	  Cumulative Effects.	  The full	  list of mitigation measures is provided in the FEIS Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments.  Wildlife  How will the alternatives impact 	  flora, 	  fauna 	  and wildlife habitat on Paradise Ridge? −  ITD 	  recognizes 	  that Paradise	  Ridge has ecological, visual,	  and 	  recreational	  value 	  to 	  the community; however, Paradise Ridge, except for the Palouse remnant defined	  by the ICDC	  and	  shown in the DEIS Figure 24, does	  not appear to have a specific	  boundary. For the purposes	  of this EIS, Paradise Ridge is shown in Figure 20 and based on the topography of	  the area (3100ft	  and above). None	  of the	  alternatives, including	  the	  E-‐2	  Alternative, would go over Paradise Ridge or directly impact it.	  The E-‐2	  Alternative would be located along the base of Paradise Ridge. As discussed	  in	  the DEIS, the E-‐2	  Alternative would primarily directly affect farmland,	  Conservation	  Reserve Program (CRP) land, and	  would	  remove 3.9 acres with	  cultivated pine trees near Eid	  Road. CRP land	  is commonly marginal farmland	  that has been	  taken	  out of production	  and enrolled in the	  program voluntarily. It is not subject to special protections or preservation outside of that program. The landowner can	  determine	  to put land into or take	  it out of the	  CRP	  program; there is no	  assurance of its long-‐term preservation. The wildlife reports all concluded that	  the project	  area does not	  contain any high quality or	  critical big game habitat. The E-‐2	  Alternative would	  affect	  more land that	  is considered moderate or	  marginal quality ungulate habitat compared	  to	  other alternatives as summarized	  in	  DEIS and	  FEIS Sections 3.8 and	  4.8. The impacted pine stand near Eid Road offers habitat for pygmy nuthatch;	  however 	  there 	  is similar available habitat located on Paradise Ridge and elsewhere	  in the	  region. See	  Section 4.8.1	  Vegetation and Habitat Effects under Pine Stand Effects. As stated	  in	  the DEIS Section	  3.8 and	  4.8, the pine stand also offers habitat	  for	  many other	  species including northern alligator	  lizard and long-‐eared myotis. Additional information has been added throughout the	  FEIS	  regarding	  the	  diversity of species on	  Paradise Ridge, the ecological function	  of CRP land, updated	  occurrence data and	  information	  about effects to	  the giant Palouse earthworm, traffic noise effects on birds,  General Response Name  General Comment  General Response  bumblebees, matrix habitat, and	  habitat fragmentation. While Paradise Ridge contains	  an important Palouse	  remnant and provides wildlife	  habitat, it is not a pristine, weed-‐free, or	  a publicly accessible resource. Paradise Ridge is entirely privately owned	  residential and	  commercial parcels zoned	  for rural residential development. There are currently	  approximately	  55 existing residential and commercial developments	  on and around the ridge. The houses, buildings, fences, septic, utility lines, driveways, roads, agriculture, pets and other human	  activities already have an	  effect on	  wildlife, habitat, visual effects and the	  setting	  of the ridge. These human activities could transport	  and introduce weeds, fragment	  habitat, and introduce 	  light 	  and 	  noise affecting	  the	  setting	  of the	  ridge. As described in the	  DEIS	  and	  FEIS 3.8, there are also active restoration projects for	  reestablishment	  of	  Spalding’s catchfly,	  native vegetation and ecological weed control on private lands. The E-‐2	  Alternative would cross one property that is enrolled	  in	  a	  restoration project but the	  impacted portion of land is not planned for	  any restoration activities. Latah County	  through its land use	  planning	  and zoning has the ability to	  provide protective measures to prevent further development of this 	  area.	  ITD 	  does 	  not 	  have 	  the 	  ability 	  to 	  regulate private development but may control access from the highway. Highways often have the potential to increase development pressures along their corridor; however, enforcing Expressway Access Control, which	  is	  described in General Response Access, will help mitigate this development pressure. The direct and indirect effects of current and	  ongoing growth	  on	  Paradise Ridge,	  has 	  been 	  considered 	  in 	  addition 	  to 	  the 	  highway’s 	  indirect effects. Additional information regarding	  the	  indirect and cumulative	  effects of the	  alternatives to Paradise	  Ridge	  has been added to the	  FEIS	  Chapter 6, Indirect and Cumulative	  Effects.	  While there are no strongly defined	  migratory corridors through	  the project area animals do	  traverse the project	  area. If	  an Action Alternative is selected, there are many mitigation measures, BMPs and standard practices that would be	  implemented to minimize	  harm and	  mitigate for impacts to vegetation, wildlife and habitat. Culverts in drainages will be designed to allow small terrestrial species to move	  through. Under-‐crossings	  at county	  road intersections	  will be designed	  to	  accommodate animal movement. If the E-‐2	  Alternative is selected, ungulates would be able to cross at Eid Road. Under-‐crossings	  will require fencing and other design elements to help ensure	  success. See	  General Response	  Weeds for additional information on weeds and vegetation. See Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments for the list of wildlife mitigation measures.  Response to Comments on the DEIS 10.3 Agency Comment Responses This section provides the scanned comment letters from the City of Moscow, USFWS, EPA, IDFG, and the City of Lewiston. The agency letters with ITD and FHWA responses are presented in this section. Administrative 6 Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) April 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow 322 Memo To: Planning and Zoning Commission From: Bill Belknap, Community Development Director Date: January 18, 2013 Re: U.S. 95 DEIS Comments On December 14, 2012, the Idaho Transportation Department (ITD) and Federal Highways Administration (FHWA) published the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) and Section 4(f) evaluation for the US‐95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow project which is anticipated to include the reconstruction and realignment of approximately six (6) miles of US 95 immediately south of Moscow. ITF reports that this particular section of US 95 has the highest accident rate within District2,andrankswithinthetop13highest accidentlocations within theentire State of Idaho. On January 15th, City Supervisor Gary Riedner requested that several City Commissions review the DEIS to determine if the Commissions desired to provide the City Council with any recommendations regarding comments that the City may wish to provide to ITD and FHWA during the public comment period which is open until February 23rd. As the Planning and Zoning Commission is tasked with current and long‐range land use and transportation planning efforts, these areas appear to be relevant to the Commission’s charge and appropriate for the Commission’s consideration. The DEIS document has been mailed to Moscow residents on CD andisavailableforreview onthe webat: www.us95thorncreek.com Staff has conducted a preliminary review of the DEIS and has identified comments that the Commission may wish to consider (referenced below by page and section), along with any other comments that the Commission may desire to provide. Staff’s primary interest in the review process focused upon the potential impacts upon; current and future land uses in the area; planned future transportation facilities; planned recreation and pathway facilities; and the accuracy of statements within the document pertaining to City‐related planning efforts and projects.Staff’sinitial commentsaredetailedbelowfor theCommission’sreview. GeneralComments: 1. Staff would strongly encourage ITD to consider the potential future intersection design for the Ring Road and/or alternate U.S. 95 and State Highway 8 alignments within the design of this project. This consideration could include the evaluation of a crossing structure that would provide grade separation for the future Ring Road, local access to property located east of the E‐2 Alignment, and a grade separated pedestrian/pathway crossing of U.S. 95 to reduce future pedestrian and local traffic conflicts with the highway. The topography wouldappeartopossibly supportaseparation structure as the roadway descends off of the ridge located just east of the existing U.S. 95 alignment. Consideration of this now could help reduce disruption and additional cost in the future andprotectandpreserve the function ofthe highwaysystem. 2. Regardless of what alignment is selected, it is recommended that access to the new highway section be restricted to reduce turning movement conflicts, safety hazards and potentially undesirable land use and development patterns. The 1.42 mile long five lane section as proposed within C2 is much more likely spur strip commercial development along the highway corridor immediately south of the City into the future. This type of development pattern would generally be undesirable and would likely increase congestion and safety hazards on the road facility and could result in additional traffic controlsignalsandtraveldelaysin thefuture. 3. The City Council has recently identified the beautification of the City entryways as a Council Goal. It appears that there would be an opportunity for the City to workwith ITD to identify beautification opportunities such as enhanced landscaping, hardscape treatments, and public art elements that could be incorporated within, or installed in conjunction with, the project to improve aesthetics of the City’s southern entrance for thetravelingpublicandvisitorstoMoscow. 4. Staff recommends that ITD incorporate pedestrian and bicycle facilities in the roadway design within the urbanized areas. Where feasible, these facilities should include tree lawns/green strips to provide pedestrian separation and reduce snow removal/sidewalk conflicts. 5. Staff would encourage ITD to work with City staff to identify current and planned future local street intersection access points and incorporate those within the project design as appropriate. 6. The City would encourage ITD to work with existing business owners through the design and construction process to ensure that suitable access is maintained during and after construction. SpecificComments: 1. Pg. 64, Table 15. There appears to be an error with respect to Gritman Medical employmentnumbers,Ibelieve itshouldbecloserto350FTEpositions. 2. Pg. 69, City of Moscow Comprehensive Plan. This section states that the “land outside thecitylimitsiszonedbyLatahCountyassuburbanresidential.” Thevastmajorityofthe land area outside the city limits is zoned Agriculture/Forestry, along with smaller areas of MotorBusiness,IndustrialandCommercialalongU.S.95.  Page 3. Pg. 70, Bulleted List, First Bullet. The document makes reference to the Ring Road concept and the fact that it is a proposed loop around the city, and then states that it is generally west of U.S. 95. In fact the Ring Road Concept includes concept alignments in all four quadrants of the City (on both the east and west sides of U.S. 95) and the southeast quadrant has been considered as a possible alternate alignment of State Highway 8. The section continues to discuss the relative benefits of an east or west alignment which leads to confusion of the reader. I believe the discussion in this section is confusing the Ring Road concept with a U.S. 95 bypass. While certain sections of the Ring Road could be considered as alternate alignments of U.S. 95 and State Highway 8, the principal focus of the concept was to facilitate circulation in and around Moscow to reducecongestionfrom regional through traffic intheCity’sdowntowncore. 4. Pg. 71, Other Plans. The document incorrectly states that the City of Moscow is preparing a Moscow School District Long‐Range Facilities Plan. That effort is being conducted bytheMoscowSchoolDistrict. 5. Pg. 71, Recreation. The document should reflect the City’s planned linear park/pathway along the Southfork of the Palouse River as reflected within the City’s Comprehensive Plan and potential grade separation crossing facilities that could be considered as part of theThorncreekproject toalleviatethispotentialfuturecrossingconflict. 6. Pg. 115, Access and Mobility. The first paragraph describes U.S. 95 as a principal arterial and State Highway 8 as a “major east west highway.” I believe both U.S. 95 and State Highway8serveanimportantrole as principal arterials withinthelocal system,aswell as significant U.S. or StateHighwaysintheregionaltransportation system. 7. Pg. 115, Mass Transit. The report states that there is no mass transit available in the study area. It may be good to mention that there is mass transit operating within Moscow, and that while service may currently end approximately 0.5 miles north of the northern project boundary, consideration of future service extension within the project areaispossible. 8. Pg. 122, Table 35. The organization of the Clyde Road to Palouse River Road section appears to be inconsistent with the above sections and unclear as to what the numbers represent. 9. Pg. 142, W‐4. The report states that the W‐4 alignment would be “inconsistent with the City of Moscow’s goals for constructing the planned Ring Road project.” It then states that a “western alternate route would respond to the higher development trends west of Moscow and would be closer to the universities of Moscow and Pullman.” I am unaware of why the report would conclude that the W‐4 alignment is inconsistent with the Ring Road and the second sentence would appear to conflict with the first. The report continues on to state that the W‐4 alignment “would bisect the proposed ball fields and could spur development in that area, diverting resources that would be in  Page conflict with the City of Moscow’s plans for the ball field, school, and residential development.” W‐4 is located over a quarter mile south of the City’s ball field property and does not bisect it. Additionally, there are no current plans for the construction of a schoolin thatlocation (however,ifresidential development weretooccurin thearea itis possible thatcould occur,buttherearenoplans for suchaschoolatthistime). 10. Pg. 143, C‐3. The report states that C‐3 would present challenges for connectivity to the planned Ring Road project. I do not know exactly what consideration lead to this conclusion, but it would appear that the C‐3 alignment might present the least challenge to this connection as the intersection with the Ring Road would occur in a location without significant horizontal or vertical curvature of U.S. 95, which may not be the case withW‐4orE‐2dependingupon final design. 11. Pg. 143, E‐2. The report states that “E‐2 could also increase property values and have growth along its alignment; however it would be less growth than W‐4 and would have controlled access.” Increased strip development along the E‐2 corridor, especially if it included an extended 5 lane (4 travel and center turn) facility south of Moscow, would generally not be desirable. Increased access points, traffic signals and overall congestion in an area of fairly significant grade in the transition from Paradise Ridge to the Moscow could impede the safe function and operation of the highway system.

The headers and numbers correspond to the comments in your letter. General Comments: 1. Based on discussions with City staff during the Community Impact Assessment update (2011), a final detailed Ring Road alignment had not been identified and funding had not been allocated or secured to finance the project. In addition, the Ring Road concept would be an independent project that has a separate purpose and need from this project. Additional evaluation, a clear future funding source, and regional plan acceptance and adoption would be required to initiate additional infrastructure as part of this project. However, ITD will work closely with the City to ensure that the design of the US-95 project is consistent with and does not preclude construction of the Ring Road concept. The Final Environmental Impact Study (FEIS) Sections 3.2 and 4.2 have been modified to clarify the status and possible alignment of the proposed Ring Road concept. 2. All the action alternatives would have Expressway Access Control which would restrict new development. The E-2 Alternative would have a shorter five-lane section than the C-3 Alternative which would result in fewer new accesses, less development pressure and congestion and would improve safety at the south end of Moscow. See FEIS Chapter 4.10.2 for additional clarification of access control for the action alternatives. 3. ITD staff is currently on the City of Moscow Entryway Beautification Steering Committee. ITD will continue to coordinate as appropriate during final design to identify beautification and design elements; however, these may need to be maintained by the City of Moscow. 4. Bicycle and pedestrian facilities for the project are outlined in the Draft Environmental Impact Study (DEIS) Section 4.10.3. All Action Alternatives include a four-lane highway with center turn lane, gutter and sidewalk sections that meet American Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements. All Action Alternatives would improve safety and access for bicyclists and pedestrians. Final project design and maintenance would be coordinated with the City of Moscow as appropriate. Landscaping would be coordinated with the City of Moscow through ITD Staff participation on the City of Moscow Entryway Beautification Steering Committee. 5. ITD will work with City of Moscow staff during final project design as appropriate. 6. Coordination with business owners regarding access would occur during final design. Continued… Mr. Bill Belknap City of Moscow Date Page Two Specific Comments: 1. Employment data was provided by the Idaho Department of Labor for 2011 and includes full and part time employees.

The preferred intersection type will be grade separated with associated on-and off-ramps.  Option E-2 would likely allow for a highway overpass of the Ring Road as the highway comes down off of the finger ridge from Paradise Ridge. Consideration should be given in the project, if Option E-2 is selected, to including an overpass structure with this phase.  In the event that the Ring Road is not constructed, the overpass will still serve the local access street system for this portion of the Area of City Impact without having the conflicts associated with an at grade intersection. 2. A potential US95 bypass to the west of the City of Moscow (Ring Road Southwest Quadrant) should be considered in the planning and design of the highway segment just south of the current City limits.  While no physical improvements would be required at this time, the overpass option noted above could accommodate a bypass highway route. 3. For the section of existing US95 immediately south of the City of Moscow that will be realigned under Option E-2, consideration should be given to the continued operation of the existing commercial driveway approaches. In particular the approaches to the Primeland site will become somewhat removed from the highway.  A reconfiguration of the existing site access to continue service and to resolve potential access conflicts should be considered. 4. There is an existing unnamed and undeveloped City street right of way in the center of the Primeland site that will ultimately serve both the Primeland parcels and the properties to the west. This is the only public right of way on the west side of the highway south of Palouse River Drive that is available to serve these properties. This public street access point will need to be maintained and a future intersection with the highway planned. 5. Staff recommends that ITD incorporate both Stormwater detention and treatment within the urbanized areas in the Area of City Impact south of Moscow.  These standards are forthcoming under the City’s Phase II NPDES Stormwater program and the incorporation of such facilities within project design construction will eliminate the need to design and construct retrofit treatment systems at a later date. 1| Page Plan Comments 1. Page 5 -Exhibit 3: Due to the nature of highway traffic volumes, speed, and noise a sidewalk placed immediately adjacent to the curb line provides an unsatisfactory walking option for most users.  Consider adding a planter strip with a minimum width of five feet (seven preferred) between the curb and sidewalk.  If this option is not possible due to right of way width limitations or other issues, a reasonably alternate would be to widen the sidewalk to at least seven feet.  This will provide users more separation from the passing traffic. 2. Page 5 -Exhibit 3: Sufficient room in provided in the cross section for a bicycle lane on each side of the roadway, but the cross section does not designate the lanes.  Confirm that it is the intent that these spaces will be used and designated as marked bicycle lanes. 3. Page 18 ES.9: The first paragraph in this section notes that there are no other major transportation projects planned for the area and that the Ring Road is in conceptual phase with no alignment proposed.  The Ring Road concept has been developed to a point that an alignment is proposed based on topographic conditions, expected design standards (arterial vs. highway), and anticipated use (local arterial vs. bypass).  The alignment has been included in the adopted City of Moscow Comprehensive Plan, the Latah County Comprehensive Plan, and the North Latah County Highway District Transportation System Plan. While a final detailed alignment has not been developed, in the area of the interaction with the US95 realignment project, the Ring Road alignment options are fairly limited. This report section should further address the Ring Road and the point of interaction between to the two projects. 4. Page 70 Section 3.2.3:  First bullet in second paragraph discusses the Ring Road concept and indicates it has no “definitive alignment although it was proposed generally west of existing US-95”. This statement is incorrect in that the Ring Road is planned to encircle the entire City of Moscow and, thus, it will be on both sides of US95 with a crossing just south of the Primeland Silos as noted above. The report goes on to state that “the alternative to a western route would be an eastern route; however, several factors make the western route a more logical choice”. This statement is also in conflict with the Ring Road concept as noted previously.  If the intent of this section was to address the ability of the Ring Road to act as a highway bypass in the future then it should be noted that the Ring Road concept and alignment have been based upon ITD design standards in the southwest quadrant (US 95 to SH8) and Minor Arterial Standards in all other quadrants.  The southeast quadrant could be modified to an ITD standard fairly easily if there is ultimately a desire to reroute SH8 around the south end of town. A 2| Page reroute of US95 to the west of the City would include a portion in the State of Washington and Whitman County.  Initial discussions with these two organizations have met with approval of the concept. The Ring Road alignment in the northwest quadrant does not support a bypass as it was anticipated that a western US95 bypass route would diverge from the Ring Road a short distance north of the crossings over SR270 and Airport Road. 5. Page 71 Section 3.2.3:  The key policies noted for the Latah County Comprehensive Plan should denote that the Ring Road Concept is included as a transportation element in the area of the proposed US95 reroute. 6. Page 71 Section 3.2.3:  The North Latah County Highway District Transportation Plan incorporates the Ring Road concept and alignment.  The summary provided in this section should also reference that element. 7. Page 93 Section 3.7.3:  The second paragraph references a document by Hashmi 1995 when stating that the aquifer levels have been declining at a rate of one to two feet per year.  The document referenced is dated with respect to the current situation and more recent research performed in the basin.  Contact should be made with the Palouse Basin Aquifer Committee regarding more current research findings and conclusions regarding the status of the aquifers. The third paragraph in this section notes that the Wanapum aquifer is a primary water source for rural residents.  The City of Moscow also draws approximately 30% of its water supply from the Wanapum aquifer. 8. Page 115:  The first paragraph in the Mass Transit section notes that the vanpool between Moscow and Lewiston is operated through the Palouse-Clearwater Environmental Institute. The City of Moscow took over operation of the vanpool system in June 2010. 9. Page 229 Table 68: The mitigation measures noted in the table include transportation related items, but do not reference the existing undeveloped City street right of way near the Primeland Silos or the planned Ring Road improvements. Both of these items should be included in the table with respect to how they will be addressed with a realignment of US95. 3| Page Date Mr. Les MacDonald City of Moscow Public Works P.O.

Existing approaches would be allowed to remain at locations where construction of joint access is not economically justified. ITD will coordinate with business owners regarding access during final design when more detailed information is available. Language regarding these coordination efforts has been added to the FEIS Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments. 4. ITD will coordinate with the City regarding this public street access point. See response to General Comment 3 above. 5. The Draft Environmental Impact Study (DEIS) Section 2.4.2 describes that stormwater in the urban section would have curbs and gutters and stormwater would be collected and treated in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. This section in the FEIS and Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments has been modified to also state that it will be designed to meet the anticipated Phase II NPDES Stormwater requirements. Plan Comments 1. The five-foot wide sidewalk meets AASHTO standards and is proposed for all of the action alternatives.

HELM District Transportation Planner, Senior KGH:cty/C:\pw_work\pwitd\cyoung\d0165673\E-47 City of Moscow Public Works Individual Letter.docx bcc: TPS2 EPS2 DE2 Department of Interior Office of Environmental Policy & Compliance Main Interior Building, MS 2342 1849 C Street NW Washington, DC 20240 RE: US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow L-26 DEIS comments Dear Sir or Madam: The Idaho Transportation Department (ITD) received your letter regarding the referenced project. We acknowledge your concurrence with the 4(f) Evaluation for the project. ITD and Federal Highways Administration (FHWA) will continue to consult with SHPO as needed throughout the EIS process and during development of the selected alternative. The headers and numbers below correspond to your comment letter. General Comments ITD and FHWA acknowledge that the Department has considerable concern regarding the environmental impacts should the E-2 Alternative be selected. ITD and FHWA appreciate your mitigation recommendations and have incorporated them into the project as follows: 1. We would appreciate it if you send your list of recommended native vegetation. We would like to utilize the list during development of the re-vegetation plan for the selected alternative. See the FEIS Section 4.8 and Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments. 2. ITD and FHWA have committed to successfully implementing ITD’s Vegetation Management Plan that will help minimize the establishment and spread of weeds. This commitment has been further refined during design to include monitoring and implementation of control measures specific to documented Palouse Remnants.  See DEIS and FEIS Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments. 3. Accommodation for Wildlife Migration Corridors a) Since the DEIS publication ITD and FHWA have met with USFWS and IDFG and come to an agreement on mitigation measures for wildlife and habitat. These measures are described in the FEIS Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments.  ITD and FHWA are committed to continue to work with USFWS and IDFG through final design and project implementation to further refine the mitigation measures and to help ensure their success. Overpass structures for county roads and culverts for streams and riparian areas will be constructed with adequate width to provide wildlife passage. This may include potential retrofitting of existing structures where appropriate. ITD and FHWA will work closely with IDFG during design to determine details of the mitigation. ITD will also collaborate with USFWS and other resource agencies during design regarding weed control and Vegetation Management. Provisions for wildlife crossings will only be made where wildlife use is expected and where wildlife is welcome on private lands (deer, elk and moose). Continued… Department of Interior Office of Environmental Policy & Compliance Date Page Two The mitigation measure addressing timing for vegetation removal in the DEIS was revised to include specific dates so that it would avoid disturbing migratory birds during the nesting season. See FEIS Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments. Specific Comments 1) Section ES.6, Table 1. The discrepancy of wetland impact indicated in your letter (4.9 acres vs. 3.61 acres) compared the DEIS page 13 to a draft Wetland Functional Assessment report (Gilmore 2006) that was circulated as a draft for review in 2006 but was never finalized, nor was it circulated with the DEIS for public comment. The functional assessment and wetland delineation information is combined into one report titled Wetland Delineation Technical Report (Gilmore 2012), which was provided as a Technical Report to the DEIS during the recent public comment period. This 2012 report (Gilmore 2012) does not include impact calculations.  Wetland impact calculations are only included in the DEIS narrative; therefore, the 3.61 acres of wetland impacts for the E-2 Alternative which was stated on page 13 of the DEIS is correct. Please do not consider the draft Wetland Functional Assessment report (Gilmore 2006) as part of the DEIS submission. 2) Section ES.8, Topics of Concern or Controversy-We acknowledge that USFWS has determined that the E-2 Alternative would result in the greatest impact to Palouse Prairie habitat, including wildlife, sensitive plants and high value wetlands. However ITD and FHWA maintain that the E-2 Alternative would have the greatest safety benefit. We have also proposed mitigation to help offset resource impacts as stated in the FEIS Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments. Please see Section 2.6 for additional explanation of why ITD and FHWA have identified the E-2 Alternative for their Preferred Alternative. 3) Section ES.8, Topics of Concern of Controversy-The following was added to the FEIS Section ES.8 and Section 3.8: ITD commissioned four different wildlife experts to assess impacts and mitigation for large ungulates. The general descriptions of the reports are in the DEIS Section 3.8.2 Wildlife Studies. Each of the experts had similar conclusions regarding the quality of available habitat in the study areas and the relative impacts of the alternatives on that habitat which is stated in the DEIS and FEIS. The Sawyer report was intended to evaluate the mitigation recommendations for the project. Sawyer evaluated and summarized ungulate habitat in the corridors and the relative impacts by alternative. The Sawyer report found that the Melquist and Ruediger reports were consistent regarding general habitat quality and the relative alternatives' effects to habitat. The Sawyer report also provided new information that was available since the previous reports were prepared which also supported the conclusions of the reports. That information was presented in the DEIS. Both Ruediger and Melquist stated that the alternatives would not have population level effects to ungulates and that no mitigation was required for population level effects. Both offered optional recommendations that included wildlife crossing, fencing, habitat preservation and other measures that could benefit individuals and mitigate for animal vehicle collisions; however, these were not required, nor are they likely to be effective without land use control in the surrounding properties. Continued… Department of Interior Office of Environmental Policy & Compliance Date Page Three Melquist's report under Mitigation Requirements (page 24) stated that there would be no population level impacts due to the alternatives and therefore mitigation was not required.  However, he acknowledges that there may be impacts to individual ungulates through increased road kills, possible habitat avoidance, and increased risks to motorists and offers seven recommended actions that would benefit deer, elk, moose, and other wildlife should transportation corridors be constructed. These recommendations include one or two possible wildlife crossings near draws, fencing associated with the crossings, habitat preservation near those crossings and other measures. However, he further states that not implementing a recommended action would not jeopardize populations of any of the species. Animal/vehicle collisions (AVCs) and associated risks to motorists were considered in the AASHTO Safety Analysis and are mitigated for in the proposed alternatives’ design. Clearing vegetation from the clear zone (highway right-of-way), widening the roadway and improving the sight distance are all mitigating factors that are expected to significantly reduce the animal vehicle crashes (AVC). On US-20 between MP 369 and 375, similar improvements reduced the AVC by 85 percent (ITD 2012). To further mitigate for the possible AVCs, if the E-2 Alternative is selected, ITD has committed to monitoring AVCs and taking action to address AVCs should it be identified as a problem as a result of the monitoring. Ruediger did not recommend stand-alone large game crossings nor did he recommend replacement of lost wildlife habitat. However, in recognition of the resource agencies’ desire for mitigation, he made three optional recommendations, all of which were considered and included in the DEIS Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments. These were 1) to provide a wildlife/vehicle crossing at county road underpasses of US-95 where wildlife use is expected and where wildlife are welcome on private lands (deer, elk and moose), 2) to provide oversized culverts to allow for small terrestrial movement and 3) to replace water sources on the east side of the highway should water sources be impacted. Fencing will also be provided to prevent animals from getting onto the highway in areas where collisions are most likely and to funnel wildlife into crossings. Additional detail about the crossings for small terrestrial movement and fencing has been added to the FEIS Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments. 4) Section 2.5.2, Screen Alternatives, Eastern Corridor page 45-The referenced statement has been further clarified to indicate that the E-2 Alternative would not directly affect rare plant communities. See FEIS, Section 2.5.2. The DEIS and the FEIS both disclose that the E-2 Alternative would have the greatest indirect effect to rare plant restoration efforts (DEIS page 167) because it would be closer to planned and ongoing restoration efforts compared to the other Action Alternatives and could result in weed establishment and spread. The discussion of indirect effects is included in DEIS (and FEIS) Section 6.1.3. The discussion of impacts to the planned and ongoing rare plant restoration projects is in the DEIS and FEIS Section 4.8.3 and in Chapter 6, Indirect and Cumulative Effects. 5) Section 2.6 Comparison of Alternatives-The FEIS Section 2.6, Comparison of Alternatives was modified to state that the E-2 Alternative would be located closer to planned and ongoing Palouse Restoration Projects and a key conservation area for Silene spaldingii.  More detail regarding potential weed dispersal on Paradise Ridge due to the E-2 Alternative and existing and future development, has been added to the FEIS, Chapter 6, Indirect and Cumulative Effects. Additional text regarding impacts to a key conservation area for Silene spaldingii was also added to the FEIS Section 3.9.3 Existing Conditions under Spalding’s catchfly. Continued… Department of Interior Office of Environmental Policy & Compliance Date Page Four 6) Section 3.8.2 Methodology-ITD and FHWA appreciate the reports and GIS data provided. This report and GIS information was reviewed just before publication of the DEIS and was incorporated on page 98 of the DEIS.  When comparing the GIS data, the Palouse Grasslands (PG) remnant data, which was provided with the report, were many small polygons of grassland, which encompassed a much smaller area than the remnants that were identified in ITD's 2005 report.  Therefore, the 2005 data was used but was supplemented to include two additional remnant areas that were not previously identified.  7) Section 3.8.3, Existing Conditions has been expanded to describe that the US Department of Interior with concurrence by the state of Idaho Natural Heritage Program considers the Palouse prairie to be critically endangered. Additional statements regarding other agency and organizations position of the ecosystem has also been added. 8) Additional information regarding the existing weeds and invasive plants and the potential for weed dispersal as a result of the alternatives has been added to the FEIS Sections 3.8, 3.9, 4.8, 4.9 and Chapter 6, Indirect and Cumulative Effects.  Mitigation for potential weed dispersal is presented in Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments. 9) Thank you for the correction. The distance to the nearest Silene spaldingii population was updated from 10 miles to 8 miles in the FEIS Section 3.9.3 under Spalding's catchfly. 10) Additional information regarding migratory bird nesting habitat on CRP lands and the alternatives impacts to migratory birds and their nesting habitat has been added to the FEIS Section 3.8.3 under Grassland Habitat and under FEIS Section 4.8. 11) Nest boxes will be placed to provide temporary nesting opportunities for pygmy nuthatch. ITD will minimize the impacts to the PSS wetlands during the design by utilizing engineering solutions such as reducing the fill slopes or using crossings that span the wetlands where practicable to allow for large wildlife movement. This will involve the use of crossings to minimize impacts to PSS wetlands (Wetlands 13 and 32) and help facilitate wildlife movement through the riparian corridor. Native trees and shrubs that must be removed will be made available for salvaging and restoration either within the project limits or for projects nearby. 12) The measures taken to avoid, minimize harm to and provide compensatory mitigation for wetland effects are described in Section 4.6, under Executive Order 11990 and in the FEIS Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments. 13) ITD will minimize the impacts to the PSS wetlands during the design by utilizing engineering solutions such as reducing the fill slopes or using crossings that span the wetlands where practicable to allow for large wildlife movement. This will involve the use of crossings to minimize impacts to PSS wetlands (Wetlands 13 and 32) and help facilitate wildlife movement through the riparian corridor. This has been reflected in FEIS Section 4.6 and Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments. 14) The FEIS Section 4.6.2 Wetland Effects was modified to specify "compensatory" mitigation. 15) Additional information regarding the relative effects of the alignments on the restoration efforts and the funding that has been applied to restoration efforts is included in FEIS Section 4.8.3. Mitigation will include the development and implementation of weed control efforts within 0.6 miles of the area with special focus on Paradise Ridge including the restoration areas. 16) Additional detail regarding the effects of the E-2 Alternative on the pine stands and the resulting effects to pygmy nuthatch has been added to the FEIS Section 4.8. Based on the Continued… Department of Interior Office of Environmental Policy & Compliance Date Page Five analysis, the remaining stands will be large enough to support pygmy nuthatch but there could be fragmentation of the habitat due to tree removal. The effects of noise on birds vary with traffic volume, speed, wildlife species and habitats. The study that you referenced (Foreman 2000) has useful information regarding the effects of busy roads on wildlife. The study indicated that traffic noise from busy roadways could affect bird communication for grassland birds. However, it must be recognized that the study was based on a road with traffic volumes measured between 45,000 to 150,000 vehicles per day, which is between 5 and 18 times greater than the Thorncreek Road to Moscow project. The study also did not measure the noise levels. Based on FHWA noise tables, traffic volumes and their predicted noise levels for the studied roadway are much higher than the predicted levels for the existing corridor. In a more recent Massachusetts (USA) study by the same author (Foreman, et al, 2003), highways with moderate traffic volume (8,000-15,000 ADT) there was no effect on bird presence, although breeding was affected for 400 meters. For relatively light traffic volume (3,000-8,000 ADT) there was no significant effect on grassland bird distribution. This study of the light traffic volumes is more comparable to this project than the study of the high volume roadway. Additional information regarding the potential effects of noise on birds has been incorporated into the FEIS section 4.8. and 6.1. Additional detail regarding the E-2 Alternative's effects on the pine stand and the effects to pygmy nuthatch are also included. 17) Melquist did not observe nesting pygmy in the pine stand. His comments are based on information from the landowner, Kas Dumroese. Melquist states that pygmy nuthatches were observed and the landowner heard vocalizations. While nesting in this stand was not observed, the landowner had observed juveniles soliciting adults for food at his bird feeders, suggesting that nesting occurs in the vicinity. For this reason, the DEIS described that the pine stands are “potential” nesting habitat. See the FEIS Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments for mitigation measures. 18) The referenced statement has been removed and the discussion of pygmy nuthatch has been revised. See FEIS Section 4.8. The report recommends that the pine stands be avoided to reduce impacts to pygmy nuthatch, however, there are other factors to weigh including safety, displacements and effects to cultural resources. 19) The statement was obtained from the Lass and Prather report on page 12. The reference to that technical report has been added to FEIS Section 4.8. 20) The long-term viability of the Key Conservation Area may be affected by the alternatives but will also be affected to a greater extent by the existing development and continued development in and around the Key Conservation Area. The project will help to minimize harm by limiting access along the roadway, which will reduce development pressures. However, based on the existing zoning and building permits, development is expected to continue around the Key Conservation Area. This could contribute to the long-term, cumulative effects to the Key Conservation Areas. Additional information has been added to the FEIS Chapter 6, Indirect and Cumulative Effects. ITD and FHWA suggest that the development be addressed as part of the municipal planning process through land use planning and protective ordinances. ITD has also proposed mitigation measures and Continued… Department of Interior Office of Environmental Policy & Compliance Date Page Six standard practices that could reduce indirect effects as a result of the alternatives. See FEIS Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments. Additional information regarding the projects impacts to the long-term viability of the Paradise Ridge/Gormsen Butte Key Conservation Area (USFWS 2007) was added to the FEIS Section 6.2 Cumulative Effects. 21) The referenced statement on page 210 of the DEIS was revised in the FEIS Section 4.3. 22) The reference “(Peterson 2008)” was added to the FEIS Section 6.2 Cumulative Effects and to the FEIS Reference section as follows: “Peterson, A., I.

HELM District Transportation Planner, Senior KGH:cty/ bcc: TPS2 EPS2 DE2 US Environmental Protection Agency Region 10 1200 Sixth Avenue, Suite 900 Seattle, WA 98101-3140 RE: US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow L-28 DEIS comments Dear Sir or Madam: The Idaho Transportation Department (ITD) received your letter dated March 25, 2013 regarding the referenced project.  We acknowledge your concerns regarding the E-2 Alternative and your detailed comments. We are providing the following as a follow-up to your concerns. The headers correspond to the bolded topic headers in your comment letter. Preferred Alternative-Need for Context Sensitive Solution As you noted in your letter, ITD and The Federal Highways Administration (FHWA) have taken steps to involve agencies, gather public comment and to conduct further studies. Based on the Revised Safety Analysis (ITD 2013) and in consideration of new information and the findings of the various technical studies and public input, ITD and FHWA maintain that the E-2 Alternative is FHWA’s and ITD’s Preferred Alternative. The E-2 Alternative is preferred and the alignment was not altered because it is designed and located to provide the greatest safety benefit which best meets the project purpose and need. However, additional mitigation measures have been added to the FEIS to address the E-2 Alternatives’ impacts to natural resources. See FEIS Section 2.6 Preferred Alternative and Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments. The E-2 Alternative is predicted to have 46 fewer total crashes and 9 fewer fatal and injury related crashes in the 19-year design period compared to the C-3 Alternative.  It is predicted to have 32 fewer total crashes and 16 fewer fatal and injury related crashes in the 19 year design period compared to the W-4 Alternative and 31 fewer total crashes and 15.5 fatal and injury crashes than the Modified W-4 Alternative. The differences in the human impacts are believed by ITD and FHWA to be a considerable difference and that the other impacts, with mitigation would not outweigh the benefits. Context sensitive solutions that have been incorporated into the Preferred Alternative are described in the FEIS Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments.  A few examples are listed below:  • Should the E-2 Alternative be selected, ITD will evaluate engineering solutions to reduce the impacts to the Palustrine scrub-shrub wetlands (Wetlands 13 and 32). This could involve steepening slopes to reduce wetland fill while still designing to meet safety standards.  This change will be evaluated and designed during the preliminary design process when detailed geotechnical and survey detail is available. • ITD will construct an undercrossing for Eid Road that will be designed to accommodate both vehicle traffic and wildlife, including ungulates, to cross under the highway. The crossing would have sloped sides with a natural surface. The animals would use the sloped side as well as the right of way adjacent to the highway. Fencing will be installed to direct wildlife to the crossing. All tributary crossings, including the crossings at Wetlands 13 and 32, which are scrub-shrub wetlands, will be designed to accommodate small terrestrial wildlife. Details of the crossing structures and fencing will be determined during preliminary and final design when detailed topographic and geotechnical information is available. • US-95 will be an Expressway Access Control facility and no new non-agricultural accesses will be permitted on US-95 without ITD consent, which would minimize future private and commercial development. This will reduce the potential future impacts to resources including rare, sensitive and ecologically valuable habitats and ecosystems, scenic value, natural functions. This access control will also minimize future farmland impacts, and future impacts to wildlife habitat due to development. See the FEIS Section 2.4.2 and 4.10 for additional information regarding proposed future access. See Chapter 6.1 regarding indirect effects due to induced growth. • ITD will work with farmers to construct farmable slopes. This will both minimize the amount of farmable land lost and reduce weed establishment and spread to sensitive areas. • ITD’s Vegetation Management Plan will be implemented as summarized in FEIS Section 4.8 and in Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments. The Clean Water Act (CWA) Section 404(b)(1) analysis will be completed during the Section 404 permit process should an action alternative be selected. During the preliminary and final design process and coordination with the USACE, there will be ongoing efforts to further avoid, minimize, and mitigate potential adverse impacts to wetlands, waters of US, Palouse prairie and other natural as well as human resources through the use of engineering solutions. Section 4.6 under the heading Executive Order 11990 discusses avoidance, minimization and mitigation for wetland impacts. Aquatic Resources Effects Additional information demonstrating the alternatives' effects on 303(d) listed streams and compliance with TMDLs has been added to the FEIS Section 4.6 Wetlands and Tributaries and to FEIS Chapter 6, Indirect and Cumulative Effects. ITD recognizes that the headwater streams that would be impacted by the E-2 Alterative provide a higher level of function compared to those further downstream. This is reflected through the higher wetland rating which considers three major categories of functions and values including water quality, hydrology and habitat. This is also stated in the DEIS Section 4.6.1. Compensatory Mitigation for the Loss of Aquatic Habitat [33 CFR Parts 325 and 332 and 40 CFR 230] and Executive Order 11990, Protection of Wetlands require that lost functions and values be replaced. Additional detail regarding mitigation including the avoidance, minimization and compensatory mitigation in order to replace the impacted wetland functions and values are described in the FEIS Section 4.6 and Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments. ITD and FHWA will continue to work with EPA, USFWS, IDFG and the USACE during the design process to identify engineering solutions to minimize wetland impacts due to the selected alternative. Should an individual Section 404 permit be required, a 404(b)(1) analysis will be completed during the Section 404 permitting process. While a 404(b)(1) analysis will not be completed prior to the FEIS, additional information regarding the avoidance, minimization and compensatory mitigation is summarized in the FEIS Section 4.6, under Executive Order 11990 and Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments. Regarding the inconsistency in E-2 wetland impacts, the tables that were referenced were both correct and added up to 3.61 acres of wetland impact by the E-2 Alternative; however, Table 2 continued on the next page (page 156) and your calculations may not have considered the entire table. Compensatory Mitigation Plan Compensatory mitigation for the Action Alternatives will be met by using credits from the Cow Creek Mitigation Area, which has already been successfully implemented. The USACE has already approved the site and it meets their mitigation requirements under Section 404; therefore a detailed compensatory mitigation plan is not necessary. However, should an action alternative be selected and during design refinements it is determined that the wetland impacts would exceed what is stated in the FEIS, then additional mitigation may be pursued by purchasing mitigation bank credits. Wetland mitigation is summarized in the FEIS Section 4.6 under Executive Order 11990 and Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments. Effects to Palouse Prairie Habitat, Rare and Threatened Plant Species As stated in the DEIS, the E-2 Alternative is closer to Paradise Ridge and more Palouse remnants compared to the other alternatives but it would not "directly" affect Paradise Ridge, Palouse Prairie Habitat, rare and threatened plant species. The referenced statement on page 45 has been clarified to refer to direct effects. The Noxious and Invasive Weeds technical report by Lass and Prather does indicate that the alternatives would have indirect effects due to weed dispersal which was disclosed in the DEIS Section 6.1 under Indirect Effects. Additional information from the Vegetation Technical Report has been incorporated into the body of the FEIS in sections 3.8, 4.8 and Section 6.1. Additional information regarding the cumulative effects to Palouse Prairie and vegetation has been added to Section 6.2, Cumulative Effects. In recognition of the potential indirect effects due to weed dispersal and establishment, ITD and FHWA are committed to implementing ITD’s Vegetation Management Plan andconsulting with USFWS regarding specific weed control measures to minimize impact to Palouse prairie and restoration sites. This may involve providing funding for long term management, maintenance and monitoring which will be determined during the right-of-way process. See the FEIS Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments. Wildlife and Habitat Ecological Connectivity All the alternatives would accommodate wildlife crossing at county road under-crossings, including the E-2 Alternative. A general description of the wildlife crossing structures and other measures to accommodate wildlife movements is included in the FEIS Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments. Specific detail regarding the type, size and locations of each wildlife structure (bridge and culverts) is not available at this level of design. That detail will be provided during preliminary and final design when specific topographic and geotechnical information is available. If the E-2 Alternative is selected, impacted water features that would be replaced will be relocated on the east side of the roadway to reduce the movement of wildlife across the roadway. Safety Effects The crash predictions in the FEIS are based on calculations from the First Edition of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Highway Safety Manual (HSM). The HSM provides the most current and accepted knowledge and practices relating to safety management according to AASHTO and Transportation Research Board Task Forces. FHWA and all 50 State Departments of Transportation have reviewed and accepted the HSMs methods for crash predictions. A better method of crash prediction does not exist. The Safety Analysis was revised after the DEIS public comment period to address comments and to predict crashes for the entire 19-year design period. In order to make the safety predictions reported in the Safety Analysis and the FEIS for the 19-year design period, nearly 2000 pages of calculations were made on Microsoft Excel Spreadsheets shown in the Revised Safety Analysis (ITD, 2013), Appendix E. The spreadsheets were developed by Karen Dixon, PhD, of Oregon State University, one of the authors of the HSM. Pages 9 through 11 of the Safety Analysis (ITD, 2013) have more detail regarding the methods of calculations used by the HSM. Facts as well as assumptions were used to predict crash data for Thorncreek Road to Moscow. The following facts are used in the Highway Safety Manual equations and support the prediction that E2 is safer than C3: • The overall length of E-2 is less than C-3, • The length of the suburban section in E-2 is shorter than the length of the suburban section of C-3. More accidents are predicted per mile in the suburban section than the rural section due to increased turning traffic, more access points, narrower separation between the northbound and southbound directions, and greater traffic volume, • E-2 has fewer residential and commercial approaches than C-3, • C-3 has five public road approaches and E-2 has two public road approaches. The traffic predictions, their growth rates, Crash Modification Factors, and Calibration Factors are considered assumptions. Traffic predictions are included in the Revised Safety Analysis (ITD 2013) Appendix C and E. The Crash Modification Factors as well as the Calibration Factor are included in Revised Safety Analysis (ITD 2013) Appendix E.  The Crash Modification Factors are widely accepted and published in the Highway Safety Manual and the Calibration Factor used is 1.0 for all alignments. All three proposed action alternatives use exactly the same Crash Modification Factors for each highway type. If the Crash Modification Factors are changed, the crash predictions on all three alignments will increase or decrease by about the same amount. Based on these findings, the E-2 Alternative is safer than the C-3 Alternative using prediction methods outlined in the AASHTO Highway Safety Manual. Wild animal crash potential may be greater on E-2 based on findings in wildlife technical reports that there is more moderate quality ungulate habitat in the Eastern Corridor and due to the presence of a Low Priority Wildlife Linkage Areas for 1.98 miles of the E-2 Alternative’s alignment; (Geodata 2008); however, sight distance for the E-2 Alternative would be greater than the C-3 and W-4 (and Modified W-4) alternatives due to its straighter roadway geometry. The greater sight distance on E2 may offset the wild animal crash potential. The frequency of wild animal crashes is difficult to predict; however, the severity of wild animal crashes is observed to be very low compared to other crash types. Even if more wild animal crashes were predicted on the E-2 Alternative, they would not offset the safety benefits of the other alternatives due to their low severity. The safety benefit can be quantified using FHWA’s calculated economic cost of crashes for different crash types. Roadside clearing is predicted to greatly reduce wild animal crash potential on all action alternatives, because brush and vegetation where wild animals can hide would be removed near the highway. It would also improve driver reaction time. The roadside clearing technique has been found to reduce wild animal crashes from 50 – 90 percent. This has been demonstrated through similar improvements from in other sections of US-95 and on US-20 between MP 369 and MP 375 where similar improvements reduced the wild animal crashes by 90 percent (ITD 2013). More detailed information regarding wild animal crashes is in the Revised Safety Analysis (ITD 2013). The Revised Safety Analysis (ITD 2013) considers the safety of the sections of US-95 that would be transferred to the North Latah Highway District. Based on the revised analysis, the E-2 Alternative is predicted to have 46 fewer total crashes and 9 fewer fatal and injury related crashes in the 19 year design period than the C-3 Alternative.  It is predicted to have 32 fewer total crashes and 16 fewer fatal and injury related crashes in the 19 year design period than the W-4 Alternative and would have 31 fewer total crashes and 15.5 fewer fatal and injury crashes than the Modified W-4 Alternative. The difference in the human impacts is believed by ITD and FHWA to be a substantial gain, which is not offset by the other environmental impacts, with mitigation. Regarding weather related safety, while weather, including precipitation, is an important contributing factor to driver safety, the highway alignment characteristics govern the spatial distribution of weather-related vehicle accident potential. The concentrations of weather-related accidents are attributable to tight radii curves on steep slopes, and are independent of the relative elevation, snow accumulation, precipitation, or fog within the highway section. The improved typical sections for each of the alternatives would mitigate in weather related safety but would be influenced by factors such as slope orientation, steepness of grade, curvature, and the location of decent. All action alternatives would improve the highway to meet AASHTO standards and would therefore be safe. See the FEIS Section 3.10 and 4.10 and the Revised Weather Analysis (Qualls 2013) for additional information. Land Use/Induced Development Effects All of the action alternatives would result in induced growth south of the City of Moscow. This is an area that is already experiencing development. All of the action alternatives would be limited access facilities that would restrict any new accesses and reduce the induced growth and potential indirect and cumulative effects due to residential or commercial growth. The E-2 Alternative is anticipated to have the fewest accesses of any of the action alternatives. Effects on Farmland and Conservation Reserve Program Lands The CRP land being affected functions for erosion control and provides moderate wildlife habitat for grassland birds and ungulates. While there may be impacts to CRP lands, these impacts will not result in a long-term degradation of ecological functions. The CRP contracts have or will soon expire and the land would be replanted, most probably, in wheat. Additional information regarding the ecosystem services of farmland including CRP land is included in the FEIS Sections 3.8 and 4.8.  CRP land is also discussed in the FEIS Section 3.3 and 4.3. Environmental Justice-Low Income/Minority Housing As disclosed in the DEIS, the E-2 Alternative will impact the Benson Mobile Home Park, which is not considered an environmental justice community (low-income or minority populations). It does have some minority residents and provides a source of affordable housing but there are no distinguishable minority or low income populations. Avoidance by the E-2 Alternative was not possible because the homes are oriented all along Eid Road perpendicular to the alignment and it would affect some homes regardless of which way the alignment was shifted. There are no gaps between the houses that would be sufficient to accommodate the width of the alignment without impacting homes. The homes would be relocated according to the Uniform Relocation Act. The E2 Alternative would disproportionately impact homes in the Benson Mobile Home Park but would not result in a disproportionate impact to low-income or minority populations because this is not considered minority or low income populations.  The E-2 Alternative would provide the greatest safety benefit compared to the other alternatives and best meets the project purpose and need. See FEIS Section 4.1. Groundwater A Hydrogeologic Analysis Report has been prepared for the project (RHS 2014). Additional information from this report regarding the direct effects of the alternatives to surface and subsurface waters have been added to the FEIS Sections 3.6, 3.7, 4.6, and 4.7. Additional information regarding indirect and cumulative effects to surface and groundwater has been added to the FEIS Chapter 6, Indirect and Cumulative Effects. Visual, Noise, and Other Community Effects The project is currently being designed at a conceptual level of analysis. Should an action alternative be selected, ITD and FHWA will utilize specific geotechnical information and topographic survey data to more specifically design cuts and fills and look for opportunities to minimize the visual impacts of the project. ITD will also meet with landowners during the design process to find opportunities to minimize impacts to properties. Mitigation measures to minimize impacts are proposed in the FEIS Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments. Noise Additional information on noise impacts on wildlife was added to FEIS Section 6.1. In addition to the above considerations, ITD has considered the land use consistency of the C-3 Alternative and the natural and cultural heritage of Paradise Ridge. This can be exemplified throughout the DEIS and specifically in Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments. Project Construction Waste, material, staging and stockpile areas will be identified by the contractor and approved by ITD prior before construction activities begin. Sensitive areas that should be avoided will be identified in consultation with agencies and will be indicated on plan sheets to be retained and protected. Material sources will be commercial sites and therefore will be in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. It is anticipated that the staging, and stockpile sites would be within the existing road footprint. See Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments. Monitoring and Adaptive Management All monitoring and adaptive management commitments have been added to the FEIS Chapter 9. Additional EIS Information needs and Corrections Information regarding the indirect effects to Palouse prairie remnants, vegetation, and restoration sites has been expanded on in the FEIS Executive Summary as well as in Section 6.1. The reference to the IDFG MOU has been revised. Since the publication of the DEIS ITD and IDFG have come to an agreement on mitigation measures and decided that an MOU was unnecessary. These mitigation measures and additional environmental commitments have been added to the FEIS Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments. ITD would like to thank you for your comments and participation in the development of the FEIS. Sincerely, KENNETH G. HELM District Transportation Planner, Senior KGH:cty/C:\pw_work\pwitd\cyoung\d0165673\L-28 EPA Individual Letter.docx bcc: TPS2 EPS2 DE2 Date Idaho Department of Fish & Game 3316 16th Street Lewiston, ID 83501 RE: US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow L-31 DEIS comments Dear Sir or Madam: The Idaho Transportation Department (ITD) received your Letter regarding the referenced project and is providing the following as a follow-up to your concerns. We also appreciate you reviewing these comments and responses during our meeting on May 20, 2014. The bolded headers correspond to those headers on your comment letter. Preferred Alternative We acknowledge that the Palouse Prairie remnants are an important ecosystem and that none of the alternatives evaluated in the DEIS, Including the E-2 Alternative would directly affect this ecosystem. Mitigation for possible indirect effects to the Palouse Prairie Remnants are described in the FEIS, Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments and are summarized in this letter. Mitigation MOU The referenced statement in the DEIS Table 68 regarding the development of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between Idaho Transportation Department (ITD) and IDFG has been revised and mitigation measures are incorporated into the FEIS, Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments.  No MOU will be prepared. IDFG Wildlife Report: The descriptions of the technical report titled General Wildlife Assessment; Thorncreek Road To Moscow (2006) which was referenced in the DEIS page 22, p162 and p168 were modified in the FEIS Section 3.8 to clarify that the IDFG Technical Report did not assess the alternatives’ impacts to general wildlife species. The reference to "key indicator species" was removed but "representative wildlife species" as indicated in the report, remains. The FEIS was revised to incorporate the methodology section from the General Wildlife Assessment (IDFG 2006). Your comment also stated that the DEIS included species that would act as representative species but that rationale for their inclusion is not provided in the DEIS; specifically for northern alligator lizard, pygmy nuthatch and long eared myotis.  The first two species were included in the DEIS because they were evaluated in the IDFG General Wildlife Assessment. IDFG's rationale for including species in the evaluation was that they were either Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN), or in the case of the pygmy nuthatch, were previously SGCN. These species had also been of concern to the public during the scoping period. Melquist identified the long eared myotis as a SGCN although it was not included in IDFG's General Wildlife Assessment. Additional information about the rationale for inclusion of the species in the DEIS and IDFG's use of species as surrogates for effects to and for the mitigation needs for other wildlife species has been clarified in the FEIS Section 3.8.3. Footnote comments: There were a number of comments that were noted within the footnotes of the letter. Footnote comment #1 states that the IDFG General Wildlife Assessment did not evaluate effects to large ungulates, pygmy nuthatch or Townsend's big-eared bat; however, page 23-24 of the IDFG General Wildlife Assessment focuses on ungulate habitat impacts and mitigation recommendations for loss of habitat for ungulates. The effects to pygmy nuthatch are discussed from page 14 to 15. Melquist's reports included ungulates, pygmy nuthatch, and long eared myotis and may have been used as the original source of information for the IDFG report.  Townsend's big-eared bat was not included in Melquist's report but is included in the IDFG General Wildlife Assessment. Footnote comment #2 pertains to the lack of rationale in the DEIS for including and focusing on the impacts to northern alligator lizard, pygmy nuthatch and long eared myotis. These species were each SGCN, previously included as SGCN, or were species for which the public and agencies expressed specific interest. The IDFG General Wildlife Assessment indicated that these three species were the only species in IDFG's General Wildlife Assessment for which the effects would differ between alternatives, specifically the E-2 Alternative. Therefore, the differences in impacts to these three alternatives were described in more detail in the DEIS.  While the DEIS does not describe for which species the northern alligator lizard, pygmy nuthatch and long eared myotis would act as surrogates, this same explanation is not provided for the remainder of the species that are described in the IDFG General Wildlife Assessment; however it may be presumed that the report intended that the species would be surrogates for other species occupying similar habitat. This explanation has been provided in the FEIS Section 3.8.2, Methodology as stated below: "This report assesses the alternative's impacts to representative wildlife species that would provide an indication of not only of impact for all species, but suggests suitable protections and mitigations for unavoidable impacts. The limited number of species evaluated serve as surrogates for all other wildlife species expected to be present in the project area that might utilize similar habitat." General Wildlife Assessment, Thorncreek to Moscow (December 2006). This report is a general assessment of wildlife impacts for the US-95 Thorncreek to Moscow Project. IDFG evaluated impacts of the project on Idaho Species of Greatest Conservation Need. It was determined that impacts to species of greatest conservation need found within the project area would provide an indication of impact for all species. This report suggests suitable protections and mitigations for unavoidable impacts. The limited number of species evaluated serve as surrogates for all other wildlife species expected to be present in the project area that might utilize similar habitat (IDFG 2006). It has also been clarified in the FEIS Section 3.8 under Wildlife Species. Wildlife Effects Analysis: General Comment The objective of the Sawyer report was to provide an independent assessment of potential big game impacts, which were primarily based on the reports by Melquist and Ruediger and did not evaluate the IDFG report; therefore, it was removed from the referenced statement. See FEIS Section 3.8.2 Methodology. The Sawyer report evaluated and summarized ungulate habitat in the corridors and the relative impacts by alternative.  The Sawyer report found that the Melquist and Ruediger reports were consistent regarding general habitat quality and the relative alternatives' effects to habitat. The Sawyer report also provided new information that was available since the previous reports were prepared which also supported the conclusions of the reports. That information was presented in the DEIS. Both Ruediger and Melquist stated that the alternatives would not have population level effects to ungulates and that no mitigation was required for population level effects. Both offered optional recommendations that included (limited) wildlife crossing, fencing, habitat preservation and other measures that could benefit individuals and mitigate for animal vehicle collisions. However, these were not required, nor are they likely to be effective without land use control in the surrounding properties. More extensive wildlife mitigation was not considered appropriate due to the following factors: 1. The Idaho Highway Linkage Assessment (Geodata Services 2008) prioritized the Thorn Creek Wildlife Linkage as “low priority”. This assessment was conducted by Idaho Fish and Game in April 2007 and included personnel from IDFG Region 2, US Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, and US Fish and Wildlife Service representation. 2. Habitat along the project area is primarily privately owned. The area, especially to the west, is adjacent to the city of Moscow where future developments are likely. 3. Deer, elk and moose habitat to the west is mostly farmland and residential and is generally not suited to be managed for wildlife. There is not significant habitat to warrant habitat connectivity or more extensive wildlife crossings. Melquist's report under Mitigation Requirements (page 24) stated that there would be no population level impacts due to the alternatives and therefore mitigation was not required. However, he acknowledges that there may be impacts to individual ungulates through increased road kills, possible habitat avoidance, and increased risks to motorists and offers seven recommended actions that would benefit deer, elk, moose, and other wildlife should transportation corridors be constructed. These recommendations include 1 or 2 possible wildlife crossings near draws, fencing associated with the crossings, habitat preservation near those crossings and other measures. However, he further states that not implementing a recommended action would not jeopardize populations of any of the species. Road kills and associated risks to motorists were considered in the AASHTO Safety Analysis and are mitigated for in the proposed alternatives’ design. Clearing vegetation from the clear zone, widening the roadway and improving the sight distance are all mitigating factors that are expected to substantially reduce the animal vehicle crashes (AVC). On US-20 between MP 369 and 375, similar improvements reduced the AVC by 85 percent (ITD 2012).  To further mitigate for the possible AVCs, if the E-2 Alternative is selected; ITD will monitor AVCs and address the AVCs if monitoring results indicate it as a problem. Ruediger's report did not recommend large game crossings nor did he recommend replacement of lost wildlife habitat.  However, in recognition of the resource agencies’ desire for mitigation, he made three optional recommendations, all of which were considered and included in the DEIS Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments. These were: 1) Allow animal crossing at county road underpasses of US-95 where wildlife use is expected and where wildlife are welcome on private lands (deer, elk and moose). 2) Provide oversized culverts to allow for small terrestrial movement. 3) Replace water sources on the east side of the highway should water sources be impacted; however, water sources are not expected to be impacted. Fencing will also be provided to prevent animals from getting onto the highway in areas where collisions are most likely and to funnel animals into crossings. Additional detail about the crossings for small terrestrial movement and fencing has been added to the FEIS Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments. Regarding the consistency of the findings between consultants regarding elk and moose habitat, Sawyer’s independent assessment agreed with both Melquist and Ruediger that elk and moose habitat was “marginal” and that mitigation “maybe warranted” for white-tailed deer (Sawyer 2010). Sawyer was also asked to make an independent assessment of mitigation and make mitigation recommendations based on the actual impacts and whether the mitigation would be effective. This process and the rationale for Sawyer's recommendations are explained in detail in the FEIS under Ungulate Effects. Wildlife Effects Analysis-Indirect Effects The referenced statement on page 166 is within the DEIS Chapter 4, Environmental Consequences, which analyzes the direct effects to resources. Indirect effects to fish and wildlife, including the effects of fragmentation and induced growth to ungulate movement, were discussed in the DEIS Chapter 6, Indirect and Cumulative Effects, Section 6.1 Indirect Effects under the header of Fish and Wildlife. Additional information regarding displacement acreages and buffers, noise effects and other effects to wildlife that are in the wildlife reports has been added into the respective sections of the FEIS. Additional information regarding mitigation recommendations is included in the FEIS Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments. Footnote comment: The footnote statement: "It would not disturb the forested habitat on Paradise Ridge but is closer to Paradise Ridge than the other alternatives." is contradicted on the next page.  For clarification, the forested stand that is impacted is near Eid Road and is not part of the forested habitat on Paradise Ridge. See DEIS Section 4.8 Exhibit 29, Habitat Feature Effects. Wildlife Effects Analysis: Species Selectivity The wildlife sections disclosed impacts to many wildlife species including deer, elk, and moose the SGCN evaluated in the IDFG General Wildlife Assessment and additional species that were raised as concerns during the public involvement process. The DEIS discusses the effects to the northern alligator lizard, pygmy nuthatch and long eared myotis in greater detail because they are SGCN for which effects differ between alternatives which would be an important consideration for the public and decision makers when comparing alternatives. The effects to the additional 34 SGCN were provided in the DEIS Table 47 and are available through the technical reports. The information was not detailed in the DEIS because the effects were not differentiated between alternatives in the IDFG General Wildlife Assessment. The details regarding the other species are provided through references to the technical reports. The rationale for discussing these species in more detail is clarified in the FEIS Section 3.8. Habitat The sentence was deleted and restated as follows: “While Melquist stated there would be no direct impact to long-eared myotis or pygmy nuthatch due to construction of any of the alternatives, the loss of habitat is expected to result in indirect impacts to resident populations. (Melquist 2005b). See Section 6.1 Indirect Effects. Melquist identified other suitable habitat nearby at Paradise Ridge and throughout Northern Idaho (Melquist 2005b). In his report Melquist states that other pygmy nuthatch suitable habitat is located near the Dumroese property, near the Robinson Lake Park in Moscow, Idler’s Rest and most of the areas of the Palouse that still have ponderosa pine (Melquist 2005b; figure 3). The WCS (IDFG 2005) generally describes the Palouse Prairie Ecosystem and provides mapping of dry conifer forest, listing it as habitat for many species including pygmy nuthatch and northern alligator lizard.  Dry conifer forest is shown to cover approximately 42 percent of the Palouse Prairie Ecosystem (IDFG 2005)” In addition, supplemental information regarding fragmentation of pine stands and possible effects to pygmy nuthatch was added to the FEIS Section 6.1 under Fragmentation. Mitigation measures that would mitigate for the loss of the pine stand include adding nest boxes per Dr. Melquist’s recommendation (page 231) and removing trees outside of the breeding period (also page 231). See FEIS Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments. ITD is committed to working with IDFG before final design on implementing these mitigation measures. Indirect effects are considered in the DEIS and FEIS Section 6.1. Cumulative Effect Citations are not provided for all general statements but are referred to in each respective methodology section where the technical reports are referenced. This is in part to make the document reader friendly. However, the respective referenced section in the FEIS has been modified and a citation added to the end of the sentence. Additional information regarding habitat fragmentation is also included in the technical reports and Chapter 6, under indirect effects. DEIS Chapter 6 describes the indirect and cumulative effects to several resources including wildlife and vegetation, wetlands, and species of greatest conservation need. Additional information was added to the FEIS Chapter 6, Indirect and Cumulative Effects regarding to specifically address Palouse remnants and Species of Greatest Conservation Need. Elk, moose and deer The specified reference to the adaptability of non-native species and habitat generalists such as raccoon and deer, to human activities is documented in the technical reports including Ruediger 2007 and Melquist 2005. The references to Ruediger 2007 was added and the referenced statement regarding habitat generalists in Section 6.2.3. The statement “elk and moose are more specific to …human use patterns”, has been clarified to say that elk and moose are more sensitive to human use patterns than deer in the FEIS Section 6.2.3. Wildlife Collisions A wild animal crash is defined as a reported vehicular crash over $1,500 where a police officer reports a wild animal crash event in the police report. A wild animal crash may be caused by many different species of wild animals, including small animals that are not classified as big game as long as the police officer estimates the property damage to be greater than $1,500. Domestic animals are not included in this definition, since police have a separate category for domestic animal crashes. You have also indicated that there is a discrepancy in the number of wildlife collisions in the project area. This has been corrected in the FEIS Section 3.10. ITD agrees that wild animal crashes are important to consider and for this reason, ITD has contracted with Utah State University to assess methodology for prioritizing appropriate mitigation to reduce big game AVC. ITD appreciates information provided in the IDFG’s wildlife linkage database and has referenced the database in the Safety Analysis used for the DEIS and the revised Safety Analysis in the FEIS. ITD is more concerned with crash types that typically result in greater severity than crash types that generally result in low severity. The Federal Highways Administration (FHWA) has established societal costs for the different crash types that can be found in a publication called Idaho Traffic Crashes 2012 created by the ITD’s Office of Highway Safety. A fatality cost is estimated at $6,295,406 and a property damage only crash is estimated at $6,739. To place the severity of crash types and their costs in perspective, the economic cost of one fatality is equivalent to 934 crashes with property damage only using the costs estimated by the FHWA. Wild animal crash severity is typically very low compared to other accident types and therefore, wild animal crashes are not one of the eleven emphasis areas in Idaho’s Strategic Highway Safety Plan. In the past 10 years, 476 wild animal crashes have been reported along US-95 in District 2. Of the 476 wild animal crashes, no fatalities have been reported and only three severe Type A crashes have occurred. About 91 percent of the wild animal crashes have resulted in property damage only. Intersection crashes are an emphasis area in Idaho’s Strategic Highway Safety Plan because the severity of intersection related crashes tends to be high. In fact, Idaho’s Strategic Highway Safety Plan states that 17 percent of the fatalities in Idaho from 2004-2008 were intersection related. Head-on crashes are also a very serious crash type. In 2012, head on crashes were the leading event related to fatalities in multiple-vehicle crashes. 16.4 percent of all multiple-vehicle fatalities in 2012 listed a head-on crash as the leading most harmful event. ITD acknowledges wild animal crash potential may be greater for the E-2 Alternative than the other action alternatives based on findings in the wildlife reports; however, this would be offset due to the E-2 Alternative’s better sight distance through the ungulate impact area than the other action alternatives because of its straighter roadway geometry. In addition, ITD is using a roadside-clearing countermeasure that will remove trees and vegetation along the highway to eliminate places that wildlife can hide near the highway giving the motorists greater sight distance. The greater sight distance will give motorists more time to react to wild animals near the highway reducing the predicted crashes. The roadside clearing crash countermeasure has been observed to result in a 50 percent to 90 percent reduction in wild animal crashes as shown in the revised Safety Analysis (ITD, 2013). Although the proposed posted speed limit on all three action alternatives will be raised five miles per hour through the wildlife crossing area identified by the IDFG, all three action alternatives would have greater sight distance than the existing route and the E-2 Alternative would have the greatest sight distance of the three action alternatives which is expected to reduce AVC potential. Wild animal crashes on the existing US-95 loop, if an action alternative is constructed, are predicted to be substantially lower than existing conditions because the estimated average daily traffic (ADT) of the existing US-95 loop is expected to be very low. The ADT of US-95 in the project area is currently about 5,200. If an action alternative is constructed, the ADT of the US-95 loop is estimated to be 200 to 300 depending upon which action alternative is constructed. The very low ADT of the existing US-95 loop will greatly reduce the potential AVCs. Wild animal crashes are included in the crash predictions, but not quantified. Mitigations ITD recognizes that the E-2 Alternative would affect habitat that is more suitable for many wildlife species compared to the other alternatives and appreciates your suggested mitigation measures. The reference to the IDFG June 28 correspondence regarding the habitat ratios and mitigation has been further detailed in the FEIS Section 4.8 and Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments. The following responses to your additional suggested mitigations are provided below and are also contained in the FEIS Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments. • Passage Structures: ITD will not be able to retrofit the existing US-95 bridge/culverts to allow passage for small wildlife but will discuss the possibility of future retrofits during road improvements along existing US-95 with the NLCHD during the road transfer negotiations. ITD will not be able to provide details regarding the site selection, design elements and design details of passage structures in the FEIS because the specific details regarding topography, road elevations, grades and structure requirements are not known at this time. Locations and designs of passage structures will be determined before final design in coordination with IDFG. General information about culvert sizing, and suitable surfacing, and fencing to accommodate wildlife crossing at underpasses is provided in the FEIS Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments. • Short-Eared Owls: ITD will install reflective posts/delineators or install reflectors on other highway structures in key flying/forage areas identified by wildlife biologists. ITD will also conduct pre-construction surveys and avoid nesting sites during construction. • Bats: ITD will install day and night roosting facilities, Roosting installations will be relocated away from the highway to reduce collisions. New structures will be designed without sealed joints to discourage roosting. ITD will mitigate for wetland impacts and impacts to waters of the US which will result in a zero net loss of wetland functions and values. Miscellaneous comments: • Page 106.  The statement regarding IDFG moose and deer surveys has been corrected in the FEIS Section 3.8.3. • Page 153-154 (Tributary Effects). The discussion of the quality of riparian habitat is described in the DEIS Section 4.6.1 Tributary Effects and Section 4.6.2 Wetland Effects.

ITD recognizes the urgency to improve this stretch of US-95 to improve safety and capacity for the travelling public and the community. ITD and FHWA intend to fully comply with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process and meet regulatory requirements. Public involvement and agency coordination have been an important part of this process and has continued throughout the development of the FEIS. As a result of the public involvement, there has been additional analysis completed and we feel it addresses the public’s concerns and questions. 30 days after Notice of Availability for the FEIS is published in the Federal Register, a Record of Decision selecting an alternative will be issued.

General Response Schedule describes the next steps	  in the environmental process	  and the anticipated schedule. The action alternative must be analyzed under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The E-‐2	  Alternative was identified as FHWA and ITD’s 	  Preferred 	  Alternative 	  based 	  on 	  a 	  balance 	  of the human and natural environment	  and the safety benefits to	  the public as described	  in	  General Response Alternative. The E-‐2	  Alternative	  would not go over Paradise	  Ridge but would	  be located	  along its base. See General Responses Weeds and Wildlife. As described	  in	  the DEIS Section	  2.4.2, the rightof-‐way width is based on specific design elements that	  address the identified deficiencies in the roadway. These include two 12-‐ft	  lanes in each direction, a 34-‐ft	  median,	  shoulders 	  and 	  clear zones. These improvements	  would reduce the predicted	  crash	  rates by more than	  50 percent over the 20-‐year design period for any	  of the action alternatives. The	  E-‐2	  Alternative, FHWA’s and ITD’s Preferred Alternative	  would result in the greatest	  safety benefit. See General Response Safety-‐6. The C-‐3	  Alternative improves safety of the highway but not to	  the same extent as the E-‐2	  Alternative.  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  H-‐2  Marshall  Comstock  All 3 alternatives are much	  safer than	  the existing alignment. The	  overriding	  choice	  by I.T.D. should be which	  route is deemed	  the safest. Although	  the final	  choice 	  should 	  not 	  be 	  a 	  popularity 	  vote, 	  my opinion	  is that the eastern	  alignment is the best overall choice for a few reasons. 1. Safety 2. Shortest 3. Least expensive 4. Can be constructed with least disruption 5. Poorest soil 6. Does not displace businesses 7. Displaces few real property homes 8. Manufactured homes are temporary in nature and can be	  easily moved to another location. 9. Please move forward with this project as soon as possible.  FHWA and ITD must balance	  the	  alternatives’ impacts 	  to 	  both 	  the 	  human 	  and 	  natural	  environment while	  taking	  into account the	  public’s need	  for a safe and	  efficient transportation system. General Response Alternative describes why FHWA	  and	  ITD identified 	  the 	  E-‐2	  Alternative as the Preferred Alternative.	  	  The Safety Analysis was revised after the public hearing; however, the E-‐2	  Alternative would still have the greatest safety benefit. See General Responses Safety-‐3	  and Safety-‐6. General Response Displacement-‐1	  offers clarification of residential and business	  impacts.

His response to	  the few questions I asked him was basically ‘It’s not a	  big	  problem’ and answered in a	  manner of brushing	  it (the questions) to	  the side. It isn’t a good	  image for ITD.  FHWA and ITD made	  a	  good faith effort to offer public involvement opportunities and	  to	  answer all questions during	  the	  public hearing	  and regret that	  you felt	  your	  comment	  was brushed aside. The	  FEIS	  provides additional information, corrections, clarifications, and discusses	  mitigation, which we hope addresses any remaining questions.  H-‐4  Jim  Prall  My concern is safety of new routes.

Because that is 	  where 	  the 	  weather 	  changes 	  quickly.	  The 	  E-‐2	  route creates the same new longer	  hazard. As a lifelong 	  resident 	  of 	  the 	  Palouse, 	  I	  can’t 	  agree 	  with creating	  that new hazard that extends the	  Reisenauer Hill danger for miles of new deceptively straight road. It just doesn’t make sense. It 	  also 	  doesn’t 	  make 	  sense 	  to 	  me 	  economically 	  to maintain two routes, especially in the winter. We	  can’t afford that. Without the local use, the new way becomes “less traveled” than the combined routes and in the winter, that	  again makes a big difference.  and would be	  upgraded to American Association of State Highway and	  Transportation	  Officials (AASHTO)	  standards, which would greatly improve 	  safety.	  See DEIS and FEIS 2.4.2 for a description	  of the design	  elements for the	  action alternatives. General Responses Weather-‐3	  and Weather-‐4	  describe weather conditions including elevation, ice, 	  and 	  snow 	  and 	  how 	  they 	  differ 	  between alternatives.

The safety study seems	  flawed, because of the mild-‐weather time frame used. It 	  seems 	  clear 	  that 	  in 	  truth,	  the 	  E-‐2	  route directly over the ridge will be more dangerous than	  C3.

This is also the	  most expensive	  option, as it 	  creates 	  the 	  greatest 	  amount of new pavement, which, together with the old route, must be maintained in perpetuity.  The E-‐2	  Alternative would not go over Paradise Ridge but would	  be located	  along its base through primarily farm fields and CRP land.

See	  General Response	  Maintenance-‐1	  regarding general maintenance	  activities.  H-‐9  Judy  Sobeloff  Thank you for holding this hearing. I am in favor of improving 	  the 	  safety of Highway 95. I believe 	  that one basic safety measure would	  be to	  lower the speed limit by 5-‐10	  m.p.h. After reading about the weather/safety analysis completed by ITD, I believe that the data is incomplete or skewed, given that the	  study	  was only	  done	  for 5 months in an unseasonably mild winter. Common	  sense would	  dictate that a highway going over a ridge would	  be less safe during a typical winter. In 	  2002 	  I	  had 	  the 	  opportunity 	  to 	  visit 	  a 	  tiny remnant	  of	  remaining Palouse Prairie.	  I believe  See	  General Response	  Safety-‐4	  for information regarding lowering the speed limit.

See	  General Response	  Safety-‐2	  for an explanation of how wildlife collision	  data was considered	  in	  the safety analyses.  H-‐10  Greg  Mack  My understanding is that this may affect less than 7	  miles.

It would also save	  money by eliminating	  the	  lawsuits that are	  sure	  to tie	  this up for	  years.  See	  General Response	  Safety-‐4	  for information regarding speed limits. FHWA and ITD are	  committed to complying with the NEPA process, which is described in General Response NEPA.

This is more about	  getting	  from Boise	  to Bonners Ferry. Need to look	  at the	  big	  picture	  and what’s best for most of the	  state. I prefer E-‐2, the recommended alternative.  As stated	  in	  the DEIS, Chapter 1, the project purpose and	  need	  is to	  improve public safety and increase 	  capacity 	  for 	  this 	  section 	  of 	  US-‐95, which would benefit all users. However, improving this section of US-‐95	  would improve the safety and  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  capacity	  for regional traffic	  and freight transport as well  H-‐21  Jim  Knect  First of all I would like	  to say that the	  desire	  of a	  few does not	  or	  should not	  outweigh the safety of a	  far larger number of citizens. Yes there will be people impacted, 	  but 	  no 	  matter what route is chosen it will be an improvement of the existing situation. As a citizen	  who	  drives this route on	  a daily basis I can only	  ask	  that something is	  done soon—before someone else dies	  on this	  road. But I guess	  that a few animals and some	  Palouse	  Prairie remnants are	  more	  valuable	  than someones husband, wife, son or daughter.  FHWA and ITD must balance	  the	  alternatives’ impacts 	  to 	  both 	  the 	  human 	  and 	  natural	  environment while	  taking	  into account the	  public’s need	  for a safe and	  efficient transportation system.

The environment/weather study is a	  joke. 4	  mo. of a snowless 2004 or 2005 season. It is exceedingly windy, foggy and a dangerous route. 2. All Idaho state agencies giving impact statements	  select C-‐3	  as the preferred route. ITD ignores 	  their 	  report? 3. ITD states land use plans would be disrupted by W-‐4. All but C-‐3	  affects land use and land use plans. Why is there preferential treatment	  to ‘land use’ plans regarding W-‐4. 4. What “park” does W-‐4	  affect. There is no park only donated	  land	  to	  Moscow. Developers “hoped” tax payers would support	  $2-‐5	  million bridge and road so they had access to their	  land for	  development. Tax payers say ‘No.’  1. General Response Weather-‐2	  explains the validity	  of the referenced data set. See General Response Weather-‐5	  and Weather-‐6, for an explanation of the	  differences in fog	  and wind between	  alternatives. All of the action	  alternatives would	  result in	  a greater safety benefit over the No	  Action	  Alternative because the road	  would	  be upgraded	  to AASHTO standards. 2. General Response Agency explains why there were differences in opinion regarding FHWA’s and ITD’s Preferred Alternative. 3. As stated in the DEIS	  and FEIS	  Section 4.2, the City of Moscow states that all three action	  alternatives would be	  consistent with their land use plans. However, the Modified	  W-‐4	  alternative	  is located the	  furthest west and closer  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  to the University of	  Idaho, Pullman and near	  areas where	  future	  development was planned. The alternatives’ consistency with land use plans is 	  clarified 	  in 	  the 	  FEIS 	  Section 	  4.2.	  4. The park that Modified W-‐4	  would affect is a	  ball field	  proposed	  by the City	  of Moscow but which is unplatted. The bridge and road that you mention is not part of this project. Additional clarification of the effects	  to land use was	  added to the FEIS Section 4.2. The action alternatives would have Expressway Access control as described	  in	  General Response Access.  H-‐23  Jim  Lion  Based	  on	  the discussion	  with	  ITD representative, I conclude that the W-‐4, C-‐3	  and E-‐2	  alternative are similar in that the fatality rate difference between them is not	  significant. On the other	  hand, the difference among the alternatives on	  environmental impact is clearly distinguishable	  and significant. Clearly, alternative C2 has	  the least impact.	  Since 	  safety 	  and 	  environmental	  impact 	  are the two most	  important	  consideration to me. I prefer C-‐3	  over E-‐2.  The significance of the differences in safety between	  alternatives is addressed	  in	  General Response Safety-‐6. In 	  reaching 	  a 	  decision,	  FHWA 	  and 	  ITD 	  must balance the alternatives’ impacts to	  both	  the human	  and	  natural environment while taking	  into account the	  public’s need for a	  safe	  and efficient transportation system.

This would certainly reduce the accidents. Also	  enforcing speed	  limits would	  be needed. We see very little of this. Having lived with a clear view of Paradise Ridge,	  from our	  home on Cameron Rd., for	  35 years, I can say with surety, that the weather on the ridge is	  worse and would be a terrible place for the highway. This was clear by seeing the snow line and fog	  line, plus the	  added factor of frequent high winds up	  higher. I	  often 	  hike 	  at 	  Paradise 	  Ridge,	  and 	  I	  am 	  also 	  very aware	  of the	  lovely and unique	  plants there	  and the necessity of	  preserving that	  environment.  See	  General Response	  Safety-‐4	  regarding lowering 	  and 	  enforcing 	  speed 	  limits. The action alternatives would not go over Paradise	  Ridge,	  but 	  the 	  E-‐2	  Alternative would be located 	  along 	  its 	  base.	  	  See 	  General	  Responses Weather-‐3, Weather-‐4, Weather-‐5, and Weather6	  regarding elevation, snow, fog, and wind respectively. The action alternatives including the E-‐2	  Alternative would	  not directly impact native plants on	  Paradise Ridge but would	  be closer to	  Paradise	  Ridge	  resulting in indirect effects as described	  in	  General Response Weeds and	  Chapter 6.  H-‐26  Dennis D.

Colson  For 11	  years I have	  travelled regularly from Viola	  to Windy Ridge Kennel on	  Zietler Road	  in	  every season and all types	  of weather. It is	  always	  windy on	  Zietler Road	  and	  many times foggy there when	  there is no fog on the rest	  of	  the 36 mile round trip drive. Elevation	  is part of the equation	  but also	  within the Palouse	  there	  is a	  series of microclimates	  that have not been taken into account in the DEIS. The weather	  study was only 5 months Jan-‐May of 2005 in the year of the least amt[.] of snow in the past 15 years. This	  is	  unreasonable data for extrapolating to	  what road conditions in the winter	  on E-‐2	  would be like; fog and black ice are	  part of winter on the	  Palouse	  but are	  worse	  at the E-‐2	  elevation and location than they are at the C-‐3	  choice. The impact visually on tourism for “The Palouse” is most minimal with the C-‐3	  choice. Why put a	  new scar on the landscape when one had 2 choices. This is an additional reason to choose C-‐3. Can the county	  afford to maintain the old US 95—why not  General Responses Weather-‐3, Weather-‐5, Weather-‐6, and Weather-‐7	  explain how wind, fog, elevation, and microclimates were considered.

As stated	  in	  the DEIS and	  FEIS, the E-‐2	  Alternative would not directly impact Paradise Ridge but would have indirect effects due to	  weeds. See General Response Weeds and Wildlife regarding the indirect	  effects of	  weeds to Paradise Ridge and Palouse	  Prairie.  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  use it. The DEIS maps of impact of weeds clearly show that E-‐2	  will disturb the land so as to allow weeds to impact forever Paradise Ridge that	  no mitigation will ever turn around. The weed impact from choosing C-‐3	  will not so drastically affect Paradise	  Ridge	  another reason to choose	  C-‐3.  H-‐31  Emma  Schmidt  I	  support 	  the 	  central	  plan 	  (C-‐3) for Hwy 95. This would help preserve the Palouse Prairie from invasive 	  plant 	  species.	  This 	  seems 	  like 	  the 	  best option.

See	  Safety-‐5	  regarding improvements to Reisenauer Hill.	  The Do Nothing (No Action Alternative) would remain an unimproved two-‐lane 	  roadway 	  but could include small improvements	  like turn lanes	  at intersections and pavement maintenance. It would not construct four-‐lanes 	  over 	  Reisenauer Hill.	  Adding two more lanes to the existing alignment would not be	  a	  comprehensive	  solution to the existing roadway deficiencies	  as	  described	  in	  General Response Safety-‐4.  H-‐81  Tom  Jacksha  Hear to register support for the E-‐2 section between	  Thorncreek Road and Moscow. Safety is my highest priority. And because	  E-‐2	  eliminates Reisenauer Hill danger. As I personally had	  a very “close call”	  at the	  bottom of the	  hill. E-‐2	  being the straightest and shortest is a	  huge factor. Environmentally, it appears to have the least impact.

Of those presented, my	  preference is	  C3. I	  dislike 	  E-‐2	  for reasons of what I would call “beauty.”	  While	  those	  of more	  “Commercial”	  mindsets scoff, I’m	  sure, at such notions, I consider the natural beauty that remains on	  and	  around	  Paradise	  Ridge	  something not to be	  taken too lightly.	  There’s 	  getting 	  to 	  be 	  little 	  enough 	  land unimpacted	  by human	  usage, that it’s worth	  being cautious—something that too many in the West don’t consider, since we still have relatively large amounts of “wild” land. I’ve	  spent considerable	  time on Paradise Ridge, having lived on Jensen Rd for	  a time, and having worked near	  Paradise Ridge for	  more than the last	  decade. In terms of	  money, there’s no real measure for	  what would	  be lost by bringing a highway closer to	  the ridge. A	  few random points on back: − Reisenauer Hill seems	  to be the real focal point of safety,	  yet 	  all 	  options 	  seem 	  to 	  do 	  little 	  about 	  really addressing	  that. E-‐2	  does approach it on more of the same level, and this is good. But	  why is excavating	  out the	  hill not ever a	  stressed option?	   Additional information	  regarding visual effects has been	  added	  to	  the FEIS Section	  4.11. Project impacts 	  will	  be 	  minimized 	  by 	  implementing measures described in the FEIS Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments. The E-‐2	  Alternative would not go over Paradise Ridge but could	  have indirect effects to Paradise Ridge. Indirect and	  cumulative effects to Paradise	  Ridge	  and vegetation are	  discussed in General Responses Weeds and Wildlife. Regarding Reisenauer Hill,	  a 	  range 	  of 	  reasonable alternatives was evaluated which included 11	  initial	  alternatives 	  as 	  described 	  in 	  the 	  DEIS	  Section 2.5.1. General Response	  Safety-‐5	  describes how the different alternatives address safety deficiencies at Reisenauer Hill. General Response Safety-‐4	  addresses making smaller improvements	  to the existing US-‐95	  alignment. The DEIS and FEIS	  include	  information on induced growth in Section 6.1 Indirect Effects. Growth is expected to occur one	  mile	  south of Moscow; however the alternatives would	  have Expressway Access Control, which	  would	  reduce development potential and	  sprawl. See General Response  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  Why are there not more realignment issues around that	  hill? Every time I approach that	  hill on the highway from the N, it seems perfectly feasible to	  rework the road in such a way that	  would take it	  along	  the	  base	  of its slope	  to the	  W. What are	  the	  costs	  for reworking that? If all the available money	  was spent on reworking that, that would be a victory	  and vast improvement. For C-‐3, it seems highly feasible to move the bulk of its line a touch	  E. This would	  bring it in	  line w/ most of the property lines. It would require displacing the one farmhouse through	  which	  it would pass—this would be sad, for	  sure, but	  certainly	  doable. If these sorts of	  improvement	  are to be made, it’s only appropriate that	  it	  affect	  human	  beings. It’s human	  beings who	  agitate for such improvements	  in efficiency, and who benefit from it. I	  would 	  love 	  seeing 	  improvements 	  in 	  the 	  highway,	  and absolutely agree they need to happen, but	  not	  at the	  cost of creating	  more	  human sprawl. I’m confident there are plenty	  of ways	  this	  could be made to work better, even if it does negatively impact 	  a 	  few 	  residents.	  It 	  is 	  a 	  shame 	  to 	  impact 	  more 	  farmland;	  but given	  how much	  people have already suburbanized	  prime farmland, there’s hardly much	  argument against it.

General Response Alternative describes why FHWA	  and	  ITD identified 	  the 	  E-‐2	  Alternative as the Preferred Alternative. The following clarifications are provided which correspond to the numbers	  in your comment letter. 1. While the C-‐3	  Alternative required less new right-‐of-‐way and may have different community impacts, 	  the 	  E-‐2	  Alternative would offer the greatest safety	  benefit as described in General Responses Safety-‐3	  and Safety-‐6.

The one thing I	  will	  say 	  that 	  this 	  operation 	  is 	  long 	  overdue! I	  was 	  surprised 	  with 	  the 	  proposed 	  E-‐3	  preferred alternatives. It was	  not one that I would have thought	  of. My major	  concern for	  the E-‐3	  option is that	  of	  an agronomic nature. My fear	  is that	  there will be a large portion of this are that would be taken out	  of	  production. There is already too much prime agricultural	  land 	  removed 	  from 	  production.  See	  General Response	  Schedule	  regarding the	  next steps in	  the environmental process and the anticipated schedule.

General Response Alternative describes	  why FHWA and ITD identified 	  the 	  E-‐2	  Alternative as the Preferred  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  In 	  regards 	  to 	  safety concerns, E-‐3	  definitely does not have the least number of effects to	  safety concerns. I do understand about the C-‐3	  safety concerns	  but do not feel they	  are as	  great as	  described. My preferred alternative would be C-‐3. I say this for	  a number	  of	  reasons. The bulk of	  the proposed roadway has already been disturbed and developed. There are existing rights-‐of-‐ways that are	  already in place. Expansion to the	  roadway and area	  would be	  least minimally impacted. Out of all alternatives, this would be	  least argonomically invasive 	  and 	  have 	  the 	  least 	  impact.	  On a socio-‐economic side, homes have	  already been	  established	  along the roadway. Businesses have placed	  their operation	  along the existing Hwy 95	  and it would be costly for them to move. Additionally, existing infrastructure exists and	  would be easier to move those services. For those	  wanting protection to the	  Palouse	  Prairie,	  I	  believe 	  C-‐3	  would have the least impact. Due to	  drainage patterns of the area, wetlands will be impacted	  and	  off sets will have to	  occur. Again, I congratulate ITD on	  how they went thru	  the scoping process. Well done!!	   Alternative. In 	  your 	  comment 	  letter 	  you 	  stated 	  “E-‐3, the Preferred Alternative”. For clarification, the	  E-‐2	  is FHWA and ITD’s Preferred Alternative; therefore, in 	  our 	  response 	  we 	  assume your reference to E-‐3	  was intended to refer to E-‐2. While some farmland would be taken out of production, the facility would	  have Expressway Access Control, which	  would	  help	  limit development along the highway. See General Response Access. The E-‐2	  Alternative would also avoid the	  most highly productive	  farmland. The E-‐2	  Alternative would offer the greatest safety benefit as explained	  in	  General Response Safety-‐3	  and Safety-‐6. ITD has heard from landowners 	  that 	  would be affected	  by the project and the	  majority affected prefer the	  E-‐2	  Alternative considering the effects of all the various alternatives. See	  the	  FEIS	  Section 4.1	  regarding the	  direct socio-‐economic effects. General Response	  Displacement-‐1	  clarifies the residential and business impacts.

Mitigation measures, including mitigation for wetland impacts, are described in the FEIS  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments.  H-‐97  Greg  Freistadt  The weather study is bias and does not accurately represent	  the quickly changing and extreme precipitation/temperatures that occur on	  the west side of Paradise Ridge.	  There are strong winds that roll down	  the west side of the ridge. With	  them freezing rain and fog are frequent	  occurrences. I know this from spending	  every	  day	  at the base of the west	  side of	  the ridge, where we farm on Clyde land.	  Another 	  aspect 	  of 	  this 	  proposal	  that 	  is misleading and to be completely inaccurate, is the length 	  of 	  C-‐3	  vs. E-‐2. By looking at a	  map you can very	  easily	  see that C-‐3	  is shorter almost by half from E-‐2. This is not what is reported. Work on existing	  road, straighten and take	  out some	  hills.  See	  General Responses Weather-‐3, Weather-‐4	  and Weather-‐7	  for information regarding temperature, precipitation, and weather	  west	  of	  Paradise	  Ridge respectively.

Construction on the north side of	  Moscow Mtn	  on	  Hwy 95 southbound has	  a wide shoulder for a distance, but the rumble strip	  and	  concrete barriers neck down	  so	  there is no bicycle lane – for	  roughly ¼ mile. I want to avoid the second situation.  The design process will begin after the Record of	  Decision (ROD) has been issued. All action	  alternatives would	  increase safety and access for bicyclists and pedestrians.	  There would be an eight ft. wide shoulder that would function as a shared lane in	  the rural sections. The urban sections would have a	  six ft. wide shoulder with sidewalk, curb and gutter.

In	  spite of some who oppose the E-‐2	  route, I, and most people I talk	  to, consider E-‐2	  to be the best, safest, most logical choice. In my humble opinion, E-‐2	  would be straighter and have a more consistent elevation profile. This would lead to better safety and a	  consistent weather impact.  FHWA and ITD must balance	  the	  alternatives’ impacts 	  to 	  both 	  the 	  human 	  and 	  natural	  environment while	  taking	  into account the	  public’s need	  for a safe and	  efficient transportation system. General Response Alternative describes why FHWA	  and	  ITD identified 	  the 	  E-‐2	  Alternative as the Preferred Alternative.  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  There are many opposed	  to	  E-‐2, but their arguments seem founded only in hysteria	  and emotion. To say we	  have	  a	  “Great Palouse	  Earthworm”, which has never been seen, that needs protection, is absurd. They continue to	  beat the “weather/fog” drum – without understanding and taking	  a serious look	  at what research your people did	  on	  this issue. C-‐3	  would have the most dangerous weather impact issues for numerous reasons. It	  would still be a windy, partially shaded icy 	  areas, 	  with 	  several	  elevation 	  changes.	  I’m 	  also 	  not 	  buying 	  into the animal/ungulate travel equation that the	  opposition wants to bring	  up. Any of these animals will still travel from point A	  to	  B—they will have to cross a road somewhere. That	  is 	  part 	  of 	  driving 	  in 	  the 	  northwest.	  You 	  are 	  safer with a route like E-‐2	  where your field of vision would be much greater, giving you an opportunity to avoid animal encounters. Not	  so on a narrow route with limited peripheral vision like C-‐3. I	  am 	  disappointed 	  that 	  these 	  people 	  in 	  opposition to E-‐2, have cost us	  so many lives, money, and time. We could have a nice safe route clear	  to Worley by now, saving many lives, injuries and property loss. I do	  realize they have a right to	  be heard. Well, they have been	  heard, they are in	  the minority and now, they need to sit down and be quiet. They are depriving we, the majority, our right	  to a safe road. Keep up the	  good work.

Allegri Jr.  H-‐102  Steven  Basoa  I	  am 	  writing 	  in 	  support 	  of 	  the 	  W4 	  alignment. 	  I	  believe the W4 alignment is far superior to	  the other proposed	  routes. The two	  negative aspects of W4 are that it is a slightly longer route and impacts 	  more 	  prime 	  farmland.	  Despite these two negatives, this route is still a wiser choice than	  the other alignments. C-‐3	  is bad primarily because it would displace too many homes and businesses (but	  at	  least	  the engineering disaster that is Resienauer Hill would	  be fixed). E2 is another story altogether. It is the	  absolute	  worst choice	  because	  of it’s altitude and	  exposure to	  the weather, as well as the proposed 5%	  grade which is totally absurd and unnecessary. Although	  this route would be straighter, it would be more dangerous. The straighter the road, the faster the driving, no matter what speed limits are posted. Even though the weather	  would be similar	  on all three proposed	  routes, the weather impact on	  E-‐2	  would	  be greatly enhanced. There would	  be fog, ice and	  drifting snow on	  such	  an	  open	  and	  exposed	  roadway. The impact	  from the high winds would be more intense since there would	  be nothing to	  slow them down. I certainly wouldn’t want to be driving a semi-‐truck up	  there during the winter. The weather survey that was done for this stretch of the project is rather disingenuous. Yes, it suits your (ITD) needs, but it is an incomplete study	  and very	  flawed. You have had eight to ten years to truly study the impact	  of	  weather, yet	  your	  study  FHWA and ITD must balance	  both the	  human and natural environmental impacts with the safety benefit for the general public. General Response Alternative describes why FHWA	  and	  ITD identified 	  the 	  E-‐2	  Alternative as the Preferred Alternative. For clarification the	  Modified W-‐4	  Alternative would impact more prime farmland than C-‐3	  but slightly less	  than E-‐2; however, it would impact more actively farmed and highly productive farmland as stated in the DEIS Section 4.3. All alternatives would	  upgrade the road	  to	  less than a five percent	  grade to meet	  AASHTO standards	  near Reisenauer Hill as explained in General Response Safety-‐5. General Response Displacement-‐1	  offers clarification of residential and business	  impacts. General Response Weather-‐3	  describes the relationship between elevation, temperature	  and ice 	  for 	  the 	  action 	  alternatives.	  General Response Safety-‐4	  provides an explanation of the	  effectiveness of reduced speed limits 	  and 	  driver 	  behavior.	  	  General Response Weather-‐4, Weather-‐5, Weather-‐6	  describes the differences in	  snow accumulation/snowdrifts, fog, wind, between alternatives. General Response Weather-‐2	  and Weather-‐8	  explains the	  validity of the	  referenced data	  set and the	  Weather Analysis.  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  only entails a five month	  period	  of one mild	  winter. The fact that the month of December was not included	  in	  these five months points out how seriously asinine the study is. The month of December is quite often the wildest month, weatherwise, on the Palouse. If you were truly serious	  about safety then you would have done a better job	  with	  this part of the research. You	  should really be ashamed of yourselves	  for passing off this study as a valid	  piece of work. Then we	  have	  the	  ungulate problem. The moose population	  on	  Paradise Ridge is 	  growing.	  They should not be much of an issue on the proposed lower 	  routes, 	  but 	  they 	  will	  be 	  an 	  issue 	  on 	  E-‐2, especially when the	  highway	  cuts them off from their	  watering holes. Have you ever	  seen the impact 	  of 	  a 	  moose 	  and 	  a 	  vehicle 	  going 	  55 	  miles 	  an house or faster? It is not a pretty sight, and	  it is usually a fatal one, both	  for the moose and	  the occupants of the vehicles involved. I	  hope 	  you 	  find 	  it 	  in 	  your 	  collective 	  hearts 	  to 	  do 	  the right	  thing and keep the new highway off	  Paradise Ridge.	  We, the residents of Latah County, will	  be the ones who drive the highway the most, we will be the ones most impacted	  by	  your decision. We do	  not want to	  live with	  your mistakes. Please do	  not make this one of them. Thank you. P.S. Included, please	  find three	  photos, taken from the Internet.  If 	  the 	  E-‐2	  Alternative is selected, impacted water sources	  would be replaced on the	  east side	  of US95	  as practicable. Most wildlife collisions result in less 	  severe 	  crashes 	  compared 	  to 	  other 	  crash types. See General Response Safety-‐2	  regarding how wildlife collisions were considered	  in	  the Safety Analysis. General Response Weeds and	  Wildlife discuss the alternatives’ indirect effects to vegetation and wildlife on Paradise Ridge.	  None of the action alternatives would be	  located on Paradise	  Ridge, but the E-‐2	  Alternative would be located along its	  base.  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response   #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response   H-‐103  Gerald and Judy  Reisenauer  It’s 	  time 	  to 	  “Git 	  ‘er 	  done”!

If 	  there 	  is 	  dissent,	  let’s 	  mitigate 	  and 	  purchase additional land that would benefit the	  Palouse	  Prairie on	  Paradise Ridge.	  Why not provide signage to educate people or	  even provide a pull out	  with a kiosk	  or interpretive display	  or plant demonstration	  area?? Let’s make it	  a win/win for	  all parties concerned. How about narrowing	  the	  right-‐of-‐way for	  less of an	  impact on	  the ridge?? How about providing a vegetative buffer to minimize noise and visual impact to residents of	  Paradise	  Ridge??	  If there	  are	  concerns about wildlife crossings then provide a point where wildlife can move safely. 12	  years is long enough ITD needs to move forward with this project and compensate those individuals who will be affected by the impact of its construction. People need to get on with their lives	  and not have	  to worry whether they are	  going	  to be displaced. We need	  a safe highway to	  stop	  or curtail the accidents	  that seem to be happening with greater frequency. E-‐2	  by limiting access and	  intersections, 	  will	  provide 	  that 	  safety and a	  more	  pleasurable easier commute. As a resident of Moscow, I whole heartedly support ITD in their choice of E-‐2	  as the preferred route of Hwy 95	  from Moscow to Thorncreek Rd. Sincerely, (signature)  H-‐109  No Name  −  Mr. Brian Ness, Director ITD: If 	  you 	  don’t 	  want 	  to 	  be 	  politically 	  raked 	  over 	  the coals	  (and maybe even prosecuted	  as well), you	   FHWA and ITD are	  committed to implementing the NEPA process and evaluating the impacts of	  a range of	  reasonable alternatives. We	  understand  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  might want to examine the sins of your predecessors, as well as the continuing fraud	  and	  deception	  at ITD and	  in	  the greater GOP community. This whole scene will get the attention of investigative 	  journalists 	  and 	  then 	  eventually prosecutors. How will you look? This	  all started well before your watch. You don’t need to go down	  with	  it. Talk to the Governor and the A.G. about this.  that	  during this process, not	  everyone will be satisfied by the decisions; however, FHWA and ITD 	  must 	  balance 	  the 	  human 	  and 	  natural	  effects with the public’s need for a safe and efficient transportation system. General Response Alternative explains why FHWA	  and	  ITD identified	  the E-‐2	  Alternative as the Preferred Alternative.  H-‐110  LeNelle  McInturff  I	  have 	  driven 	  U.S. 	  95 	  from 	  Eid 	  Road 	  to 	  Moscow 	  five days a week for over 30 years. My overriding concern with the current highway	  is safety.	  I strongly support moving U.S. 95 to the E2 alignment. It eliminates the	  dangerous curves of the current	  route. It	  provides a more consistent	  elevation which will result in more	  consistent road conditions: no more treacherous	  changes	  from wet pavement in	  the low area to	  ice on	  the curves and	  hilltops. E-‐2	  also requires fewer access points which will result in less congestion. As to	  weather concerns, in	  my experience the fog often	  seen	  hanging over Paradise Ridge is 	  actually further	  up the ridge than the proposed E-‐2	  route. Recently I was headed	  south	  out of Moscow and	  sure I would be in heavy fog as	  soon as	  I topped the hill at	  Johnson’s Trucking. The fog was actually far	  from the highway and even above the E-‐2 alignment and Reisenauer Hill.	  Look south from Moscow, the view of fog on the Ridge can be very deceiving. Strong cross winds on	  the proposed	  E2 route have been listed as a concern by some. I  General Response Alternative explains why FHWA and ITD identified the	  E-‐2	  Alternative as the Preferred Alternative. The E-‐2	  Alternative would offer the greatest safety benefit as explained	  in	  General Responses Safety-‐3, Safety-‐6	  and the Revised Safety Analysis. Elevation, fog, wind, and other weather conditions	  in the study	  area and on Paradise Ridge are	  addressed in General Response	  Weather-‐3, Weather-‐4, Weather-‐5	  and Weather6. All displaced	  businesses and residents will be	  compensated and relocated according to the Uniform Relocation Act. Residential and business impacts are clarified	  in	  General Response Displacement-‐1. See FEIS	  Appendix 5	  for a	  summary of the Uniform Relocation Act. The project will not be constructed over on any Palouse	  Prairie remnants but	  may have indirect	  effects due to	  weed	  dispersal as described	  in	  General Response Weeds.  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  wouldn’t expect winds on the new	  route to be any worse than the strong cross winds I have experienced coming	  in and out of the	  cuts on the	  current route, and the new wider highway	  will provide for a larger margin	  of error/drift in	  windy conditions. I	  trust 	  that 	  homeowners 	  in 	  the 	  direct 	  path 	  of E-‐2	  will be fairly compensated for the loss of their homes. I also	  trust that reasonable efforts will be made to limit damage to the small amount of Palouse	  prairie	  impacted. Wildlife	  will be	  trying to cross	  the highway	  no matter which route is	  taken. I have	  thankfully avoided collisions with deer at several locations	  on the current route but have seen the evidence of less	  fortunate animals	  and drivers all along the way. Since I live on	  Eid	  Road, I won’t have direct access to the E2 alignment, but I would expect that the current stretch of US 95 will be suitably maintained	  for those of us who	  will still need	  to	  use it. When road conditions and visibility are poor, driving is easier and	  safer on	  a straight level stretch	  of road	  than	  on	  a stretch	  with	  hills, curves, and	  many side roads. I hope the E2 alignment can be approved and construction can begin without further	  delay.  See	  General Response	  Wildlife	  and Safety-‐2	  regarding wildlife movement	  and wildlife collisions. See	  General Response	  Maintenance-‐1	  regarding the maintenance of	  the existing US-‐95	  segments.

It is the only route	  that elimanates the	  steep down hill north	  side of Reisenauer Hill.	  As stated “safety first”. It	  would also be the straightest	  and shortest.

Also	  crossing’s for	  wildlife could help. I	  have 	  great 	  faith 	  in 	  all	  of 	  the 	  research 	  done,	  that I.T.D. 	  will	  choose 	  E-‐2	  as the road of the future. See	  General Response	  Safety-‐5	  regarding Reisenauer Hill.  H-‐112  Leonard T.  Hetsler	  (“Len”)  Kudos to ITD personnel for their years of time	  and effort in design, public relations and physical presence in	  Moscow. The three alternatives appear well designed and creatively presented; all would be defensible. After reading community comments and spending	  time	  “on the	  ground” in the C-‐3	  and E-‐2	  areas, my support goes to the E-‐2	  alternative	  for the	  reasons stated by ITD. I	  would 	  hope 	  that 	  selection 	  of 	  E-‐2	  would free up the existing Highway 95 roadway for	  safer	  travel by locals 	  who 	  may 	  also 	  opt to upgrade their	  properties and	  build	  a quieter rural community after years of traffic noise and disruptions. Because	  Paradise	  Ridge is 	  a 	  substantial	  community 	  of 	  more than fifty homes, some residents of	  which will face	  disruption	  with	  E-‐2’s selection, perhaps ITD will find the means and methods to mitigate the noise near homesites. Techniques such	  as tree and	  shrub	  plantings and	  the prohibition	  of “jake brakes” come to mind. If appropriate, underpasses	  could make crossings 	  safer 	  for 	  animals.	  As one who	  has lived	  not far from Highway 95 north	  of Moscow for more than	  three decades, I know that road noise can be intrusive, and even the sound of	  the wind through the trees can make life 	  more 	  pleasant.	   General Response Alternative explains why FHWA and ITD identified the	  E-‐2	  Alternative as the Preferred Alternative. ITD 	  revised 	  the 	  Safety 	  Analysis 	  to 	  include 	  the predicted	  safety on	  the existing US-‐95	  segments should an action alternative be selected. See General Responses Safety-‐3	  and Safety-‐6. Maintenance of existing US-‐95	  is discussed in General Response Maintenance-‐1	  and Maintenance-‐2. Due to less traffic on the existing US-‐95, the traffic noise levels 	  will	  also 	  be 	  lower.	  	  The 	  E-‐2	  Alternative would	  bring traffic closer to	  homes on	  Paradise	  Ridge but there would	  be less braking due to	  the more level grade reducing the	  need for jake 	  brakes.	  ITD 	  will	  be 	  working 	  with 	  landowners during the design	  process and	  will minimize vegetation removal where practicable. The function of	  vegetation for	  noise reduction is minimal compared to walls or berms; however, they may offer	  a visual shielding effect. See	  General Response	  Wildlife	  and Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments for a	  description of wildlife mitigation. General Response Schedule describes the next steps	  in the environmental process	  and the  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  I	  am 	  looking forward	  to	  a safer highway and	  an	  “awesome”	  entry	  into Moscow from the	  south.  anticipated schedule.  H-‐113  Robert W.  Haun D.C.  Could	  we please have a straight road	  into	  Moscow I	  believe 	  E-‐2	  was that route. It makes the most efficient pathway Least cost to build, straight, less energy to drive, looks to be the safest	  route. How could 	  you 	  go 	  wrong.  General Response Alternative explains why FHWA and ITD identified the	  E-‐2	  Alternative as the Preferred Alternative. General Response Safety-‐3	  and Safety-‐6	  provide updated	  information	  from the Revised	  Safety Analysis and	  results from the Mobility and	  Road	  User Cost Study. The E-‐2	  Alternative would still offer the greatest safety benefit and	  would	  be the shortest alternative.  H-‐114  Nora  Locken  I	  would 	  suggest 	  that 	  ITD 	  reconsider 	  the 	  benefits 	  of C-‐3. There are a	  number of positive elements that	  should be given significant weight: 1) less	  right-‐ofway would need to be acquired; 2) fewer wildlife and native	  plant areas would be	  impacted; 3) the	  mid-‐level	  (as 	  compared 	  to 	  E-‐2	  or W-‐4) elevation would be beneficial since	  it would not be	  the	  coolest location (W-‐4) and also would lie below the fog line (E-‐2); 4) It is only .1	  miles longer than E-‐2, so nearly the same distance; 5) safety would be improved 	  greatly 	  by 	  eliminating 	  the 	  risk 	  of 	  head 	  on traffic collisions by making this improvement	  to the current	  roadway and dividing traffic lanes. The weather study included in the draft EIS	  was greatly	  lacking	  any	  information that pertained to C3. Weather points to the east and west were examined, but nothing 	  in 	  the 	  center, 	  only 	  the 	  RH point which	  is included	  in	  W-‐4, C-‐3	  and E-‐2. Also the high fog months of	  Oct., Nov. and Dec. were not included	  in	  the study.

Safety: Any studies extrapolating data points below the ridge are unreliable. The wind	  gusts are dangerous both	  from the East and	  West. I have measured gusts in excess of 80 mph yearly. My roof	  was affected and needed repair	  3 times due to these gusts. I know of	  no scientist	  that	  is	  reputable that	  would only sample one year.

As a newer resident to	  Moscow, this is my first opportunity to	  comment on	  this project. No doubt, many of the accidents are due to drivers traveling too fast	  for	  the	  road conditions (winter), inattentiveness, 	  or 	  both. I	  encourage 	  ITD 	  to 	  address 	  the 	  safety concerns	  FIRST by implementing safety measures that do	  not require re-‐routing the highway. These could include more signs, perhaps flashing lights, rumble strips, etc. I am sure	  that warning	  folks to slow down for conditions	  and for the more steep, curvy	  section would help and be more cost effective than rerouting the highway. Due to the higher elevation and winter weather concerns, please do not adopt	  the proposed route to the East. Moving the road to a higher	  elevation will increase 	  the 	  risks 	  due 	  to 	  frost 	  and 	  ice 	  on 	  the 	  road.

Thank you for your consideration. Amy Conway, resident, Moscow ID  E-‐3  Ashleigh  Bright  Dear Idaho Transportation Dept., Enough of the buffoonery. I thought you all were joking 	  when 	  you 	  tried 	  to 	  send 	  mega 	  loads 	  up 	  past Jerry Johnson hot	  springs. That	  road is sinuous enough to make	  a	  Subaru feel like	  a	  sports car. Those poor truck drivers were probably 	  terrified. This new idea	  of destroying final remnants of Palouse	  habitat with the	  proposed Highway 95	  E2	  is all the	  more	  senseless. Have	  you *been*	  to Idaho?	  Have you *seen* the difference between a flat stretch in the winter, and trying to drive up or down	  a	  mountain in the	  winter?	  You stay *away*	  from hills, mountains, and	  inclines in	  general when	  the snow flies. There's a	  reason all the hills have names up here Steakhouse, Risenhauer, Crooks -‐and it's because	  of the local epic legends of	  winter	  travel. Making	  it over Saddle Ridge when	  there is more than	  4 inches of snow is a remarkable achievement. Paradise Ridge is 	  no 	  different.	  Why 	  the 	  hell	  would 	  you 	  want to route the highway over	  it? Tree huggers and truckers alike think the	  E2 option for	  Highway 95 is completely idiotic. Come to Moscow sometime in the next month-‐I'll	  treat 	  you to dinner	  at	  Nectar, and drive you around Paradise ridge to show you why you might	  want	  to reconsider	  this silly, silly plan. All the best, Ashleigh Bright  Truck traffic along US-‐12	  is outside of the project's logical	  termini and is not considered as part of this project. See	  General Response	  Weather-‐3, Weather-‐4	  and Weather-‐6	  regarding elevation, snow and weatherrelated safety along	  the	  E-‐2	  Alternative.

My wife and I have both experienced accidents on this stretch, one serious, that would	  have no	  doubt been	  avoided or lessened considerably had the	  highway been	  a four-‐lane 	  divided. Having lived in this area for 25 year, I've always wondered why Idaho is the only state of the union that	  does not	  have a four-‐lane 	  divided	  North/South	  route. This fact	  is especially damming considering that	  Idaho is a vertical state!	  I've also wondered what the benefit of such a highway would be to the Rt 12/Lochsa River corridor. A	  divided	  four lane N/S route in Idaho would give truckers a more economical and convenient route	  to C'DLane	  and US	  90, and to Missoula. Truck traffic along the Lochsa	  River, a potentially dangerous route, should	  be lessened. Above all, safety first	  to all who travel US 95 should be the main	  consideration. Let me	  know if I can do anything	  else	  to support your proposal. Bill Perconti  The proposed solution to improve public safety and increase 	  capacity 	  on 	  this 	  section 	  of 	  US-‐95	  is to continue the four-‐lane 	  divided 	  highway 	  through 	  this 	  section, which will better serve local and regional travel in and through Idaho.  E-‐5  Dale  Newberry  I	  would 	  like 	  to 	  write 	  in 	  support 	  of 	  the 	  preferred 	  E2 alternative	  of the	  Thorncreek/Moscow US95	  realignment.

Everything is saying that only five of the mobile homes will	  be 	  affected.	  There 	  are 	  six 	  units 	  so which one will not be affected? In the noise impact survey, it listed 1071 Eid Road #2, #5, #7, #8 and #9 but not #3 (which	  is my home). So, if I'm reading this correctly, only	  one home will be left in the 1071 section of Benson's	  Park? It also doesn't mention the original Benson	  house that's directly across from the homes at 1071 Eid	  Road. And, it appears that most of the information	  about the residents was gathered before I purchased my home so	  at some point, will we need	  to	  clear that  See	  General Response	  Displacement-‐1	  and Displacement-‐2	  for clarifications of residential and business impacts and	  the Uniform Relocation	  Act. The five mobile homes that	  you	  noted	  would	  be impacted. Your home (1071 Eid Road #3)	  and the original Benson house would	  be potentially impacted meaning the E-‐2	  Alternative’s cut and	  fill lines do	  not intersect your property but would	  be close.

So, there	  are	  six receptors in Benson's Mobile	  Home	  Park (1071	  Eid Road #2, #3, #5, #7, #8, and #9) 1084	  Eid Road is the original Benson house (stick house). I	  believe 	  that 	  1971 	  Eid 	  Road 	  is 	  a 	  typo 	  and 	  should 	  be listed 	  as 	  1071 	  Eid 	  Road 	  #3 	  because 	  there 	  is 	  no 	  1971 Eid Road that I know of. Even if there was, it would	  be much	  further west than	  Benson	  Mobile Home Park. Additionally, in	  the noise impact 	  section, 	  it 	  says 	  that both	  receptors #7 and	  #13 will be affected	  but at this time, there's no plan to "wall off" the noise. From looking at the	  rendering of	  the bridge over	  Eid Road, every time that I go	  out my front door, I'll be looking 	  up 	  this 	  gigantic 	  hill	  with 	  an 	  overpass 	  and bridge at the top	  of it. If there's no	  plan	  to	  deal with	  the noise, why leave us? − I	  used 	  to 	  live 	  north 	  of 	  Viola,	  Idaho 	  (about 	  500	  feet from the center	  line)	  of	  Highway 95. I will have to say that living next to Highway 95 was	  horrible. Every time a	  trucker came by, he'd set off his "Jake brakes" and	  it would	  shake the house. This happened	  every night and	  woke me up	  every time. After	  a year	  of	  that, I had to move. So, I can't	  imagine 	  the 	  noise from this version of	  the highway would be any better, especially since I'm listed as one of the residents within	  300 feet of the center line. The problem this time?	  I own my property and may  describes why FHWA	  and	  ITD identified	  the E-‐2	  Alternative as the Preferred	  Alternative.  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  not be able to	  sell it because who	  wants to	  look out and see	  a	  highway in their front yard?	  My neighbors at 1084	  Eid Road feel the	  same. Being	  so close	  to this new highway will completely devalue our	  properties to	  the point we may never be able to sell them. I	  totally 	  understand 	  that 	  this 	  road 	  is 	  necessary 	  and that	  the E-‐2	  is the best route. However, I'm not happy with	  the Idaho	  Transportation	  Department's decision	  to	  leave my home untouched. If you're going	  to move	  everyone	  out of our neighborhood, take me, too. I don't	  have any desire to live next	  to Highway 95 ever again. There is a	  lot of other misinformation about the residents in the E-‐2	  route. It appears that much of it was gathered before I moved to my home in 2009. I'm 	  NOT 	  one 	  of 	  the 	  owners who can easily find other housing, as I'd	  planned	  to	  stay here for a very long time. The people who sold me my home failed to let	  me know that a highway might go through. You can imagine 	  the 	  shock 	  I	  felt 	  when 	  reading 	  the 	  article 	  in the paper	  last	  July announcing	  the	  project had been awarded funds to move	  forward. There's NO mobile home park in Moscow that could provide what I currently have, both	  financially as well as the ability to run a business out of my home. I've 	  been 	  looking 	  since 	  July 	  for 	  alternatives and so far, what's available in other	  mobile home parks,	  would be a HUGE step back AND cost me at least $200	  per month more than I currently pay. Plus, my current income level	  (as 	  an 	  instructor 	  at 	  a 	  university) would make	  it tough to have	  an additional $200 per  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  month payment. I	  chose 	  Benson's 	  Mobile 	  Home 	  Park 	  for 	  a 	  reason... 	  I	  love 	  the 	  country 	  setting, 	  the 	  large 	  yard, 	  the 	  low 	  lot rent, that	  I can store my camper	  trailer	  at	  no extra fee, can run a business out	  of	  my home, my neighbors, and	  the ability to	  do	  as I wish	  to	  my property. I would	  lose all of that if I were to	  move to	  another mobile	  home	  park. (Trust me... I called them all) If I stay, I get to hear "Jake	  brakes" all night again and look at an ugly hill that leads up	  to	  a highway. So, I was NOT	  one	  of the	  residents of Benson's Mobile Home Park that said it wouldn't be a problem to	  have the highway go	  through	  our property. But, they were slated	  to	  be moved	  and	  I wasn't so maybe no one thought to ask me. Why not? I	  will	  look 	  forward 	  to 	  hearing 	  how 	  the 	  Idaho Transportation Department plans to deal with the effects of noise to those remaining 9 residences within 300 feet of the center line for the E-‐2	  route. It doesn't appear that a plan	  has been	  developed yet (according to the DEIS)	  document. Thank you for taking time to consider my comments. I	  know 	  that 	  you 	  must 	  get 	  hundreds 	  of 	  e-‐mails, many of them not so	  pleasant. Please understand	  that I believe this is necessary and	  that E-‐2	  is the best route. But, please	  understand that I simply cannot live 	  that 	  close 	  to 	  a 	  highway 	  again. As a little side note... That group	  called	  the "Paradise Ridge Coalition...." see if you	  can	  find	  out how many of them live (or have at one point) on	  or near Paradise Ridge. They don't	  want	  the road for	  selfish  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  reasons while people continue to die on the highway.

The route would not go "over" Paradise	  ridge, it would be	  at the	  base, thus the	  weather is not any more adverse than any	  other route. The so called endangered species could be affected on any of the	  routes as the	  birds and bats fly over	  a large area. As far	  as the Palouse giant	  earthworm, there	  isn't any definite	  proof they actually exist. People	  who oppose	  the	  E2	  route	  do not live in	  the impacted	  area and	  many do	  not live in	  this area at	  all, so they do not	  have to drive this dangerous 6 miles on	  a daily basis like many of us do. As two	  people that drive this stretch	  of roadway and have	  come	  upon several accidents and a	  fatal one, have lasting effects on	  us. Your safest route (E2)	  is a must	  for	  the good of	  anyone on the highway, not to	  mention	  our family and	  friends who	  drive this highway on	  a daily basis. Also, the land	  the E2 opposition	  is referring to	  is "private"	  owned land 	  so 	  if 	  the 	  landowners 	  want 	  to plow it under or sell it to	  ITD, those folks should	  not be able to	  dictate what they can	  or can't do	  with	  it.I am attaching	  a	  quote	  as one	  of the	  landowners along	  the	  corridor which clears states the	  opinion of the majority of	  the landowners: E2	  is the Least Disruptive Alternative. Nearly all the land 	  in 	  the 	  corridor 	  is 	  private 	  property.	  The 	  owners of more than	  80% of the land	  directly impacted	  by the three alternatives have notified the ITD that	  they  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  prefer alternative E2. E2	  is less disruptive of local businesses;	  minimizes 	  residential	  and 	  business relocation,	  and 	  the 	  number 	  of 	  remaining 	  homes 	  and businesses that must access the highway directly; results in the least	  fragmentation of farming operations; best preserves, protects and	  services the current agricultural practices	  in the area; and is	  the least 	  likely 	  to 	  encourage 	  suburban 	  encroachment into 	  some 	  of 	  the 	  best 	  farmland in 	  the 	  northwest.	  The vast majority of farmers impacted by all three routes agrees that	  E2 is the best	  alternative and least 	  interferes 	  with 	  their 	  operations.	  These residents and property owners overwhelmingly support Alternative E2 because it directly affects their everyday home life. In	  contrast, most of those that oppose the E2 alternative largely live 	  outside 	  the 	  Study 	  Area, 	  do 	  not 	  own 	  property directly affected	  by the alternative routes, and	  are concerned about indirect effects on	  Paradise Ridge,	  much of which is on the periphery or outside the Study area. E2	  is clearly the Safest Alternative. It is the straightest, flattest, shortest, least expensive route; with the fewest accesses, and least poor weather conditions. E2 is	  the only	  alternative that	  eliminates Reisenauer Hill,	  minimizes 	  curves,	  has 	  the 	  minimum number of accesses and	  is most favorable for conversion to “no access” status	  for the next generation of highways. As far as the view goes, anywhere the highway would 	  be 	  built 	  could/would 	  affect 	  someone's 	  view.	  This should not take precedence over the safety of  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  public travel now or in	  the future. As stated	  in	  your plan	  there are many ways in	  which	  to	  build	  the new highway to	  minimize the sight of the highway 	  by plantings etc... I	  am 	  very 	  much 	  hoping 	  the 	  people 	  opposing 	  the construction will not be allowed to block	  the ITD, FHWA from preceding with the	  construction of this desperately needed	  new safe highway. By ITD having to defend their	  decisions over and over, it is draining	  the highway construction funds and is concerning to us that want it to	  be constructed, not to	  mention	  along	  with the	  delays, there	  will be	  more	  accidents which affect the lives of many people who use this highway daily.

My opinion on this next portion is to create a highway that has the most functional efficiency in	  getting	  traffic past Moscow north/south and from/to Pullman to north, east, south of	  Moscow. Keep the hundreds of autos commuting to	  work from Idaho	  to	  Pullman out of downtown Moscow and off the	  rural gravel roads.  The option that you mentioned appears to be similar to the Ring Road concept	  that	  is	  being proposed by the City of Moscow.

I	  have 	  literally 	  spent 	  thousands 	  of 	  hours 	  (over 	  many years) walking	  and helping	  to farm the land in and around that associated with both the	  E2	  and the	  C3	  options and	  for the life of me, I can't see how E2 is the better	  course. *	  The elevation	  change alone between	  these two	  options is a very serious difference in	  the winter  See	  General Response	  Weather-‐3, Weather-‐4	  and Weather-‐6	  regarding elevation, snow accumulation and other weather related	  road	  conditions. The pine stands that your referenced do provide whitetail deer habitat and	  would	  be affected; however there is other	  available habitat	  in the area as described in 	  the 	  DEIS 	  and 	  FEIS 	  3.8 	  and 	  4.8.	  See 	  General	  Response Wildlife and Safety-‐2	  regarding the effects to wildlife and how wildlife	  collisions were	  considered 	  in 	  the Safety Analyses.  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  months. During a storm, the C3 option might get three inches of	  snow and yet	  the land associated with E2 will more than likely (although just hundreds of feet higher in	  elevation) receive	  a	  foot of snow and with strong	  winds. This fact is known throughout	  the Palouse and is no different	  than what we see in Moscow. As Moscow	  sits at a slightly lower 	  elevation 	  than 	  the 	  ridge 	  and 	  the 	  difference 	  in snow accumulation is	  the difference	  between being	  able	  to drive	  your vehicle	  on the	  roads and having	  to plow the road	  first at that slightly higher elevation. That difference in height/elevation between C3	  and E2	  is substantial enough with everything else perhaps being equal, that the C3 option	  would	  be much more safe and should prevail. *	  The C3	  option will have much less of an adverse impact 	  on 	  the 	  wildlife.	  The 	  Ridge 	  is 	  a 	  very 	  special	  ecosystem and the	  Whitetail deer population	  alone venture out into the edges of the pine 	  trees 	  that 	  the E2	  option would invade. And just the presence of the highway that	  close to the edge of	  the deer	  habitat will reduce substantially the deer habitat associated with the	  Ridge. We	  don't have	  that many pine trees on	  the Palouse to	  begin	  with	  and	  the E2 option	  will take out some of that ecosystem and	  force the deer	  and the rest	  of	  the wildlife to recede even further up the	  ridge	  and into what pine	  and brush	  habitat is there; however, it is obvious that the deer	  range will be more adversely impacted	  with	  E2	  than the C3	  option. *	  The E2	  and C3	  options join together in South Moscow at approximately the same location and  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  both	  are relatively straight roads from the vicinity of mile post 340 to town, so it seems that if just for the wildlife, wildlife 	  habitat, 	  and 	  safety alone, the	  C3	  option	  should	  truly be the selected	  course of action. Having spent the majority of my adult life living in Moscow and working the fields and spending countless	  hours	  on Paradise ridge and the surrounding	  area, I am absolutely	  convinced that if the highway is realigned following the E2 route, we will be consciously bringing undue harm and hardship	  to	  the associated	  wildlife and	  their associated habitat and we	  will absolutely see	  an increase 	  in 	  serious 	  accidents 	  than 	  what 	  we 	  already have with	  the current alignment. Anyone that has spent any time on the ridge in the winter months	  will absolutely understand the major change in weather in just hundreds of feet change in elevation. The prudent and right course of action	  is to	  select the C3 option. I strongly encourage you to re-‐think the relationship between the C3 and E2 option as it	  will be very sad for us to consciously put this new	  highway in	  at any location	  higher up	  the ridge than	  the C3 option.

The displays at the hearing of the various factors considered for the re-‐routing highway 95 were very informative. The maps and charts and providing staff to answer	  questions were all good. I	  think 	  that 	  the 	  weather 	  data 	  was 	  not 	  as comprehensive as	  it could have been, and was	  not as thorough as data	  in the	  other categories. Why stint on something as	  important as	  weather in Idaho? 	  	  (Of 	  course,	  with 	  climate 	  change,	  who knows....) I guess the data that was looked at does not point to	  any strong recommendations. Listening	  to people's comments was not very	  helpful in 	  helping 	  me 	  make 	  a 	  decision.	  I	  understood 	  their emotions but often	  could	  not figure out what they thought	  was the best	  route or	  why. But	  it	  was a good process I suppose. I	  think 	  it 	  is 	  time 	  to 	  act. I	  am 	  leaning 	  towards 	  the 	  western 	  route 	  at 	  the  See	  General Response	  Weather-‐1	  regarding the referenced sampling period and data set.

It doesn't impact the native grass area	  near the	  eastern route, or disrupt or destroy the residential and	  business property along	  the	  current route. It takes away farmland but there seems to be a lot	  of	  that. Meanwhile, the speed limit can be lowered. Yesterday morning there was a thin layer	  of	  snow on the road and I drove at	  50 to 55 mph. No one passed me, tailgated or honked. Some	  flashing lights or signage	  about the	  steep grades, curves, and driveways ahead would be	  a	  good thing. I	  have 	  thought 	  of 	  driving 	  through 	  there 5 miles below the speed	  limit with	  my emergency flashers on. After all, the road	  is an	  emergency.

A road placed at this elevation will experience inclement 	  weather 	  from 	  September 	  until	  May.	  Snow, icy roads, winds, and blowing snow will occur at this elevation at a	  much greater rate	  than other alternate routes.

Moscow, ID January-‐22-‐2013 I	  wish 	  ITD 	  had 	  done 	  a 	  better 	  job 	  on 	  the 	  safety oriented	  information of the DEIS.

These road	  remnants would	  be operating concurrently	  and dynamically	  in time if E2	  or W4	  are used, with increased miles and times for	  those intending to commute south on new 95. This poor data	  is not insignificant as just one or two number changes to	  the crash	  and	  fatality graph	  renders ITD's present view supporting E2 as safer invalid. Our property, being in the drainage some distance down-‐hill from E-‐2, is sure to experience some kind of water related	  impact as there will be changes to	  the runoff	  for	  certain and limited yet	  still potential risk for	  potable water, a risk that	  does not	  exist	  presently.

Also, one of the biggest issues which	  impact "everyone" that will use this highway is fact that it is the shortest route making it	  the least	  expensive to build and in this distressing economy be the least costly for commuters	  to use, in lower fuel consumption and wear on vehicles, tires, etc... The people that oppose the E2	  route do not have many facts correct. The route would not go "over" Paradise	  ridge, it would be	  at the	  base, thus the weather is not any more adverse than any other route. The so called endangered species could be affected on	  any of the routes as the birds and	  bats fly over a large 	  area.	  As 	  far 	  as 	  the 	  Palouse 	  giant 	  earthworm, there isn't	  any definite proof	  they actually exist. People	  who oppose	  the	  E2	  route	  do not live	  in the	  impacted 	  area 	  and 	  many 	  do 	  not 	  live 	  in 	  this 	  area 	  at all, so they do not have	  to drive	  this dangerous 6	  miles on a daily basis like many of us do. As two people that drive this stretch	  of roadway and	  have	  come upon several accidents	  and a fatal one, have lasting 	  effects 	  on 	  us.	  Your 	  safest 	  route 	  (E2) 	  is 	  a 	  must for	  the good of	  anyone on the highway, not	  to mention our family and friends who drive this highway on	  a daily basis. Also, the land	  the E2 opposition 	  is 	  referring 	  to 	  is "private"	  owned land so if the landowners	  want to plow it under or sell it to	  ITD, those folks should	  not be able to	  dictate what they can	  or can't do	  with	  it. I	  am 	  attaching 	  a 	  quote 	  as 	  one 	  of 	  the 	  landowners  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  along	  the	  corridor which	  clears states the opinion	  of the majority of	  the landowners: E2	  is the Least Disruptive Alternative. Nearly all the land 	  in 	  the 	  corridor 	  is 	  private 	  property.	  The 	  owners of more than	  80% of the land	  directly impacted	  by the three alternatives have notified the	  ITD that they prefer alternative E2. E2 is less disruptive of local businesses;	  minimizes 	  residential	  and 	  business relocation,	  and 	  the 	  number 	  of 	  remaining 	  homes 	  and businesses that must access the highway directly;	  results in the least	  fragmentation of	  farming operations; best preserves, protects and	  services the current agricultural practices	  in the area; and is	  the least 	  likely 	  to 	  encourage 	  suburban 	  encroachment into 	  some 	  of 	  the 	  best 	  farmland in	  the northwest. The vast majority of farmers impacted by all three routes agree that	  E2 is the best	  alternative and least	  interferes 	  with 	  their 	  operations.	  These residents and property owners overwhelmingly support Alternative E2 because it directly affects	  their everyday	  home life. In contrast, most of those that oppose the E2 alternative largely live 	  outside 	  the 	  Study 	  Area, 	  do 	  not 	  own 	  property directly affected	  by the alternative routes, and	  are concerned about indirect effects on	  Paradise Ridge,	  much of which is on the periphery or outside the Study area. E2	  is clearly the Safest Alternative. It is the straightest, flattest, shortest, least expensive route; with the fewest accesses, and least poor weather conditions. E2 is	  the only	  alternative that eliminates	  Reisenauer Hill,	  minimizes 	  curves,	  has 	  the 	  minimum  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  number of accesses and	  is most favorable for conversion to ³no access² status	  for the next generation of highways. As far as the view goes, anywhere the highway would be built could/would affect someone's view. This should not take precedence over the safety of public travel now or in	  the future. As stated	  in	  your plan	  there are many ways in	  which	  to	  build	  the new	  highway to	  minimize the sight of the highway by plantings etc...

Susan Somers 3639	  Country Club Court Lewiston, Idaho.  E-‐37  Thomas R.  Brandt  Dear ITD	  Officials, I	  am 	  writing 	  to 	  voice 	  my 	  opinion	  that the C-‐3	  alternative	  for the	  U.S. 95, Thorncreek Rd. to Moscow Project is preferential to the E-‐2	  alternative. I	  say 	  this 	  for 	  three 	  reasons: 1. More cost effective because it utilizes more of the existing	  alignment. 2. Lower impact on a. New right-‐of-‐way acres b. Prime farmland acres c. Wetlands	  acres 3. More fair treatment of displaced residences While the lengths of the two alternatives are technically about	  the same, the C-‐3	  alternative clearly	  requires	  fewer	  miles of	  new road bed. Approximately 60% of this route follows the existing alignment whereas only 40% follows a	  new alignment. The	  E-‐2	  alternative, on the other hand, has only about 20% following the existing alignment and 80% requiring	  all new roadbeds. Based	  on	  the DEIS FHWA-‐ID-‐EIS-‐12-‐01-‐D, the C-‐3	  route will disrupt	  fewer	  acres of	  prime farmland,	  wetlands and new	  right-‐of-‐way acres as compared to the E-‐2	  alternative. This seems to be preferable.  FHWA and ITD must balance	  the	  alternatives’ impacts to both	  the human	  and	  natural environment while taking into 	  account 	  the 	  public’s 	  need 	  for 	  a 	  safe 	  and 	  efficient transportation system. General Response Alternative describes why FHWA	  and	  ITD identified	  the E-‐2	  Alternative as the Preferred	  Alternative. Your statements regarding the alternatives’ impacts are accurate	  with the	  following	  clarifications: See	  General Response	  Displacement-‐1	  and Displacement-‐2	  for clarification of the residential and business impacts. All displaced	  residences and	  businesses will be treated equally and fairly per the requirements of	  the Uniform Relocation Act. Additional information 	  regarding	  indirect effects to businesses due to relocating the highway is described in the DEIS and FEIS	  Section 6.1. See	  General Response	  Safety-‐6	  regarding the significance of the differences	  in length and safety between alternatives.  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  There is no question 	  that 	  residences 	  and 	  businesses will be displaced and/or disrupted. However, prior reasonable expectations are not	  the same. People and businesses that locate	  along	  a	  federal highway must assume the clear possibility of changes due to the highway. There must	  be a reasonable expectation that the	  possibility for disruption will occur. Conversely, those who	  locate in	  a rural area, far	  from the federal highway have no reasonable expectation that they will be	  disrupted by the	  highway. Residents move	  to such an area	  specifically because it offers privacy from things like highways. To suddenly find the likelihood that a	  highway will be going through	  your property, near to	  your house, is 	  not 	  a 	  reasonable 	  expectation 	  that 	  these 	  people should have. This is grossly unfair to people	  who chose to live where they	  did specifically	  so that they	  would be away from things like the highway. As for businesses that	  will be displaced, it	  seems that	  the businesses are located along the current highway by choice. This provides a transportation	  route for	  their	  product, customers, etc. While not	  being displaced	  by moving the highway to	  a new route, I would think that	  having the highway move away from the	  business will be	  a	  detriment to those	  businesses.

Stroebel  I	  am 	  writing 	  to 	  express 	  my 	  concerns 	  regarding 	  the preferred	  route specified	  by the DEIS for the US 95 Thorncreek to Moscow project. I am a	  resident of Boise, but have a family home and	  80 acres in	  Latah	  County and	  am a frequent traveler of Highway 95. While I am very much in support of improving Highway 95 to 4 lanes, I am opposed to the	  E-‐2	  alignment alternative	  and favor the	  C-‐3	  option for the following reasons: * Impact on Palouse Prairie remnants -‐the ecosystem of Paradise	  Ridge,	  including 	  one 	  of 	  the largest 	  remnants of Palouse	  Prairie	  native	  habitat,  FHWA and ITD must balance	  both the	  human and natural environmental impacts with	  the safety benefit for	  the general public. General Response Alternative describes why FHWA	  and	  ITD identified	  the E-‐2	  Alternative as the Preferred	  Alternative. The statements regarding effects are consistent with the DEIS and FEIS with the following clarifications: The E-‐2	  Alternative would not go over Paradise Ridge or Palouse	  remnants but would come	  closer to Paradise	  Ridge and	  could	  cause indirect effects due to weeds, noise and visual effects as discussed in the	  DEIS. More	  information 	  is 	  provided 	  in 	  General	  Response 	  Weeds 	  and  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  would be seriously threatened by the invasion of aggressive, non-‐native weeds. The DEIS acknowledges that weed infestations will extend 0.6	  miles on either side of each alternative (pg. 206). I have purchased	  native plant seed from a source originating from the Paradise Ridge remnant. Once these rare remnants are destroyed, they are gone forever. What	  that	  means is that	  our	  grandchildren and their children may never have	  the	  opportunity of experiencing a view into	  Palouse	  history. A visit to Paradise	  Ridge	  prairie	  remnant on a	  balmy June	  evening	  to see	  the	  vivid display of wildflowers, enjoy the silence and serenity of	  the view from the ridge, listen 	  to 	  the 	  buzz 	  of 	  pollinating 	  insects, 	  and 	  envision what the prairie looked 	  like 	  hundreds 	  of 	  years 	  ago 	  is a	  memorable	  experience. Landowners, like	  my family, who choose to landscape with water-‐wise native plants will have fewer resources for seed. Traffic noise from the E-‐2	  route would destroy the tranquility of Paradise Ridge. *	  Conversion of prime Palouse farmland to highway and ecological footprint impact-‐E-‐2	  route would impact 	  nearly 	  51 	  acres 	  of 	  prime 	  farmland, 	  the economic engine	  of Latah County, compared with 25 acres for the	  C-‐3	  route	  and twice	  the	  CRP	  land as the	  alternatives. Not only does this affect the	  productivity of the Palouse in	  loss of farm production	  to	  transportation	  use, the pastoral view of the Palouse would	  be visually impacted. The C-‐3	  alignment of Highway 95	  would have	  less impact than E-‐2	  on the views that make the Palouse beautiful.

I don't think that a difference of 32 seconds is going to impact	  freight	  transport	  or	  the "economic vitality of the area" (pg. 176). * The DEIS underestimates the full impact of crashes	  in that it fails	  to include crashes	  that would continue to occur on the existing section of highway	   #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  95. Building the E-‐2	  highway will reduce the rate of crashes	  on Highway	  95 but doesn't eliminate crashes	  that	  will occur	  on the existing highway section because of its greater number of access points. In	  addition, much of the	  difference	  in predicted crash rates is an artifact	  of	  the difference in crash rates between	  the C-‐3	  and E-‐2	  routes and the relative lengths	  of divided 4-‐lane 	  vs.	  5-‐lane 	  suburban sections. The benefit of C-‐3	  is greater pedestrian and bicycle safety (pg. 177: C-‐3	  would have the greatest length 	  of 	  4-‐lane 	  with 	  center 	  turn 	  lane, 	  curb, 	  gutter and sidewalks). * The remediation of Goodman Oil contamination required in the C-‐3	  alternative would be good for the environment. * Cost shift -‐with the E-‐2	  route, the cost of maintaining the abandoned section of the existing highway 95 would	  be shifted	  to	  the county highway district, increasing the burden on the local tax base.

I	  know 	  you 	  have 	  been 	  inundated 	  with 	  letters 	  from residents who live on Paradise Ridge taking a stand against the	  E-‐2	  option for completion	  of Hwy 95. They are a	  very strong group and have been quite vocal during	  this whole process. I’d 	  like 	  to 	  make 	  a 	  point 	  from 	  our 	  perspective. 1) My husband and I must drive to Lewiston a	  number of times each	  month. During the winter the scariest part of the	  trip is coming	  down Reisenauer Hill and then winding	  up the	  hills north of Snow Rd. 2) Any option but E-‐2	  still keeps Reisenauer Hill in the plan, with the roads only diverging at	  the bottom of the hill. The	  “hill”	  is a	  dangerous part of the highway, especially during the wintertime. Also dangerous when	  we, who	  obey the speed	  limit, have cars	  on our tail because we tend to slow down coming over the top of the hill due to the curve at the bottom. We have been passed	  numerous times near the curve because of impatient drivers, adding more danger to the trips. 3) These residents of Paradise Ridge,	  who 	  discuss  The NEPA process requires that all	  substantive 	  public comment be considered. FHWA and ITD must balance the alternatives’ impacts to both the human and natural environment while	  taking	  into account the	  public’s need for	  a safe and efficient	  transportation system. General Response Alternative describes why FHWA and ITD identified 	  the 	  E-‐2	  Alternative as the Preferred Alternative. See	  General Response	  Safety-‐5	  regarding Reisenauer Hill.	  As noted, Paradise Ridge is 	  subject 	  to 	  past, 	  present and increasing 	  residential	  development.	  	  Additional	  consideration of the effects	  to Paradise Ridge, including residential and commercial development, has been added to Chapter 6, Indirect and Cumulative	  Effects.	  See	  General Response	  Weeds and Wildlife	  regarding	  flora and fauna. The Safety Analysis has been revised since the DEIS was published	  but the findings regarding the relative safety between	  alternatives remains valid. See General Responses Safety-‐3	  and Safety-‐6.	  See	  Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments for mitigation measures.  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  disturbing the flora and	  fauna in	  that area, didn’t hesitate to	  build	  their homes (which disturbed the same ecosystem) in that area many years	  ago. So why is it different that some areas would be disturbed	  when	  a safe highway is built? 4) The other two alternatives do not address the safety issue 	  of 	  Reisenauer 	  Hill,	  and 	  the 	  western alternative	  makes the	  least sense. We	  strongly support the E-‐2	  alternative. It is the safest, the straightest, and just makes	  sense. Sincerely, Joan and George	  Klingler Moscow Joan Klinger  E-‐54  John  Crock  After speaking with	  an	  IDT representative at the recent	  highway 95 re-‐alignment forum, he	  admitted that	  the safety numbers for the E-‐2	  alternative are underestimates of	  the big picture. The big picture is that	  in the E-‐2	  option, old 95	  still exists. People, including 	  residents 	  on 	  that 	  stretch, 	  will	  still	  drive 	  old 95. Accidents will occur and people will die on that old	  stretch. Of course the traffic will be greatly	  less, so maybe accidents	  will only occur at 1/10 of the current rate, but when you add in those numbers	  to the projected accident	  rate on E-‐2, E-‐2	  is the most dangerous alternative. C-‐2	  obliterates the old 95	  roadway, so there are no additional accidents	  and is	  thus safer	  in the big picture. In addition IDT models E-‐2	  as being safer than C-‐2	  because there are no businesses on	  it since it hasn’t been	  built. As soon	  as there is high traffic flow on E-‐2, savvy business or property owners will develop the adjacent land and it 	  will	  soon 	  be 	  as 	  congested 	  as 	  old 	  95 	  is 	  today,  The E-‐2	  Alternative would have the greatest safety benefit even	  when	  considering the safety of existing US95. See General Response Safety-‐3	  regarding how the safety of existing US-‐95	  was considered in the Revised Safety Analysis (ITD 2013). See	  General Response	  Safety-‐6	  regarding the significance of the differences	  in length and safety between	  alternatives. The action	  alternatives would	  have Expressway Access Control, which would restrict new accesses and	  reduce the potential for sprawl. See General Response Access.

General Response Schedule describes the next	  steps in the environmental process and the anticipated schedule.  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  meaning the lower accident projections will be short-‐lived.	  When I first started driving 95 nearly 40 years ago, the speed limit	  was 55 MPH. Now, despite it	  being well	  known 	  as 	  one 	  of 	  the 	  most 	  dangerous 	  roads 	  in Idaho,	  the 	  speed 	  limit 	  is 	  60MPH. 	  I	  don’t 	  trust 	  IDT 	  to improve 	  safety on	  old	  95 once E-‐2	  is built because they have done nothing and in fact	  made old 95 more dangerous in the intervening decades. Let’s go with the safest alternative, the central route and get rid of	  those death curves. Using the existing corridor	  worked well with the 15 miles from Thorn Creek to the top of	  the Lewiston grade, let’s continue that	  success	  and get the C-‐2	  route built.

I	  concur 	  with 	  the 	  following 	  itemization 	  of 	  socioeconomic impacts, not the	  least of which is that problems with	  the existing roadway would not be pushed	  off onto	  Latah	  County taxpayers by adopting C-‐3: *	  Land Use: C-‐3	  would take the least prime farmland of statewide importance and	  Conservation	  Reserve Program land, whereas E-‐2	  would use twice as much.

The addition of	  frontage roads currently not	  proposed by ITD could correct the slightly	  higher accident rate due to access and result in a	  C-‐3	  safety rating similar to that of E-‐2. * Businesses/Residences: C-‐3	  would affect eight businesses with more noise,	  whereas 	  the 	  other 	  two alternatives could undermine	  their viability in the	  absence	  of Highway 95	  traffic. C-‐3	  would dislodge	  one residence and	  affect no	  domestic wells; E-‐2	  would move five-‐plus residences and	  impact two	  wells. * Accidents & Safety: Based on a	  flawed DEIS	  safety analysis that does not consider weather conditions and C-‐3	  corrections of the unsafe sections	  of the current highway, about 4.7 predicted fatal and injurious 	  crashes 	  could 	  occur 	  on 	  C-‐3	  per year, compared to 3.8 on E-‐2. E-‐2	  would abandon these dangerous stretches as a county road, and	  accidents would continue to occur there. * Weather: ITD	  reports that 57 percent of highway section accidents	  happen during inclement weather. But the DEIS only analyzes snowless conditions between	  January 1 and	  May 31, 2005, during the mildest winter in 25 years.

I find the endorsement	  of	  the E2 option	  to	  be flawed	  and	  misleading to	  the public. It appears to be	  praying	  on the	  public regarding	  safety concerns	  which do not appear to be accurate. In light 	  of 	  the 	  evidence 	  supporting 	  C3 	  and 	  against 	  E2, the endorsement	  of	  E2 is surprising and in fact	  raises public concern	  about process and	  potential special  The DEIS	  was prepared in accordance with ITD and FHWA NEPA regulations [23	  CFR 771].

Because I frequent the Paradise Ridge area, I have	  purchased	  a more robust (SUV all-‐wheel drive) vehicle because of the differences in weather and road conditions that	  exist	  on Paradise Ridge compared to Moscow. I don’t need that vehicle	  in town, but	  I do when I go up towards the Ridge. It	  does not make sense to	  make predictions for the different routes based	  on	  weather that fluctuates depending on	  elevation	  and	  location. Where the current road exists	  provides	  a distinctly	  different road condition and weather	  pattern compared to Paradise	  Ridge. Weather is clearly different on a	  regular	  basis and produces quite treacherous conditions	  which appear to pose a significant safety concern. The majority	  of the accidents	  that occur on 95	  are weather related. The proposed route E2	  is the highest in	  elevation	  (making it the most consistent weather with Paradise Ridge) and the most different from the current	  location. In the winter	  months this location 	  is 	  more 	  icy/snowy/dangerous.	  Therefore the safety risk of	  E2 appears inaccurate and flawed. The current weather data	  does not seem to provide a	  good basis for accurate	  predictions. I know statistics	  and prediction. There is	  a lot of potential for	  error	  that	  is inherent	  to the prediction	  process. The data	  used to make such predictions must be measured accurately.

The	  weather analysis is simply invalid 	  and 	  does 	  not 	  hold 	  up 	  to 	  scrutiny.	  This 	  is something that can be used to persuade the general population, but it is not accurate for those that understand	  research, and	  is irresponsible to	  use it to	  make safety claims	  that are highly	  questionable and potentially harmful in	  their effects. Additionally, the most dangerous sections of the current road would continue to operate as	  country roads, therefore continuing to pose safety	  risks. The newspapers are rife with passionate cries for safety.	  And, I would argue that the E2 route poses safety risk that has	  not been accounted for currently. If the safety	  argument is	  to be a persuading factor, then	  E2 should	  not be the endorsed route. It seems the	  responsible	  and ethical decision	  will consider accurate data before inflaming the public regarding safety. Endorsements for	  E2 based	  on	  safety should	  not be taken	  into	  consideration. I	  also 	  believe 	  that 	  there 	  are 	  other 	  important considerations	  in the road location. The C3 route would require the least right-‐of-‐way and take	  the	  least 	  amount 	  of 	  prime 	  farmland and CRP	  land, has the least	  effect	  on wetlands and general wildlife, and is 	  consistent 	  with 	  Moscow 	  impact 	  land 	  use 	  goals.	  This appears to consider both personal and public interest, 	  both 	  of 	  which 	  are 	  maximized 	  with 	  C3.	  Whereas, E2 takes twice as much prime farmland, would produce the most noise effects, greatest visual impact, 	  affects 	  2 	  domestic 	  wells, 	  and 	  will	  have  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  an environmental impact on large	  and small wildlife, pine stands, and	  Palouse prairie remnant. These disadvantages to	  E2 are compelling. It looks very clear that C3 is a	  superior route	  compared to E2 on many levels. I	  highly 	  endorse 	  the 	  C3 	  route 	  based 	  on 	  the 	  many public and	  private benefits that appear with	  this route over	  the others. Because this route is not	  more expensive than E2, is negligibly longer (only .09 mile!), and the effects of business displacement is difficult at best to	  predict – this appears to be the reasonable choice. Please consider	  these factors in the decision process to arrive at	  a sound and reasonable route. Based on the data provided C3 is the reasonable route to improve US 95.

Constructions costs are provided	  but they do	  not include 	  right-‐of-‐way,	  mitigation,	  maintenance,	  and  FHWA and ITD must balance both	  the human	  and	  natural environmental impacts with	  the safety benefit for	  the general public.

As far as we can tell, this wasn't done, even in 	  the 	  "Visual	  Resources" 	  document.	  E-‐2	  has by far the highest	  percentage of	  "high visual impact" 	  and will be in clear view	  of Moscow	  residents. This is one of the biggest disadvantages of E-‐2, yet it isn't shown at ground level and it is	  somewhat unclear (to us)	  from aerial views exactly where the road will go. This view should have	  been included in all public presentations and	  in	  the DEIS. *	  We are concerned	  that the worse weather conditions	  along the E-‐2	  route have been underemphasized. The draft EIS states "Therefore, weather was considered when developing the design	  elements but will not be a major factor for comparing the alternatives."	  Both E-‐2	  and C-‐3	  are within the eastern corridor (EC) and it appears that weather was not differentiated between the two. Still the	  route	  of E-‐2	  up and over the west end of Paradise	  Ridge may be snowier and foggier than the C-‐3	  route. E-‐2	  would likely require	  more	  (and costlier) snow removal than the C-‐3	  or W-‐4	  routes. More snow, more fog, (and steeper grades?) could result	  in an underestimate of	  crashes along E-‐2. *	  According to the DEIS, "All alternatives would traverse the rolling terrain of	  the Palouse and	  have similar maximum grades	  and curvature". However, it appears the	  C-‐3	  route follows a	  more steady grade into 	  Moscow 	  while 	  E-‐2	  stays high then drops over the west	  end of	  Paradise Ridge into 	  Moscow.	  This  See	  General Response	  Weather-‐3, Weather-‐4, and Weather-‐5	  regarding weather, elevation, snow, fog and other weather related	  driving conditions.

Winter maintenance is addressed in General Response Maintenance-‐1. General Response Weather-‐8	  addresses the validity of the Safety and Weather	  Analyses. The lengths of the early alternatives were originally longer	  and close to MP 337. The alternatives evaluated in 	  the 	  DEIS 	  begin 	  at 	  MP 	  337.67.	  	  See 	  FEIS 	  Section 	  2.5, Level Two Screening. While any of the alternatives would have a maximum grade	  of five	  percent, the	  alternatives differ in the	  amount of hills and curves as well as the orientation of those hills, which can have an effect	  on road conditions. See	  General Response	  Weather-‐4	  regarding how snow accumulation and grade	  compare	  between alternatives. See	  General Response	  Safety-‐6	  regarding the significance of the difference in length and safety between	  alternatives. The E-‐2	  Alternative would be a	  straighter and flatter alignment with two lanes in each direction. This should reduce turning movements, and excessive braking which is expected to result	  in less need to use "jake brakes"; however, jake brakes would	  not be prohibited.

The percentage of different grades for the different routes should be included 	  in 	  the 	  DEIS.	  * Different lengths are given in places for the different routes and	  the reason	  for this given	  in	  the DEIS is that the length of the project limits changed. We aren't sure how this would change E-‐2	  from being shorter than	  C-‐3	  to being	  longer (see	  "Screening"	  pages	  5 and 6). Please state whether all lengths 	  are 	  based 	  on 	  the 	  distance 	  from 	  the 	  same project beginning and	  ending points (mp	  337.67 to	  mp 344.00). *Crash estimates are one of the strongest arguments for C-‐3	  but are they meaningful?	  How good is the	  crash estimate	  model?

Is the difference in	  estimates between the	  routes statistically significant? * The noise impacts of E-‐2	  are based on estimates within 300ft of businesses and residents. Presumably, trucks will be	  using air brakes as they come down off the ridge into Moscow along E-‐2	  and, while the noise may not exceed requirements, it will affect quality of life	  in residential areas south of town much farther	  away than 300 feet.

Well, maybe, but putting	  a	  road through the	  middle	  of the	  scenery is hardly equivalent to the	  counter argument that the	  existence	  of the	  road will mar the	  view. The	  visual resources argument	  is clearly and strongly against	  the E-‐2	  alternative and the DEIS	  should not imply otherwise. We believe the roadway through the project area needs to	  be improved	  and	  a reasonable case can	  be made for the three improvement alternatives but	  especially for C-‐3	  and E-‐2. (A fifth alternative-‐improve 	  and 	  widen 	  the 	  existing 	  roadway-‐-‐seems	  to have been	  dismissed	  out of hand. Why wasn't that discussed? Perhaps we missed	  it.) In	  general, we believe that the improved	  roadway should	  follow the existing 	  route 	  as 	  much 	  as 	  possible, 	  balancing cost and considerations	  described in the DEIS, such as driver safety.	  We believe C-‐3	  does that.

However, I am also highly concerned about the vitality	  of the remnant wildlife and native plants of the Palouse, which is one of	  the most	  endangered ecosystems in Idaho. The	  integrity of local farms should also be preserved to the maximum extent. Therefore, I encourage you not to adopt the preferred	  alternative	  because	  of its impacts on wildlife, native plants and farmland,	  but 	  instead 	  use the C-‐3	  alternative as having much less impact to these values. Very truly yours, Debra K. Ellers 116	  Garfield St., Moscow ID 83843  The E-‐2	  Alternative would not	  directly affect	  Palouse remnants but	  would be closer	  to Paradise Ridge,	  a 	  high quality remnant, compared	  to	  the other alternatives. See	  General Response	  Weeds and Wildlife	  regarding effects to Palouse	  remnants, vegetation and wildlife. The E-‐2	  Alternative would affect the greatest amount of prime farmland;	  however,	  it 	  would 	  have 	  less 	  effect 	  to the most	  productive farmland in the area which is located 	  along 	  the Modified W-‐4	  Alternative. Measures that	  would	  minimize farmland	  conversion	  and	  indirect effect to farmland include	  controlling	  non-‐agricultural access points along	  US-‐95	  and working with farmers to construct farmable slopes.

My comment I said that route W-‐4	  was the	  option I favored. Now that	  the hearing is over	  I have changed my mind and now favor C-‐3. Please consider this option	  as the best one. Yes, E-‐2	  is the favorite of the state, but you are leaving the existing section(s) of the highway as is. Wrong!	  This does	  nothing to alleviate	  the	  dangerous conditions on Paradise	  Ridge.	  Yes, use will	  go down, but the danger still	  exists for the	  area	  drivers who will continue	  to use	  old	  95. It seems to	  me that the Draft Environmental Impact 	  Statement is 	  mislabeled.	  It 	  should 	  read "Draft ECONOMIC Impact Statement,"' cause that is	  the main consideration. It	  also seems to me that	  the environment is of no concern to you. For example,  General Response Safety-‐3	  provides information regarding the updated Safety Analysis, which considers the remaining sections of	  US-‐95. General Response Maintenance-‐2	  discusses the process of addressing the existing	  safety deficiencies on	  the existing US-‐95	  section. FHWA and ITD must balance	  the	  alternatives’ impacts to both	  the human	  and	  natural environment while taking into 	  account 	  the 	  public’s 	  need 	  for 	  a 	  safe 	  and 	  efficient transportation system.

No Palouse Prairie or remnants will be directly impacted.	  See 	  General	  Response 	  Weeds 	  and 	  Wildlife regarding Paradise Ridge and Palouse	  remnants. However, as stated in the DEIS, the E-‐2	  Alternative  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  did	  anyone consider the dramatic impact on	  the water table? The existing highway already has channeled the water into the culverts and sped it rushing downstream. And you want	  to do it	  again? How many acres of forest will be "harvested" for this project? How many acres of the ORIGINAL Palouse prairie will be removed? And, what's left will have it's 	  water 	  directed 	  away 	  quickly.	  This 	  will	  kill	  most 	  of what's left after you scrape away what is needed to clear the path chosen. Do more research! You're option	  is a poor one. Yes, E-‐2	  may be a	  slightly safer route. But,	  at 	  what 	  cost? 	  You 	  obviously 	  aren't interested 	  in 	  doing 	  what's 	  right 	  for 	  the ENVIRONMENT. Economics is the main concern.

There	  are	  many reasons why I believe	  C-‐3	  is 	  a 	  preferable 	  route, 	  but 	  three 	  main 	  reasons 	  stand out for me. 1. It will be much more visible route from Moscow, whereas C-‐3	  is lower down. 2. The noise level will be	  much greater with trucks coming down the slope and having to brake. 3. The most troubling aspect of this is how the weather analysis was done. The E-‐2	  route is much further	  up, and this means it	  is much more susceptible to winter weather conditions. I  Four alternatives were	  evaluated in detail in the	  DEIS, the No Action, W-‐4, C-‐3	  and E-‐2	  Alternatives. Since	  the	  DEIS the W-‐4	  Alternative was modified and is now the Modified 	  W-‐4	  Alternative. FHWA and ITD must balance	  the	  alternatives’ impacts to both	  the human	  and	  natural environment while taking into 	  account 	  the 	  public’s 	  need 	  for 	  a 	  safe 	  and 	  efficient transportation system. General Response Alternative describes why FHWA	  and	  ITD identified	  the E-‐2	  Alternative as the Preferred	  Alternative. Your numbered points are consistent with information presented	  in	  the DEIS with	  the following clarifications: 2. The E-‐2	  Alternative would descend in elevation more gradually	  than the	  C-‐3	  and Modified W-‐4	  alternatives, which would require less braking. Additional  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  remember	  the winter	  of	  2005. It	  was not	  much of	  a winter, and past MLK weekend, there wasn’t much snowfall. In fact, the ski areas	  had to close early for the season. I remember	  hiking in the mountains during Spring Break because we couldn’t go	  skiing. Do we really want to rely on the weather analysis from such an unusual winter? This choice would be much more credible if the weather analysis came from a more typical winter. ITD is choosing a route with potentially greater hazards due to the weather. Thank you for your consideration.

There are many problems with	  the E-‐2	  proposal. I observe heavy fog on	  Paradise Ridge until noon	  many days even	  in	  the summer. Construction	  there will damage native habitat	  beyond repair. Four	  lanes 	  will	  create 	  a 	  speedway 	  and 	  traffic 	  will	  not 	  slow down	  as it reaches Moscow. And	  finally, no	  attempt has been	  made to	  create a safer route on	  the current road. I drive back	  and forth between Moscow and Lewiston frequently. I find that	  the only way to take some of the curves safely is to slow	  down	  to	  45 miles per hour. I also	  travel to	  a job	  in	  Spokane	  several days a	  week and notice	  that many curves	  there have recommended speeds	  as	  slow as	  40	  miles per hour. At the January 23	  public	  hearing, I spoke with several of your representatives	  concerning safety.	  Even though I pointed out that most of the accidents occurred on curves and questioned	  why speed	  was not lowered	  significantly  See	  General Response	  Weather-‐5	  regarding elevation and fog	  on Paradise	  Ridge.	  The E-‐2	  Alternative would not have construction activities on Paradise	  Ridge but would	  be closer to Paradise	  Ridge	  compared to the	  other alternatives. Many of the primary roadway deficiencies would not be addressed by repairing	  the	  existing	  road. The	  dangerous curves	  and grades	  would not be improved, nor would accesses be	  eliminated. The	  safety deficiencies would	  continue to exist on the existing road and therefore the purpose and	  need	  would	  not be met. See Safety-‐4	  regarding lowering the speed limits. See	  General Response	  Safety-‐3	  regarding safety on	  the existing 	  US-‐95	  should an action alternative be constructed.

I pointed	  out that clear conflict of interest years ago	  when	  comment was first taken	  on	  this project. Almost a decade later this cronyism is 	  still	  driving 	  the 	  decision 	  making 	  around 	  this project. I am unclear as to	  the persons and	  mechanisms	  which have kept this	  faulty	  plan so firmly in place, but	  I do not	  accept	  them as valid and democratic. The DEIS	  as written contains factual errors and misleading statements. These are clearly intended to put the E-‐2	  alignment in the best light while 	  ignoring or minimizing the many problems with	  this alignment: The	  C-‐3	  alignment is said to displace eight businesses,	  while 	  that 	  is 	  clearly 	  not 	  true. 	  The 	  E2	  alignment is touted as shorter than the C-‐3	  alignment. In fact it is 0.09	  miles 	  shorter, 	  which 	  is insignificant.	  The 	  E-‐2	  alignment would end up displacing more homes than	  any other alignment, but this is not mentioned	  in	  the DEIS. The weather studies	  show no major difference between the E-‐2	  and C-‐3	  alignments in regards to snow. These studies	  are clearly flawed, being made in an unusually low snow year. I can	  see with	  my own	  eyes the difference in weather	  between the middle of	  the ridge and the foot	  of	  the ridge, day after	  day, Winter	  after Winter. The	  E-‐2	  route stays in the higher	  snow area	  for most of its length. Building the E-‐2	  alignment adds more new highway miles than the C-‐3	  alignment, while putting a	  major road into an area which currently has no major	  roads; no paved roads of	  any sort. This will clearly have a larger effect	  on wildlife and habitat, including  business impacts and	  potential impacts.

(2)	  As I've driven this section	  of highway over the last 	  month 	  I've 	  thought 	  to 	  myself 	  that 	  it 	  really 	  isn't that	  bad. With a little ingenuity it	  could be widened as required with added lanes, straightened in sections, and some of the grades	  could be reduced. Surely with the	  technology that	  exists now, the current roadway	  could be much improved and made vastly	  safer. Drivers would benefit, and those who farm adjacent	  lands could still farm them. It	  seems that	  much could be done without	  displacing those who live along the current highway and are	  accustomed to living	  along	  it anyway. If this is the	  C3	  option then so be it, but I feel that ITD could have made a more thorough investigation of the current road bed and possible improvements along that	  route. (3)	  Much has already been said in other	  forums of	  the sanctity of	  Paradise Ridge, and I reiterate my opposition	  to	  the E-‐2	  option. This is another area	  that	  should remain immune from alteration, especially considering	  that there	  are	  other viable	  options. The supposed	  safety of this route remains in 	  question 	  because 	  of 	  the 	  anomalous 	  weather sample that was	  conducted in 2005. E-‐2, above the other options, has the potential to	  affect the quality of life in	  the city of Moscow and	  surrounding countryside through increased noise and light pollution. Moscow is and	  has been	  a quiet town, but there are other	  factors that	  go beyond the numbers and whatever set of standards is being	  applied. I'm  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  not an	  advocate of the houses that have been	  built on	  Paradise Ridge and	  would	  rather they weren't there, but carving a four-‐lane 	  highway 	  through 	  that lush 	  farmland-‐-‐with its accompanying clear space and barrow pits-‐-‐adds insult to injury. It is more	  than many who live here can bear. It would also seem	  inevitable 	  that 	  once 	  this 	  area 	  is 	  opened 	  up, consequent commercial and residential development will erode the agricultural and	  aesthetic qualities of that area. The	  whole	  prospect south of Moscow is	  subject to further desecration. This is not merely misguided "environmentalism," but practical concern	  for the inherent and	  valuable qualities that make Moscow and	  the Palouse what they are. I'm speaking for	  regional character, healthy agriculture	  and its global significance, and the	  continued healthfulness	  of Moscow and its environs. (4)	  I feel a need to respond to one element of IDT's promotional campaign	  used	  at the Moscow open	  house. The introductory video	  stated	  that the accident rate	  of the	  Moscow/Thorn Creek section is four	  times as high as the newly improved Grade to Thorncreek section-‐-‐a	  misleading	  and disingenuous comparison. The newly	  improved section from the top of	  the Lewiston Grade to Thorncreek was already much more	  tame. Lying	  predominantly within what was often called the "Genesee Flats," it bore little comparison	  to	  the section	  now in	  question. It was more level with fewer	  curves. The only meaningful statistic-‐-‐and the	  only one	  that should have been cited-‐-‐would have been a comparison of the accident rate for the  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  Grade/Thorncreek section before and after it was improved.	  In 	  conclusion,	  I	  would 	  quote 	  GeoNote #9 of the Idaho 	  Geological	  Survey 	  that 	  describes 	  the 	  rich unpinning’s of the Palouse landscape. State Geologist Roy Breckenridge summarizes it this way, "...The formation of the landscape upon which we live 	  took 	  place 	  over 	  millions 	  of 	  years.	  From 	  the 	  lava	  flows of	  17 million years ago to the ashfall of	  1980, the Palouse has been altered and shaped by a series of often	  violent natural events. This history suggests, for	  those of	  us who rely on the water, soil, and mineral resources of this area, how truly fragile the Palouse	  country is geologically and how difficult it would be to make another." I	  would 	  simply 	  ask 	  that 	  IDT 	  seriously 	  consider 	  the qualities-‐-‐including 	  the 	  beauties-‐-‐and irreplaceable	  characteristics	  of the region and of Paradise Ridge in its final proposal for	  a safer	  highway, bearing in mind the fragile nature of the Palouse and its stature as an important world food source.

I feel ITD did	  not participate in	  the NEPA	  process in	  good	  faith. They did	  not listen	  to	  members of their interdisciplinary team (IDFG, EPA, or	  USFWS)	  and the public, but	  rather	  went	  through the motions generating a DEIS to support	  their	  preferred alternative, basically one very	  similar to the original 10A from 1999. I	  have 	  many 	  concerns 	  and 	  comments 	  about 	  this project. I do	  think a four lane highway is needed	  and	  will be wonderful once completed. I prefer the C3 alignment for many reasons described below. I	  do 	  NOT 	  believe 	  alternative 	  E2 	  is 	  the 	  best 	  choice,	  especially for the	  people	  who live	  in the	  project area	  and the	  Moscow economy. ITD’s	  rationale that E2 is	  preferred	  is mostly based	  on	  safety and increased safety comes	  from fewer access	  points	  and less	  intersections.	  When 	  I	  asked 	  about 	  limiting 	  access 	  on  The E-‐2	  Alternative was identified as FHWA’s and ITD’s Preferred Alternative	  because	  it balances the	  human and natural environmental effects with	  the best safety benefit for the public. It was not identified	  as the Preferred Alternative	  due	  to political, developer or personal gain. FHWA	  and	  ITD have been	  transparent throughout	  the EIS process from early scoping through the FEIS development. This has included holding open house meetings, breakfast meetings, posting information 	  on 	  the 	  website, 	  working 	  with 	  citizen advisory groups, agencies, sending	  out newsletters, and conducting other public	  involvement activities	  as	  described	  in	  the FEIS. Chapter 10. FHWA	  and	  ITD have presented	  alternatives that balance the needs of the public with	  protection	  of natural resources. The E-‐2	  Alternative is similar to the 10A alternative that was evaluated in an Environmental Assessment (EA) around 2002. One	  of the	  requirements of NEPA and the	  EIS	  process is that a	  range of reasonable alternatives be evaluated in the	  DEIS. There	  is no requirement to exclude	  reasonable	  alternatives because	  they had been previously considered	  as part of a separate study.  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  new alignments, I have gotten	  different answers. Will	  ITD 	  really 	  be 	  able 	  to 	  purchase 	  all	  of 	  the 	  right 	  of ways with 100%	  restricted easements? Will ITD restrict	  new access on any new alignment	  chosen forever	  into the future? I ask because if	  any agricultural access changes down the	  road into a	  residential or commercial access, then	  there is no	  safety benefit of moving the highway away from the existing	  alignment or C3 alternative. I recommend using the existing highway alignment to	  fullest extent possible	  to limit effects on environment. I suggest fixing the	  problem areas and dealing	  with existing	  residents and business approaches rather than making a new highway on undeveloped ground. There is lower construction cost for C3	  than for E2. This is a	  good reason to pick C3. In preferring E2, I understand	  ITD’s desire to	  build	  a new road	  without having to	  restrict and	  control traffic. However, when	  I	  think 	  back,	  I	  can’t 	  remember 	  the 	  delays 	  when 	  the four-‐lane 	  from 	  Thorncreek 	  to 	  the 	  top 	  of 	  Lewiston Hill was constructed. I lived through it and travelled back and	  forth to work through it. But	  I don’t	  remember	  it. Although the total cost	  for	  C3 is higher	  than for	  E2, I’d rather	  pay wages for	  highway traffic control than increased costs	  for more right of way, easements, and prime	  farmland purchases (most of which will benefit a few	  individual landowners). Safety is not adequately addressed in the	  DEIS. Moving the highway to the E2 or W4 alignments would limit most of the local resident’s use of highway 95. Emergency vehicle response time to	   During the DEIS, the E-‐2	  Alternative was one of the alternatives reviewed by the	  public during	  the	  first and second levels	  of the screening process. The rationale for	  forwarding it	  for	  detailed analysis in the DEIS and for	  identifying it 	  as 	  ITD's 	  Preferred 	  Alternative 	  is summarized in the DEIS and FEIS Section 2.6. FHWA and ITD must balance	  both the	  human and natural environmental impacts with	  the safety benefit for	  the general public. General Response Alternative describes why FHWA and ITD identified the E-‐2	  Alternative as the Preferred	  Alternative. See	  General Response	  Agency regarding the	  difference	  in 	  opinion 	  regarding 	  ITD's 	  Preferred 	  Alternative.	  The E-‐2	  Alternative would have Expressway Access Control which	  would 	  restrict 	  any 	  new 	  non-‐agricultural accesses onto US-‐95	  as described in General Response Access. Residents on	  existing US-‐95	  would still be able to use the existing US-‐95	  loop and they would be able to access the new US-‐95	  alignment similarly to existing conditions. See	  General Response	  Safety-‐4	  for a	  discussion of smaller improvements	  on the existing US-‐95	  alignment. Emergency vehicle response times will not change for residents along existing US-‐95	  as emergency vehicles may continue to use the existing highway. Emergency services	  would not be reduced as	  a result of the roadway improvements. The travel on the new alignment would result in a	  safer and slightly faster. See	  General Response Safety-‐3	  and Safety-‐6. Access, mobility and travel user costs are	  further evaluated in the FEIS Section 4.10 and in the Mobility and Road User	  Cost Study (ITD, 2014a).  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  accidents on	  the new highway might be better, but the local residents will see reduction in emergency services.	  The C3 route would keep more residents closer to highway	  access. Reisenauer Hill is 	  a 	  safety hazard. ITD should	  fix the problems there rather than	  turning this stretch	  over to the county highway district. School bus routes for	  both	  Moscow and	  Genesee school districts use Eid	  Road	  and	  I recommend	  improving highway access to	  and from Eid Road (C3 or W4) rather than	  making it more difficult (E2). I	  am 	  not 	  in 	  favor 	  of 	  realignment 	  away 	  from 	  the business section	  of highway 95 at the South	  entrance	  to Moscow (north end of project). This area	  hasn’t seen economic growth like	  other areas in Moscow and many store fronts are vacant probably because of the uncertainty of the proposed	  highway project. In	  the future, it is unclear that the businesses along	  the	  existing	  road will be	  viable	  if alternative	  E2	  or W4	  is chosen. A one	  mile	  stretch of	  business access (C3) isn’t going to	  snarl traffic along highway 95 like up	  in	  Coeur D’Alene, but it will allow travelers the mental stimuli to transition into slower	  speeds	  before entering town. So there is	  a safety benefit. I think it	  is important	  to the economy of	  Moscow to retain some business access to highway 95	  at the south end of the City. E2	  will impact more Palouse Prairie remnants than C3. The weeds and	  listed	  species effects are real concerns	  to me. Many plants and animals are unique and if we	  can avoid impacts to a	  much endangered ecosystem, we	  should. In addition to the	  pygmy  While cost is a factor in identifying the Preferred Alternative, it is not the prime factor. Safety, social effects and protecting	  the	  natural environment are other key factors that were considered. General Response Maintenance-‐2	  explains how the existing	  safety deficiencies would	  be addressed	  on	  the existing	  US-‐95	  section. The C-‐3	  Alternative would be closer to existing accesses but as	  a result, it would have more access	  points	  and a longer 	  five-‐lane 	  section 	  and 	  more 	  turning 	  movements, which would contribute to it having higher crash rates than the E-‐2	  Alternative. See General Response Safety5	  regarding Reisenauer Hill.	  School buses and emergency vehicles would still use	  Eid Road	  and	  would	  access US-‐95	  as they do today. Business access to	  US-‐95	  at the south end of Moscow will be retained with the E-‐2	  Alternative. Many of the businesses that front the section	  of US-‐95	  that would be turned over	  to the North Latah Highway District	  are not	  dependent upon	  drive by traffic. See FEIS Section	  4.1.2 and FEIS	  Section 6.1	  for additional detail. The E-‐2	  Alternative would not directly affect any Palouse	  remnants but would be	  closer to Paradise	  Ridge compared to the other action alternatives. See General Response Weeds and	  Wildlife. Additional information	  regarding the giant Palouse earthworm, pygmy nuthatch and Spalding’s catchfly was added to the FEIS Section 3.8 and 4.8.

We know so little about this	  species. They may exist in remnants slated for	  destruction, why risk further	  damage to	  its known	  habitat, uncultivated	  prairie remnants? Keep the highway along existing road	  route. Big game like moose and elk pass between	  Bald	  Butte and	  Paradise Ridge crossing highway	  95 near Southern end of project area. They will cross the	  highway with	  all of the alternatives,	  but 	  I	  am humored	  that ITD didn’t like report from IDFG and	  hired	  another wildlife consultant to	  provide expert opinion	  that suits their needs. I had	  a moose in	  my yard Feb 9 and 10, 2013. The large road cut across the flank of Paradise Ridge from the E2 alignment	  will probably affect	  surface springs	  such as	  historic	  Steven Springs	  and other shallow springs	  used by households. Will Steven Springs still exist if E2	  is built?	  The	  cuts from C3	  will also affect the	  surface	  hydrology, but	  to a lesser	  degree. Since most residential wells are in	  the Wanapum aquifer that	  is recharged from surface water, any changes to the hydrology from the large road cuts associated with the new alignments have the potential to affect	  wells in the project	  area.

Why keep the road at	  elevation when fog, snow, ice and wind are	  worse	  at the	  elevation of Reisenauer Hill than along	  the	  existing	  alignment?	  The aesthetic value of the Palouse landscape is a	  valuable commodity. A large road cut across the prominent high	  vista, Paradise Ridge will detract	  from the picturesque view if	  alternative E2 is built. Also	  the nuisance noise impact 	  from 	  trucks 	  revving up	  or braking down	  the hill of proposed	  E2 at the northern	  end	  of the project will be worse than	  the C3 alternative.

Idaho's 	  Transportation 	  Investment 	  Program 	  is 	  a 	  multimodal program	  that includes highways, bridges,	  public transportation, railroads, 	  aviation, 	  and 	  non-‐motorized  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  I	  am 	  writing 	  because 	  I	  believe 	  that 	  none 	  of 	  the alternatives deserves to see	  the	  light of day. We	  need	  more and	  better roads, but the 95 improvements 	  have 	  been 	  a 	  jury 	  rigged 	  and compromise solution which are not worthy	  of our state. Here's why: 1. Every region in Idaho EXCEPT	  for Region 2	  has Interstate 	  roads 	  and 	  funding. 2. Much more money is spent in these other regions than is the case in Region 2. 3. Region 2	  is the largest geographically, but the smallest region in terms of population. 4. Because of the above, road building needs are greatest in Region 2, yet total road building	  funds are	  the	  smallest available. 5. To remedy this, you need to come up with a funding scheme using "Interstate Funding Replacement" dollars to answer the	  needs of Region 2, as has been done in other states (Example: Minnesota). Once you do this, you will be able to devote the funds necessary to accomplish more than the existing	  "band aid" approach. Specifically, Moscow needs a west	  side bypass to route traffic around Moscow. Thank you. Cheers! Tom La	  Pointe 409	  North Grant St., Moscow, Idaho  transportation. The program outlines funding priorities by District. State funding for each	  District is allocated	  to	  the identified priorities. In District	  2, improvement	  on this section of	  US-‐95	  between	  Thorncreek Road and Moscow is the highest funding priority. Funding for each of the	  Districts is determined by lane	  miles within those Districts. While District	  2 does not	  have any interstate 	  there 	  are 	  four-‐lane 	  roadways, 	  which 	  are	  considered when calculating the funding amounts	  for each of the	  programs outside	  of the	  Interstate	  Program. We do not anticipate a change in this calculation method because District 2 does not have any Interstate roadways. See FEIS Section 8.4 for	  additional information 	  regarding 	  funding.	  The west side bypass in Moscow may be similar to the Ring Road	  concept being proposed. The Ring Road	  project is a separate project with	  an	  independent purpose and	  need. ITD will continue to	  coordinate with	  the City of Moscow so that the design of this project will not preclude the Ring Road	  concept.  E-‐77  Carolyn  Hovde Bohach  To whom it may concern: I	  am 	  a 	  long 	  time 	  resident 	  of 	  Moscow.

C-‐3	  is the most fiscally responsible because it results in ONE highway for	  us to maintain. The E-‐2	  Eastern Alternative creates a	  completely NEW road, so that we will have TWO roads	  to maintain……(one by the state and	  one by Latah	  county). 2. C-‐3	  is safest because it will improve a	  dangerous 2-‐lane 	  highway.	  The 	  E-‐2	  Eastern Alternative will leave 	  this 	  dangerous 	  road 	  in 	  place 	  and 	  it 	  will	  be 	  used by many people who	  will find	  access to	  the 2 lane highway the easiest, due to	  their location. 3. C-‐3	  will result in the least nose and light pollution for	  Moscow. 4. C-‐3	  is the most convenient because it has the most access for people to use the road. The E-‐2	  Eastern Alternative has only one access point. 5. C-‐3	  would likely be chosen as the best alternative if 	  ALL 	  THE 	  FACTS 	  were 	  carefully 	  checked 	  and reported. ITD favors E-‐2, but their conclusion is based	  on	  some incorrect information	  about the number of businesses and residents that would be	  displaced	  by C-‐3. 6. C-‐3	  will result in people who have a	  business or a home on	  a highway…..continuing to	  have a home or a	  business on a	  highway.

Regarding the fewer access points for the E-‐2	  Alternative, E-‐2	  would have two access points, one at each point where	  it connects to existing	  US-‐95.

We live on	  the south	  side of Moscow where we will see any route you choose coming in to town.

The  FHWA and ITD must balance	  both the	  human and natural environmental impacts with	  the safety benefit for	  the general public.

The E-‐2	  Alternative was identified as FHWA’s and ITD’s Preferred Alternative	  because	  it balances the	  human and natural environmental effects with the	  best safety  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  road is too curvy, narrow and the intersections with other roads are poorly designed	  and	  dangerous due to poor	  visibility and no acceleration or	  turn lanes. Of the four alternatives: Do Nothing, W4, C3, and E2, I	  strongly 	  favor 	  C3. 	  I	  am 	  strongly 	  opposed 	  to 	  the 	  E2 alternative	  and I don’t think the	  “Do Nothing” or the	  W4 options are going to go anywhere. I	  don’t 	  agree 	  with 	  most 	  of 	  the 	  talking 	  points 	  given 	  by ITD 	  supporting 	  the 	  E2 	  alternative. 	  I	  feel	  like 	  it 	  is 	  the favored option because it	  will be easier	  for	  ITD to build	  because there will be less traffic to	  deal with, and because	  they have	  had their minds set on that route from the very beginning, but	  in the long run I don’t feel like it will be the better route. As a local resident	  in the Moscow area, I would prefer	  to see the highway stay as close to it’s current	  location as possible. I would	  have preferred	  the old	  C1 route, but the next best option	  I think is the C3 route. One of the main disagreements I have with the E2 route is the way the safety was calculated. It does not take into	  account the fact that the old	  road	  will still be	  used by most of the	  local residents because	  there will be no access points to conveniently get	  on the new highway, therefore forcing the local residents to still use the old road. The old road is not	  likely 	  to 	  get 	  fixed 	  and 	  made 	  any 	  safer, 	  and 	  there 	  will likely 	  be 	  less 	  snow 	  removal	  and 	  maintenance 	  than there currently is. Therefore the accident	  rate for	  the local residents will likely go up and those accidents are	  not included in the	  E2	  safety prediction. The C3 route allows access to	  more local residents giving	  them a	  safer route. I feel the	  E2  benefit for the public. It was not identified	  as the Preferred Alternative	  due	  to political, developer or personal gain. FHWA and ITD have	  been transparent throughout the	  EIS	  process from early scoping through the FEIS	  development. This has included	  holding open	  house meetings, breakfast meetings, posting information on the website, working with citizen advisory groups, agencies, sending	  out newsletters, and conducting	  other public involvement activities as described	  in	  the FEIS. Chapter 10. FHWA and ITD have	  presented alternatives that balance	  the	  needs of the	  public with protection	  of natural resources. The Safety Analysis was revised in response to public comment and considers	  safety of the existing US-‐95	  loop;	  however 	  the 	  relative 	  findings 	  stated in the	  DEIS	  remain valid. See General Response Safety-‐3	  regarding how the safety of existing US-‐95	  was considered in the Revised	  Safety Analysis (ITD 2013). See	  General Response	  Maintenance-‐1	  and Maintenance-‐2	  regarding maintenance of the US-‐95	  loop. While the C-‐3	  Alternative would provide more convenient access	  for those along its	  route, those access points contribute	  to higher predicted crashes. Access, mobility and	  travel user costs are further evaluated in the	  FEIS	  Section 4.10 and in the	  Mobility and Road User Cost Study (ITD, 2014a). General Response Access provides updated	  information	  regarding Access Control for	  the action alternatives. While the C-‐3	  Alternative would have less environmental impact for some	  resources, the	  E-‐2	   #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  route is only safer	  because access is denied to the local	  residents, 	  forcing 	  them 	  to 	  go 	  around 	  the 	  new highway, and	  not use it at all, and	  instead	  use a dangerous route. Where is the safety improvement in 	  that? 	  Why aren’t those	  probable	  accidents included 	  in 	  the 	  E2 	  route’s 	  safety 	  predictions? 	  It 	  is easy to make	  the	  E2 route	  look safer by making	  it difficult for locals to	  drive on	  it. I	  also 	  favor 	  the 	  C3 	  route 	  over 	  the 	  E2 	  route 	  for 	  a number of environmental reasons. C3 has less impact 	  on 	  wetlands, 	  ungulate habitat, pine stands, and especially Palouse	  Prairie remnants. I really care about this. I think the	  C3	  route; using	  more	  existing	  road location would have less environmental	  impact than a totally new road. The E2 route would disturb more wet lands, introduce more weeds to the fragile and threatened Palouse	  Prairie	  remnants, and possibly dig up	  Palouse Giant Earthworms, a poorly studied rare species. It would go closer to deer,	  elk and moose habitat increasing the likely hood	  of collisions	  with them, especially	  in the fog. I	  also 	  think 	  that 	  seeing 	  the 	  highway 	  up 	  on 	  Paradise Ridge would be very offensive to look at. Moscow is a	  beautiful place	  to live	  and I think that would have	  a	  very	  negative effect on the appearance of our community. I understand, from a highway	  engineer’s	  perspective, that may not be a negative effect, but to me it	  is. I	  would 	  prefer 	  to 	  impact 	  as	  little land as	  possible to fix the highway. Once a road goes in, it	  does not	  go away. The	  E2	  route	  is almost all new road, whereas the C3 route uses a lot	  more existing road. I think  Alternative would	  not affect any critical or high	  quality ungulate habitat, nor would	  it directly affect any Palouse	  remnants. See	  General Response	  Weeds and Wildlife regarding Palouse remnants and Paradise Ridge.	  Additional	  information regarding the occurrences of Giant Palouse earthworms and	  potential impacts to	  them have been added to the FEIS Sections 3.8 and 4.8. See	  General Response	  Safety-‐2	  regarding wildlife collisions. Regarding the view of the highway on	  Paradise Ridge,	  the E-‐2	  Alternative would not be on Paradise Ridge but would be lower in elevation along its base. See FEIS Section 4.11	  for additional information regarding visual effects of the	  alternatives. General Response Weather-‐2	  addresses the five-‐month data set and	  how it relates to	  the larger 30+-‐year data set. General Response Weather-‐8	  addresses the validity of the Weather Analyses. See General Response Weather-‐3, Weather-‐4	  and Weather-‐5	  regarding elevation, ice, snow, fog, and other	  weather	  conditions. The increased access and the five-‐lane 	  section 	  at 	  the northern	  end	  of the project could	  result in	  more accidents, congestion and possible	  strip development in that	  area and therefore is not	  preferred by the City of	  Moscow. See the additional information and clarification in FEIS Section 4.1. See	  General Response	  Safety-‐3	  regarding how safety of the existing US-‐95	  is considered in the Revised Safety Analysis (ITD 2013). The alternatives would have Expressway Access	  Control, which would restrict any new	  accesses onto US-‐95	  as described	  in	  General Response Access. The amount of  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  that	  is a strong point	  in favor	  of	  the C3 route. Impacting 	  less 	  undisturbed land means less new right	  of	  way, less farmland taken permanently out	  of	  production, less new environmental damage, and	  less 	  disruption 	  to 	  existing 	  residents 	  and 	  businesses.	  Businesses and	  residents that are currently 	  next 	  to Highway 95 have been expecting the expansion of the road for	  a long, long time. To move the highway to a totally new location and reroute it	  into town from a different	  direction does not	  make much sense to me. The City of Moscow favors the C3	  route too. It goes better with	  their land	  use goals and	  plans for a future ring road. I	  feel	  the 	  weather 	  section 	  of 	  the 	  environmental	  impact 	  statement 	  is 	  very 	  flawed.	  I	  live 	  on 	  the shoulder of Paradise Ridge and I drive	  down Eid road every day. There	  is nothing	  you can say to convince	  me that the weather is the same on both the C3 and E2	  routes. It is absurd to even suggest that they are. There is much more wind, fog, snow and ice higher up	  on	  the ridge. I see it every day in	  the winter when I	  drive 	  by. 	  There 	  is 	  an 	  obvious 	  line 	  of 	  snow 	  on paradise ridge and	  the proposed	  E2 location	  is right in 	  that 	  transition 	  zone.	  There 	  is 	  frequently orographic fog that sits on	  the top	  of Paradise ridge all day long	  in the	  winter and it does not exist lower down	  the mountain. I know for a fact that would	  make driving conditions much worse than the current location, no matter what your “weather expert”	  says. I think the	  proposed bridge	  over Eid road would likely be a very windy spot	  and a  impervious 	  surface 	  from 	  both 	  the 	  proposed 	  alternatives and the	  remaining	  US-‐95	  loop road has been added to Section 4.8, Water Resource Effects. For	  clarification, the C-‐3	  and Modified W-‐4	  alternatives 	  would 	  impact 100-‐year floodplain and E-‐2	  Alternative would not impact 	  100-‐year floodplain. See	  General Response	  Displacement-‐1	  for a	  clarification of the residential and	  business impacts. In 	  this 	  section 	  of 	  roadway,	  turning 	  movements contribute to the highest number of accidents. Increasing 	  assesses 	  and 	  approaches 	  onto 	  US-‐95	  would introduce 	  additional	  safety risks even with turn lanes and modified approaches. Access points along winding and hilly topography reduce	  sight distance	  and create	  safety risks; therefore, the grades	  and curvatures	  of the alignments were	  improved and access points were	  limited 	  to 	  create 	  the 	  safest 	  route.	  See	  General Response	  Safety-‐6	  regarding the significance in difference of the length and safety between	  alternatives.  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  particular hazard to vehicles with a	  lot of surface	  area	  like	  tractor trailers and buses. I’d hate	  to see	  a	  school bus	  get blown off the bridge. The weather data used	  on	  the DEIS was completely inadequate. They only used from January to May 2005, an unusually mild	  winter!	  What	  about	  Nov. and Dec.? Some	  of the	  nastiest storms occur during these	  months. I suppose you probably chose that time period	  to	  demonstrate that the weather will be the same. Why didn’t it get information from a 10 year average?	  Another problem I have	  with the	  E2 route	  is that ITD claims	  that it will be safer because there are fewer locations 	  for 	  traffic 	  to 	  get 	  on 	  and 	  off 	  the 	  highway.	  Despite my feelings that it is wrong to deny access to the local residents in order	  to improve the appearance	  of a	  safer road while	  making	  the	  local residents travel on an unsafe road, I don’t	  know that	  this “unblemished” road can remain “on-‐ramp free”. I	  have 	  gotten 	  conflicting 	  answers 	  when 	  I	  ask 	  ITD people if new access points can	  be added	  after the highway is built. If an adjacent landowner wants to put in	  a sub-‐division, or gas station, or some other type of	  business can ITD really stop them? I have gotten yes and no answers on this question. If ITD cannot stop new access	  to the highway, then the E2 route is not	  really as safe	  as it is predicted to be, and is 	  only 	  encouraging 	  urban 	  sprawl.	  I	  think 	  the highway should	  stay about where it is now. Then	  you know what you have to deal with. As far as the issue of reducing access points to	  improve 	  safety,	  it 	  seems to me that properly  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  designed	  access points with	  good	  visibility, acceleration lanes, turn lanes, and possibly frontage	  roads where needed is very safe. It	  works fine by Genesee, Thorn Creek and all the	  other locations on the new section 	  on 	  95 	  where 	  you 	  allowed 	  access 	  on that	  part. In fact	  you allowed quite a few access points on	  that section, why the change on	  this section? I don’t think a few access	  points	  would be a bad	  thing. It seems to	  me like the small number of access points on the E2 route is ITD’s strongest	  argument for that route, but I don’t think that is a	  good enough argument to make	  it the	  favored option. In	  fact I think it is a distinct disadvantage. The E2	  route is less than 1/10th of a	  mile shorter than the C3. That	  is	  pretty insignificant. The costs	  are	  very similar, and the	  resident displacements are	  similar. But the environmental impacts	  are worse for E2, and I fear the safety of E2 is worse. The weather on	  E2 will be worse, the appearance of the highway from town will be worse. I really don’t	  see the attraction to the	  E2	  route. Here are the talking points ITD	  uses to support the E2	  route and my comments on them: E-‐2	  (Preferred Alternative) E-‐2	  would be aligned east of existing US-‐95	  near the base of Paradise	  Ridge.	  This alternative is 5.85 miles long 	  transitioning 	  to 	  a 	  four-‐lane 	  with 	  center 	  turn lane, 	  curb, 	  gutter 	  and 	  sidewalk 	  for 	  the 	  last 	  0.24 miles at the northern end of the project. The evaluation of effects during	  the	  screening process and the	  detailed analyses presented in this DEIS	  resulted in the lead agencies, FHWA and ITD,  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  identifying 	  the 	  E-‐2	  Alternative as the Preferred Alternative for the following reasons ￿-‐It 	  would 	  have 	  the 	  greatest 	  safety improvement 	  	  (I	  disagree with	  this because it does not take into	  account the	  local residents having	  to use	  the	  old road because they are denied access to the new highway, and	  because of the weather being worse in	  the higher	  elevation.) •	  It would have the fewest access points (I think this is 	  a 	  disadvantage.	  What 	  is 	  the 	  point 	  of 	  building 	  a new road	  that the local residents can’t use?) •	  It would have the shortest length with the shortest travel time (shorter	  by less than 1/10 of	  a mile, less than 6 seconds faster) •	  It would the least effect to streams (Both C3	  and E2	  have 5	  stream tributary crossings, but E2	  would effect twice	  the	  acreage	  of wetlands and two wells, not to	  mention	  the fact that it will increase	  the	  amount of impervious surface	  due	  to the	  additional pavement of a second	  road.) •	  It would have better weather conditions for driving than W-‐4. (But not better than C3) •	  It would avoid effects to cultural/Section 4(f) resources, floodplains and business Displacements (so do the others) •	  It would best meet the project purpose and need. (I disagree because of	  the above comments) The primary disadvantages of E-‐2	  compared to the other alternatives are that it would	  be located	  closer to the base of	  Paradise Ridge which provides moderate ungulate habitat and	  E-‐2	  would also affect pine stands that are potential long-‐eared myotis,  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  northern	  alligator lizard	  and	  pygmy nuthatch habitat. (As well as the detrimental effects to	  Palouse	  Prairie remnants, possible encounters with Palouse	  Giant Earthworm, the	  fact that IF&G specifically recommended against E2 because of it’s	  effect on wildlife, 	  and 	  the 	  ugly 	  scar 	  across 	  Paradise ridge that	  would be visible from Moscow, the large amount of farmland taken out	  of	  use, just	  more paved	  road	  surface in	  general.) Here are the ITD	  comments on the C3 route and my comments	  on them: C-‐3:	  The 	  C-‐3	  alignment would run closest to the current highway	  near the center of the corridor. (I think that	  is a very good thing.) This alternative is 5.94	  miles long transitioning to a	  four-‐lane 	  with 	  center 	  turn 	  lane, 	  curb, 	  gutter 	  and sidewalk for the last	  1.42 miles at	  the northern end of the project. (It will blend	  in	  better as you	  come into 	  town 	  and 	  not 	  look 	  like 	  the 	  highway 	  was 	  an afterthought.) It 	  would 	  have 	  the 	  highest 	  crash 	  rate 	  of 	  the 	  Action Alternatives. (I don’t believe that is accurate since it does not take into	  account the local residents crash	  predictions on	  the old	  highway location	  or the inaccurate 	  weather 	  data.) It 	  would 	  require 	  the 	  least 	  amount 	  of 	  new 	  right-‐ofway compared to W-‐4	  and E-‐2	  because it would utilize some of the existing roadway. (This is good) C-‐3	  would have the greatest adverse effect to residences, businesses,	  and 	  would 	  encroach 	  on 	  the greatest number of hazardous material sites. (These	  residences and businesses are already near	  the  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  highway, some of them because they want to	  be. It may be better for the businesses. Maybe the hazardous material sites would	  get cleaned	  up.) It 	  would 	  have 	  the 	  longest 	  urban 	  section 	  that 	  would operate at a LOS B. (better for businesses) C-‐3	  would have the least wetland	  and	  wildlife species effects. (That’s good)	  Similar to E-‐2, C-‐3	  would have the fewest tributary crossings	  but would affect three times	  more linear feet	  of	  tributary channel compared to the E-‐2	  (but less 	  effected 	  wetlands, less 	  total	  impermeable 	  paved surface, and better for wildlife) Alternative. Also, similar to	  E-‐2, C-‐3	  would avoid cultural/Section 4(f) resource effects. (they	  all do) In 	  conclusion,	  I	  think 	  the 	  C3 	  route 	  is 	  by 	  far 	  the 	  better route. I think IDT manipulated	  the facts to	  make the E2	  route look better because that is the route they prefer to	  build. I think the C3 route is safer, better serves	  the public, is	  more aesthetically pleasing, and is 	  less 	  harmful	  to 	  wildlife, 	  Palouse 	  Prairie,	  wet lands, and host of other environmental aspects. I think the	  E2	  route would be an ugly scar across the landscape, not nearly as safe as predicted, and	  would	  not serve the public very well.

The Ring Road concept is discussed and clarified in the FEIS	  Sections ES	  9, 3.2.3, and 4.2. Based on discussions with City staff as part of the Community Impact	  Assessment update (2011), a final detailed	  Ring Road	  alignment had not been identified and funding had	  not been	  allocated	  or secured	  to	  finance the project. The US 95	  Thorncreek Road to Moscow project	  satisfies an identified 	  purpose 	  and 	  need 	  for 	  improved 	  highway safety and capacity independent of the	  Ring	  Road Project.

As a hard	  working American who travels that	  highway every day for	  work, I must say that I think it is in the best interest for	  the IDT to make the new project	  as straight	  as possible.

General Response Alternative describes why FHWA	  and	  ITD identified	  the E-‐2	  Alternative as the Preferred	  Alternative. The information 	  stated 	  is 	  consistent 	  with information presented	  in	  the DEIS with	  the following clarifications: All of the action	  alternatives would	  result in	  a safety benefit over the No	  Action	  Alternative. In	  response to	  public comment, the Safety Analysis was revised	  and	  includes the	  existing	  US-‐95	  loop as explained in General Response Safety-‐3. See	  General Response	  Safety-‐6	  regarding the significance of the differences	  in lengths	  and safety between	  alternatives. This includes consideration	  of the existing	  US-‐95 section that would be turned over to the NLHD. Repair of the existing US-‐95	  loop is addressed in  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  Highway 95, Thorncreek Road to Moscow Project. We agree with ITD’s stated purpose to improve safety along	  what is now a	  6.34-‐mile stretch, but strongly disfavor ITD’s	  preferred alternative— preferring instead the C-‐3	  route—for	  the following reasons, related to the points enumerated on page 15	  of the DEIS. Safety.	  According to the DEIS (p.113), between 2002 and 2011, 40% of accidents within designated high accident areas were	  attributed to curves in the	  project area that have substandard	  geometry and	  narrower than	  standard	  shoulders. Between	  2002 and 2011, approximately 40	  percent of the	  accidents in 	  the 	  project 	  area 	  occurred 	  while 	  a 	  driver 	  was negotiating a curve. The predictive analysis seems to	  assume	  few	  if any changes to crash statistics along the existing central route, which certainly would not	  be the case if C-‐3	  were selected. (On a	  highway tour, probably eight or more years ago, an	  ITD employee standing on the tailgate of his	  pickup told a group of us that regardless of which	  route might be selected—including 	  the 	  current 	  alignment—ITD would make it safe.) The DEIS also neglects to point out that if the central route were abandoned	  in	  favor	  of	  E-‐2, and North Latah Highway District were to assume responsibility, the present deficiencies— including 	  the 	  most 	  dangerous 	  sections—would remain hazards for	  the traveling public, unless or	  until the District secured	  funding to correct	  deficiencies in	  engineering and	  deferred	  maintenance, and posted	  signs to	  reduce speeds. According to	  page 174 of the document, relative  General Response Maintenance-‐2. See	  General Response	  Safety-‐4	  regarding making smaller improvements	  along the existing US-‐95	  alignment. See	  General Response Safety-‐1	  regarding the adding a	  frontage road to the C-‐3	  Alternative. The action alternatives would have Expressway Access Control as described	  in	  General Response Access. Mitigation for impacts to resources including streams, wetland, and wildlife is 	  described 	  in 	  the 	  FEIS 	  Chapter 	  9, Environmental Commitments. The Paradise Ridge Challenge Course has been	  added	  to	  the map	  in	  the FEIS Section 3.1. See	  Displacement-‐1	  for clarification of the displaced and impacted 	  residences 	  and	  businesses.	  Displaced noise receptors are clarified in the FEIS Section 4.12. See	  General Response	  Weather-‐1, Weather-‐2, Weather3, Weather-‐4	  regarding the weather analysis data, elevation, temperature, snow, fog, wind and other weather related driving conditions. Regarding noise impacts 	  to 	  future 	  development, 	  ITD cannot predict what the future development will be however; the results from the Noise Analysis will be provided	  to	  the jurisdictions for their	  planning purposes. The E-‐2	  Alternative would not have any construction on Palouse	  remnants. See	  Weeds and Wildlife	  regarding the effects to Palouse remnants and Paradise Ridge.	  While E-‐2	  does impact CRP	  lands, enrollment of land	  in	  the in the CRP program is voluntary, temporary and with no assurance of CRP land remaining undeveloped in 	  the 	  future.	  	  Landowners 	  can 	  determine 	  whether 	  to  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  safety of C-‐3	  would be detrimentally affected by higher crash	  rates associated	  with	  1.42 miles of proposed	  four-‐lane 	  with 	  center 	  turn 	  lane 	  (like 	  WADOT’s Moscow-‐Pullman	  Highway 270, albeit with	  a slower 45mph speed limit), compared to just 0.24 miles for E-‐2, which would consist of mostly the four-‐lane 	  divided 	  highway 	  with 	  a 	  65mph 	  speed.	  It seems	  realistic	  that slower speeds	  along C-‐3	  would result	  in less severe accidents, and that	  providing for	  frontage road access and combining or	  closing existing	  driveways could reduce	  the	  number of intersections, 	  and 	  call	  for 	  shortening 	  the 	  urban section at the north end of this	  project, and substituting strategically-‐located 	  intermittent	  turning bays, thereby reducing costs as well as the potential for accidents. For those reasons, a modified version of C-‐3	  is our preferred alternative. Access.	  According to the DEIS (p.37), limited access control would be applied to the highway, and existing	  approaches would be	  allowed to remain at locations 	  where 	  construction 	  of 	  joint 	  access 	  is 	  not economically justified. The	  assumption that future	  policymakers will limit access points (p. 15) any more than previous policymakers have is flawed. The reason E-‐2	  doesn’t have as many points of conflict (22, compared to 47 for C-‐3) is that it hasn’t been	  built. Realistically, new roads attract development, just as the existing route has, and	  as predicted	  on	  page 143 of the DEIS. The C-‐3	  route could have a shortened 5-‐lane 	  urban 	  section, modified with limited access, turning lanes, etc. Effect on streams.	  C-‐3	  and E-‐2	  would each have five  leave 	  lands 	  in 	  CRP 	  or 	  to 	  withdraw 	  them.	  	  Design visualizations from Moscow toward the proposed	  alignments are	  included in the	  Community Impact 	  Assessment 	  (HDR 	  2006) 	  Appendix 	  B 	  and additional information was added to the	  FEIS	  Section 4.11. Effects to the giant Palouse earthworm were considered as stated in the	  FEIS	  Section 3.8	  and 4.8	  and in the	  General Wildlife	  Assessment (IDFG, 2006). Updated information 	  regarding 	  recent 	  occurrences 	  and 	  habitat information 	  has 	  been 	  added 	  to 	  the 	  FEIS 	  Section 	  3.8.	  Regarding the cultural resource surveys, the reports state that there is	  a low to moderate probability of encountering	  prehistoric sites, and the	  shovel testing	  was placed based in part by the results of the probability study. The shovel testing was not sporadically done but was	  intentionally conducted near sites	  near the alignments	  where there would be the	  highest probabilities of native American	  use, such	  as near streams, camas fields and	  hunting grounds. The Nez Perce Tribe was also consulted during the EIS process as described	  in	  the DEIS Chapter 7. Additional detail regarding the methodology of the archaeological surveys	  and the findings	  has	  been added to the FEIS Section 3.4; however, shovel testing is an acceptable	  method for field investigation. Field inspectors will be on-‐site during construction to identify cultural resources during soil disturbing activities in	  high	  probability areas for	  Native American sites.  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  tributary crossings, with C-‐3	  affecting more linear feet	  of	  tributary channel (p.153). Compensatory mitigation with replacement of affected flows and functions of	  the tributaries will be vitally important, as with any modern road construction project. Effects on cultural resources,	  businesses,	  and floodplains. “The	  C-‐3	  Alternative…had no adverse effects to historic resources and had the	  least wetland, cultural and visual effects compared to the	  other central corridor alternatives” (p. 45). According to	  the DEIS, C-‐3	  would	  displace 7 residential units and 8 businesses, while W-‐2	  would displace 5 residences and	  no	  businesses (p. 53), however references to	  “impacts” and	  “displacement”	  are	  inconsistent and misleading. Page	  154	  suggests that acquisition of right-‐of-‐way and removal of access are	  considered equivalents to displacement, even	  if mitigation	  could	  include providing alternate access. C-‐3	  is believed by business owners to	  have the least indirect effects because the access would	  be similar to	  what exists, although it would be	  changed to a	  limited access facility (p.204). Traffic would continue to pass by the existing	  businesses, which would encourage	  businesses to	  stay or locate in	  the area (p.204). W-‐4	  and E-‐2	  would have greater effects to visibility and access to existing	  businesses; however; they could also potentially encourage	  growth in the	  area	  (p.204). Page 16 inaccurately indicates the C-‐3	  “would have	  the	  highest business and residential displacements (eight businesses and seven homes),” when as pointed out elsewhere in the document,  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  most of those would be “impacted” in some unspecified	  way/s. Realistically, at least in	  some cases, impacts	  of the project could be advantageous, increasing 	  visibility 	  of 	  businesses, 	  justifying	  frontage road access, or	  compensating the property owner	  to facilitate relocation to an even more desirable site. (Page 14 indicates that	  noise impacts 	  of 	  C-‐3	  would cause one receptor to be displaced, while E-‐2, with the “highest noise impacts of the action	  alternatives” (p.15) would result in displacement of 5	  of 7	  receptors.) Regarding businesses that would be adversely impacted	  by E-‐2, I pointed out to the person	  attending the table at ITD’s public hearing on	  January 23	  that the Paradise Ridge Challenge Course (and corporate retreat	  meeting and events center)	  didn’t even	  appear on	  his map	  of businesses. I even	  introduced 	  him 	  to 	  Keith 	  Haley 	  who 	  owns 	  that business, but neither of us came away with the sense that it mattered, and I saw no evidence that the fellow was planning to add it	  to ITD’s database for	  this project. Length and travel time. The distance differential between	  C-‐3	  (5.94	  miles) and E-‐2	  (5.85	  miles) is negligible (p.37). Nine one-‐hundredths of a mile is a mere 158 yards…hardly a strong argument for preferring E-‐2, particularly when weather conditions at that higher, more	  exposed elevation could impede 	  traffic 	  in 	  winter 	  weather 	  conditions 	  that residents in that	  vicinity report. Weather.	  Measurements for E-‐2	  were documented for	  an uncharacteristically dry and mild season in 2005. Logic and local experience suggest that the  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  higher elevation	  of E-‐2would expose drivers, especially in high-‐profile vehicles, to	  more wind, snow, drifting, fog, and other potentially hazardous weather conditions. Weather conditions for C-‐3	  do not appear to	  have been	  characterized	  in	  this document. Purpose	  and need.	  It depends on whose.	  The stated purpose of this project is to	  improve public safety and increase	  highway capacity on US-‐95	  south of Moscow between Thorncreek Road (MP 337.67)	  and the South Fork Palouse River Bridge (MP 344.00) (p.24). The stated need is that	  “US-‐95	  is part of the National Highway System (NHS)	  and is a North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) route spanning the United States	  from Canada to Mexico. Within Idaho, US-‐95	  is classified as a	  principal arterial, providing	  the	  only continuous north-‐south highway connection	  between	  the Idaho	  Panhandle and the	  rest of the	  state. It supports multiple	  local uses, including primary access to	  agricultural, residential, commercial and industrial land located directly adjacent to	  the highway. Within	  the City of Moscow, US-‐95	  connects	  with SH-‐8	  which is a	  major east-‐west highway. The US-‐95	  Thorncreek to Moscow project is included in the approved Idaho Transportation Investment Program (ITIP) (ITD 2011a)” (p.26). Allegedly, “(t)hese benefits would consist of improved safety, and increased capacity to accommodate	  current and future	  traffic demand” (p.193). We certainly support	  the purpose of	  safety, but think that C-‐3	  would be safer than E-‐2. Turning historic downtown	  Moscow into	  an	  increasingly busy  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  industrial	  through-‐route doesn’t	  seem beneficial to	  the livability, desirability, or	  economic well-‐being of our community, including our pursuit of mixed-‐use zoning,	  to 	  blend 	  retail,	  office,	  residential,	  and entertainment uses together, but none	  of the	  alternatives include	  a	  bypass, which	  we would	  like to	  see included (and funded). Additional reasons we prefer C-‐3	  over ITD’s preferred	  alternative include the following: Farmland.	  C-‐3	  would take up about half of the prime farmland as would E-‐2	  (25.1	  acres, compared	  to	  50.8 for	  W-‐2	  and 46.7	  for W-‐4). C-‐3	  would take up the least 	  amount 	  of 	  wetlands 	  (0.99 	  acres, 	  compared 	  to 3.61	  for W-‐2	  and 5.45	  for W-‐4) (p.147). The C-‐3	  Corridor has the fewest acres of prime and	  statewide important farmland. Approximately 8.8 percent of the land	  in	  this assessment unit is in	  CRP and planted with grasses. The	  C-‐3	  Alternative would convert the least acres	  of prime farmland and farmland of	  statewide importance to other	  uses. The C-‐3	  Alternative would utilize more existing right-‐ofway and would convert the	  least amount of farmland to other	  uses. E-‐2	  would affect slightly more prime farmland than the other Action Alternatives. 27.7 percent of the land	  in	  the assessment unit is CRP	  land, primarily in the	  southern end of the corridor. However, the E-‐2	  Alternative would	  affect the greatest acres of actively farmed land even after the	  CRP	  land is subtracted. E-‐2	  would affect approximately twice as much CRP land compared to the other alternatives. Land acquisition.	  C-‐3	  would take up less land for	   #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  additional right-‐of-‐way (154 acres)	  than E-‐2	  (207	  acres) (p. 53). Visual impacts.	  pp.	  181-‐182. Interesting discussion of visual effects of E-‐2, seemingly focusing on the perspective of the motorist entering	  Moscow from the south, rather	  than of	  a resident	  or	  visitor	  observing Paradise Ridge from town: The project	  would cause a high effect to residential viewpoints…Effects would be the result of grading, exposed soils, erosion, and unnatural slopes. The	  addition of a	  new highway, structures, development and vegetation removal would also potentially affect the visual quality…Continued development	  on Paradise	  Ridge	  would further degrade	  visual quality for	  residential viewpoints. Future transmission lines may potentially follow the alternatives’ alignment to facilitate access and to consolidate impacts into a single corridor. This	  may further contribute to the additional contrast in the	  existing	  natural landscape	  (p. 217). Page 15 notes that	  visual impacts to Moscow residents were listed among specific concerns	  and controversy, however no virtual images 	  were 	  presented 	  to 	  demonstrate 	  what development of E-‐2	  might look like from the Moscow side. Ironically, references have been made to motorists’ views from	  the highway approach into Moscow from the south and the prospect of a scenic highway on	  Paradise Ridge. Noise.	  The noise impacts 	  were 	  based 	  on 	  disruption of present conditions, not on	  the desirability of developing in	  the	  vicinity of any of the	  routes in the	  future, and were inexplicably deemed outside of	   #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  project scope. (Page 14 indicates that noise impacts of C-‐3	  would cause one receptor to be displaced, while E-‐2, with the “highest noise impacts of the action alternatives”	  (p.15) would result in displacement of 5 of 7 receptors.) Habitat.	  E-‐2	  would have a	  significant and immediate detrimental effect on	  remnants of the endangered	  Palouse	  Prairie ecosystem, and what pieces were	  not wiped	  out immediately by construction would be threatened	  by introduction	  and	  widespread	  distribution	  of invasive weeds. Chapter 1 of the City of Moscow’s Comprehensive Plan	  (1.4.2) advises, “Promote	  the	  conservation of valuable	  agricultural lands 	  and 	  Moscow’s 	  surrounding rural landscape…Promote 	  the 	  protection 	  of 	  the 	  remaining areas of Palouse	  Prairie.” The	  E-‐2	  route is in conflict with those community values. Also, we believe that the Giant	  Palouse Earthworm also warrants consideration, listed or not. Livability/desirability of	  place.	  Few people choose to live 	  along 	  busy 	  highways.	  They 	  are 	  noisy, 	  fumeproducing, and	  dangerous. If E-‐2	  were selected, industrial	  use 	  and 	  large-‐scale commercial development might occur in	  sprawled	  and	  linear fashion, but	  would almost	  certainly have	  a	  detrimental effect on	  residential property values in	  the vicinity of	  that	  new section of	  roadway, while the abandoned section of	  the existing route would probably not be any more sought-‐after for residential purposes than it	  is now. The cultural resource inventory seems inconsistent with the literature review.	  The predominant focus is  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  on	  historic structures, and	  the significance of thousands of	  years of	  intermittent	  activity by indigenous 	  people 	  seems 	  minimized.	  According 	  to the results of	  the technical report on all cultural resources,	  recorded 	  and 	  pre-‐recorded, in/abutting the project	  area “Seventeen historical properties— nine farms, four residences, one residence/commercial property, one historical trash scatter, one historical monument/trash scatter, and a	  road—were identified within the project area of potential effect (APE), that is, within	  75 m (250 ft) of the W-‐4, C-‐3, and E-‐2	  alignment centerlines, or immediately 	  adjacent 	  to 	  this 	  area 	  (see 	  Figure 	  2a 	  and Appendix A).” The draft does acknowledge that “Despite	  the	  influx	  of Euro-‐Americans, Native American	  people continued	  to	  return	  to	  the Palouse highlands during this period	  for root harvests and	  other traditional activities” (p.4), but the proposed	  solution to uncovering	  prehistoric artifacts is, “In the	  event that previously unidentified cultural resources are	  unearthed during	  project activities, work should be halted	  in	  the immediate vicinity of the find	  and	  a qualified	  archaeologist contacted	  to	  assess the significance	  of the	  resource.”	  (Cultural Resources Technical Report p. 8, RE	  survey done in August). Ironically,	  the 	  likelihood 	  of 	  making 	  such 	  an observation	  from behind	  the controls of huge excavation equipment is not very probable, and the	  amount of destruction of a	  site	  that could occur under those circumstances is substantial. No effects on cultural resources were identified for either C-‐3	  of E-‐2	  (p. 147) however the Archaeological  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  and Historic Survey Report (p.1) indicates that “Cultural	  resources 	  may 	  be 	  expected 	  along transportation corridors, near	  water	  sources, and in resource extraction locations (and)	  ethnographic literature 	  notes 	  Native 	  American 	  use 	  of 	  the 	  project vicinity	  for root harvests, travel, and other activities. A	  cultural resources probability study…rates the probability of Native American	  archaeological resources within the current	  APE as low to moderate due to	  the ephemeral nature of prehistoric Native American	  activity in	  the area (however) ethnographers…place	  the	  current project within	  traditional Palouse and Nez Perce territories. Although	  permanent Palouse and	  Nez Perce villages were generally situated along major rivers, rich fields of	  edible camas roots, as well as an abundance of game, made the Palouse uplands a popular gathering	  and hunting	  destination… Local Native	  American	  peoples occupied	  temporary camps during seasonal resource collection trips. Although upland campsites	  are rarely	  mentioned in ethnographic	  literature, 	  a 	  Palouse 	  camas-‐digging camp	  was noted	  in June 1855 along the South Fork of	  the Palouse River, several miles west of the current project…and	  a	  large	  Nez Perce	  camp was reported north of the	  project near the previously mentioned	  root ground.” It 	  seems 	  to 	  us 	  that 	  the 	  C-‐3	  corridor has already been disrupted by the existing highway, and that E-‐2	  is less 	  so 	  It 	  would 	  seem 	  that 	  hunters 	  and 	  gatherers would be more likely to have camped—particularly if they had (pawing, defecating)	  horses—at an elevation above	  where	  they were	  digging	  for root  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  crops, and that	  hunting camps were more likely to be nearer the ungulate habitat at the higher elevations.

Clearly, this is an emotionally charged issue. But I believe the Draft Environmental Impact Statement is inappropriately named. Mostly, we	  hear how many businesses or houses will be effected and how much will it cost. Mr. MacDonald followed the money. His research led to the trucking industry 	  as 	  the 	  primary 	  force 	  driving 	  the 	  I.T.D.'s preference (E-‐2).

Not at the expense of Public preferences for C3.

US-‐95	  is used for	  local circulation and access, commuters and regional travelers. It	  is also the only north-‐south highway in the Idaho 	  Panhandle 	  and 	  therefore 	  must 	  consider 	  truck traffic and international travel as well. The E-‐2	  Alternative would offer the greatest	  safety benefit as explained	  in	  General Response Safety-‐3.

Please except these comments and include them in the official record. For starters, the	  below online	  petition has to date	  gathered 530 signatures from mostly	  area	  residents who are opposed to ITD's preferred E2	  route for a	  variety	  of reasons: http://signon.org/sign/idahotransportation?source=c.url&r_by=5978043  FHWA and ITD must balance	  both the	  human and natural environmental impacts with	  the safety benefit for	  the general public.

This has included holding open house meetings, breakfast meetings, posting  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  I	  have 	  been 	  following 	  this 	  issue 	  since 	  ITD 	  first proposed	  rerouting 	  Highway 	  95 	  up 	  Paradise 	  Ridge.	  I attended some	  of the	  informational meetings held by ITD back then	  and	  submitted	  comments at that time. I	  am 	  glad 	  that 	  ITD 	  proposed 	  alternative 	  routes 	  in response to the opposition, as it	  seems only	  reasonable to have other	  routes to consider	  and to compare the Paradise Ridge route with. I	  am 	  really 	  hoping 	  ITD 	  will	  consult 	  with 	  Washington State	  to figure	  out how to make	  the	  highway more	  user-‐friendly for	  all residents on the Palouse. It makes sense to me to find a way to tie the highway in 	  with 	  traffic 	  that 	  is 	  traveling 	  to 	  and 	  from 	  our neighbor state, which	  means rerouting the highway to the west. That	  way, truck and other	  traffic not	  intending 	  to 	  stop 	  in 	  Moscow 	  would 	  be 	  able to bypass Moscow instead	  of causing congestion	  in	  the city	  as	  currently	  happens	  and will continue to happen	  if E2 is built. Washington	  may even	  share some of the expense which seems	  fair since some of the traffic that	  utilizes Highway 95 is Washington bound. Why make that traffic drive through	  Moscow, create congestion and potential accidents with pedestrians,	  and 	  cause 	  wear-‐and-‐tear	  on Moscow's roads? Idaho 	  has 	  a 	  backlog 	  of 	  road 	  maintenance 	  needs 	  as explained by Director Brian Ness to the Idaho legislature's 	  Joint 	  Finance-‐Appropriations Committee recently.

FHWA	  and	  ITD have presented	  alternatives that balance the needs of the public with	  protection	  of natural resources. The Preferred Alternative	  was not identified based interest of employees’ relatives or insider manipulation. General Response Alternative describes why FHWA	  and	  ITD identified 	  the 	  E-‐2	  Alternative as the Preferred Alternative. The E-‐2	  Alternative does not go over Paradise Ridge but would be located along its base. The proposed project would tie into the proposed Ring Road concept that is being proposed	  by the City of Moscow; however, there is 	  no 	  definite 	  plan 	  at 	  this 	  time.	  That 	  project 	  has 	  an independent 	  purpose 	  and 	  need 	  and 	  is 	  outside 	  of 	  the scope of this	  project. The consistency with the Ring Road	  is being considered	  during the EIS development. See	  FEIS	  Section 4.2	  Land Use	  and Recreation Effects. See	  General Response	  Weather-‐3	  andWeather-‐4, and Weather-‐5	  regarding elevation, ice, snow accumulation and fog. Geotechnical information will be collected and utilized during the design	  process to	  determine if blasting is necessary if	  an action alternative is selected. See	  General Response	  Maintenance-‐1	  and Maintnenance-‐2	  regarding maintenance of the existing US-‐95	  loop. The E-‐2	  Alternative would not go over Paradise Ridge but would	  be located	  along its base. See Safety-‐2	  and Wildlife regarding wildlife collisions and wildlife habitat  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  fiscally responsible. Other more reasonable approaches would	  be to	  make the current route a 2-‐lane, 	  1-‐way stretch and build	  a new 2-‐lane, 	  1-‐way stretch flowing in the opposite direction	  on	  the western	  proposed	  route, or make the C3 route the preferred	  choice, as paving Paradise	  Ridge is 	  unacceptable 	  for 	  numerous reasons well-‐articulated by others. In 	  regards 	  to 	  E2,	  a 	  primary 	  concern 	  is 	  the 	  number 	  of car encounters	  that will happen with large wildlife, as numerous large	  animals utilize	  Paradise	  Ridge.	  Not only	  will the highway	  interrupt and displace their	  natural forage range, but	  these animals pose a serious	  danger for travelers	  not only in terms	  of potential direct impacts but also	  with	  drivers swerving to avoid hitting them. Since this	  will be a high-‐speed stretch of highway, reaction times	  are minimized and force of impacts is maximized. Couple that with	  potentially more fog, snow and/or icy 	  roads 	  that 	  probably 	  occur 	  at 	  higher 	  elevations and you are	  creating	  a	  recipe	  for repeat disasters if the E2 route is built. Since the proposed	  reroute is intended 	  to 	  solve 	  safety issues, 	  how 	  is 	  building 	  a new highway in	  an	  unsafe area not contradictory? Since	  Paradise	  Ridge is 	  a 	  lot 	  steeper 	  than 	  the 	  lower elevations, it seems a	  lot more work is going to be needed	  in	  order to	  make the terrain	  level enough	  to	  put in	  a wide, 4-‐lane 	  highway.	  Since 	  there 	  is 	  less 	  soil	  and thus more	  exposed and shallower rock, that will require more blasting in order	  to break up the substrate. All that seems	  like it will be more costly than if	  the route chosen were less steep, such as  respectively. General Response Weather-‐2	  addresses the sampling period	  for the weather analysis and	  how it relates to	  the longer 	  30+-‐year data set. See	  General Response	  Displacement-‐1	  for clarification of the residential and	  business impacts. The majority of the businesses in 	  the 	  northern 	  project 	  limits 	  would 	  not be dependent on	  drive by traffic. See	  General Response	  Safety-‐3	  regarding how existing US-‐95	  was considered in the Revised Safety Analysis (ITD 2013). See	  General Response	  Safety-‐4	  regarding making smaller repairs	  on the existing US-‐95	  alignment.  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  where the central and western route could be. I	  am 	  also 	  concerned 	  that 	  ITD's 	  preferred 	  route 	  is partly based	  on	  faulty or incomplete data. For example, the	  weather data	  was taken from one season which was	  a mild season compared to average	  snowfall and temperature	  for this area. Weather data should have been taken over several seasons	  in order to gain a better picture. How can ITD 	  be 	  sure 	  that 	  the 	  E2 	  route 	  experiences 	  less 	  severe	  weather than the other routes based on such limited data, especially when	  logic indicates that higher elevations are	  colder and thus icier, snowier and foggier? Also, from what I understand, the number of displaced	  businesses and homes	  on the C3 route has	  been	  over-‐estimated in the	  DEIS. I understand that there is only one home that	  will have to be removed, whereas the E2 route will displace more. How can people trust that ITD	  is making a wise decision	  if the data used	  to	  justify the preferred	  route is inaccurate? That misinformation should be evaluated and updated	  before a route is chosen. In 	  regards 	  to 	  the 	  businesses on	  the route, they all occur on	  the final, straight stretch	  into	  Moscow. It does not seem necessary to widen that	  part	  of	  the road since this is not	  being done to alleviate congestion. There really	  is	  not that much traffic	  that utilizes the highway. Keep	  that portion	  of the road	  as is and those	  businesses will not be	  impacted. Or put in	  a center lane or a 2-‐lane 	  for 	  one 	  direction 	  by widening that stretch of road to the west so as not n  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  impact 	  those 	  businesses’ 	  property.	  On the other hand, if the highway is rerouted, that means less people are likely to utilize those businesses.	  Why impact 	  them 	  economically 	  by building the highway somewhere else? I	  imagine 	  the 	  money 	  saved 	  by 	  not 	  widening 	  that final stretch could be used to well-‐compensate the one homeowner that would	  lose their home to	  a C3 highway. Lastly, the	  current route	  will still	  be 	  used 	  and 	  remain unsafe if a new 4-‐lane 	  highway 	  is 	  built.	  How 	  does ITD 	  plan 	  to 	  solve 	  the 	  issue 	  that 	  instigated 	  this 	  whole process in	  the first place? Will the current route no	  longer 	  be 	  considered 	  a 	  highway 	  and 	  then 	  become the county's responsibility?	  It 	  has 	  been 	  reported 	  in 	  the 	  Spokesman 	  Review (http://www.spokesmanreview.com/newsstory.asp?date=110802&ID=s1249416) that Bob Clyde, one of the landowners who	  will sell his marginal land to ITD if the E2 route is built, has a family member	  who worked for	  ITD to help craft	  the E2	  route. While that charge may be false, just the perception	  that there is nepotism involved	  with	  the decision	  taints it. Add	  that to	  all the reasons not to	  build	  on	  Paradise Ridge plus the reasons to	  build	  elsewhere, 	  and 	  it 	  looks 	  like 	  ITD 	  is 	  more 	  interested 	  in helping out special interests instead	  of the greater community	  that will forever be impacted by	  a bad decision. It 	  is 	  understandable 	  why 	  people 	  look 	  out 	  for 	  people they know. It	  is also only natural to not want to	  be told that	  an initial decision is bad and thus react	  by  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  becoming stubborn	  in	  refusing to	  change. I urge you, though, to see this from a bigger	  perspective and through the eyes of	  those who question the decision. Issues like this should	  not be	  decided by a	  small group of people, especially if those people do not actually live in	  the area. It really does take a lot of people, particularly ones who	  live in	  the area, to	  add ideas into the	  process to insure	  that the	  best decision	  is made. That should	  be done because it is the right	  thing to do, not	  because a court	  orders it. There is no reason for ITD to create controversy by paving Paradise Ridge when better alternatives are available. While	  it is a	  good idea	  to not rush into any major decision like this, the highway probably would have already been	  built by now if ITD had	  chosen	  the more logical central or western route at the very beginning. If 	  ITD 	  chooses 	  E2 	  again,	  there 	  surely 	  will	  be 	  lawsuits and further stalling. It is	  only reasonable for ITD to take the "high-‐road", accept	  that	  the initial decision was based on incomplete data and choose one of the other	  routes. It 	  seems 	  better 	  to 	  modify 	  the 	  current 	  route,	  solve the safety issues, 	  save 	  money 	  and 	  protect	  Paradise Ridge.

I feel the IDT has done an exceptional job in collecting and compiling	  the	  data	  needed to make	  a	  well informed 	  decision 	  regarding realignment of Highway 95. In my opinion more than enough time and expense	  has been devoted to gathering	  enough information 	  to 	  make 	  an 	  informed 	  decision.	  I	  have 	  lived 	  in 	  Moscow 	  since 	  1979 	  after 	  graduating from college because I love the area and surrounding landscape. I can	  be grouped	  into	  the category	  that lives	  here by	  choice rather than by	  default. I work for the Nez Perce Tribe which is headquartered	  in	  Lapwai. I have been	  commuting to	  work since 1985 (23 years), so I have considerable experience	  regarding	  the	  stretch of highway of concern. My thoughts and observations regarding the alternatives are	  as follows. Safety is my primary concern. I believe	  E1	  to be	  the	   General Response Schedule describes the next steps in the environmental process and the anticipated schedule. Your comment states that E-‐1	  is your preferred alternative.

The information regarding the relationship between elevation and temperature	  as well as the	  cold air drainage and	  black ice relationships are consistent with	  the findings in the weather	  analysis. See General Response Weather-‐3	  and Weather-‐4, regarding an explanation of elevation, ice, snow accumulation, and other weather related	  driving conditions.  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  safest route based on two factors, fewer access	  points and	  weather. Limiting	  the	  number of access points, and the	  visibility	  and configuration of the access points should be of primary concern as	  safety is 	  no 	  doubt directly affected. Regarding climate, my major concern	  is black ice. My observation	  is that	  black ice along this route is most	  frequently found in low lying areas before sunrise. Cold	  air drainages create the coldest temperatures in 	  low 	  pockets 	  and 	  ice 	  forms 	  when 	  the 	  dew condenses	  on the road. Black	  ice is	  not readily	  visible to the untrained eye, and many people	  are	  obviously unaware of this hazard	  based	  on	  the number of vehicles I have observed losing	  control and ending	  up	  in	  the ditch	  or the on-‐coming traffic. It would be interesting 	  to 	  analyze 	  your 	  weather 	  data 	  to 	  see where and when the coldest temperatures	  occur. There is a	  general pre-‐conception that temperatures	  decrease as elevation	  is increased. This results in	  more snow accumulation at higher elevations. When people see snow they slow down, a natural reaction. People	  who don't see	  black 	  ice 	  lose 	  control	  and crash. So I am not convinced the proposed eastern route is more dangerous in regards to local weather. There is an expectation of out of state drivers as well as most locals that since	  US	  95	  is a	  federal highway it should be designed to drive	  safely	  at highway	  speeds. The IDT should attempt to achieve the safety and efficiency standards of modern US	  highways. Out of state drivers have a tendency to	  believe these highways are comparable in	  terms of  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  safety and travel time, and plan trips accordingly. Estimated trip times are based on speed limits, and it 	  assumed 	  that 	  a 	  person 	  can 	  travel	  safely 	  at 	  highway speeds	  on these roads. I commend the ITD in its	  attempt to construct the	  safest possible	  route. In 	  my 	  opinion 	  one 	  significant 	  benefit 	  to 	  the 	  eastern route is the view this route would provide. This vantage would provide more stimulation to those that	  treasure the beautiful Palouse, and allow travelers passing through a greater	  opportunity to observe the beauty that surrounds them. I personally would	  prefer the eastern	  route based	  on	  safety and the	  view, and I would guess that many non-‐local	  people 	  driving 	  the 	  highway 	  that 	  did 	  not have an	  opportunity to	  comment would	  also	  appreciate	  the	  better views.

I am further convinced that a safe highway, one that includes	  serious	  mitigation for	  any environmental impacts, should go at	  the base of the Ridge in	  order to	  quickly design	  and	  build	  the shortest, safest, and	  least costly route. Most important of all to me, even if I were to lose my home, is that the highway be made safe. I am	  embarrassed to say that I was happy to see	  my children grow up and go away	  to school so they	  were not on the existing 	  highway 	  daily.	  Everyone 	  in my family has either been involved in an accident on this stretch of	  highway or	  been so close to one that	  it 	  feels 	  like 	  a 	  matter 	  of 	  time 	  before 	  we 	  are 	  in 	  one.	  The new highway cannot be completed soon enough. And E2 makes the	  most sense. Thank you for your attention. Louise	  M. Davison "Be who you are, want what you have, and do what you can." [Forest Church] Louise	  M.

Scott  To whom it may concern: I	  am 	  writing 	  to 	  encourage 	  you 	  to 	  choose 	  the 	  C-‐3	  option when re-‐aligning	  US	  95	  between Thorncreek Road and Moscow.  FHWA and ITD must balance	  the	  alternatives’ impacts to both	  the human	  and	  natural environment while taking into 	  account 	  the 	  public’s 	  need 	  for 	  a 	  safe 	  and 	  efficient transportation system. General Response Alternative  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  My reasons for preferring this route are personal. My spouse has been commuting to Lewiston for work for more than 23 years and I do not want him driving in	  winter at higher	  elevations than the road already reaches on Reisenauer Hill.	  The eastern option	  would	  travel at an	  even	  higher elevation	  for several miles, increasing the risk of accidents	  due to fog and icy road conditions. There appear to be legitimate	  concerns about disturbance of wildlife, both	  animals and	  plants, on	  Paradise	  Ridge if 	  the 	  E-‐2	  option is built. However, my concern about this	  alignment option is	  once again personal. Living on	  a relatively busy thoroughfare on	  the eastern side of	  Moscow, I enjoy quiet	  at	  night	  once the local traffic dies down; noise from the highway traffic traveling though	  the downtown	  cannot be heard. However, I believe the noise of a four-‐lane 	  highway 	  will	  be 	  heard 	  in 	  our 	  part	  of	  town if	  the highway is brought	  over	  the ridge to the south. I will be able to see it from my neighborhood and, thus, will also be able to hear	  it. My quality of	  life, as well as that all Moscovites on the east side of town, will be diminished forever. Therefore, I request you choose the C-‐3	  option for re-‐alignment of US	  95, the	  one	  which will impact the	  least 	  number 	  of 	  people 	  in 	  Moscow.	  Sincerely, Lucille	  A.

The ITD did a commendable and thorough job in 	  the 	  Draft 	  EIS.	  This 	  project 	  needs 	  to 	  move 	  forward.	  I	  summarize 	  my 	  review 	  and 	  comments 	  of 	  the 	  Draft EIS. Safety issues for affected property owners: The current highway, along which I have lived for 25 years, is dangerous and must be replaced. The preferred	  alternative, route E2 is the safest and	  is estimated to reduce	  accident rates by 69%, the	  most of any alternative. That would	  have translated to four	  less deaths, 13 less severely debilitating crashes, and 150 less	  accidents	  over the past ten years. More of these tragic	  crashes are projected to occur in	  the future, as traffic volume increases. Most of those that oppose the E2 alternative live outside the study area, do	  not own	  property directly affected by the	  alternative	  routes, and are	  concerned about indirect effects on	  Paradise Ridge,	  much of which is on the periphery or outside the study area. No More Delay: This decision process has been going on	  for nearly 20 years. This is one of the most dangerous stretches of major highway in	  all of Idaho,	  and 	  the 	  most 	  dangerous 	  in 	  our 	  region,	  extending	  from Benewah County to Riggins. Too many people have	  died and suffered severe	  injuries while this delay has proceeded. Our friends and neighbors continue to	  use this road	  every day and	  our families are at unnecessary risk. There should	  be no	  further delays. The safest road	  possible should	  be built ASAP. Any extension	  of the review period	  or more litigation should be discouraged.  describes why FHWA	  and	  ITD identified	  the E-‐2	  Alternative as the Preferred	  Alternative.

E2 is	  the only	  alternative that eliminates Reisenauer Hill,	  minimizes 	  curves,	  has 	  the 	  minimum number of accesses and	  is most favorable for conversion to “no access” status	  for the next generation of highways. E2	  is the Least Disruptive Alternative. Nearly	  all the land 	  in 	  the 	  corridor 	  is 	  private 	  property.	  The 	  owners of more than	  80% of the land	  directly impacted	  by the three alternatives have notified the ITD that	  they prefer alternative E2. E2 is less disruptive of local businesses;	  minimizes 	  residential	  and 	  business relocation,	  and 	  the 	  number 	  of 	  remaining 	  homes 	  and businesses that must access the highway directly; results in the least	  fragmentation of	  farming operations; best preserves, protects and	  services the current agricultural practices	  in the area; and is	  the least 	  likely 	  to 	  encourage 	  suburban 	  encroachment into 	  some 	  of 	  the 	  best 	  farmland in 	  the 	  northwest.	  The vast majority of farmers impacted by all three routes agrees that	  E2 is the best	  alternative and least 	  interferes 	  with 	  their 	  operations.	  Paradise 	  Ridge is 	  Private 	  Property.	  Most 	  of 	  the 	  opposition 	  to 	  Route E2	  centers around potential impacts to wildlife, remnants and restoration of	  native prairie, and visual effects on Paradise	  Ridge. These	  alleged effects occur on private	  land at the	  base	  of the	  ridge	  on	  the periphery of the study area, or largely outside the study area on the ridge itself. All of	  this land is private property. Currently, the ridge	  is subject to  See	  General Response	  Safety-‐5	  regarding Reisenauer Hill.  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  considerable pressure for residential development, is 	  becoming 	  less 	  accessible 	  to 	  the 	  public, 	  and 	  less hospitable to	  wildlife. As the ridge area continues to	  develop	  and	  is fragmented	  into	  suburban	  homes and	  lots, 	  human 	  interaction 	  and 	  habitat	  loss will be particularly significant with	  respect to	  big game and	  predator species, and	  predation	  and	  disturbances by suburban pets	  will more adversely affect these and other non-‐game	  populations than the	  proposed highway. This trend	  is likely to	  get worse in the future. Stewardship of Paradise	  Ridge.	  Most of the landowners 	  on 	  and 	  adjacent 	  to 	  the 	  ridge 	  are responsible stewards and many generously have allowed public access to their property for generations, although no trespassing signs are becoming more prevalent. With	  respect to	  prairie restoration, significant	  portions of	  these efforts are being undertaken	  by landowners who	  support alternative	  E2. Many of these	  owners view alternative	  E2	  as a	  restraint on ridge	  development and suburban encroachment from the west. They believe locating the highway at the base of the ridge may, in the long run, better preserve the current environment. However, it must be	  remembered that all of these	  efforts are	  voluntary. There	  are	  no guarantees that	  future owners and potential development will decide to	  ensure the perceived	  character of the ridge, sought by	  the opponents	  of this Alternative E2. Quarreling Views of the Ridge. With respect to visual effects, the	  perspective	  of those	  who look at the  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  area	  differs 180	  degrees from those	  of us who look from within the area. Those who view the ridge from the urban area of	  Moscow believe the highway at	  the base of	  the ridge will diminish their	  view. Landowners from the	  area believe	  the	  view from alternative	  E2	  will enhance	  the	  view to the	  west and be an	  attractive gateway to	  Moscow. Environmental Mitigations Required and Proposed. The required and proposed mitigations to offset adverse	  environmental effects are	  nearly identical for all three routes as follows. C3 actually requires the most mitigation, including the only cultural heritage impacts.	  E2 	  has 	  the 	  largest 	  wildlife 	  impact associated with a	  stand of Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) timber, planted	  in	  the 1930s, that may be habitat for	  three species of	  potential concern (bat, songbird and lizard). W4, incidentally, is the route that	  potentially most	  impacts the only endangered species found in the	  study area, and more CCC and earlier (1904) conservation tree plantings will be destroyed.

Wray  Dear Adam and all concerned, I	  am 	  writing 	  to 	  add 	  my 	  opposition 	  to 	  the 	  E-‐2	  realignment. I have been a Moscow resident	  for	  14 years and remember hearing	  about this discussion when we moved here. I have since had a chance to educate	  myself on the	  issue	  and am amazed that it is  See	  General Response	  Weather-‐3	  and Weather-‐4, and Weather-‐5	  regarding elevation, snow accumulation and other weather related	  conditions. The E-‐2	  Alternative would not directly affect Paradise Ridge.	  Paradise Ridge is a group of privately owned parcels 	  that 	  have 	  over 	  55 	  homes 	  and 	  businesses with  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  still being debated. I recently received the letter	  sent	  to you by the PRDC organization and would love to hear what rebuttal ITD has to	  it’s stated	  facts. Of most concern to me is the added risks imposed by putting the highway at the higher elevation	  (E2 vs. C3). As I write this it has been snowing off and on for the past	  24 hours and driving up the ridge just	  last	  night I noticed	  that the snow accumulation	  was triple at	  about	  2800 ft	  and higher	  than that	  down on the highway. It	  is a very common to have the	  weather change drastically in just 200-‐300	  ft of elevation climb. I would think that with all that has been	  said	  and	  having heard	  the facts (costs, environmental impact, noise impact, 	  weather concerns, opposition from multiple federal agencies, etc.) that the	  ITD would want what is best for the	  community	  and the environment. I am at a loss	  to understand	  why ITD is so	  persistentin	  sticking with	  an alignment that is opposed by so many for one	  that	  is just	  as safe and less intrusive. Remember that	  the impact	  of	  where you place this new stretch	  of highway is permanent and	  the changes	  you make are irreversible. Why	  then would you not want to preserve something	  so beautiful and important as Paradise	  Ridge and its surrounding environment.

Idaho Fish and Games study recommendation reflects this as well. 2) The Palouse prairie remnants would be adversely affected by non-‐native species spread	  by vehicles and other vectors. Weed control in Idaho is generally	  ineffective. Knapweed is steadily	  encroaching	  on many areas of Latah County. Most landowners 	  just 	  don¹t 	  care 	  or 	  give 	  up quickly on	  control/eradication. 3) Standardized precipitation shows monitoring was during a drier than	  normal period. This makes the predictions much	  less reliable. During a normal or wet winter, road conditions would become more dangerous than	  the other routes. 4) By not following more closely to the existing highway, noise will be affecting a new	  group of residences that	  were developed without	  a highway presence.

C-‐3	  should be the route chosen because: 1) Even though C-‐3	  would have the greatest number of approaches, this would	  be best for future commercial and residential development. 2) Because access	  would be similar to the existing route, C-‐3	  would have the least indirect effect on the economy of the	  area. 3) It would consolidate impacts into a	  single corridor, hence minimize the ecological footprint. Even though safety and shortness	  are said to be the most important, the slight statistical advantages of E-‐2	  are not worth the costs numbered above. In my opinion, the C-‐3	  option is the best option other than no	  action. C-‐3	  best fulfills the purpose and needs of all the	  options under consideration. Sincerely, Mark Townsend 214	  N.

I	  am 	  concerned 	  that 	  the 	  Eastern 	  Washington University archaeological study reports discuss their assumption that the	  project area	  has a	  low potential for	  archaeological Native American village sites in the project	  area, and thereby seem to dismiss the potential for any significant tribal resources or sites. Indeed,	  the 	  archaeological	  surveys 	  only 	  turned 	  up 	  1 historic trash	  scatter and	  many historic	  farms, buildings, and	  structures, and	  no	  prehistoric or tribal cultural resources.	  I	  am 	  really 	  concerned 	  about 	  whether 	  or 	  not 	  ITD 	  put  FHWA and ITD appreciate	  the	  Nez Perce	  Tribe's (Tribe) interest 	  in 	  the 	  US-‐95	  Thorncreek Road to Moscow Draft	  Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS). We look forward to addressing your	  concerns regarding the project's effects to	  important Tribal resources and	  sites. Due to the large size of the project area, it was necessary to	  utilize some degree	  of predictive	  methodology to help identify areas with the highest likelihood 	  of 	  having 	  cultural	  resources.	  A report titled A Cultural Resources Probability Study for Idaho	  Transportation Department’s Proposed US	  95	  Thorn Creek Road	  to	  Moscow, Stage 1 Project, Latah	  County, Idaho 	  (Sharley 	  and 	  Gough,	  2005) 	  focused 	  on 	  the likelihood 	  of 	  encountering 	  prehistoric 	  Native 	  American resources in the 30 sq. km (12 sq. mi)	  project	  area. This  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  forth a good faith effort	  to identify nonarchaeological tribal resources, specifically historic properties of cultural and	  religious significance to	  Indian 	  Tribes. 	  Examples 	  that 	  might 	  be 	  located 	  within the project	  area include traditional plants, significant	  landscape 	  features, 	  and 	  ritual	  sites.	  By 	  limiting 	  the cultural resource review to archaeologists and	  historic architects, the agency may not have been	  able	  to identify these	  sites types, and therefore	  is unable to	  consider the impacts of the undertaking upon	  them in	  the decision	  making process, in	  violation of the National Historic	  Preservation	  Act. Please	  contact the	  Nez Perce	  Cultural Resource	  Program to determine	  how we	  can identify these	  important 	  resources 	  before 	  the 	  final	  decision 	  is made by the ITD. Sincerely, Patrick Baird Tribal Historic Preservation Officer\ Archaeologist Cultural Resource Program Nez Perce Tribe PO Box 365	  Lapwai, ID 83540 208-‐621-‐3851	  (o) 208-‐791-‐8610	  (c)  report	  was not	  circulated with the DEIS but was available	  on-‐line 	  during 	  the 	  DEIS 	  development, 	  was referenced in subsequent	  reports, and was provided to your office. It cited ethnographic/historic	  information regarding Native Americans including information regarding camas root	  grounds, hunting areas, travel routes, known and predicted camp locations, and the relationships of	  camps to landscape features such as Palouse	  highlands, camas meadows and stream valleys. The report suggested that there may be a	  low to moderate probability of encountering prehistoric sites in 	  the 	  project 	  area, 	  including 	  villages, 	  and 	  that 	  there were other nearby sites with a higher likelihood of having prehistoric cultural resources. The study also	  stated that over 50 percent of the project area has	  been surveyed	  in	  the past and	  nothing has been	  found	  to	  date. This information	  helped	  to	  identify where sites were most likely to be located and where further investigation 	  should 	  be 	  focused, 	  including 	  shovel	  testing, but	  it	  was not	  meant	  to dismiss the possibility of significant tribal resources or sites in	  the project area. Some	  of the	  same	  ethnographic citations were	  used in subsequent cultural resource surveys	  for the project. Four additional cultural resource	  surveys that involved literature 	  reviews 	  and 	  field 	  studies, 	  including 	  shovel	  testing were completed. See the DEIS and FEIS Section 3.4.2	  Methodology. FHWA and ITD also consulted with the	  Tribe	  to help identify 	  any 	  Tribal	  concerns 	  and 	  Traditional	  Cultural	  Properties. Prior to initiating the	  cultural resource studies, FHWA and ITD sent a letter to the Nez	  Perce Tribe (July 14, 2004)	  initiating Tribal Consultation under	   #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation	  Act. The letter described the project, stated that	  an EIS will be prepared, and	  requested	  the Tribe to	  provide information 	  on 	  cultural	  resources that	  should be considered as	  part of the cultural resource studies. FHWA also requested any information regarding Traditional Cultural Properties and sacred sites. The	  ITD District Engineer and the Nez Perce Tribal Executive Committee also	  engaged	  in	  government-‐to-‐government consultation and discuss	  projects	  through their quarterly meetings as agreed	  upon	  in	  their Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). There have been	  at least 18 quarterly meetings Since December 2004	  during which the project was discussed. Through the tribal consultation letter, the review opportunities for	  the various cultural resource studies, and the quarterly 	  government-‐to-‐government consultation meetings, ITD has made a good faith effort to identify Tribal concerns and to identify and consider effects to cultural resources. ITD will continue to consult with the Tribe through the Nez Perce Tribal Executive Committee as agreed upon through the	  MOU. We respectfully request that the Tribe work through this committee to provide information about	  any Traditional Cultural Properties, sacred sites or other important 	  cultural	  resources that could	  be affected	  by the project	  so that	  we may take steps to avoid or	  minimize harm	  to them. ITD will hold the information in the strictest	  confidence and will refrain from publishing the information in the Final EIS and any other	  public documents.  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  E-‐115  Rami  Attebury  Dear Mr. Rush, As a homeowner potentially affected	  by the Highway 95 Thorn Creek project, I am writing to	  lend	  my support to ITD's preferred route, E2. My primary reason for	  doing so is safety,	  and 	  I	  believe	  that ITD has chosen	  the correct route to	  reduce the accident rate in this section of	  the state. After	  five years of	  residence at	  the bottom of	  Reisenauer	  Hill,	  I	  have seen numerous	  vehicles	  in the ditch, my pasture and my yard. One of the most recent accidents resulted	  in 	  the 	  death 	  of 	  a 	  truck 	  driver 	  attempting 	  to 	  chain 	  his tires on the side of	  the road. My husband, having heard	  the truck miss a gear and	  realizing the driver would likely need to put on chains to summit the hill,	  went 	  out 	  to 	  see 	  if 	  he 	  could 	  help. 	  He 	  was 	  the 	  last person	  to	  ever speak to	  this accident victim. My husband	  warned	  him about how often	  vehicles lose control on the hill in icy	  conditions	  and suggested that	  he wait	  for	  law enforcement	  to slow traffic so he could chain safely. Unfortunately, this	  did not occur. I would	  like to	  express my wish	  that a decision	  to proceed with E2 be made as quickly as possible to prevent similar situations in	  the future. In 	  addition 	  to 	  safety,	  I	  would 	  like 	  to 	  lend	  my support to E2 as the owner	  of	  a residence in which I live with my husband and four young children. Both C3 and W4 require the seizure and destruction of our home and property. My family does not wish to see	  our home destroyed. When	  we moved	  in, the house was a	  three	  bedroom, one	  bath house. Improvements made by my husband and myself have turned this into 	  a 	  four 	  bedroom, 	  three 	  full-‐bath	  home with	  an	   Thank you for your comments and for sharing your experience	  regarding	  the	  accident.	  	  ITD 	  is 	  committed 	  to improving 	  this 	  roadway 	  as 	  soon 	  as 	  possible.	  	  General Response Schedule describes the next steps in the environmental process and the anticipated schedule. The DEIS	  alternatives are based on a	  conceptual level designs. Right-‐of-‐way needs will be determined during the design process when geotechnical, topographic and detailed	  survey data is available and	  when	  a design	  details are known. ITD will work with	  landowners one on	  one during the right-‐of-‐way and design process. Should your property	  be impacted, you would be compensated according to the Uniform Relocation Act.

The	  significance of this	  change is	  that it accommodates	  my large family 	  in 	  a 	  location 	  close 	  to 	  my 	  workplace in 	  Moscow.	  Additional	  improvements 	  around 	  the property have resulted	  in	  two	  guest cabins, an	  outbuilding with	  a private bar and	  brewery, new siding on	  several barns, fencing for goats, and	  a band	  equipment room. I believe	  it will be	  hard to find another residence	  of this nature	  within a	  five	  minute	  drive of town; hence, even	  if we were to	  be compensated monetarily	  for lost property, it is	  unlikely that such	  compensation	  would	  equal the true value of	  the home and property in terms of location, 	  square 	  footage, 	  number 	  of 	  room, outbuildings, pasture, and	  convenience. I	  would 	  like 	  to 	  thank 	  the 	  Idaho 	  Transportation Department for the opportunity to comment on this issue.	  I	  hope 	  that 	  a 	  decision 	  is 	  made 	  quickly 	  so 	  as 	  to both prevent future needless accidents and	  to	  avoid	  destroying permanent dwelling places of Idaho	  taxpayers. Sincerely, Rami Attebury, 3455	  Highway 95, Moscow, ID 83843 509-‐607-‐1196  E-‐116  Romney  Boehm  To the Idaho Transportation Department, This is in regards to the proposed expansion of U.S.	  95	  south of Moscow, ID, and the three possible routes. Given what	  I have been learning, I think that	  C-‐3	  is probably the best route, for various reasons. For one, it is the	  established route	  and with improvements 	  to 	  the 	  road, 	  the 	  safety can	  be greatly  General Response Alternative explains why FHWA and ITD 	  identified 	  the 	  E-‐2	  Alternative as the Preferred Alternative. While the C-‐3	  Alternative follows existing US-‐95	  more closely	  than the other action alternatives, it is new alignment east of existing	  US-‐95	  from approximately MP 340-‐343.  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  improved.	  Secondly, 	  I	  have 	  heard 	  that 	  it 	  will	  not cause the destruction of as	  many	  homes	  and business as the DEIS claimed	  it would. I agree with	  avoiding	  destroying	  people's property for the	  highway expansion, as best as is possible. Thirdly, I	  think 	  that 	  widening 	  and 	  improving 	  the 	  C-‐3	  route would allow the preservation of	  more of	  Paradise	  Ridge and of the	  Palouse	  Prairie ecosystems, which are	  local treasures that I would think the whole state of	  Idaho 	  should 	  be 	  proud 	  to protect, preserve, and	  maintain	  for future generations. Many	  participants in the	  DEIS offer significant projections	  and data that indicate that E2	  would be an unwise choice, environmentally. Weeds are likely to encroach areas that are	  now covered in native plants	  and habitats. Deer, moose,	  and elk populations will be disturbed	  by E-‐2. These large 	  animals 	  also 	  endanger 	  drivers 	  when 	  they 	  are 	  in the middle of	  the road. Residents living close to the proposed	  E-‐2	  route speak of very large deer populations that favor that area. If there is a route that	  wouldn't	  cut	  into Moscow's and Idaho's natural heritage in	  such	  a way, why wouldn't we be thankful and chose	  the	  other route	  (C-‐3)?	  The EPA, Idaho Fish	  and Game, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife	  Service	  all advise	  against the	  E-‐2	  route. Finally, I think you should be	  very careful about claiming that E-‐2	  would be the safest route. The weather study in the DEIS was done during a part of a	  year where	  the	  weather	  was not	  what	  local residents would call "normal" for	  the region. For	  example, I think there	  was little	  or no snow during	   The Safety Analysis has been revised since the DEIS	  was published	  but the findings regarding the relative safety between	  alternatives remained	  valid.	  See 	  General	  Response Safety-‐3. See General Response Safety-‐6	  regarding the significance of	  the differences in safety between	  the E-‐2	  and C-‐3	  Alternatives. See	  Displacement-‐1	  for a	  clarification of the impacts to residents and businesses.	  All of the action	  alternatives would	  be widened	  to	  4 lanes 	  as 	  described 	  in 	  the 	  DEIS 	  2.4.2.	  	  Widening 	  the existing	  alignment would not be	  a	  comprehensive	  solution to the existing roadway deficiencies	  as	  described	  in	  General Response Safety-‐4.

So, the study did not note all the low hanging clouds, fog, and	  precipitation	  that are common in the Paradise Ridge area. It also did not look 	  at 	  weather 	  conditions 	  during 	  the 	  whole 	  year-‐weather conditions need to also be checked during the months of	  November	  and December	  as people living 	  in 	  that 	  area 	  say 	  there is heavy fog among other weather conditions during those times. I think another study needs to be	  done	  so you can really know what you are proposing	  and so you can take full responsibility for	  how the weather	  on the E-‐2	  route would affect	  its safety.	  You could start by asking	  a	  representative	  group of local residents what they observe. Some people might	  not	  see it	  as a problem, but that doesn't seem to	  be enough	  research to build a highway on. Everyone's safety is at issue, so a	  thorough study would seem best, all around. I hope	  you will really consider this underexamined aspect of the	  E-‐2	  route, before you make a	  decision, because	  I know you will not want more	  blame from local residents for another unsafe road.

The preferred alternative	  is too close	  to paradise	  ridge	  and will have an	  adverse impact on	  the native plants found	  there, which I have personally observed during an outing last year of the Idaho	  Native Plant Society. At least 	  one 	  major 	  property 	  owner 	  on 	  Paradise 	  Ridge is very	  active in native plants issues and can be counted on try	  to keep Paradise ridge's	  native plants	  in 	  a 	  native 	  Palouse 	  Prairie state. It is	  everyone's	  duty to do everything possible to support	  that	  noble quest. Highway construction on Paradise Ridge would be in violation of that ethical duty. The new highway should be constructed as far from Paradise	  Ridge as possible, so I favor the	  most westerly of the three proposed routes. Please construct the new highway far from Paradise Ridge.

It seems logical to me that	  the best plan is to improve	  the	  existing	  section of highway just as	  the rest of the highway was improved to the top of the Lewiston Hill.

The E-‐2	  Alternative would be located along the base of Paradise	  Ridge and would be	  shorter than the	  existing	  section of US-‐95	  because	  the	  curves would be	  eliminated.

If you punch in a totally	  new road, people will continue to use the old highway, which will be no safer than it is	  today and people will continue to die on	  the corner that is marked	  60 mph	  when	  it should	  have been	  reduced	  to	  50 mph	  years ago. I	  hope 	  the 	  Idaho 	  Highway 	  Department 	  will	  choose C3 for the safety of Idaho	  and	  our visitors and	  for expediency and economic reasons.

I	  quite 	  see 	  the 	  need 	  for 	  road 	  improvements 	  on 	  the stretch of 95 in question; it is	  crowded with cars	  nowadays, and	  people drive its curves recklessly.	  However, I cannot see that the overall safety will be improved 	  by 	  putting 	  the 	  road 	  up 	  into 	  the 	  frozen 	  fog belt, no	  matter how straight it is. I	  think 	  it 	  is 	  a 	  different 	  kind 	  of 	  bad 	  idea 	  to 	  tear 	  out 	  a chunk	  of native Palouse Prairie and risk impacting	  the nearby piece of	  it, when there are other	  alternatives.

I'd	  also	  like to	  thank the ITD 	  for 	  taking 	  the 	  time 	  to 	  prepare 	  the 	  DEIS 	  and 	  to make that document and all the other information publicly available for comment regarding the Thorn	  Creek to Moscow project	  alignment. Of the three alternatives remaining on the table at  FHWA and ITD must balance	  the	  alternatives’ impacts to both	  the human	  and	  natural environment while taking into 	  account 	  the 	  public’s 	  need 	  for 	  a 	  safe 	  and 	  efficient	  transportation system.

See	  General Response	  Weather-‐3, Weather-‐4	  and Weather-‐5	  regarding elevation, fog and other weather related	  driving conditions. General Response Safety-‐5	  describes how the different alternatives address safety deficiencies at Reisenauer Hill.  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  this point	  in time, I believe that	  all will result	  in a significant improvement of the safety of this dangerous segment of the highway, compared	  to	  the current	  route as all three separate the traffic onto	  separate northbound	  and	  southbound	  roads, and even W4, which otherwise	  follows the	  current route quite closely, eliminates the curve at the bottom of Reisenauer Hill which has been the site of so many accidents. After this	  great improvement in safety that will accompany any of these routes, it is	  my opinion that other factors should be the primary considerations 	  in 	  selecting 	  the 	  preferred 	  new routing. For me, the	  C3	  route	  is the	  best way to go. It provides a very good	  compromise between	  minimizing the number of miles of new route, eliminating	  the	  most dangerous part of the	  old route, and providing a direct	  route into	  Moscow from the south. I	  am 	  most 	  opposed 	  to 	  the 	  E2 	  route,	  for 	  both 	  safety and environmental protection reasons. Regarding	  safety, I have lived in this	  area long enough to see the many days when Paradise Ridge is 	  crowned 	  by fog, extending well down to the E2 route, when lower 	  elevation 	  routes 	  remain 	  beneath 	  the cloud/fog level. I believe that this	  will greatly	  adversely affect wintertime	  driving	  safety on this route, more than is suggested by the ITD commentary. I	  am 	  a 	  member 	  of 	  the 	  Idaho 	  Native 	  Plant 	  Society 	  and the Palouse Prairie Foundation, and am well aware	  1) that the Palouse Prairie ecosystem is nearly  See	  General Response	  Weeds regarding indirect effects to Paradise Ridge and Palouse	  remnants.

It 	  is 	  my understanding that other agencies, including the US Fish and Wildlife Service, the US Environmental Protection Agency, and the Idaho Department of Fish and Game also have all opposed E2, for these and additional reasons. I would urge ITD 	  to 	  take 	  those 	  opinions to	  heart and	  avoid	  the E2 option.

I thought I had	  more time. Even	  though	  I've lived	  on	  Paradise	  Ridge Road	  for 35 years, I	  didn't 	  get involved 	  last 	  time 	  because 	  I	  just 	  assumed 	  that something so inane could have no real support. You know, who is really supporting this?	  After all, the Moscow community has two major	  landmarks:	  Moscow 	  Mountain 	  and 	  Paradise Ridge. Exactly who	  would 	  have 	  any 	  interest 	  in defacing either? Would	  you	  build	  a road	  over Moscow Mountain strip mine it? Would you, and there are interests that, that	  uh probably would clear-‐cut it if the laws	  didn't prevent that. Huh, aren’t there?	  Are	  there?	  Yeah. But for the	  environmental laws, there	  are	  interests that would. Allright. Then, since I retired a	  few years ago, I started hearing rumors that what seemed	  ridiculous was in 	  fact 	  a 	  done 	  deal.	  The 	  power 	  company 	  guys, ITD 	  surveyors,	  a 	  former 	  state 	  legislator,	  these rumors, a done deal? Well, that was my basic reaction. How could this be a done deal? What	  processes had	  been	  gone through? What could	  possibly explain	  persisting with	  the self-‐evident stupidity? Again, who? Who? Who's	  responsible for	  this? And what	  process could	  have resulted	  in	  the alleged rumored done deal? No process? Do these interests assume they're so powerful they  FHWA and ITD must balance	  both the	  human and natural environmental impacts with	  the safety benefit for the general public. FHWA	  and	  ITD are responsible for	  NEPA compliance and would not	  circumvent the process. The E-‐2	  Alternative was identified 	  as 	  FHWA’s 	  and 	  ITD’s 	  Preferred 	  Alternative because it balances the human	  and	  natural environmental effects with the	  best safety benefit for	  the public. It	  was not	  identified as the Preferred Alternative due to	  political, developer or personal gain. FHWA and ITD have	  been transparent throughout the EIS process from early scoping through the FEIS development. This has included	  holding open	  house meetings, breakfast meetings, posting information on	  the website, working with citizen advisory	  groups, sending	  out newsletters, and conducting	  other public involvement activities as described	  in	  the FEIS Chapter	  10. General Response Alternative describes why FHWA	  and	  ITD identified	  the E-‐2	  Alternative as the Preferred	  Alternative. The E-‐2	  Alternative would be located at the base of Paradise	  Ridge but would	  not go	  over it. Paradise Ridge is privately owned	  land	  and	  does offer important 	  scenic 	  and 	  ecological	  functions.	  	  See General Response Weeds and Wildlife regarding effects to Paradise	  Ridge	  and mitigation measures. ITD 	  and 	  FHWA 	  are 	  the 	  lead 	  agencies 	  for 	  this 	  project and consider all public and agency input regarding	   #  First Name  Last name  Comment  Response  don't need	  process? Um, months later many of us got in the mail the slick PR package, you know, slick, corporatelooking.	  Again, 	  whose 	  money?	  Are	  tax dollars paying to	  deface the, the ridge? Who	  money, whose money paid for these slick materials? Then you show up today, is this taxpayer stuff?	  Is this somebody else, really, uh, behind this? Um, most strangely of all, the supposedly neutral, supposedly neutral, state agency, the ITD, recommends the ridge-‐ruining route without	  providing any convincing rationales and	  not even	  seeming to try very hard if you really look at the materials carefully, a sense of hubris or, uh, conceit. Again, circumstantial evidence of	  this done deal, uh, mentality. Then a	  couple of well-‐connected locals	  with public, uh, write public letters blaming another local	  citizen 	  for 	  the 	  ITD's 	  failure 	  to 	  do 	  anything about the	  area	  five	  miles south of town. If the	  idea 	  is 	  somehow the grotesque charge that	  blood	  is on	  someone's hands, those hands are those of	  the ITD and whoever	  it	  might	  be in cohorts	  where, uh, with. Uh, Al Poplawsky	  is	  not a	  safety officer. Al Poplawsky can't get out in	  the road and put	  rumble sticks. He can't put danger signs, warning signs. He can't lower the speed limits 	  or 	  do 	  any 	  of 	  that.	  Why 	  don't 	  they 	  do 	  that for	  10 years? Is the ideals, is the idea some sort	  of blackmail? Our way or the highway? No	  safety for	  10 years unless you, uh, bring a interstate-‐like highway to	  the very, uh, city limits. Uh, what is  the project	  and alternatives. Providing the "Guide to the DEIS" to the public was an effort to	  summarize information in the EIS, to notify the public of an	  opportunity to	  comment on	  the DEIS and to attend the	  public hearing. The release of the DEIS	  and timing of the hearing was during winter because it was approved for publication	  at that time 	  and 	  because 	  there 	  is 	  a public interest to	  move forward	  with	  the project. It is 	  not 	  untypical	  to 	  approve 	  and 	  have 	  public comment periods	  during the winter or at any	  other time of	  the year. To accommodate the timing of	  the comment period, additional days	  were added. The comment period was	  then further extended to March 25, 2013 for an additional 30 days at the request	  of	  the public and agencies. The development of the EIS	  is funded by FHWA and ITD 	  with 	  tax 	  dollars 	  and 	  we 	  are 	  not 	  aware 	  of 	  any money trail or industry funding.	  We do not agree with the blame Mr. Poplawski has received in the comments or	  editorial letters. We also do not agree	  with the	  conspiracy or syndicate, industry 	  influence 	  comments 	  received.	  	  FHWA 	  and ITD 	  are 	  not 	  catering 	  to 	  any 	  special	  industries.	  	  General Response Schedule describes the next steps in 	  the 	  environmental	  process 	  and 	  the 	  anticipated schedule. Please	  see	  the	  description of the	  EIS	  process and the	  screening of alternatives	  in Chapter 2, Alternatives. The project is being designed	  to	  AASHTO standards, which will result in a safety benefit. See General Response Safety-‐3.  #  First Name  Last name  Comment  Response  going, uh, on, uh, here? Uh, again, uh, do either of these blame-‐it-‐on-‐Al-‐letter-‐writers have any connection to any	  of the likely	  ITD cohorts? Feeling that I might be	  getting closer to some, any explanation, uh, for this, I went to the	  informational	  meeting 	  last 	  Saturday 	  where someone mentioned that last time around the lumber 	  company 	  had 	  openly 	  lobbied 	  for 	  a 	  faster way out of town. Literally, a straight line or the closest thing to a straight line.	  Think 	  of 	  a 	  slurry line.	  Any 	  of 	  you 	  involved 	  in 	  the 	  mining 	  industry might know what a slurry line is. What these folks want	  to do in effect	  is set	  up a slurry line to run their	  chips and chip trucks up the ridge faster	  and more	  efficiently. A few cents' cost	  saving per	  chip load truck. Bingo, finally I started	  to	  get an, uh, an	  answer to	  who, who could possibly be, uh, behind this. Then I asked someone in Boise about the reputation of	  the ITD. Another bingo. Follow the money. Excuse me, I'm 	  going 	  to 	  continue here. I haven't got much	  longer.	  Follow 	  the 	  money 	  was 	  the 	  Boise 	  political	  observer's advice. The ITD turns out to	  be a hand	  maiden for industry, the very companies that it is designed	  to	  regulate call its shots. That was the word from Boise. I	  now suspect that a syndicate in effect of the ITD itself 	  and 	  logger/trucker/mill	  interests 	  have cynically	  used the EIS process	  with no public	  purpose in	  mind. If you	  believe safety,	  I've 	  got 	  a bridge to	  sell you. The circumstantial evidence is  Mr. Wasdens staff along with FHWA attorneys will have an	  opportunity review and	  advise the ITD prior to the release of	  the FEIS. The administrative costs of legal challenges are not factored into the total project	  costs presented in the DEIS. Each of the alternatives, including the No Action	  would	  have the potential for legal challenge and it is not possible	  to predict these actions. See	  General Response	  Weather-‐2	  and Weather-‐3	  regarding the methodology of	  the Weather	  Analysis and weather in relation to elevation.  #  First Name  Last name  Comment  Response  there. For example, uh, after all these years, why wait until the dead of winter to release the DEIS? It 	  reminds 	  me 	  of 	  the 	  White 	  House 	  policy 	  of releasing bad news on Friday afternoons. Uh, and even more	  damning	  are	  the	  DEIS	  and supporting PR materials	  themselves. They're an intellectual hoax. On their own terms, these items don't	  remotely support	  the industryfriendly recommendation, and what	  they leave out, the truth, is scandalous. They contain	  numerous factual misstatements and	  misrepresentations that you	  hear a lot about or be able to	  read	  a lot about later. Not to bring myself in, and I'm almost through here, but I was a corporate securities lawyer years ago. A primary	  job was drafting	  and filing	  disclosure documents, uh, on	  behalf of corporations	  with the Securities and Exchange Commission	  in	  Washington, D.C. A	  basic rule with public documents is that it's every bit as wrongful to not disclose material information as it 	  is 	  to 	  just 	  straightforward 	  lie.	  The 	  idea 	  is 	  full	  and fair	  disclosure, transparency. Well, the DEIS is not yet an official public document, not yet. If filed	  in	  this present form, it would naturally be subjected to both federal and state legal challenges. If you doubt my, uh, credentials	  on this	  sort of stuff, uh, look	  me up. The federal, uh, EIS implications are obvious. I would talk to my old student Larry Wasden, my old	  student, uh, about state charges here. I, uh, again suspect that this is all part of an essentially  #  First Name  Last name  Comment  Response  quasi criminal fraudulent conspiracy, the slurry line, 	  uh, 	  idea.	  That's	  what’s	  really behind this. All right, this leads to	  yet another material, uh, misrepresentation in the DEIS itself. When comparing total expenses, legal and administrative	  expenses are	  ignored. Again, why this obvious deception by omission? Who’s responsible 	  for 	  that? 	  These 	  are 	  public documents, folks, not the private property of industry.	  Why 	  is 	  this 	  self-‐evident difference	  in ultimate expenses ignored? Why is this not a cost factor? Uh, could it be that ITD would spend our public dollars on	  lawyering to save the industrial	  complex 	  a 	  few 	  cents 	  per 	  load? Finally, what is key for everyone	  involved is to keep in mind the ITD's apparent acceptance of the straight	  line engineering trucking efficiency argument. You'll see	  the	  weather stuff is just a	  crock. What's the idea,	  go up 	  for 	  safety? Audience member: It’s not a crock. Testifier: Yeah, go up for safety?	  You’ll have	  your chance. Go up for safety? Does	  that make sense to anybody? I have lived on Paradise Ridge,	  you’ll have your chance, for 35 years. The idea that going	  up for safety, uh, is just [comment inaudible] Hearing officer: Your four minutes is up. Testifier: This is talking truth to power. There are powerful interests here. They have no	  interest in	  sharing the truth. Thank you.  OM-‐2  Jack  Flack  Okay, I'm, I’m Jack Flack. I live south of Moscow.

It doesn’t frost on	  Paradise Ridge when	  it frosts on	  the western route. The western route is the coldest route. The cold air goes	  down in the flat and draws. The uh, some of the farmland that	  is the most	  valuable	  farmland is the	  farmland that lays west of, uh, Paradise Ridge.	  There's a huge block of some of the finest farmland in Whitman County and Latah County that lays in there	  that's very valuable. It probably	  produces more per acre than any other farmland in the	  world, and it's very	  valuable. Uh, I don't think	  we want to have a	  highway on it, and I would prefer not to have	  one there. Our main concern is that we get a highway built soon, that we get the safest highway that we could possibly 	  have 	  and 	  that 	  the 	  alignment would be fairly consistent in elevation and it would be fairly straight and that's unlike what we have now, and, uh, uh, we've watched	  a lot of people be killed	  since this process started	  and	  we would like to have this road, this  the E-‐2	  Alternative as the Preferred Alternative. See	  the	  response	  for V-‐9 regarding items repeated from your	  previous comment. Your observations regarding frost and fog are consistent with the Weather Analyses. The E-‐2	  Alternative would have the greatest safety benefit, as stated	  in	  General Response Safety-‐3. See	  General Response	  Weather-‐3	  and Weather-‐4, and Weather-‐5	  regarding elevation, fog, snowdrift and frost.

Uh, there are some safety factors that	  are involved.	  I	  don't 	  think 	  there's 	  any 	  question 	  that the E-‐2	  route is the safest	  route. It	  involves the least 	  number 	  of 	  land.	  [Inaudible]	  will	  be 	  the 	  least destructive to	  the traffic flow while they're building it. You‘ll be able to	  build	  a highway and	  when you get through with it, you can connect it at both ends and there will be free-‐flowing traffic. You will not, your	  traffic going south to Lewiston will be	  not interrupted in any	  way	  until they start	  connecting it. Uh, it’s also, the elevation of the highway in my years that have been there, I think	  the elevation of the top of	  Paradise Ridge is 	  about 	  3,000 	  feet.	  The fog level usually comes down about maybe 29	  to 2,800. Most of the time this E-‐2	  route will be fog-‐free. If	  it	  has fog on it, it	  will also, an uh, come down into the old 95 and the western route. The western route will have much more drifting snow area that it has to	  blow snow across those	  flats and pick up snow for drifts will be good. I want to	  commend	  the Idaho	  Department of Transportation for the road that they have built	  already. The engineering on it is very	  good. As you	  go	  south	  to	  Lewiston, you	  will find	  very few places where you have any drifting on that	  highway. The safety of it is very good. The, you	  have good	  vision	  on	  both	  sides of the road. You	   #  First Name  Last name  Comment  Response  have not got any places where	  you don't have	  good visibility	  as you're	  driving	  that route. The	  E2	  route will be an extension of that, and I think that's another	  reason we would like to have the E-‐2	  route. I think the E-‐2	  route is the preference of most of the majority	  of the major landholders in 	  that 	  area.	  And 	  I	  think 	  it 	  should 	  be 	  a 	  factor 	  to the, to the Idaho Department	  of	  Transportation that	  they take the weight	  of	  the people who are going	  to be	  impacted the	  most by	  this highway. Thank you.  OM-‐3  Johann  Muneta  I'm 	  Johann 	  Muneta 	  and 	  my 	  last 	  name 	  is 	  spelled M-‐u-‐n-‐e-‐t-‐a. Moscow is in some	  ways not as fortunate as our	  neighbors to the south. We live at the	  confluence	  of two mighty rivers, the	  Clearwater and	  the Snake, or our neighbors to	  the north who live on the shores of	  world-‐class	  lakes, 	  Coeur 	  d'Alene 	  and 	  Pend 	  Oreille, 	  but 	  here we do have some advantage. We are happily cradled by	  the scenic	  and wonderful Moscow Mountain and by our treasured Paradise	  Ridge. Can	  you	  wonder why the Moscow community is speaking out to preserve the integrity of our cherished Paradise Ridge area	  from becoming	  the site of	  a four-‐lane 	  highway 	  that 	  could 	  more easily and sensibly be built along the current highway route using alternative C-‐3?	  I speak not as a	  member of any community group, but as a	  concerned citizen. I'm 	  a 	  citizen 	  who 	  values 	  her 	  quality 	  of 	  life 	  and our exquisite and	  natural land	  area, but also	  the safety of our residents and	  the integrity of  See	  response	  for L-‐13  #  First Name  Last name  Comment  Response  businesses and homes along	  the	  route. My question	  now, as it was when	  this was first proposed	  in	  2003, is why, why, why? I know that the Idaho Department	  of	  Transportation is dedicated to providing safe and sure highways for	  both local and not	  local travelers, and we thank the ITD for	  that. But	  that's what	  makes it	  impossible 	  for 	  me 	  to 	  understand 	  why 	  they 	  would choose E-‐2, a	  route with a	  higher elevation subject to more ice, snow, wind, and rain over C3, an alternative that is more satisfactory and will do	  far less damage to	  our culture, our scenery and our environment and our quality of life. The information provided by ITD states, lists the many advantages of C-‐3. This is the one they don't prefer. It requires less new right of way, paves only half as much	  prime farmland,	  has much less noise effects, has less than half of the	  visual impact, 	  provides 	  better 	  emergency response time to local residents. All that sounds pretty good; however, the only substantial claim that's made for	  E-‐2	  is that it’s safer. Now, part of this whole safety business is extremely questionable	  because	  it, a	  lot of it is based, the, the claims you	  just heard of, based on	  weather studies that were made for only onehalf of the winter months starting in	  January in	  2005, an unusually mild year with no snow impact. We all want a highway soon and safe. I	  understand 	  just 	  talking 	  to 	  someone 	  in 	  the 	  other room that one	  of the	  major safety differences  #  First Name  Last name  Comment  Response  between	  E-‐2	  and C-‐3	  is in the number of access points in	  the last five miles, the number of access points that could	  be reduced	  by having a frontage road, and this has not	  been part	  of	  the study or even considered. Everyone I've spoken to joins me in asking ITD to reconsider	  the unwise and	  unfortunate choice of E-‐2. Make the decision	  that would	  be safe and	  at the same time save our natural landmark, preserve Moscow's	  identity 	  and 	  unique 	  natural	  beauty.	  I understand	  that	  even Idaho Fish and Game and the Corps of	  Engineers prefer alternative C-‐3, a	  safer and better choice. We want this highway soon, but it's 	  going 	  to 	  be 	  built 	  for 	  a 	  long, 	  long 	  time, 	  so 	  we want to make a wise choice now. Please, ITD, don't let	  us down and persist	  in making the wrong decision. Thank you.  OM-‐4  Farrell  Byington  Farrell Byington. It's F-‐a-‐r-‐r-‐e-‐l-‐l	  B-‐y-‐i-‐n-‐g-‐t-‐o-‐n.

I	  have 	  read 	  the 	  reports 	  and 	  I'm 	  going 	  to 	  tell	  you what, if I honestly felt that where we live was the route that	  the road would go, I'd start	  looking for	  a	  house	  to buy. Unfortunately, I'm not willing	  to give	  up my	  house	  so that somebody	  could look	  at a	  ridge	  and not see	  the	  highway that goes through there. So all I'm going to say is that	  when you guys are thinking about this discussion, think about in	  the last 	  10 	  years. The last 10	  years there's been 13	  severely debilitating crashes on	  that road	  or 18, excuse me, 18. There’s been five fatalities.

I've picked, I think, 11 vehicles out of our yard. The road needs a change.

To me, that, uh, portion of the	  study was	  majorly lacking. Theres, um, the only point at which C-‐3	  is mentioned is on Reisenauer Hill which all three of the, uh, of the routes would	  pass through, and	  then following that, there's a point on, on	  the easterly side	  and a	  point far on the	  westerly side	  that	  actually isn't	  even on the west	  route that's located 	  in 	  Washington, 	  um, 	  so 	  I	  have 	  a 	  hard 	  time believing that C-‐3	  was given any real credence with the weather study, and just 	  having 	  lived here for a number of years and	  looking up	  towards the ridge, I can tell you the fog settles.

Now that’s, unfortunately, I am no scientist, nor am I providing	  you a	  scientific study, so I'm just astonished that, uh, there	  was only one-‐year study done, 2005.

I mean, uh, ITD you’ve done some good work, but that's a big-‐time hole, a big hole, in the plan, and I	  think 	  we 	  should 	  be 	  talking 	  a 	  little 	  bit 	  about what the safety would look like if we had real weather data, and it's so hard to compare the current roadway	  as	  is, where you've got the situation, unfortunately, of coming down a curve on	  those slopes and	  you	  go	  into	  oncoming traffic and, yes, it's scary and, yes, something	  needs to be done	  about it, it really does; however, um, if we were to have the divided highway, 34 feet in between, I really do	  think we'd	  see a major difference on	  that central route and	  we'd	  get to	  use some of the current roadway that we've already done	  so much work on over the years, and it's unfortunate	  that people	  are	  impacted no matter where you put it, but let's impact the least 	  amount 	  of 	  ground 	  and 	  go 	  with 	  alternative C-‐3.  OM-‐8  Gerard  Connelley  My name is Gerard Connelley.

Improved safety is 	  a major part of the purpose and need of the DEIS, and the	  DEIS	  states that all three	  analyzed alternatives, E-‐2, C-‐3	  and W-‐4, meet the purpose and need.

Um, the DEIS states that 57 percent of the accidents on this stretch of	  the highway occur	  during inclement 	  weather, 	  so 	  weather 	  is 	  a 	  huge 	  factor here in	  terms of safety, and	  weather is not  FHWA and ITD must balance	  both the	  human and natural environmental impacts with the	  safety benefit for the general public.

The weather analysis was updated to clarify the confusion that	  seems to exist. The referenced fivemonth data set is a calibration method to see how the weather	  ranks in relation to the larger	  30+-‐year data set as explained	  in	  General Response Weather2. General Response Weather-‐8	  explains the validity	  of the Weather	  Analysis. The Safety Analyses does consider weather but it is included 	  in 	  the 	  crash 	  factors 	  within 	  the 	  safety model.

General Response  #  First Name  Last name  Comment  Response  included 	  because 	  the 	  DEIS 	  weather 	  analysis concluded that weather is	  not different between the three different	  alternatives. Um, the people, everybody I've	  talked 	  to 	  that 	  lives 	  on 	  Paradise Ridge will argue with	  you	  about that quite vociferously. Um, the weather analysis was done for	  only January to May of	  2005, five months, not	  even one	  complete	  winter, and, uh, this was one	  of the mildest winters in	  recent history. There wasn't even any snow	  on the ground, um, so they were unable to analyze snow because there wasn't any snow	  on the ground, and in addition, only the eastern	  and	  western	  alternatives were included 	  in 	  the 	  weather 	  analysis, 	  not 	  the 	  central	  alternative. Um, so we consider the weather analysis very deficient, and without weather considerations, we consider the safety	  study	  seriously flawed, so, um, we really don't feel that the, uh, safety study can be used, be used reliably to predict	  differences between the	  different alternatives. In	  terms of socio, socioeconomic	  factors	  comparing C-‐3	  to E-‐2, C-‐3	  requires less new right	  of	  way, paves over	  only half as much	  prime farmland,	  much 	  less 	  noise effects, less than half the	  visual impact, 	  more compatible with Moscow land use goals. This	  is	  all in the	  DEIS, and, uh, better emergency response times to local residents. C-‐3	  is 0.09	  miles longer. It's going to be a little slower and, uh, C-‐3	  will dislocate several more businesses.	  Still, by my count, C-‐3	  seems to be superior in terms of	  socioeconomic factors. In terms of	   Weather-‐1	  discusses how the C-‐3	  Alternative was evaluated in the	  Weather Analyses. See	  General Response	  Safety-‐6	  regarding the significance of differences	  in length and safety between	  alternatives. The E-‐2	  Alternative would not directly affect any sensitive plant species	  but would result in the removal of	  3.9 acres of	  planted pine stand while not	  considered sensitive species, do provide habitat for wildlife including pygmy nuthatch,	  long 	  eared myotis and northern alligator lizard. The E-‐2	  Alternative would not directly impact any Palouse	  remnants including the	  Paradise	  Ridge remnant.

Um, C-‐3	  is clearly superior in socioeconomic	  and environmental considerations, and we feel no valid comparison can be made	  with safety between these	  alternatives, so we	  encourage	  ITD to take	  a	  closer look	  at C-‐3	  and, uh, how it might be made even better or safer, for example, by the	  addition of frontage roads.

If you're	  not familiar with the	  Palouse	  Prairie	  Foundation, it's a	  nonprofit organization	  dedicated	  to	  the conservation and restoration of prairie in the Palouse	  bio-‐region. An important	  point	  I'd like to make here is the Palouse Praire is recognized by numerous scientists as an	  endangered ecosystem with less than point or with less than 0.1	  percent of the prairie remaining. Let me repeat	  that, less than 0.1 percent. That's less than a tenth of	  a percent	  of	  Palouse Prairie remains.  ITD 	  recognizes 	  that 	  the 	  Palouse 	  Prairie is 	  considered by many agencies to	  be an	  endangered	  ecosystem as stated in the	  DEIS Section 3.8.3 and that that weeds are a threat to the remaining Palouse Prairie remnants. Mitigation for	  weed dispersal and establishment will involve	  minimizing	  soil disturbance, revegetating bare soils to	  reduce risk of establishment, and species selection 	  that 	  will	  consider quick	  and sustainable groundcover. Additional mitigation	  measures are described	  in	  the FEIS	  Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments. See	  General Response Weeds. More information from the Vegetation Technical Reports has also been added into the	  FEIS	  Sections 3.8	  and 4.8.  #  First Name  Last name  Comment  Response  Um, Palouse Prairie Foundation is 	  unequivocally opposed	  to	  the preferred	  alternative E-‐2. Um, the primary reason we're opposed to it	  is because the technical reports and	  the draft EIS, um, show in	  their, the various analyses that over twice as many prairie frontage will be impacted by the preferred	  alternative than	  by the other routes, C-‐3	  or W-‐4. That's unacceptable to us. The primary way that, um, uh, the prairie is going to be impacted by E-‐2	  in a	  way much more seriously than the other alternatives	  is	  going to be from weed	  infestation.	  If you look at the technical reports and dive into those technical reports, the vegetation technical report, it's very good, I highly	  recommend you get into it, and what is shown in the report by, uh, Dr. Lass and Dr. Prather from the U	  of I is that they predict weed infestation will extend one kilometer on either side	  of each of the	  alternatives. Now, one	  kilometer on each side. The reason why that's very, uh, troubling	  for the Palouse Prairie Foundation is on E-‐2	  because it's further east and because it's higher in elevation,	  closer 	  farther 	  up the ridge, that, that, one kilometer	  zone of	  weed infestation 	  is 	  going 	  to 	  take 	  those 	  weeds 	  right 	  to the top of	  Paradise Ridge,	  not 	  just 	  part 	  way 	  up,	  to the top. And the top of	  Paradise Ridge from people that live around	  here, um, they can	  tell you that's, that’s where the most pristine, uh, pieces of Palouse Prairie reside, the largest patches, the highest quality patches. The technical reports, uh, bear	  this out	  quite well, so  Additional information	  regarding the Palouse Prairie ecosystem including	  more	  recent occurrence	  data	  and potential impacts to pollinators and giant Palouse	  earthworm was added to the	  FEIS	  Sections 3.8.3	  and 4.8.3	  as described in General Response Wildlife.  #  First Name  Last name  Comment  Response  we cannot, uh, accept the	  preferred alternative. I'd 	  also 	  just 	  like 	  to 	  make 	  a 	  statement 	  that,	  uh,	  in the DEIS, it	  says that	  the Palouse Giant	  Earthworm does not occur in the project area. That's completely false. Uh, there's been at least four	  specimens found in the last three years, I believe it's three, maybe four years, but four of them found up on Paradise Ridge,	  two 	  of 	  them 	  in prairie, two	  of them in	  forest. They're up	  there. The report	  also states that	  there's no suitable habitat for the worm up	  on	  Paradise Ridge. That’s complete nonsense. It's absolutely their habitat. That's where they're found. Um, and	  then I'd just	  like to say that	  I would certainly like to see some inclusion, some discussion in the, uh, the next version	  of the DEIS concerning pollinators that's not been	  in	  this report on	  pollinators. I think the reason	  being is there's very	  few threatening	  or endangered pollinators in 	  our 	  region, 	  but 	  nevertheless, 	  flowering 	  plants cannot exist without their pollinators	  and the weed infestation 	  and 	  deterioration 	  that 	  I'm talking about	  here as discussed in the technical reports, that	  will affect	  pollinators. That's going to have effects upon plant	  populations and it's just, 	  it, 	  it’s 	  just 	  a, 	  a 	  food 	  web 	  that's 	  going 	  to 	  be hurt and	  in	  decline from	  this, so Palouse Prairie Foundation is opposed to the	  preferred alternative.

My question today is why ITD would insist on invading 	  and 	  negatively 	  upsetting 	  this 	  ecosystem when they have designed	  two	  other safe, acceptable	  alignments meeting	  state	  and federal highway standards. I would	  like to	  point out that in 	  the 	  DEIS 	  report, 	  it 	  states 	  the 	  Idaho Department of Fish and Game, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Environmental Protection Agency, and	  the Army Corps of Engineers all indicated 	  that 	  their 	  preferred 	  alternative 	  is 	  the central route, C-‐3. Interesting 	  that 	  this 	  information 	  appears 	  in 	  the executive	  summary in the	  DEIS	  in the	  section level	  1.4, 	  alternatives 	  screening, 	  bullet Number 1, public involvement and agency coordination, page 8. Why didn't ITD follow the preference of so many advising agencies? Why did they even consult them? The DEIS report also reveals	  that Idaho 	  Fish 	  and 	  Game 	  has 	  stood 	  up 	  against 	  the eastern alignment from the beginning; however, ITD 	  has 	  continued 	  to 	  pursue 	  support 	  for 	  the eastern alignment, spending	  more	  money, more	  time to try to justify their	  preference. Both Dr.  Army Corps of Engineers has not identified	  a Preferred Alternative	  at this time. The DEIS	  Section 3.8.3	  states the conclusions of the Wildlife experts, that the E-‐2	  Alternative would affect low to moderate	  or marginal quality habitat for	  ungulates. The	  DEIS	  states per the	  Wildlife	  experts conclusions, that there	  is no critical or high quality big game habitat that would	  be affected	  and	  that	  mitigation for	  population level effects was not	  warranted. Information regarding the wildlife experts opinions and	  recommendations are in	  the DEIS and FEIS Chapter 1. See General Response Wildlife-‐1	  and Safety-‐2	  for additional information regarding wildlife habitat	  and wildlife collisions. The clearing of vegetation within the clear zone would be done to	  meet AASHTO standards and will not only increase sight distance but will also	  discourage wildlife from hiding and browsing near the roadway. FHWA and ITD must balance	  both the	  human and natural environmental impacts with	  the safety benefit for	  the general public. General Response Alternative describes why FHWA	  and	  ITD identified	  the E-‐2	  Alternative as the Preferred Alternative. There is no hidden agenda	  for the preference of the E-‐2	  Alternative. The public Involvement under NEPA encourages all	  facets of	  the public to participate in the environmental process.  #  First Name  Last name  Comment  Response  Wayne Melquist, wildlife study done in 2005, and Dr. Bill Ruediger, wildlife	  study done in	  2007, concluded quote, "The eastern E-‐2	  alternative posed	  the largest concern	  for big game among the three alternatives being considered." Not satisfied, ITD	  then went to the outside to garner support. December 2010 they	  hired Hall Sawyer of Western Ecosystems Technology, Incorporated 	  from 	  Cheyenne,	  Wyoming,	  and involved 	  Holland 	  & 	  Hart, 	  LLP 	  of 	  Salt 	  Lake 	  City, Utah. In Hall Sawyer's report, he states quote, "The eastern E-‐2	  alternative posed the largest concern for big game among the three alternatives being considered.” In 	  the 	  executive 	  summary 	  of 	  the 	  DEIS 	  under topics of	  concern and controversy, it	  states quote, "There has been	  disagreement between	  Idaho 	  Fish 	  and 	  Game 	  and 	  ITD 	  regarding appropriate	  mitigation," and this is then, um, explained over quite	  a	  few pages over 20062007. In the safety analysis of the	  DEIS	  in the	  section titled Wild Animal Crashes, it states	  quote, "Alternative 2-‐E, E-‐2	  has potential to have more wild animal crashes than C-‐3	  and W-‐4	  because of the 1.98 mile long length of alternative	  E-‐2	  within ungulate impact 	  area;	  however, a wildlife crash	  countermeasure that clears	  the roadside of trees	  and brush will be constructed"; in other way, in other words, mitigation destroys additional wildlife	  habitat on top of	  that	  destroyed by the four-‐lane 	  highway. Finally, my question goes back to why, why this  #  First Name  Last name  Comment  Response  trail of	  insistence on pursuing the most	  environmentally disruptive	  alignment when other alignments can	  satisfy. What is ITD's hidden 	  agenda 	  here? 	  It 	  is 	  proposed 	  that 	  we request	  our	  local state legislative representatives look 	  into 	  this 	  matter.  OM-‐15  Steve  Ullrich  My name is Steve Ullrich. I'm related by marriage to Mary. U-‐l-‐l-‐r-‐i-‐c-‐h, and	  I'm actually delivering a testimony from Mark Wray and, and his name is, is 	  spelled 	  W-‐r-‐a-‐y, and I'm going	  to read this. It came from an email. He says, "Unfortunately, I'm battling 120 mile an	  hour winds right now and	  I'm 	  in 	  a 	  slow 	  jet 	  on 	  my 	  way 	  home 	  from 	  Philly 	  and Charlotte, so	  won't get to	  Pullman	  until about 6:30	  or 6:40." I	  was 	  going 	  to give	  testimony	  to the	  real weather differences experienced	  on	  the ridge and	  so	  I offered	  to	  give, to	  give his testimony. I have only been	  on	  the west slope for two	  years. We have come to know that the weather difference between	  the current alignment and	  the	  proposed	  is substantial, and	  I would	  edit in	  here that, uh, my two years is much longer	  than the five months January to May 2005 weather	  study. So Mark lives up on Paradise	  Ridge.	  The worst weather differences seem to be when the temperature	  is just above	  freezing	  in Moscow. As you begin to climb, the temperature begins to drop	  with	  about two	  degrees' difference. If there's moisture in the air	  or	  you enter	  the fog as you climb, the temperature is even more drastic, three to four	  degrees. This is because of	  the  See	  General Response	  Weather-‐2	  regarding the referenced weather	  data and how it	  relates to the larger 	  30+-‐year data set. Many	  of your comments regarding weather principles are consistent with and addressed in the	  Revised Weather Analysis. See	  General Response Weather-‐3, Weather-‐4, Weather5, Weather-‐6	  and Weather-‐7	  regarding elevation, temperature, ice, snow, fog and wind, and other	  weather conditions.

See, he's a pilot, so he understands some meteorology. Uh, I believe there was testimony, uh, this afternoon's session that indicated that the	  temperature rises up the ridge and it’s cooler	  down	  below. Well, that's true in	  the summer. We can actually	  see, and Mary	  and I live up on Paradise	  Ridge as well, we	  can see	  10 degrees' difference between, um, where Fountains' airstrip is at the	  point of where, um, the	  South Fork of the	  Palouse	  River crosses, um, Paradise	  Ridge Road	  and	  our house. In 	  the 	  summertime,	  we 	  don't 	  cool	  off 	  at 	  night,	  but in	  the wintertime, it's 	  just 	  the 	  opposite, 	  so when we drove down today, this afternoon, it was 33 at our house. It was 36 by the time we got down to Palouse	  River Drive. Anyways, for experience, I have	  noticed it rain in Moscow and an absolute	  blizzard at my house	  with feet of drifting snow. And	  the issue that, or the that point that Al made about, about no	  snow the year the weather study	  was concerned, um, now the snow and the wet	  and the wind were not	  considered, and you put those together and it makes a huge difference in the drifting possibilities. And	  then	  he says I know that Mary and Steve	  can attest to this, also. Indeed,	  between 	  our 	  two 	  properties,	  we 	  observe about 75	  percent of the	  E-‐2	  route and C-‐2	  or C-‐3.  #  First Name  Last name  Comment  Response  I	  have 	  heard 	  of 	  a 	  stretch 	  of 	  highway 	  in 	  southern Idaho 	  that 	  is	  split four-‐lane.	  The 	  westbound lanes 	  climb 	  up 	  about 	  400 	  feet 	  above 	  the eastbound lanes because	  of the	  topography. Apparently, the accident rate is much	  higher in	  the higher	  side of	  the highway due to the weather changes. Ice due to freezing fog and high	  winds are the biggest reason. Unfortunately, the person telling me this lives in the south, but	  could not	  identify the stretch. She knew it had factual, but no details. I'm to find out more about this and report back with facts later. It 	  is 	  my 	  belief 	  that the weather	  issue for	  safety sake needs	  to be a highly discussed issue. It is	  something that everyone can relate to because of how open	  and	  exposed	  the E-‐2	  highway, the E-‐2	  alternative will be and its elevation changes as it traverses the	  ridge, in	  my opinion, that you	  see much more severe weather than any stretch of this highway.

I needed	  to	  go	  down	  in	  the afternoon to just	  pay a bill for	  something and it 	  wasn’t 	  an 	  absolute 	  need, 	  and 	  as 	  I	  hit 	  the 	  road, 	  I	  got met by	  a	  combination of ice	  on the road, plus horizontal blowing winds, uh, winds coming out of the west and, um, it was scary. I, I had	  an	  allwheel drive car with good tires and I was having a	  difficult time	  staying	  on the	  road. When I passed	  the second	  truck pulled	  off the road, I kind	  of took that as a sign	  that maybe this wasn't a	  good time	  for me	  to be	  trying	  to make	  a	  quick trip down to Lewiston, and right	  at	  Thorncreek, I turned around and I came back to Moscow, again fighting	  the	  winds and driving	  barely 35	  miles an hour on the road. I	  can't 	  even 	  imagine 	  how 	  bad 	  it 	  was 	  up 	  on 	  the ridge above me when it	  was bad enough that	  somebody who grew up driving Idaho roads, I grew up driving	  southern Idaho roads, really	  nasty ones, too, and	  I'm pretty gutsy about what I'll,	  what 	  I’ll	  drive 	  through, decided that	  if	  I didn't	  absolutely have	  to be	  on the	  road that day, it was probably a pretty good idea that I shouldn't, and this was on the	  stretch of road that's down protected	  by the rid-‐-‐,	  by 	  the 	  drainage 	  is 	  where 	  it runs.

It was not identified 	  as 	  the 	  Preferred 	  Alternative 	  due 	  to political, developer or	  personal gain. FHWA and ITD have been	  transparent throughout the EIS process from early scoping through the FEIS development.

It, uh, everywhere else can be clear and there's a clump, like a hat	  of	  clouds, up on the ridge. That	  hat	  of	  clouds which will be fog, which will give freezing rain, which will put a lot of frost is 	  always 	  right 	  up 	  coming 	  to 	  a, 	  a, 	  the 	  brim 	  of 	  the hat right where they want to put this highway, which makes me wonder why in the world are they thinking that	  this is a safer	  way to go. I	  believe 	  that 	  the 	  safety study done was	  flawed. It 	  was 	  done 	  at 	  the 	  wrong 	  time 	  of 	  year 	  and 	  it didn't take into	  account normal conditions for this, for	  this area. Um, I think that	  the safety is also flawed because	  it has not taken into account wildlife collisions, which are also, um, a fairly dangerous thing to	  have happen, and, um, I, I just 	  think 	  that 	  the 	  whole 	  thing 	  is 	  not, hasn't been	  well thought through for, for the, see, how	  am I going	  to put this? We, we	  in Moscow, especially	  all of us on the	  east side	  of Moscow, we	  look up over a beautiful jewel. When we look south, we see this beautiful ridge up	  there. How is that going	  to look	  when it has a	  whole bunch of headlights coming right over the shoulder of it? Our beautiful jewel will be gone. We will have light coming over there. We will have more noise coming from the cars	  coming over there. Um, I personally just don't understand	  ITD's constant insistence upon	  taking  #  First Name  Last name  Comment  Response  this highway over	  Paradise Ridge. I	  think 	  somebody 	  came 	  up 	  with 	  this 	  idea 	  years ago and, and they're	  so invested in maintaining	  this that, that	  we've gone through all of	  this rigamarole and they come right	  back around to what they came up with years ago without really listening 	  to 	  the 	  people 	  who 	  live 	  here, 	  who, 	  who see the ice and the snow up there and keep saying this	  isn’t safe, you need to pay attention to us. So, um, okay. I	  am 	  out 	  of 	  time 	  and 	  I've covered some of the things	  here. Um, yes. But I just want to say that I just think this is a bad idea. I do not	  think E-‐2, I’m not certain as	  to whether which of the other two, um, ones would	  be better. I don't have a strong opinion 	  on 	  that.	  Those 	  of 	  you 	  who 	  know 	  me know that's a rare thing	  for me to not have a strong opinion, uh, but I do have a strong opinion	  that E-‐2	  is a	  poor choice.  OM-‐17  Cindy Great Old Broads for Wilderness  Magnuson  Well, it’s right at my height.

The right-‐of-‐way for the action alternatives was based	  upon	  a conceptual level of detail and	  a worstcase scenario.

It would be comprised	  of two	  12-‐ft. lanes in each direction, a  #  First Name  Last name  Comment  Response  Of all the, all the alternatives, though, I think share a common flaw, though and that is the	  amount of agricultural land that's destroyed.

I, I think I'd 	  simply 	  like 	  to 	  say 	  that 	  I,	  I	  think 	  that 	  we 	  should fit	  the highway to the land and not the	  land to the highway. Apparently, the project director has decided	  that the clear	  space between the two lanes, the four	  lanes, 	  and 	  believe 	  me, 	  I'm, 	  I’m 	  an 	  advocate 	  of safety and safe	  road, I, I understand the	  need for double lanes	  on both sides, but the right of way itself, 	  for 	  example, 	  between 	  the 	  top 	  of 	  Lewiston Hill and Thorncreek Road,	  I	  think,	  is 	  overkill. 	  I	  don't think we need	  something suitable for a military invasion. It's a state highway and I'd just like 	  to 	  conclude 	  by 	  saying 	  that 	  the 	  quality 	  of 	  life iss-‐-‐the quality of	  life issues are important, aesthetics are	  important. Agricultural land once	  altered can never be	  replaced.

Additional mitigation measures are described	  in	  the FEIS Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments.  #  First Name  Last name  Comment  Response  between	  these two	  roles, I have firsthand	  over the decades watched the vegetation in Idaho change. For those of you that don't know	  what a herbarium is, it's like a plant library. Um, the University of Idaho Stillinger Herbarium is the official herbarium for the State of Idaho	  and	  we have over 200,000 specimens, um, that were collected starting in the mid-‐1800's, so what this does is it 	  offers 	  us 	  a 	  historical	  perspective 	  of 	  the changing vegetation in Idaho. Um, when I first began to notice, um, things were rapidly changing around here was probably about the	  time	  that we	  first started talking	  about climate change, about maybe 15 to 20 years ago, and I don't think there's anybody in this room who's been around two or three decades who hasn't noticed	  the changing ecosystems up	  on	  the Selway and the Lochsa River. Before we used to have these beautiful native vegetation stands, now it's full	  of 	  spotted 	  knapweed. Um what, what is being proposed here if we adopt E-‐2	  is the same thing will happen. Um, man-‐made activity opens up disturbed habitat and invasive	  species move	  in. Most of these	  invasive 	  species 	  come 	  from 	  the 	  Mediterranean.	  Native vegetation can't outcompete	  them. Um, probably the biggest problem is spotted	  knapweed. For those of you not aware of what spotted knapweed does, it has	  allelopathic	  properties, it releases a chemical into	  the ground. Within seconds the	  root cap of a	  native	  vegetation explodes.

Additionally, by disturbing land 	  close 	  to 	  one 	  of 	  the 	  largest 	  remaining Palouse	  Prairie remnants, E-‐2	  will invite, uh, will invite 	  invasive 	  plant 	  species 	  to 	  take 	  over 	  native species	  along Paradise Ridge, as	  Tim explained earlier. As shown	  in	  the vegetation	  technical report, weeds will extend to six-‐tenths of	  a mile from the roadbed, and this will take weeds pretty much all the way to the top of Paradise Ridge,	  and as the	  winds in the	  area	  move	  from east to west, or I'm sorry, from west to east, they will  FHWA and ITD must balance	  both the	  human and natural environmental impacts	  with the safety benefit for the general public.

General Response Weather-‐2	  explains the validity of the referenced data set, which was used to rank the larger 	  30+-‐year data set. General Response Safety-‐7	  discusses the validity of the Safety Analyses. General Response Agencies explains why there were differences in	  opinion	  regarding FHWA’s and	  ITD’s Preferred Alternative. However, for clarification, the	  US Army Corps of	  Engineers has not	  chosen a preferred	  alternative at this time.  #  First Name  Last name  Comment  Response  likely 	  blow 	  more 	  seeds 	  over 	  to 	  the 	  top 	  of Paradise	  Ridge	  that will eventually create	  a	  giant invasive 	  weed 	  patch 	  along 	  our 	  beautiful	  Paradise Ridge. I	  strongly 	  am 	  against 	  this 	  and 	  the 	  science 	  proves it.	  It's in 	  the 	  vegetation 	  technical	  report.	  You 	  can read it	  for	  yourself. Uh, this takes, okay, so this invasion 	  will	  further 	  threaten 	  rare 	  species 	  also found on Paradise Ridge,	  including 	  plants 	  and animals. I'm also skeptical on the	  safety analysis compiled using weather data from January	  to May 2005 which was a drought year and one of the most	  mild winters in recent	  history, so the weather component of their safety analysis seems	  to be really flawed, they're only looking at five months during a year	  in which it	  was quite abnormal, much warmer than normal, much less precipitation	  than	  normal, so	  this weather data is, 	  is 	  flawed, 	  and 	  so 	  how 	  can 	  such 	  an 	  analysis based	  on	  this data be anything but flawed, and	  why is there no data from the past	  seven years? Why is there only data from this five-‐month period	  in	  2005? I don't understand. While I do support the realignment of U.S. 95 to make travel safer, I doubt the DEIS findings on weather analysis. I urge ITD to reexamine the flawed safety study and seriously consider the C3	  route as a	  preferred alternative. Idaho Fish and Game, the EPA, the Fish and Wildlife Service, the Army Corps of Engineers, they all prefer the central route. Why	  does	  ITD insist on the eastern route when	  the central route fills the ultimate  While the E-‐2	  Alternative would impact the greatest acres of prime	  farmland soils, the highest producing farm fields are located along the Modified W-‐4	  Alternative as discussed	  in	  Section	  4.3.  #  First Name  Last name  Comment  Response  requirements of	  highway standards and invites less, 	  um, 	  argument 	  from 	  these 	  agencies? The central route has less miles of right-‐of-‐way acquisition required. It's endorsed by several pertinent agencies, the ones that I just listed, and will sacrifice	  less prime	  farmland than the, uh, than	  the eastern	  route. It won't damage the Paradise	  Ridge view as much and will have the least 	  amount 	  of 	  impact 	  on 	  our 	  precious and endangered Palouse	  Prairie.	  Again, I am for making U.S. 95 safer, but I'm	  baffled by ITD's insistence 	  on 	  the 	  E-‐2	  alternative. Don’t pave Paradise.  OM-‐21  David  Sass  Yeah, my name’s David Sass, S-‐a-‐s-‐s.

We keep talking about Paradise Ridge and the	  habitat and	  I'm like okay, so	  I went and	  did	  this little 	  map 	  server 	  search 	  thing 	  on 	  the 	  Latah County. There are 55 homesteads up	  there right now that are on, in	  or near Paradise Ridge. That doesn't count the five homes or businesses at the base of	  Paradise Ridge Road. If 	  there 	  are 	  homes 	  in 	  the 	  trees,	  you 	  can't 	  see them from the air, so I'm only counting the 55 that	  I can actually see. A large facility which I found out	  later	  is a horse arena which is right smack in the middle of all the trees. You can't miss it. Okay, there are five plats of land in the center that appear to be completely	  untouched. A	  sixth	  plat has a road	  going all the way through	  to it	  which leads to a seventh plat	  that’s currently	  been designed, divided into four more	  little 	  pieces 	  of 	  property 	  in 	  which 	  I'm 	  assuming people are going to	  build	  homes on, so	  55 plus four, okay. The heaviest concentration of homes is on the north	  end	  of the ridge, followed	  by the east end. The west side, it looks 	  like 	  there's 	  only 	  eight homes that are facing the west side. Um, so	  from just 	  the 	  visual thing, it	  looks like a pretty good portion	  of Paradise Ridge has already been	  touched. So my question is if	  we're going to leave 	  Paradise 	  Ridge 	  untouched, 	  move 	  the  General Response Displacement-‐1. General Response Safety-‐5	  describes how the different alternatives address safety deficiencies at Reisenauer Hill. The Safety Analysis has been revised since the DEIS was published	  but the findings remained	  valid. See General Response Safety-‐3. As stated	  in	  your comment, there are many private developments on	  Paradise Ridge that	  contribute	  to weed establishment and dispersal. However, FHWA and ITD would not have	  the	  authority to move	  homes off of Paradise Ridge and	  restore it to	  native habitat. More information	  has been	  added	  to	  Chapter 6, Indirect and	  Cumulative Effects regarding the existing and future developments based on the information 	  provided.	  See 	  General	  Response Weeds. General Response Access described the proposed Expressway Access Control and how it could limit development pressures. Additional information	  on	  noise including 	  jake breaks is discussed	  in	  the FEIS Section	  3.12.

And, you	  know, in	  looking at this, Pamela	  Brunsfeld just said, man-‐made activity opens up	  harm to	  native habitat. Every home on Paradise Ridge has had	  some disturbance because they’ve had	  to	  build	  homes. You dig up dirt. You move dirt around. You put things there. Everyone has weeds right	  next	  to their	  house, so if	  we're talking about	  Paradise Ridge, think about the 55 homes that are already up	  there. Every time I look up there, that's all I see. I see these beautiful, gorgeous 500,000, million dollar	  homes up	  there. It's wonderful. That's part of what's up there. Okay, again, as far as me personally is concerned, if it's E-‐2, which to me appears to be	  the	  safest route, I'm okay with losing 	  my 	  home, 	  as 	  long 	  as 	  Idaho 	  Transportation Department takes care of me. From my neighbors' aspect, if we say I'm going to	  be living at the	  foot of a	  very tall embankment leading	  directly to	  the highway, I lived	  on	  a highway before, you	  know what jake brakes feel like? They would shake my entire house. I live in a	  trailer, so it's not	  a house. There's a lot	  of	  things that	  will affect	  us personally, which I will send a letter 	  with 	  that 	  information because I see I have one minute, 10 seconds left. I'm a teacher, so	  I'm used	  to	  watching time. The other question is, if you are coming from Lewiston and you're	  coming	  down Reisenauer grade	  and you're	  turning	  onto Eid Road, I have	  to  #  First Name  Last name  Comment  Response  put my blinkers on	  at	  the top of	  Reisenauer	  and pump	  my brakes for the idiot behind	  me who	  doesn't see that I'm trying to	  turn	  onto	  Eid	  Road. There's many times I've had to turn so fast I had to practically run into the people that, up their	  driveway, so	  I don't spin	  out and	  land 	  turning 	  like this. People do not	  pay attention when you're trying to turn on and off	  the current	  highway. Every other road but E-‐2	  has a	  lot more connecting roads	  into it. The more connecting roads you have, the more accidents you could see. E-‐2	  is the	  only road that has the	  fewest amount of connecting	  roads into it, so I'm saying	  safety is 	  more 	  than 	  just 	  weather.	  Think 	  of 	  all	  the people who	  live along the current C-‐3	  and who they, will be living. Think of	  all the businesses there. It's all about	  putting them all together, picking the best one and	  choosing it and	  if I have to lose my home, I'm okay with that	  for	  the better of the community. Zero	  and	  I'm done. Thank you. Oh, one last comment. If you guys are digging around	  in	  there and	  feeling it, make sure you look	  for the little plastic	  skeleton that we lost 	  last 	  year 	  during 	  the 	  4th 	  of 	  July.	  He's 	  missing a	  couple	  of arms.

We do have a	  T-‐shirt	  say you mess with me, you mess with the whole trailer	  court. So, um, we, um, I have some concerns. I'm very concerned that we need safety improvements.	  I've 	  lived 	  there 	  since 	  1998.	   See	  General Response	  Safety-‐4	  regarding improvements 	  to 	  the 	  existing 	  US-‐95.

All displaced	  residents and	  businesses will be compensated according to the Uniform Relocation  #  First Name  Last name  Comment  Response  Um, multiple times I have had to stop and, uh, on	  some occasions	  I’ve actually	  went into a field and helped a	  young	  man who was ejected from his car and	  he was, like, immobilized	  in	  the field. Um and its very, uh, fortunately, he survived, but, um, it's very frustrating to	  me to	  see this kind of unsafe conditions	  year after year. For the life 	  of 	  me, 	  I	  do 	  not 	  know 	  why 	  Latah 	  County 	  and the highway department, the state highway department, have not straightened	  some curves, put a turn	  lane into	  Eid	  Road, done some basic, simple things. I don't know what, why nothing has been	  done to	  this point. So, um, I, uh, some, I am, the	  environmental concerns, I agree	  with, uh, the closer the Highway 95 is to, uh, Paradise Ridge the greater	  the number	  of	  collisions with wildlife will be. Uh, on the current route I have hit one deer,	  uh,	  right 	  across 	  from 	  Bob 	  Clyde's house. Um, uh, I had	  a near collision	  with	  a moose,	  uh,	  one 	  night. 	  And,	  uh,	  one 	  night 	  I	  was just 	  about 	  run 	  off 	  the 	  road 	  by 	  a 	  large 	  and 	  vicious raccoon. So, so but	  the closer that this	  road is	  to the bedding area of	  the wildlife up on the ridge, you will have a higher frequency	  of wildlife collisions, so, uh, wildlife, uh, management is	  going	  to be	  key	  for that E-‐2	  route. I live directly under the proposed	  E-‐2	  route. I live 	  in 	  a 	  mobile home. Uh, I own	  the mobile home next to	  me. These two homes would be removed.

The	  E-‐2	  route takes up the local water	  supply for	  the community, uh, with a well and that well will need	  to	  be replaced	  or, um, moved, and	  if it is, uh, I would	  like to	  point out that it needs to	  be, uh, put upstream, a hydrologic gradient from the highway so	  that when	  the road	  salt runs off and	  everything	  and it	  will contaminate the groundwater eventually, so that well needs to be	  up, up	  gradient of the highway, and, um, that's all I have	  to say.

Um, uh, there's a lot	  of	  questions raised	  here, who	  and	  then	  whose blood, whose	  hands are	  bloody from the, the	  wrecks and all that. Uh, no one has asked about what's really going on. There's questions who, what, what might explain this, this ridiculous, uh, idea.	  Um, 	  the 	  ITD 	  itself, 	  you 	  know, 	  go 	  to 	  Boise, check	  the reputation of the ITD. 	  The 	  ITD 	  itself 	  is the lap dog of	  industry. It's a water	  carrier	  for	  industry.	  Uh, 	  start 	  thinking 	  about 	  that 	  in 	  this 	  part of the country who	  might that be, who	  might have an	  interest in	  turning the highway into	  something akin, uh, to a slurry line. Y’all anybody know anything	  about mining, know what a slurry	  line 	  is? 	  Well, 	  who 	  might 	  have 	  an 	  interest 	  in 	  this?

I have	  some	  experience, uh, in this area. Obviously, you can't make	  false	  statements, uh, nor can you fail, uh, to disclose material facts. If you look through all this material in the DEIS, the real reason for all this never comes out. The safety stuff as	  its	  been pointed out is obviously a	  sham.

More information 	  is 	  required 	  before 	  ESA listing 	  protections 	  may 	  be 	  provided.	  	  Occurrence data includes not only the Palouse grasslands but also forested areas, areas in the	  North Cascades and Chelan. Regarding your request for the State Attorney  #  First Name  Last name  Comment  Response  Well, why was the power out? It was because a tree had fallen on our	  electrical lines. As a matter	  of fact, all the trees were	  snapping	  behind my house and	  it ended	  up	  getting logged	  because of it. These trees were snapping because so much frost	  had set	  on us for	  days and days of	  us being stuck in a cloud where we didn't see any sunshine. We didn't see anything but fog, and it built on	  the trees and	  built on	  the trees. It went by for months and	  trees snapped	  off and	  busted. There's constantly a	  band of fog out that way. There's constantly weather change difference. I	  ski	  up 	  at 	  my 	  house 	  when 	  people 	  in 	  Moscow 	  are looking 	  at 	  a 	  couple	  of inches. I live	  only 500 foot higher, so	  it's 1,000 foot higher in	  all, but the roads run at	  about	  that	  500-‐foot	  level, and, uh, we, when it's raining here, like right now, marginal rain, it's likely it's snowing up at my house. It's likely it will be snowing where the E-‐2	  alternative	  is going, too, when it's raining	  in this marginal time, so it's not really a safety issue 	  to go up there. It, it doesn't really	  have	  anything	  to do	  with	  safe or science. Now, while I've got a little bit more time, I want	  to say I speak for	  the worm. I found, I found two Giant Palouse Earthworms last year above my house and	  this Palouse earthworm was petitioned	  to	  be put on	  the endangered	  species list 	  and 	  was 	  rejected 	  by 	  the 	  Fish 	  and 	  Wildlife Service	  because	  it	  was too rare. It	  was too rare to bother listing under the Endangered	  Species Act.	   General to investigate conflict	  of	  interest	  corruption, ITD and FHWA have identified the E-‐2	  Alternative as their Preferred	  Alternative because it would have the greatest safety benefit and	  in	  consideration of the human and natural environmental effects. See	  FEIS	  Section 2.6. The project was reviewed by the appropriate legal counsel prior to publication to ensure that NEPA requirements are met.  #  First Name  Last name  Comment  Response  That is what the determination was, so few of them are found. Well, the reason they’re on Paradise Ridge is because it hasn't been	  tilled	  up, because it isn't farmland,	  it's 	  rocks 	  and 	  trees,	  but 	  that 	  species belongs here on	  the Palouse and	  used	  to	  spread	  all over the	  Palouse, but when you till it, you kill it, 	  and 	  if 	  that 	  species 	  is 	  ever 	  to 	  take 	  foothold again on the	  Palouse, we	  need not have	  a	  road that's a barrier	  to stop it	  from spreading through the CRP lands and coming back down. That	  does it 	  no 	  good. I,	  something 	  is 	  fishy 	  here. 	  I	  would 	  like 	  to 	  request that	  the state attorney general investigate this whole thing because it stinks of corruption. It stunk of corruption nine years	  ago. There's	  people who	  had	  a conflict of interest that were working for the ITD who had family members that	  would benefit	  from property sales on the ridge. It	  has never	  been investigated. It needs to be investigated. It should	  be investigated. It's a sham. Audience member: The attorney general is a former	  student	  of	  mine and if	  this goes through, I'll	  be 	  in 	  touch.

I dislodge bee stings from my	  hands. I'm a beekeeper. I dislodge ticks from dogs. What is happening to	  my home and	  my property that I've cared deeply	  about for 25	  years is it is being	  destroyed	  and	  it means a lot to	  me.

My	  motto is	  why	  not  FHWA and ITD must balance	  both the	  human and natural environmental impacts with	  the safety benefit for the general public. General Response Alternative describes why FHWA	  and	  ITD identified	  the E-‐2	  Alternative as the Preferred Alternative.

Of course	  there will be. That's life, but the public good must be served. I've lived out on U S. 95 for two years	  between	  Eid	  Road, right near Eid	  Road, one slick, dangerous stretch	  of highway. I feel bad, I feel terrible for	  those families, friends, individuals that	  have	  suffered losses, deaths, injuries. No one, particularly myself being a proud	  environmentalist does not want to see	  that go on, nor do	  I want to	  see it continue in	  the future. Don't pave Paradise. It's about public safety as much as it is about anything else. Fog, ice, snow, rain, wind, visibility, wildlife crossings, a stretch of highway that is going to	  be built to	  handle speeds	  of 70 miles	  an hour. Speed and weather conditions	  kill. Now I, I’m, I'm going to doublecheck	  my	  notes	  when I go here on the draft environmental impact statement and if I am wrong, I'd like someone to correct me. I believe that	  if	  E-‐2	  is built that current stretch of highway on	  U.S. 95 is going to	  stay the way it is. So	  much	  for	  public safety. So much for	  showing compassion for the men and women and families that	  live along that	  stretch of	  highway. E-‐2, if E-‐2	  is 	  built, 	  the 	  same 	  men, 	  women, 	  and 	  children 	  that are	  testifying	  here	  tonight that still have	  to travel to commute to their	  jobs, to the University, what	  about them?	  I'm an environmentalist. I care	  about you, too, but guess what?	  I don't think ITD cares	  about you. Palouse Prairie,	  we 	  stand 	  to lose 	  a 	  lot.	  It's 	  our 	  job 	  as 	  human 	  beings 	  to 	  give  regarding the effects to wildlife and how wildlife collisions	  were considered in the Safety	  Analyses.

I	  have 	  several	  comments. 	  I'm not going to	  tell you which one I appreciate the best of the three, but I do	  have some comments that I'd	  like everybody to think about. Number one, I had two children go to the University of	  Idaho. They’re, go Vandals, they're Vandal graduates and they would 	  come 	  down 	  to 	  my 	  house 	  and they had friends that	  were from southern Idaho that	  weren't	  very good drivers up here. They weren't experienced and they lost friends on the Reisenauer Hill.	  I	  came 	  up 	  from 	  my 	  job 	  tonight,	  drove 	  all	  the way from Lewiston up here to listen, to give my testimony, and as I was coming up the Reisenauer Hill,	  or 	  was 	  coming 	  down 	  the Reisenauer Hill, it was raining. It was 34 degrees. I	  checked 	  on 	  my 	  car,	  and 	  it 	  was 	  that 	  rain/snow mix and	  I thought hmmm, do	  I continue up, come up here, give my	  testimony, because when I	  go 	  home,	  it 	  will	  be 	  a 	  sheet 	  of 	  ice 	  as 	  you 	  all	  know, so I'm going	  to have to climb very	  slowly	  up	  that road	  to	  get back home.

We are all, most of the landowners, I can't say all, but the	  majority of them really like	  the	  E-‐2	  route primarily because of	  the safety,	  the disruption	  to	  the lives of the people who	  have houses on	  the current Highway 95 and	  who	  will be dislocated	  or moved. We appreciate the people that live in	  trailer courts and	  that area of Eid Road that	  would say, hey, I would be willing to move my place to get	  a decent	  highway from Moscow to Lewiston, and the current road that they have from Thorncreek to the top of	  the Lewiston grade	  is well done, it's well engineered. The snow does not drift on that road badly. And, as I said	  before, when	  we get the wind	  in	  the Palouse and we get	  snow, it's going to be consistent throughout the Palouse, and one of the things that	  the protectors of, uh, Paradise Ridge,	  I	  respect 	  their 	  desire 	  to	  keep	  it clean	  from weeds and other things, but there have been farm families here for	  a hundred years that	  have been	  protecting that environment, spraying weeds, keeping them down, and I wish that the City of Moscow, the City of Pullman, and	  some of those	  other areas would enforce	  their noxious weed laws to keep the seed from spreading out,  #  First Name  Last name  Comment  Response  but I can	  guarantee you	  if those weeds come into	  this area that	  the highway is not	  going to spread them any worse than a combine that	  goes through there and spreads chaff for 50	  feet up in the air. That moves the weeds, also, and it will be a	  magnificent highway and for those of you that really love Moscow and the Paradise Ridge area, you should be saying	  isn't it great that anybody	  that	  comes from	  south to north or north to south can get on that road and see what a beautiful, magnificent area the Palouse is and they can see how well the farmers have preserved	  the Palouse	  and grown crops on it and it's a	  marvelous food-‐producing area.

I live in	  Benewah	  County and	  the chip	  trucks run	  95 all day and	  all night and	  the loggers run	  all day and	  all night and	  I	  think 	  that,	  uh,	  the 	  loggers 	  and 	  the 	  chip 	  truck drivers, uh, may be influencing this more than	  we think. You know, uh, we're talking about a	  short stretch of road. Yes, safety’s 	  important. I made	  some	  notes here. Um, the curves, the steep	   FHWA and ITD must balance	  both the	  human and natural environmental impacts with	  the safety benefit for the general public.

It	  is also the only north-‐south highway in	  the Idaho	  Panhandle and	  therefore must consider truck	  traffic	  as	  well as	  passenger vehicles	  and local circulation.

We	  have	  a	  roadbed. You know, why	  can't we just take that road and take some of the curves	  out, take some of the, you know, we've got the technology	  to do whatever we want, we're humans. We can, we can,	  we 	  can do	  this, you	  know. It might cost a little bit more money, but I'm	  speaking right now for the people who	  can't speak, the children	  and	  the grandchildren of the	  future. You know, if we mess up Paradise Ridge,	  if 	  we 	  go in 	  there and disturb more	  closer to the	  ridge, it's gone. We	  can't replace	  it. We	  can replace	  a	  road every 50 years, every 20 years. We	  can continually	  work	  on that road and improve it as	  more money becomes available, but we can't make more native Palouse. What we have is what's left. The plants, the animals, the whole character of the place is	  what we have left, and yes, I understand that we as citizens can't control the development	  on Paradise Ridge. It's private property. We can hope that maybe the people who have those rock piles up there are sensitive enough to realize that	  they have something unique and want to protect it, but we can control the road. It's 	  our 	  public 	  road. 	  We 	  can 	  have 	  a 	  say-‐so in that, and so I think we	  should consider possibly just  General Response Displacement-‐1	  offers clarification regarding residential and business	  impacts.	  The E-‐2	  Alternative would not go over Paradise Ridge but would be located along its base.

Approximately	  57 percent of crashes	  during the past 10 years occurred	  during inclement 	  weather 	  where 	  the 	  police 	  reports 	  list snow, rain or fog as	  the weather condition during the crash incident, page 116 of	  the DEIS. In the weather study they say that measurements began	  on	  January 1, 2005, and	  are ongoing, but, um, well, this report includes results from the date of measure between	  January 1, 2005, and May 31, 2005. If measurements are ongoing, where are the data for the remaining six or seven years, eight years? Why	  are they	  not included in this current	  draft? Some of	  the studies have been	  updated. That one apparently has not.  See	  General Response	  Weather-‐2, Weather-‐3	  Weather-‐4, and Weather-‐5	  regarding the sampling period	  and	  weather related	  road	  conditions, including 	  snow, 	  and 	  rain.	  	  See	  General Response	  Safety-‐1	  regarding frontage roads on the C-‐3	  Alternative.

The data that supports the report is now incorporated	  into 	  the 	  revised 	  report.	  See	  General Response	  Safety -‐6	  regarding the	  significance of differences	  in length and safety between	  alternatives.  #  First Name  Last name  Comment  Response  The weather study goes on to say the ITD server	  pulled	  and	  downloaded	  data from the three stations	  approximately every five minutes. ITD uploads the data to	  its public website where current weather conditions	  may	  be viewed on the Internet. I just	  went	  there and the page is non-‐existent, so I think that data definitely needs	  to be part	  of	  the study. Um, why are they not	  there? In 	  terms 	  of 	  safety,	  ITD 	  predicted 	  slightly 	  more accidents for C-‐3	  than E-‐2. That did not include the possibility of	  frontage roads and other	  small possibilities that very likely could	  switch	  those numbers around	  to	  make C-‐3, um, have fewer accidents than any of the	  others. This argument is specious. They hang their hat on	  that E-‐2	  is the shortest route, but it's 9/100ths of a	  mile, less than 500	  feet, shorter	  than C-‐3. That's ridiculous to go on that. Resource agencies are against the eastern	  alignment. Fish and Game, Idaho Fish and Game, is 	  strongly 	  against 	  the 	  eastern 	  alignment.	  In 	  a letter 	  to 	  ITD, 	  they 	  say 	  in 	  closing, 	  we 	  feel	  it 	  is important 	  to repeat	  one additional mitigation recommendation we have made in the wildlife assessment and at every other opportunity, we	  recommend avoidance of	  the eastern alignment. It 	  has 	  been 	  IDFG's 	  position 	  from 	  the 	  start,	  a position	  supported	  by recommendations from the other	  resources agencies, that	  the eastern alternative	  will have	  the	  greatest direct and indirect 	  impacts 	  to 	  wildlife 	  and 	  other 	  resources.	   See	  General Response	  Agency concerning the	  differences in	  opinion	  regarding ITD and	  FHWA’s Preferred Alternative.

We recommend avoidance of	  alternative	  alignment E-‐2, and the EPA guidelines include 	  maximizing 	  reuse 	  of 	  existing infrastructure 	  which 	  would 	  indicate 	  using 	  the central alignment. They	  also state it will be important 	  to 	  use 	  extraordinary 	  sensitivity 	  in 	  the design	  and	  placement of the roadway to	  ensure that	  the natural values and functions of	  the area remain intact, one of	  the most	  critical aspects of	  the preservation of	  ecological connectivity. This can best be achieved using avoidance and minimization impacts. Why is ITD not listening to these folks? This is, 	  after 	  all, 	  an 	  environmental	  impact 	  analysis 	  and 	  they're 	  ignoring 	  the environmental studies from what I can see. My final point	  was exactly what	  Mr. Arceneaux noticed, said, is that, is there a way to	  fix the existing	  alignment with a	  smaller footprint?	  I can't remember, Mr. Macdonald who also said that	  the lanes don't	  have to be so far	  apart	  and I think that	  would be the, the preferable option, but it's not included	  in	  this draft DEIS.

Okay, uh, every coin needs	  another side and I'm usually	  the other side of things. Um, my family and I have lived in the corridor	  for	  close to 30 years. It's always been	  a safety issue.	  I	  was 	  there 	  when 	  the 	  Lapwai	  school bus	  fell on its	  side on the Reisenauer Hill corner and slid down	  into	  the side.

As was pointed	  out	  earlier, we sit	  there at	  the bottom of Paradise Ridge and watch everybody build	  on	  the ridge. There's roads into	  each	  one of those homes. There's weeds along each side of	  those driveways. It	  does not	  make sense. What	  it	  boils down	  to in my viewpoint	  is the ridge.

I'm a citizen of Moscow and I need a script. I tried to cut it down to	  four minutes. I have not reviewed	  a	  great deal of the	  DEIS, but as someone	  who has commuted nearly	  every	  week	  day	  on U.S. 95 between	  Moscow and	  Lewiston	  for 23 years and	  someone who has	  been a citizen of Moscow for nearly 30 years, I feel I can	  offer some	  relevant perspective.

We have been	  hearing and	  reading a lot in	  letters to	  the editor, in 	  the 	  DEIS, 	  and 	  so 	  forth 	  about safety concerns. I'm 	  obviously 	  as 	  concerned 	  as 	  anyone 	  about safety since I've spent thousands	  of hours	  driving this route. Safety on our	  highways is a paramount issue, so	  I ask these questions, keeping	  in mind that we are being	  told this is for the most	  part	  all about	  saving lives and we are putting our trust in	  ITD. Why was the speed	  limit going	  down to Lewiston hill on 95 raised from 55 to 60 when we know that	  higher	  speeds mean more serious collisions? We were told at least in media reports that it was because	  motorists were already driving at 60, so the speed limit was altered to reflect that. We were told years ago that this was also the	  rationale	  for increasing	  the overall speed limit	  on 95 from 55 to 60 between	  Lewiston	  and	  Moscow. Can	  you	  imagine if 	  all	  traffic 	  laws 	  were 	  determined 	  by 	  this criteria? Now to throw out turn signals	  and dimming your bright lights, right? Next question. Where are the passing zone and no	  passing zone signs on	  95? They would	  be extremely helpful, especially for drivers not familiar	  with the road and also because some of	  the passing zones seem unsafe. Next, why is there no signage as motorists approach Reisenauer Hill warning them of the dangerous grade	  and curve? A simple	  flashing	  warning	  sign on	  the north	  and	  south	  end	  of the hill should	  have been	  in	  place decades ago.  collisions	  and how they	  were considered in the Safety Analyses. See	  General Response	  Agency regarding differences in 	  opinions 	  regarding 	  FHWA’s 	  and 	  ITD's 	  Preferred Alternative. The comment period was extended to March 23, 2013.  #  First Name  Last name  Comment  Response  Finally, more	  importantly, is the	  infamous northbound	  passing zone going down	  Reisenauer Hill.	  As you know, there's already a passing lane coming up the hill, which is dangerous enough, but this passing zone going down	  the hill, while someone who is	  reckless	  enough to make the decision	  to	  pass, cross over into	  the oncoming lane 	  and 	  attempt 	  to 	  complete 	  the 	  pass 	  in 	  a 	  very short distance just before the road curves	  sharply to the east. I have actually seen a close call on the hill when a semi was	  trying to accomplish the	  maneuver. Can an ITD engineer please explain	  to	  me why this zone was created	  and, more	  importantly, why they haven't simply painted	  a no	  passing stripe on the road to eliminate	  this incredible	  danger? I've 	  posed 	  this 	  question 	  to 	  several	  ITD 	  officials tonight	  and they all said the same thing, good question. We're talking about lives here. I'm concerned that ITD picked the Paradise Ridge route and was committed to it	  from the beginning and	  that their DEIS reflects a bias towards E-‐2. I'm concerned that more motorists will die on the E-‐2	  route because of more snow, more ice, more fog, and more wildlife on Paradise	  Ridge	  and, of course, more wildlife will die as well, and	  I'm concerned	  about environmental impacts. It 	  is 	  my 	  understanding 	  that 	  I	  and 	  other 	  individual	  citizens	  are not alone when it comes	  to these concerns	  as	  has	  been pointed out. Fish and Game prefers the C-‐3	  alternative, as does Fish  #  First Name  Last name  Comment  Response  and Wildlife	  and even the	  EPA which is why we're doing this, because of NEPA. After all, this is an	  environmental impact statement we are discussing today. I request that ITD 	  extend 	  the 	  comment 	  period 	  for 	  the 	  DEIS 	  and select an alternate route to	  E-‐2	  for the sake of the environment	  and the safety of the public.

I wouldn't like to see a four-‐lane 	  highway 	  cutting across there. I	  do 	  not 	  believe 	  it's 	  the 	  safest 	  alternative because I believe IDT forgot to	  take an	  important thing into account, both with weather, but also with the E-‐2	  alternative, the existing roadway would still exist, meaning it may have 10 percent  FHWA and ITD must balance	  both the	  human and natural environmental impacts with	  the safety benefit for the general public.	  General	  Response Alternative describes why FHWA	  and	  ITD identified	  the E-‐2	  Alternative as the Preferred Alternative.

There are no more existing deaths on	  that road, because that road	  is now straightened. So I think the IDT has	  not really carefully	  considered the total amount of deaths	  that's going to occur	  on the E-‐2, plus I live north of town, I look at Paradise Ridge every day when I	  drive 	  to 	  work. 	  There 	  is 	  often 	  a 	  fog 	  bank,	  um,	  especially in the	  wintertime, that wraps in a	  donut shape around	  that hill because it's the most uplifting, this orographic lift, just like Seattle	  has tremendous snow on the west	  side because the winds lift there, and	  that road	  is higher and	  it's going to	  be, its going to	  be wetter.

There's far more snow on Paradise Ridge right	  now than	  there is on	  Moscow Mountain	  or in	  the town of	  Moscow because it's higher, so I think I would like to see the road not even go over Reisenauer Hill.	  I think that would be safer, but I  #  First Name  Last name  Comment  Response  don't see that that's a possibility at this point, but I still think the C-‐2	  is being lower, 	  it's 	  away from wildlife.

Um, I live 	  south 	  of 	  Moscow 	  in 	  the, 	  um, 	  the 	  study 	  area, uh, just south	  or just north	  of Snow Road.	  Jack Flack is one	  of my numbers, uh, neighbors. A number of other people in	  here are neighbors, also. Here’s my comments, uh, that I want to make are, um, to identify some of the kinds of things that	  go on, on Highway 95 right	  now and how they potentially relate to	  what the different alternatives are	  there. Uh, this last year I lost the roof off of	  both my garage	  and my	  house. We	  are	  not more	  than 100 feet	  off	  of	  Highway 95, probably, what, a quarter	  of a mile south	  of, of Snow Road,	  the 	  entrance there. What	  I want	  to make there is that, uh, we have this narrow corridor there. The elevations change somewhat, but what you see at the lowest 	  elevations 	  you 	  also 	  see 	  at 	  the 	  highest elevations. I’ve 	  watched 	  fog 	  roll	  from 	  the 	  top 	  of 	  Paradise Ridge all the	  way down, uh, to our drainage	  area. Uh, in that area down through there on the east	  side of, of the ridge there, there is	  a drainage area	  and it goes all the	  way down to the	  breaks of the, of the river, so	  the point being that, uh,  General Response Weather-‐3, Weather-‐4, Weather5	  and Weather-‐6	  discuss the general weather patterns in	  the study area. Lowering	  speed limits is addressed in General Response Safety-‐4. The Safety Analysis has been revised since the DEIS was published but the findings remained valid. See General Response Safety-‐3.  #  First Name  Last name  Comment  Response  you know, we talk	  a lot about the weather issues that	  are on there. Depending on the time of	  year, depending	  on the time of day, you’re going	  to see the same conditions at	  each elevation, and so the	  point I want to make	  there	  is that there isn’t	  a whole lot	  of	  difference when you look 	  at 	  the 	  cumulative 	  pattern 	  of 	  weather 	  from, uh, for the entire	  season. The other point I want to make is that, uh, people have this tendency to	  think that that is a four-‐way freeway down through there. Um, my wife was almost rear ended a couple of weeks ago. Uh, she	  was turning	  into our place	  and across traffic	  and there was	  a white pickup that came down through there and she had her turn signal on, was	  tapping her brakes	  from the top of, uh, the hill where Barbers live, uh, as we were headed	  south, and, um, she the, the, she’s the one that was in	  the car, I was	  at work, but anyway, the	  pickup didn’t see	  her and she’s got a	  big white Suburu	  and	  it was a black pavement, and uh, just beside	  the	  pull-‐off area where the mailbox, which is not longer there because we can’t keep a mailbox	  up, therefore, we have to use a	  post office	  box, the	  pickup took that side	  at a	  very fast rate	  of speed, honking	  his horn all the	  way. Well, that’s human nature in the sense that people tend	  to	  think, um, that they own	  the road	  and how dare	  somebody be	  turning	  in off of that particular road, so the point	  is that	  human nature is not going to	  change just, uh, because  #  First Name  Last name  Comment  Response  we put in a four-‐way highway. What we are going	  to see	  is, uh, that even if you reduce, uh, the speed limit	  on that	  road, people are still going	  to go down through there. Right now the speed	  limit on	  that road	  is 60 miles an hour in front of our place. We routinely have people go	  down	  through	  there at 70 and	  75 mile an hour, and when I go to pull onto the road, I basically, uh, don’t	  move until I can’t	  see anything	  coming	  down the hill. Okay, I have 14 seconds, 13 now, so the point I want to make here is that that is a cow	  path. Putting a	  four-‐lane 	  road 	  down 	  through 	  a 	  cow path	  with	  all its curves and	  everything else doesn’t change the issue or the problem.

Public involvement is an	  important part of  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  personal reasons, uh, number one I guess, is that the fact	  that	  the other	  two routes would take out	  my house, um, the house that we love living at so, uh, that would	  probably be the primary reason	  for us. But there’s many factors that come in	  effect on	  that. Uh, over the past, uh, six years living at this house, we’ve had to open our	  house up many times, uh, at	  one or	  two or three o’clock in the morning, at 10 o’clock at night because of accidents that happen on the	  hill. Uh, four times we’ve pulled cars out of our yard, uh, twice we’ve had	  two	  vehicles that rolled	  over in	  our field, uh, that	  were injuries. We’ve also had to go up and assist for accidents on the	  hill every time	  there’s, there’s snow or	  icy conditions. Um, we have four	  young	  children and of course the concern is that, uh, the hill being where it is right now, why we’re pro	  moving it to	  begin	  with	  is, uh, I’ve got a teenage boy that’s going to be driving in about	  three years, I don’t	  want	  him pulling out	  onto 95, and then, too, is I don’t want anybody to come	  crash through my	  house in the middle of the night and injure	  any of my kids. So that brings us down to location and where we should go. I, uh, spent quite a bit of time reading the ITD, uh, environmental impact statement. Uh, from what I could, uh, ascertain from there, it’s	  one of the best research	  projects I think I’ve had	  the, the privilege of reading. Everything’s suggesting that	  E2	  is going to be the safest, the shortest, the least expensive	  and the	  least disruptive	  alternative	  to go.

They have no vested interest in the direction that the route should go. Where, uh, 80 percent	  of	  us that	  have a vested interest	  in it	  have already reported to	  the ITD that we want the road	  to	  go	  on	  E2 and	  I think that that’s, that’s valuable. Now, if 	  we 	  look 	  at 	  the, 	  the 	  safety record of, uh, Reisenauer Hill or the, the E2, uh, progression, we’ve had in the past ten years and I gotta look at my notes here. In	  the past ten	  years, we’ve had, uh, do-‐do-‐do, sorry, uh, well let’s look at the report. The report	  says that	  E2 is going to reduce the accident	  rate by 69 percent, uh, which I think’s pretty powerful. That	  translates to four	  less 	  deaths 	  a 	  year,	  13 	  less 	  severely 	  dilapidating crashes	  and 150 less	  accidents	  over a ten year period. We’ve had, uh, I should	  have numbered	  these darn things. Okay, safety is really ultimately the main reason why IDT and why, uh we’re even considering moving this	  road and	  why this is an	  issue.	  Three 	  of 	  the 	  top 	  thirteen 	  most 	  dangerous half-‐mile segments in all of Idaho, Idaho highways are	  found in the	  five	  miles that we’re	  talking	  about. Considering	  Idaho’s terrain and climate	  this is remarkable. The high accident	  rate are due to many private accesses, curves, hills, bad weather conditions and ever increasing traffic volume. Five fatalities and 18 severely	  dilapidating	  injury 	  accidents 	  have 	  occurred 	  since 	  the 	  current code, court imposed the de-‐-‐,	  delay 	  of 	  the 	  road  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  project nearly ten years ago. Most of us will remember	  that, not	  too long ago, there was a young	  family	  lost on Reisenauer Hill and they’re not included	  in	  these statistics. The preferred	  alternative, route	  E2, is the	  safest and is estimated to reduce	  accident rates	  by 69 percent, the most	  of	  any of	  the alternatives offered. That	  would translate into four less deaths, 13 less severely dilapidating crashes, 150 less	  accidents	  over the past 10 years. More of these tragic crashes	  are projected to occur in the future as traffic volume increases. E2 is clearly the safe, safest alternative of all that’s	  offered. It’s	  the straightest, the flattest, the shortest, the least expensive	  route	  with the	  fewer accesses and, and it 	  will	  have 	  the 	  least 	  poorer 	  of 	  the, 	  of 	  the 	  weather conditions. E2 is the only route that eliminates Reisenauer Hill which	  minimizes curves and	  has minimum	  number of accesses and the most favorable for	  conversion to no access status for	  the generations that	  are behind us. I think that	  in our opinion, uh, my wife’s and mine, and she’ll be in 	  here 	  to 	  talk 	  later, 	  I	  think 	  that, 	  that 	  the 	  major concern from what I’m seeing, is	  that people are concerned about the visual effect of a	  highway. Uh, who cares about the visual effect when we’re talking about	  safety for	  those people that	  are driving it on	  a daily basis. The environmental mitigations required and proposed on route W4 have 29 mitigations that will be required, on	  route C3, 30 mitigations that are required, and	  on	  E2, 29 mitigations that are required. So	  in	  speaking  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  about the	  environmental concerns and the	  mitigations involved in that, uh, all three routes are	  equal. Uh, W4, of course, offers, uh, more	  damage to	  the lower lands and	  is probably worse for	  the environment. I ride my horse throughout the whole Paradise Ridge area as well as the entire, um, uh, ten mile	  radius around Reisenauer Hill and I can tell you that I’ve seen all of the exact same species	  in my valley which is	  the valley right next to	  Reisenauer Hill as I have up	  in	  Paradise Creek. Uh, in fact, I’ve	  seen more. I’ve	  never seen a	  moose while riding through Paradise Creek and I’ve 	  had 	  to 	  chase 	  moose 	  out 	  of 	  my 	  yard 	  at 	  my house right next to	  Reisenauer Hill. So, my opinion	  is, that, uh, we should	  make the route E2 and if you don’t own any	  property	  on that route, then stay out	  of	  that	  business, because it’s really not yours. That’s my opinion.  V-‐4  Diane  Baumgart  My name is Diane Baumgart. I reside in the city of Moscow at 494 Ridge Road. Um, I am a supporter of the C	  through, uh, C3 alternative. I believe that we have the technology and the knowledge to make that route safe and	  it meets all the criterion	  of not using prime farm land, no	  environmental impact, 	  um, 	  that 	  many 	  of 	  us 	  are 	  considered about. But in looking	  at all the	  three	  options, and coming from a construction, a commercial construction family, and a mortgage company family for	  50 years, I was taught	  to ask this question	  “Qui bono? Who	  benefits?” It’s often	  a consideration in construction projects	  and historically especially in	  government funded	   FHWA and ITD must balance	  both the	  human and natural environmental impacts	  with the safety benefit for the general public. General Response Alternative describes why FHWA	  and	  ITD identified	  the E-‐2	  Alternative as the Preferred Alternative. The Safety Analysis has been revised since the DEISwas published but the findings remained	  valid. See	  FEIS	  Section 4.10	  and the	  Revised Safety Analysis. See General Response Safety-‐3	  and Safety6. Regarding the project benefits, all action	  alternatives would benefit the traveling public by improving safety and capacity. All action alternatives	  would be designated	  as Expressway Access control, which	   #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  projects. So	  I looked	  at the landowners affected	  by each of the routes and	  it appeared	  to	  me that avoiding	  the	  W4	  route	  and the	  C3	  route	  gave	  an immense 	  benefit 	  to 	  primarily 	  two 	  landowners whose land is currently west of our current Highway 95. Those landowners, according to Latah County	  Assessor’s Office, are	  Mr. Germer of Palouse	  Developers, LLC and, uh, Sherman Clyde. They both have their land plotted out. Mr. Sherman has already plotted and developed one	  parcel of his farmland and with 95	  vacated as a	  U.S. Highway and a count, and I was told it 	  would then turn into a county road, both of	  those landowners 	  who 	  already 	  have 	  planned 	  to 	  develop their	  land have much cheaper	  access to their	  land, in 	  terms 	  of 	  development.	  Mr.	  Germer 	  for residential and Mr. Clyde’s land is currently in development for residential development. Previously, Mr. Germer had tried to develop his land 	  with 	  the 	  hopes 	  of 	  getting 	  a 	  road 	  and 	  a 	  bridge off of Palouse River Drive but the Latah	  County and the	  Moscow city taxpayers said no to that two to five million dollar	  project	  so his land	  is currently	  landlocked and unavailable to be developed	  without some kind	  of access road. W4 divides his property, uh, in	  half which	  makes it much less valuable in terms of being split up, but also residential property development in a	  rural setting 	  next 	  to 	  a 	  large 	  major 	  highway 	  isn’t 	  as development, as desirable for residential property. So	  I have serious questions about all the other alternatives. I strongly support  would purchase access rights and reduce development pressures. However, development is regulated by the land use regulations of	  the local jurisdictions.	  	  See 	  General	  Response 	  Access-‐1. Additional detail regarding indirect and	  cumulative effects has been added to Chapter 6, Indirect and Cumulative effects.  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  straightening C3 and making it set, making it safe, and I strongly hope	  that the development ties between	  the city, ITD and	  the various state organizations are not resulting in	  an	  undue influence 	  in 	  the 	  steering 	  away 	  from 	  C3 	  as 	  a 	  route for	  this highway. Thank you.  V-‐5  Don  Meyer  Ok. My name is Don Meyer. Uh, I live here in Moscow and, uh, I’ve lived in this area just about my entire	  life. My family owns farmland on	  the other side of the ridge from where, from where the proposed E2 route is going to take place. But	  it 	  doesn’t 	  really 	  impact 	  me 	  personally 	  from 	  that, that	  area but, um, what	  I think I have a perspective, uh, because of, uh, working in the construction business	  for 21 years	  and a lot of that	  was laying out	  road beds and stuff	  and to me and as well as having	  owned a, a, a	  trucking	  company	  for 15 years, and to me, it makes	  the most sense to go with the E2	  route because my experience, uh, driving	  through that area	  and, uh, working around there is that contrary to what some of the proponents	  against that route state, that	  it	  is gonna to be the safest, the most	  direct. Uh, in my opinion, there’ll be the least amount of ice 	  up 	  there 	  because 	  in 	  my 	  experience 	  driving through that	  area, uh, in the mornings if	  you get	  some kind of weather inversion, all of the ice and fog is in the lower	  spots, not	  up high on the ridge. And, uh, driving Highway 95 for many years,	  I’ve never, ever seen	  ice, even	  in	  the winter time, very seldom up on the high spots. That’s	  where it melts first in the day time because of the sun and,  General Response Alternative describes why FHWA and ITD identified the E-‐2	  Alternative as the Preferred Alternative. Your observations regarding elevation, fog and ice are	  consistent with the	  findings of the	  Weather Analyst. The weather, including elevation, ice and	  fog are clarified in General Responses Weather-‐3	  and Weather-‐5. The Safety Analysis was revised and the E-‐2	  Alternative would	  still have the greatest safety benefit. See General Response Safety-‐3. General Response Safety-‐6	  describes the significance of the difference in	  length	  and	  cost between alternatives. Residential and	  business impacts were reviewed	  after the	  DEIS	  public hearing	  and are	  described in the	  General Response Displaceent-‐1.  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  uh, it doesn’t usually come back, uh, with	  the different types of weather. It’s, uh, gonna be in	  the shaded spots	  and the low spots	  so to me that’s gonna to be the safest	  route, probably the most cost effective to build because it impacts fewer, uh, buildings and homes that	  are gonna have to	  be moved. It impacts fewer, uh, road	  crossings	  which makes	  the road bed, uh, more expensive	  to build. Um, you can cut costs because	  you’re gonna have most of your onsite dirt you can use for fill. You don’t have to haul it in and, uh, it just makes a lot of sense on	  a lot of levels, it’s 	  gonna 	  be 	  the 	  safest 	  route 	  and, uh, I, I think, that	  that’s what	  we gotta, we’ve lost	  too many people out there on	  that lower route, road	  and	  even if you straighten it out, I don’t think that’s going	  to change. You’re	  still going	  to have, uh, uh, problems, you’re gonna have accidents out	  there if 	  they 	  keep 	  that 	  low 	  route 	  because 	  that’s 	  where the ice and, and fog build up is normally. Plus, you’re gonna impact a lot more people, and, uh, destroy a lot more homes that way.  V-‐6  Roy  Druffel  Hi, I’m Roy Druffel. I’m a representative of Norm, of Norm Druffel and	  Sons.

The, the far east one, the one up on the Butte is by far taking the less amount, if, if you’re a	  farmer, is taking	  for sure	  the	  least valuable	  farmland out	  there. Uh, uh, eeh, uh, we think, as we are truckers also, we think safety is 	  a 	  huge concern of this	  and we think	  it would be wonderful to keep the road at one level and head down	  to	  Moscow on	  it. The middle route, I can	  see the viability of the middle route. Uh, they’re creating a few more up and downs, passes	  in that route. Uh, as we are trucker	  or	  traveler	  wise, these new, new things do go up and down better	  than they used to, but	  you are going to have to, uh, uh, uh, it, it’s not going to	  be as safe as the top road. I think safety is a big key, I think that	  the property owners, the land	  up	  there is, is more marginal and at the, the final thing I want to say is that	  we went	  through a condemnation before, uh, from the government	  and taking farm ground from us and, uh, we know that	  the valuations of	  farm ground is, is to everybody’s benefit 	  to 	  be 	  low on	  it.

Uh, I have been a	  resident	  for	  off	  and on in Moscow for	  59 years. I, uh, was both born and raised in Moscow	  and as a kid, uh, they	  had talked about, I guess, northsouth route through Idaho and it’s	  been talked about for many, many years. And, uh, uh, now it’s, 	  uh, 	  we’re 	  getting 	  to 	  the 	  point 	  where, 	  uh, 	  we have routes selected	  and	  it just seems to	  me that it 	  needs 	  to 	  be, 	  uh, 	  a 	  decision 	  needs 	  to 	  be 	  made.	  And, uh, E2, uh	  can	  provide a safe, uh, highway. It needs to	  be, uh, completed	  and, uh, I guess one of the things that	  I’m concerned about	  is just	  creating a safe highway. Uh, six or seven	  years ago, I slipped on, uh, on March 9th, I, uh, slipped on, there was some black ice, and, uh, slipped	  and	  broke two	  vertebraes. So	  I have had, I wouldn’t want to wish this on anybody. I’ve had two, uh, seven and a half hour surgeries	  and I’m not quite the same as I was and I think it, it’s part	  of	  living on	  the Palouse is dealing with	  ice and	  snow but we need to really, um, uh, provide a safe and efficient, uh, roadway to, uh, for commuter traffic and, uh, and I’m thinking	  that the	  E2	  is the	  most, the best	  choice. And I think it	  would benefit	  the whole community. That’s, uh, my thought, and, uh, and	  why not make it a win, win	  situation	  for everyone. And, uh, mitigate	  and find some	  additional east prairie	  land and, and maybe	  it could be even something, uh, really positive by, uh, you	  know, put a positive spin	  on	  it and, uh, create, uh, some signage that, you know, for  FHWA and ITD must balance	  both the	  human and natural environmental impacts with	  the safety benefit for the general public. General Response Alternative describes why FHWA	  and	  ITD identified	  the E-‐2	  Alternative 	  as 	  the 	  Preferred 	  Alternative.	  	  General Response Schedule regarding the environmental process and the	  next steps.

And, uh, you	  know this could	  be a really good, uh, thing for, for	  Moscow and that’s why I, I really support the E2 alternative. It	  could really, uh, give uh, help business, uh, and, just be a real positive thing for, for	  uh, for	  Moscow I guess. For	  one of	  the good things about	  the E2, uh, in some of	  the documentation	  that I’ve read	  is that the E2 would result	  in the greatest	  travel time reduction, shorten travel time would be a good thing, the vitality	  of the area, can benefit great transport, emergency service	  response, school access, bicyclists,	  pedestrians in 	  the 	  whole 	  area.	  The 	  C3 alternative	  would have	  the	  highest predicted fatal injury 	  and 	  total	  crashes 	  of 	  all	  the 	  actual	  alternatives. The	  C3	  alternative	  would be	  the	  least safe because the extra intersections, approaches	  and suburban section would create turning traffic	  across U.S. 95. The	  E2	  alternative	  would have	  the	  shortest [word inaudible] and the fewest public	  road intersections, the fewest	  commercial and residential approaches, would have better	  weather conditions for roadway safety,	  compared to W4. E2 would also have the greatest	  length of	  four-‐lane 	  divided 	  highway.	  These 	  factors 	  all	  contribute to E2 having the lowest predicted crash rate compared to other alternatives. The E2 alternative	  is predicted to reduce	  the	  crash rate	  of the existing road by about	  69 percent.  V-‐8  John Hidden Village  Thomas  My name is John Thomas.

And our water quality,	  uh,	  from 	  the 	  run 	  off 	  in 	  the 	  salt brine solutions. Some of those, uh, issues related	  to run off	  with the highway being to the east	  and, and down sloped, uh, also there. I guess the	  second thing would be just the quality of life from impact 	  from 	  noise from the overpass, um, and, uh, um, what impact that would	  be. The third	  thing would be access for	  the residents that	  have immediate 	  access 	  to 	  I-‐90, or excuse me, to 95, uh, north	  and	  south. Some of our residents do	  work in 	  Lewiston 	  and, and, and some, uh, work in Moscow, so the access issue is a concern, also. And, um, I think the final thing, is is my experience with the weather there, that, uh, I think that two things that	  are kind of	  being missed here is that	  the weather, uh, at, at	  that level, it, it, it does have a dramatic change where E2 is and	  even	  though it’s a straighter	  road and a faster	  road, you combine that with the weather, you could have increased 	  accidents.	  Uh, 	  it 	  just 	  kind 	  of 	  appears 	  to me that, uh, that if, if, uh, this most direct route might be the fastest, but I, I think there are some issues 	  here 	  to 	  be 	  looked 	  at.	  I	  think, 	  I	  don’t 	  think  wells are not contaminated.	  If wells are affected they would be relocated or	  decommissioned according	  to IDWR regulations. The	  quality of life	  considerations	  including visual and noise impacts 	  are described	  in	  the DEIS 4.11 and	  4.12 respectively and	  will	  be 	  considered 	  during 	  the 	  design 	  process 	  as practicable. Vegetation removal will be minimized where practicable. See DEIS and	  FEIS Section	  4.11 Visual Effects. While travel times for	  residents on Eid Road are not	  anticipated to change, access	  safety on	  or off of US95	  would be greatly improved.

I’ve been involved with the Snow property south	  of Moscow for about 54 years now. My	  wife’s family	  has been involved there for	  about	  136 years so it	  is an area that	  we are	  very familiar with and pretty fond of and we	  think it	  is very important	  that	  the Idaho Transportation Department knows that we are very	  happy	  with the way	  that they	  have gone about the	  environmental study. We	  are	  hoping	  that	  they can go ahead and get	  this plan okayed and continue	  on and get us into a	  very safe	  highway soon. Our prime concern	  is the safety of the highway and getting it	  built	  soon. Those are primary concerns for us. We also	  are concerned	  about the	  safety of the	  different routes. We	  think, uh, our natural, uh, preference is the E2 route, the farthest	  east	  route. We think that	  would be the safest	  route. We think it	  would, uh, disrupt	  the people involved that	  own the land in that	  area  See	  General Response	  Schedule	  regarding the	  environmental process and next steps. The	  Safety Analysis was revised and the	  findings remain valid as described in the FEIS Section 4.10 and the Revised Safety Analysis.

We think it	  probably would	  be, uh, in	  terms of the environment, probably, uh, disrupt less of the	  native Palouse prairie and	  the good	  Palouse	  soil that	  we farm down in the lower	  flats and, uh, the area	  that we	  are	  involved with. We’re	  also concerned that, uh, the coalition to save Paradise Ridge is, 	  uh, 	  keeps 	  missing 	  the 	  fact 	  that, 	  uh, they’re very concerned that	  people in	  Moscow feel that	  the, uh, weather	  conditions are different	  up	  on	  the ridge than	  they are on	  the other two	  routes and I would like to say that	  in our	  54 years of living in	  this area that we’ve observed	  that, uh, the western route would be the coldest	  route. The current location of the highway 95	  is, uh, not quite as cold, but a little colder, uh, a little warmer and the eastern route would be the warmest route because of the increased elevation. You, we’ve	  observed from our kitchen dining room that we	  eat dinner, breakfast, and all of our meals at as we look right out directly at, uh, Paradise	  Ridge	  that usually the	  fog level, when they do have fog on Paradise Ridge, it, uh, is usually somewhere above 3,000 feet elevation	  and it may drop down to, uh, the twenty-‐eight, twenty-‐nine hundred	  level but when	  it does, we usually have fog in	  the whole area. The snow line is 	  similar 	  to 	  that.	  The 	  snow 	  line 	  usually 	  is 	  about twenty-‐eight hundred to twenty-‐nine hundred	  feet	  and sometimes up to 3,000 and I think that	  that	  would not	  be any problem in terms of	  the safety for the E2 route. We, uh, also like that  additional information on visual effects of the	  alternatives.

The highest elevation being at Reisenauer Ridge which, uh, people that are wanting to preserve Paradise	  Ridge	  or, don’t	  mention the fact	  that	  the highway does go	  across it right now and	  that all three of	  the routes that	  are proposed and the current route goes	  over Paradise Ridge at Reisenauer Hill and, uh, we	  think that, uh, that grade	  from there going into Moscow would be a very, uh, safe grade going	  in and it would not have much	  elevation	  change going along the top	  below the tree line and	  on	  Paradise Ridge until it drops down	  into	  Moscow and	  that would	  be a very	  good grade and it would probably be	  the	  only significant grade coming out of Moscow. We think that	  would be, in terms of	  the safety of	  the route, that	  would be very beneficial for	  the people in	  Moscow to, uh, have that route. One of the things that, uh, we feel is, uh, as someone that	  is very fond of	  Paradise Ridge, is that, uh, people that are concerned	  about having a highway up	  there, uh, a safe highway, from my perspective, would	  be far superior to	  what we’ve been	  having in	  the past and	  the other routes, plus the fact	  that, uh, in terms of	  coming into Moscow, it’d 	  be 	  one 	  of 	  the 	  most 	  beautiful	  scenic 	  highways in 	  Idaho, 	  it’d 	  give 	  people 	  uh, 	  a 	  better 	  view 	  of 	  the Palouse	  than any of the	  other routes. And, uh, in terms of	  the wildlife that’s up, up there, we have considerable, uh, death of wildlife, particularly deer on	  Highway 95, which	  is similar to	  the, the central route and I feel that the amount of, uh,  #  First Name  Last Name  Comment  Response  wildlife that will be impacted by the highway on E2	  will not be significantly different than what we have already with	  Highway 95 and the other two routes so I don’t	  have a concern about	  that. I do know that the visibility, uh, up on E2 will be, uh, very	  good and when we get four lane highway	  with, uh, a wide right of way, we’ll give hopefully the drivers that	  are driving there, uh, a more visual,	  uh,	  significance 	  of 	  the 	  surrounding 	  area and they will be	  able	  to spot those, uh, animals before they get on	  the highway and	  take precautions not to	  hit them. Uh, and	  I would	  also	  say that, um, we are concerned that this process be, uh, terminated	  as quickly as possible by the Highway Department and they can get started on construction and we definitely	  want the E2 route.

Adams St., Moscow, ID 83843 Comments The Idaho Transportation Department's 6.5-‐mile, preferred	  alternative re-‐route of	  Highway 95 -‐-‐the eastern route	  or E2 -‐-‐between	  Thorncreek Road and Moscow, is not the	  route	  I prefer. The	  E2	  reroute, as described in the Draft	  Environmental Impact 	  Statement,	  has 	  several	  glaring 	  flaws. 	  For example, the	  weather information for the	  E2 alternative	  is limited 	  to 	  the 	  period 	  from 	  JanuaryMay, 2005. This is too brief of a winter review, and limiting 	  the 	  study 	  to 	  4 	  months 	  in 	  2005 	  captures 	  no more than one mild winter season. What happened to the winter	  weather	  data from 2000-‐2004	  and from 2006-‐2012?	  Since highway safety is 	  one 	  of 	  the primary reasons given	  for the E2 alternative, why weren't weather patterns, up on Paradise Ridge,	  such as, snow depth, black ice formation potential, frost	  pockets, fog and other	  visibility concerns, reviewed? Or, if	  these weather	  conditions from the other years were taken	  into	  consideration, why weren't they included in the DEIS? Anyone who has lived 	  in 	  north 	  Idaho 	  for 	  a 	  few 	  winters 	  can 	  tell	  you that	  road conditions at	  higher	  elevations, such as	  those encountered on Paradise Ridge, are more hazardous and	  last longer than	  those at lower elevations. Weather conditions along	  Paradise	  Ridge are unpredictable and	  have the real possibility of contributing to	  more highway injuries and fatalities than the	  existing	  Highway 95	  route.  General Response Weather-‐3, Weather-‐4	  and Weather-‐5. The action alternatives would not go over Paradise	  Ridge but would	  be located	  along its base.

Various	  environmental organizations, foundations, public institutions, and individuals are	  working to save the few	  remaining remnants of Palouse	  prairie	  habitat – the landscape indigenous people and	  pioneers lived	  in	  and	  loved. Why does the ITD want	  to or	  have to pave over	  this part	  of	  Paradise	  Ridge?	  Why does the ITD want to unleash an infestation of noxious weeds that would spread 0.6	  miles through a	  piece of prairie paradise on either side	  of the	  proposed (E2) new section of highway? The answer is: The ITD does not have to choose the E2	  alternative. A	  more central route, also	  identified	  by the ITD, is located	  away from the native prairie and more	  extreme	  weather conditions on Paradise	  Ridge.	  The C3 alternative route exists.	  The proposed C3 alternative is lower in	  elevation	  and	  stays away from the frost	  pockets and slippery road hazards that	  drivers would have to negotiate higher	  up on the ridge. The C3 route is safer	  and less environmentally destructive	  than the	  E2 alternative. The question of the day is: Will the ITD "do the right thing" and choose the C3 route and get	  on with the task of	  building a safer	  6.5-‐mile stretch of highway between	  Thorncreek Road and Moscow?	  The	  C3	  reroute will save more lives, help prevent	  injuries, spare the native prairie parcels, cost about the same as	  E2, and will impact about the same number of private and	  commercial landholders as the E2  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  alternative.

I respectively offer the	  following comments	  as	  a citizen of Latah County	  and the City	  of Moscow. I	  unequivocally 	  support 	  the 	  adoption 	  of 	  the 	  C-‐3	  alternative	  as the	  preferred alternative	  for the	  project. The arguments presented in support	  of	  W-‐4	  and E-‐2	  were not convincing or credible. I offer the following rationale in support	  of	  the C-‐3	  alternative: •	  E-‐2	  would adversely impact the last remaining and the most	  important	  segments (24)	  of	  the native Palouse prairie. If we can’t save a small vestige of this native habitat, what	  can we save? •	  C-‐3	  is the least destructive of wildlife and wildlife habitat. •	  E-‐2	  will significantly impact ungulate habitat and	   FHWA and ITD must balance	  both	  the human	  and	  natural environmental impacts with	  the safety benefit for	  the general public. General Response Alternative describes why FHWA	  and	  ITD identified	  the E-‐2	  Alternative as the Preferred	  Alternative. The E-‐2	  Alternative would not directly affect Palouse remnants. It	  would come closer	  to remnants compared to the other alternatives, which could result in 	  indirect 	  effects including 	  weed 	  dispersal.	  	  See General Response Weeds. Regarding ungulate and wildlife	  habitat, the	  majority of the E-‐2	  Alignment passes through farmland or CRP land.	  	  1.98 	  miles 	  of 	  E-‐2	  crosses an area	  identified by IDFG 	  as 	  a 	  Low 	  Priority 	  Wildlife 	  Linkage 	  Area. 	  	  Based 	  on the various Wildlife Technical Reports, Melquist, Sawyer and Ruediger, all wildlife	  experts, concluded that	  there is no critical or	  high quality ungulate habitat	  in 	  the 	  project 	  area 	  and 	  that 	  none 	  of 	  the 	  alternatives would result in population level impacts to ungulates. The E-‐2	  Alternative would impact	  more moderate quality ungulate habitat which	  includes 3.9 acres of pine stand. See DEIS and	  FEIS Sections 4.8. General Response Safety-‐2	  discusses how wildlife collisions	  were considered in the Safety	  Analyses.  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  populations on	  Paradise Ridge.	  Ponderosa pine stands	  near Paradise Ridge would be removed. Elk, deer,	  and 	  moose use the pine stands for cover. •	  W-‐4	  requires more right of way and stream crossings, and adversely	  impacts	  more floodplains. •	  Because of the weather conditions (elevation) and the potential of	  more collisions with wildlife, I do not believe that the E-‐2	  option is significantly safer than the C-‐3	  alternative. The weather study was flawed and too cryptic. Lowering speed limits and signing can mitigate crash rates. •	  E-‐2	  would affect approximately twice as much CRP land	  compared	  to	  the other alternatives. •	  E-‐2	  would present challenges for the future connectivity	  to the planned “ring road” project. •	  E-‐2	  would adversely affect the aesthetic and	  social values of Paradise Ridge.	  Paradise Ridge is natural	  icon 	  valued 	  by 	  all	  in 	  the 	  Moscow 	  Community.	  E-‐2	  is closer to Paradise Ridge than the other alternatives. •	  E-‐2	  could adversely affect the movement of elk and moose that	  currently travel between a farm pond	  and	  Paradise Ridge. •	  E-‐2	  may adversely affect the Spalding’s catchfly in the Palouse prairie remnants. •	  C-‐3	  would 	  be 	  the 	  most 	  consistent 	  with 	  land 	  use goals because	  the	  areas along	  the	  existing	  US-‐95	  highway are already established. •	  C-‐3	  would have the fewest acres of new impervious 	  surface. •	  The resource and conservation agencies (Idaho Fish and Game	  Dept., U.

The general public traveling from Lewiston to Moscow has been forced to use the existing inadequate 	  highway 	  alignment 	  (includes 	  three 	  of the worst	  accident	  locations in	  Idaho) for an	  additional 7-‐8	  years when the Thorncreek Road to Moscow segment of U.S. 95 was originally scheduled for reconstruction as	  part of the 20052007	  project from the top of Lewiston Hill to Thorncreek Road.

Box 7129 Boise, Idaho	  83707-‐1129 Dear	  Mr. Rush, I	  have 	  some 	  questions 	  and 	  comments 	  regarding 	  the Draft Environmental Impact Statement, U.S. 95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow. As I have some experience	  with meteorological analysis and maintenance of meteorological data collection systems	  working for the NOAA Global Monitoring Division, I have focused on the Weather Technical Report in	  the following points listed	  below. 1. The report states that “ITD desires to characterize the climate of the study	  area...”. To do this, why were	  weather data	  for only the	  first 5 months of 2005 used in the analysis? Why were not data from at least a full winter included	  in	  the analysis?	  On p. 5, in the	  Data	  and Instrumentation section, it is	  stated that the measurements	  are “ongoing”. On p. 22, in 	  the 	  Historical	  Analysis section, continued data collection during the remainder	  of	  2005 through summer	  of	  2006 is anticipated. Why were	  these	  data	  not included in the study? The report's Analysis of	  Current	  Data section finds	  on p. 19 that “There was	  insufficient snow during the study period to present a report on this variable.” The report	  also points out	  that	  there were months in the study period during which fog and precipitation of all types were	  anomalously low. Why was not meteorological data collection  data set. See	  General Response	  Weather-‐3, Weather-‐4	  and Weather-‐5	  regarding elevation, fog, visibility and other weather conditions. See	  General Response	  Weather-‐1	  regarding the weather data collected for the C-‐3	  Alternative. The	  EC and WC measurement stations were	  located at the	  end-‐points of an	  east-‐west continuum and represented the edges of	  what	  were referred to as the East	  and West Corridors. The Central Corridor lies between these. Qualls and Zhao (Qualls and Zhao, 2005) generally	  did not dissect climate	  details down to individual	  road 	  alignments;	  however, 	  more 	  specific distinction	  was made within	  the Central Corridor among	  alignments C-‐1, C-‐2	  and C-‐3, than within any other corridor. Furthermore, a more detailed distinction	  was made among proposed	  alignments in	  the accident	  study, using weather	  and alignment	  curve radii and slopes. See the FEIS Section 3.10 and 4.10 or	  the Revised Weather	  Analysis Technical Report	  (Qualls, 2014) for more information.  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  continued for a few more years	  beyond 2005 so that	  the effect	  of	  anomalous months would be diminished	  in	  a longer term average? The report relates data collected in the study area, such as temperature and precipitation, to data collected at	  the Plant	  Sciences Farm (PSF)	  climatological station to provide an estimate of	  the study area climatology. However, since no fog and visibility	  measurements are made at the PSF, a projected climatology	  for these variables	  is	  not possible, and we are left with only the 5 months of	  fog and visibility	  data collected in the study	  area. These are weather elements which the report states, on p. 10, the following: “Fog is a significant	  variable of	  concern in this	  study	  owing to its	  effect on visibility	  for	  drivers.” 2. The	  study anticipates climate	  regimes in the	  study area for the purpose of data collection site selection, based on elevation and proximity to Paradise	  Ridge.	  Are there any previous studies which establish the existence of these regimes? The study also refers	  to air flow patterns	  in the vicinity of Paradise Ridge to	  define these regimes. On	  p. 2 it is 	  stated 	  that 	  “The 	  predominant 	  air 	  flow 	  in 	  the region is in the East	  -‐West direction.” Does this mean that air flows from	  east to west, from west to	  east, or both?	  Are	  monthly climatological average	  wind rose data from PSF or Pullman-‐Moscow Regional Airport (which	  would	  present a long term climatology	  of air flow in the region) available? If so, and since	  air flow is being	  used as a	  criterion	  to	  anticipate	  these	  climate	  regimes in the	  study area,  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  why were they not referred to in the study? The report	  also on p. 2 establishes an approximate demarcation	  line between	  two	  anticipated	  types of air flow over the	  study area. Years of personal observation of wind in the	  vicinity of Moscow and on	  Paradise Ridge indicate that there are two	  frequency maxima in wind direction associated with moderate wind speeds: air flow from	  the east through southeast, and air	  flow from the southwest	  through west. If	  this 	  is 	  true, 	  would 	  this 	  not 	  require two sets of	  air	  flow climate regimes in the study area	  to accommodate	  these	  two radically different regional air	  flow regimes? The report	  indicates that	  wind data were collected at the 3 measurement sites, but I see no exposition	  or analysis of these data in	  the report. What do	  these wind	  data indicate 	  with 	  regard 	  to 	  air 	  flow 	  patterns 	  in 	  the 	  study area? 3. My impression of the report is that the C-‐3	  alignment in the	  Central Corridor was eliminated from consideration from the beginning. No	  data collection site was	  located in the vicinity	  of the proposed	  new alignment between	  Eid	  and	  Cameron	  Roads. On	  p. 2 it is stated	  that “In	  order to	  capture the climate effects at	  the elevation extremes, it	  was determined	  that climate stations 	  would 	  be 	  installed below 2600 feet and	  at or above 2900 feet”. This would seem to exclude any sampling of the intermediate 	  elevation 	  C-‐3	  route climate. Was the intent 	  of 	  the 	  study 	  to 	  interpolate 	  data 	  between 	  the high	  and	  low elevation	  sites to	  arrive at an estimate	  of conditions in	  the C-‐3	  alignment?	  If so, I don't find  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  in 	  reading 	  the 	  report 	  that 	  this 	  was 	  done.	  In 	  the analysis of alternative	  alignment corridors given on pp. 25-‐26, the report gives assessments of the Eastern and Western Corridors. Of the	  C-‐3	  alignment, however, the	  report says only that it “...is described better by	  the	  climate	  description of the Eastern Corridor...”. Thus, it	  appears to me that	  the Central Corridor	  has not	  actually been characterized in its	  own right. Nevertheless, I think that	  the Eastern and Western characterizations, a consideration of topography, and meteorological thinking can provide some useful inferences regarding the character	  of	  the C-‐3	  route in relation to the other	  two corridors. The Western Corridor	  assessment includes a higher likelihood	  of cold	  air drainage temperatures leading to	  possible icy or frosty road surface. This is because the Western Corridor includes sections of significant length	  in	  the lowland flats where the cold air	  pools. The proposed	  new C-‐3	  segment, located on higher sloping terrain to the east of the present U.S. 95 alignment, would be	  expected under these	  ground based	  temperature inversion	  conditions to	  be at a warmer temperature, either above or higher in the temperature inversion air	  layer. With C-‐3	  lower in elevation than the	  Eastern Corridor, a	  reasonable	  expectation is that C-‐3	  would be less susceptible to lowered 	  visibility 	  due 	  to 	  fog.	  Note 	  that 	  the 	  report finds that	  the most	  frequent	  and lowest	  visibilities reduced by fog occurred at the	  higher elevation sites: EC (Eastern Corridor) and RH (Reisenauer Hill).

General Response Alternative describes why FHWA	  and	  ITD identified	  the E-‐2	  Alternative as the Preferred	  Alternative. The delay to the project is due to the need for additional studies, extensive	  public involvement process and	  the need	  to	  evaluate a range of reasonable alternatives and their impacts as required under NEPA. See	  General Response	  NEPA and Schedule	  for a	  description	  of the environmental process and	  the anticipated schedule. General Response Safety-‐5	  describes how the different alternatives address safety deficiencies at Reisenauer Hill.

No	  one should	  have to	  endure the uncertainty, anxiety and	  loss in	  quality of life we have suffered	  for 15 years waiting for	  this highway decision to be made, especially at	  our age.	  As you can see, it is not going	  to be	  an easy	  property to	  replace. This is much	  more than	  a house; it is a sanctuary to	  us. These amenities on	  our property are why we live here. These are the things that	  are important	  to us in our	  life. Our mental health is at stake here,	  as 	  we 	  are	  held hostage, as well as our physical well being driving the highway every day. It	  is totally unacceptable to continue to wait on this	  project any	  longer. We don’t have that much	  time left to	  do	  the things in	  life 	  we 	  anticipated 	  at 	  the 	  age of 60. The delay on this project	  is the most frustrating experience of our lives.	  It 	  is 	  ruining 	  our 	  lives.	  We cannot urge you enough to complete	  the	  project and make	  sure	  all things are in order	  to prevent	  further	  litigation. We highly encourage all state and	  federal agencies to	  work together to make this happen. Safety is the	  Main Issue. Three	  of the	  top thirteen most dangerous half-‐mile segments in all of Idaho highways are found	  in	  these 5 miles. The high	  accident rates are	  due	  to too many private	  accesses (such as our	  own driveway), curves, hills, weather, and increasing	  traffic volume. You can check the	   #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  data for yourself concerning the injuries and	  deaths that	  have occurred during the past	  ten years, while we have been waiting for a new	  highway. Route E-‐2 is 	  the 	  safest 	  route 	  and 	  is 	  the 	  only 	  route 	  that 	  deals with Reisenauer Hill,	  where 	  many 	  accidents 	  occur. 	  It is 	  estimated 	  E-‐2	  will reduce accident rates by 69%. E-‐2	  is clearly the safest alternative. It 	  is 	  the straightest, shortest, least expensive	  route, with the	  fewest	  accesses, the least	  poor	  weather	  conditions. E-‐2	  is the only alternative that eliminates Reisenauer Hill,	  minimizes 	  curves,	  has 	  the 	  minimum number of accesses and	  is most favorable for conversion	  to	  “no	  access” status for the next generation of highways. Private	  Property. E-‐2	  is the Least Disruptive Alternative.	  Nearly all of the land in the corridor	  is private property.	  The owners of more than	  80% of this property have contacted ITD and notified	  them our preferred	  route is E-‐2. It has the least impact on private property, including homes and	  businesses.	  E-‐2	  minimizes residential and business relocation,	  and the number	  of	  remaining homes and businesses that	  must access the highway directly. E-‐2	  results in the least	  fragmentation of	  farming operations, including 	  that 	  of 	  family 	  homesteads.	  It 	  best preserves, protects and	  services the current agricultural practices in the	  area; and is the	  least likely 	  to 	  encourage	  suburban encroachment into some of the best farmland in 	  the 	  northwest.	  The majority of farmers impacted by all three routes agree	  that E-‐2	  is the best alternative and least  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  interferes 	  with 	  their 	  operations. This Land	  is Private Property, Including 	  Paradise Ridge. Most of the opposition to route E-‐2	  is based on	  NIMBY landowners of property on	  Paradise Ridge, who	  do	  not live in	  the corridor of any of the three routes and will not	  have their	  property or	  homes destroyed by E-‐2. The other major opposition, which	  the NIMBY folks have joined	  in	  an	  effort to keep the	  highway away from their “view,”	  is 	  concerned 	  with 	  the 	  Palouse 	  Prairie remnants. All of this land	  is privately owned. Any farmer or landowner could decide to plow	  up their land and dispose of the Palouse Prairie remnants at	  any time. Over the years these landowners have graciously allowed public access and encouraged prairie	  restoration and have shown a true commitment to	  valuing	  this land. However, it is mostly	  CRP land and it 	  is 	  PRIVATE.	  The 	  point 	  being, 	  who 	  are 	  these 	  folks to tell the private land owners which route they should prefer based on the non-‐land 	  owners preferences???? We participated in public hearings before	  the	  highway expansion	  got underway, to	  prevent three subdivisions	  going in north of Cameron Road on	  wells and septics on a 25%	  slope!! If the city and county	  had allowed this, their beloved Palouse Prairie would be all gone by now	  from the development. As it is, four large homes with	  large plots of property have already been	  built on	  Cameron	  Road	  despite the impending highway. We have watched	  as other homes have been	  built along the E-‐2	  area	  as well, since this highway project	   #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  began, knowing full well they would	  become part of the coalition opposing E-‐2. E-‐2, being a	  limited access highway, would act as a	  restraint on ridge	  development and	  suburban	  encroachment from the West. The Palouse Ridge Defense Coalition 	  and 	  other environmental groups argue	  that they want to save	  the Palouse Prairie Remnants. Unless they own	  the land, 	  they 	  do 	  not 	  have 	  a 	  say, 	  unless 	  they 	  can 	  buy the land and protect	  it. There are no guarantees that	  future owners and potential development will decide to	  ensure the perceived	  character of the ridge sought	  by the opponents of	  Alternative E-‐2. If they truly value the land, and don’t	  want	  to see it	  disturbed, why are they building their homes, corrals, outbuildings	  and bringing in	  animals, which	  will do nothing but destroy the very areas they espouse	  they want to save?	  I suggest their efforts would be better spent buying the property from the farmers, and putting it	  in a land trust. No homes, no nothing. Adverse Effects. We recognize there will be adverse effects with any route. But the	  positive	  aspects of replacing the current	  highway far	  outweigh any of	  the potential ill effects. Nevertheless, we urge ITD to conscientiously mitigate those adverse effects to both	  the environment 	  and 	  impacted 	  homeowners. We believe impacted homeowners and property owners must have mitigation	  that replaces their property with	  like property. As I mentioned	  above, our property values have declined	  due to	  the uncertainty of this decision. It would	  be unfair of  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  ITD 	  to 	  benefit 	  by 	  lower 	  condemnation 	  to homeowners who	  have suffered	  diminution	  in	  value due to	  ITD’s delays. Regarding those who	  will be relocated or	  will lose significant	  portions of	  their	  property, we encourage ITD to	  assist them with	  sufficient compensation in order to obtain comparable property	  elsewhere and maintain their quality of life, no	  matter which	  alternative is ultimately selected. Alternative E-‐2	  is an opportunity for ITD to mitigate plant issues by creating native plantings all along	  the highway, possibly creating a rest	  area for	  the Palouse	  Prairie to be viewed by all who travel through Moscow. ITD can develop programs to preserve and	  improve habitat in	  the corridor, in	  addition to creating	  a	  limited access area	  that is protected. As far as wildlife mitigation, we are well aware that the herds travel East-‐West and are attracted to all of the fruit in	  property owner’s orchards, in	  addition to foraging	  elsewhere. No matter which way the highway goes, the herds will go	  where they please. They already cross the existing highway back and	  forth. We strongly believe ITD should	  ensure	  that environmental mitigations be	  local and serve to replace the resources	  in this	  area, rather than cash payments to another	  agency.Many of those opposed to Alternative Route E-‐2	  claim to do so in the interest of Paradise Ridge.	  In reality, these opponents are attempting to	  prescribe what to	  do	  with someone else’s private property. We are environmentally sensitive, too. It is our land and we	   #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  are	  responsible	  stewards. Many of us would rather not see Paradise Ridge developed; but residential encroachment on farm and woodlands on the	  Ridge	  is 	  a 	  private 	  property 	  issue, 	  and 	  a 	  far 	  greater endangerment to habitat than this highway. Another tactic by the opponents to	  E-‐2	  has been to disparage the weather study done by our State Climatologist, Russ Qualls. We talked	  to	  Russ Qualls at the	  public hearing	  and felt he	  did a	  good job of explaining	  the	  results, which were	  difficult to	  glean	  from the facts in the weather	  technical report. We implore 	  ITD 	  to 	  be 	  very 	  thorough 	  in 	  addressing 	  any remaining questions concerning the weather	  report, so as to avert	  any possible litigation. ITD 	  has 	  done 	  a 	  commendable 	  job 	  on 	  this 	  DEIS 	  in	  responding to complaints and comments on this project. It is time to	  make highway 95 safe, it has been	  dangerous way to	  long. We applaud your recommendation for	  Alternative E-‐2	  as the only route that: Avoids lethal Reisenauer Hill Provides the	  straightest route	  that avoids prime	  farmland Has the support of the landowners/farmers who own	  that land Impacts 	  the 	  least 	  number 	  of 	  homes 	  and 	  businesses Provides the	  fewest and safest accesses Has environmental impacts that CAN be	  effectively mitigated locally Does not have an impact on an endangered species Avoids historic preservation	  issues Is 	  the 	  safest 	  and 	  most 	  cost-‐effective	  route  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  In 	  closing 	  we 	  would 	  like 	  to 	  say 	  that 	  we 	  certainly hope this decision	  is not made by a popularity contest, but based on the facts	  and documentation supported in the DEIS. As	  private property owners, who drive this highway daily, live here, work here and pay our property taxes, we	  should have	  more	  to say in what	  happens with this 	  highway 	  alignment than anyone who lives in town, out-‐of-‐state or is	  only concerned	  about their “view.” We look forward to a timely decision and construction of E-‐2	  as soon as possible.

General Response Alternative describes why FHWA	  and	  ITD identified	  the E-‐2	  Alternative as the Preferred	  Alternative. Hybrid Alternative-‐The alternative	  that you mentioned would combine the northern portion of the E-‐2	  Alternative with	  the southern	  portion	  of the C-‐3	  Alternative. This would	  possibly create a much	  longer route with a large variation in grades. This would be expected to have	  a	  higher crash rate compared to the  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  ITD 	  Public 	  Involvement Coordinator PO Box 7129 Boise, ID 83707-‐1129 RE: Written	  Public Comment − Mr. Rush, We are well-‐educated owners of	  multi-‐family residential property, Hidden Village Mobile Home Court, along US 95 in	  the project limits. There are 32	  homes in our park. For 20	  years we	  owned and managed a	  successful construction company, which focused on road construction in North Idaho. John	  has spent the last 5	  ½ years as Public Works Director of Shoshone County in	  Wallace, ID. As professionals, at times, we know it is possible to get so involved in a project that	  we can’t	  see the forest	  through the trees. The summary of alternatives’ benefits and effects tables, for	  the most	  part, identify the impacts of	  each alternative. What is not clear or understandable is why the Idaho	  Transportation	  Department (ITD) didn’t minimize the negative impacts 	  of 	  the 	  project 	  by 	  proposing 	  a 	  hybrid 	  of the final alternatives. It	  is very common, when selecting a	  preferred alternative, to combine	  the	  positive	  attributes of different alternatives and create	  the	  best overall solution. Your preferred	  alternative, route E-‐2, is not the best solution since it does not minimize the overall environmental impacts. To minimize the environmental impact of this project and still achieve	  the	  desired goals, the	  northern portion	  of route E-‐2	  should be combined with the  E-‐2	  Alternative. 1) Mobile Home Park Resident Opinions-‐Since	  the	  DEIS	  Public Hearing, ITD has conducted a	  series of meetings with the owners and residents of the Hidden Village Mobile Home Court. These meetings were held to obtain input	  from the residents and owners and to provide information	  regarding the potential impacts in	  the area. ITD also revised the safety analysis to consider the safety	  of the accesses	  onto the existing US-‐95. See General Response Safety-‐3. ITD 	  and 	  FHWA 	  will	  ensure 	  that 	  the 	  project 	  would 	  not affect the	  quantity or quality of groundwater.	  Additional information	  regarding the effects of salt on	  surface and groundwater is	  provided in the FEIS Section 4.7. 2) Any wells	  that could be potentially impacted will be relocated to a more suitable location. Well locations will be shown in final design plans to avoid contamination from road runoff. See General Response Water. 3) Information regarding the grades for each alternative	  has been provided in the	  FEIS	  Section 4.10	  Transportation Effects. Information regarding road grades and curvature	  in relation to ice	  formation on north	  facing slopes has also	  been	  provided	  in	  General Response Weather-‐3	  and Weather-‐4. 4) Regarding the fairness given to the residents of	  the Mobile Home Park residents, any displaced or impacted 	  residents 	  would 	  be 	  given 	  fair 	  and 	  equitable treatment	  under	  the Uniform Relocation Act. See FEIS Appendix 5.  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  southern portion of route C-‐3. If this hybrid alternative	  C-‐3/E-‐2	  was analyzed along with the other alternatives, the best solution	  would	  be clear to engineers and locals. The point	  where C-‐3	  route joins 	  route 	  E-‐2	  needs to be determined with all the same criteria used for the other alternatives. We are	  formally requesting	  that the	  ITD consider this hybrid	  route C-‐3/E-‐2	  and fairly analyze its benefits and effects. The ITD must not overlook this solution or take a	  defensive position	  in	  supporting their recently chosen preferred route. Moreover, the Federal Highway Administration	  (FHWA) must require the ITD 	  to 	  evaluate 	  the 	  proposed 	  C-‐3/E-‐2	  hybrid alternative. Additional, we have significant concerns with	  the lack 	  of 	  clarity 	  with 	  the 	  impacts 	  to 	  the 	  southern 	  end of the E-‐2	  route: 1) The DEIS	  does not adequately address the severity of the impacts	  associated with access	  to and from new US	  95	  for residents of Hidden Village	  Mobile Home Park and Benson Mobile Home Park. The access impacts are noted but insufficient information 	  was 	  discussed 	  or 	  simply 	  not understood. We	  know many of the	  individuals that live 	  in 	  these 	  two 	  parks and they feel intimidated by the public involvement	  process. We are formally requesting that	  the ITD investigate, beyond what	  has previously been	  done, the opinions of the resident	  of	  Hidden Village and Benson Mobile Home Parks. The EIS	  process requires that a	  good faith effort is made	  to gather opinions of individuals  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  affected by the	  project. A good faith effort was not accomplished with these	  residents based on their lack 	  of 	  understand and willingness to voice	  their opinions in	  public. 2) The DEIS	  does not adequately address the potential impact to	  waters of the United	  State and	  wells. The ITD does use salt for road maintenance during such	  times of the year, therefore more details need to be	  studied or stated on the	  impacts of salt and	  the effects on	  the new drainage patterns created in this	  area. We are formally requesting that	  the ITD investigate, beyond what	  has previously been	  done, the severity of the impact to	  the waters of	  the US from road maintenance using salts. 3) The DEIS	  does not adequately address the safety impacts 	  to 	  the 	  grade 	  (vertical	  alignment) 	  of 	  the alternatives or the	  effects of south verses north facing slopes. It	  is always subjective to the weight	  factors that	  are given to individual impacts. However, safety should always have a very high weighting factor. We are formally requesting that the ITD investigate, beyond what	  has previously been	  done, the severity of the safety impacts to	  the grade	  of each	  alternative and	  the effects on	  southern verse northern facing slopes. 4) It appears that the DEIS	  does not fairly value the existing	  Mobile	  Home	  Parks based on the	  manner that	  the information is presented and the quantity and quality of the	  information gathered. A better way to describe this concern is the lack of importance 	  given 	  to 	  the 	  impacts 	  to 	  the 	  Parks.	   #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  Hidden Village Mobile Home Park and Benson Mobile Home Park have been in existence from the early 1970’s and are	  very well established for a	  certain economic class of people. Impacts on the	  lives 	  of 	  these 	  residents 	  and/or 	  relocation would be very	  difficult. Again, we are formally requesting that the ITD investigate 	  the 	  fairness 	  given 	  to 	  the 	  Mobile 	  Home Parks as compared to other environmental	  concerns	  and impacts. Basically, people matter too. It 	  is 	  obvious 	  that 	  significant 	  time 	  and 	  money 	  and effort has been put forth on this project. Also, it is very	  obvious that safety improvements 	  are 	  greatly needed	  on	  this stretch	  of highway. However, in	  order to	  get the best solution	  for the overall purpose and	  need, the federal process must be followed without	  bias and time constrains. Spending the	  time	  to address our concerns and requests will only strengthen the final solution and	  get the	  best project for all. Route	  E-‐2	  may appear to be the choice of the alternatives that were evaluated but clearly a	  better alternative	  is available	  and should be	  considered. If 	  you 	  have 	  any 	  questions 	  or 	  would 	  like 	  to 	  further discuss our comments, please contact us any time, John at	  208-‐512-‐5779	  or Christie at 208-‐659-‐6486.

Box 7129 Boise, ID 83707-‐1129 − Dear Mr. Rush: Citizens	  for a Safe 95 is	  a group of more than 90 landowners 	  who 	  own, 	  rent, 	  and 	  reside 	  on 	  property impacted 	  by 	  one 	  or 	  more 	  of 	  the 	  alternative alignments assessed in the	  Thorn Creek-‐to-‐Moscow Highway 95 Draft Environmental Impact Statement [DEIS]. Collectively, we own more than 80% of the property ITD needs to	  acquire for any of the proposed	  new routes. We previously supplied	  ITD with a map showing our supporters (an updated version is attached). We believe the ITD has done a comprehensive, detailed, and thorough job with the	  DEIS. We	  unanimously support the Preferred	  Alternative— Route E2. Everyone signing this letter is a landowner, 	  tenant, 	  or 	  business 	  owner* 	  in 	  the 	  area affected by one	  or another of the	  proposed routes for	  the new section of highway. We have followed	   General Response Schedule describes the next steps in the environmental process and the anticipated schedule. ITD 	  and 	  FHWA 	  have 	  committed 	  to 	  implementing 	  the mitigation measures that are listed in Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments. These include mitigations for impacts to wildlife, biological resources and landscapes including	  weed control, replacing	  the	  functions and values of	  impacted wetlands, and accommodating	  safe	  wildlife	  movement through the	  corridor. ITD has	  met with IDFG and come to an agreement mitigation measures (avoidance, minimization, and compensatory mitigation) for impacts 	  to 	  potential	  restoration 	  sites, 	  indirect 	  effects to Palouse remnants, and wildlife habitat	  and will seek local	  mitigation.	  ITD 	  is 	  committed 	  to 	  working 	  with 	  IDFG and USFWS	  through design and project implementation 	  to 	  further 	  refine 	  mitigation 	  measures described	  in	  Ch	  9 Environmental Commitments. Any displacements of residences or businesses will be in accordance	  with the	  Uniform Relocation Act which, requires that	  compensation be according to the fair	  market value. See Appendix 5 for a summary of the Uniform Relocation Act. Additional information	  regarding the indirect and	  cumulative effects, which include the impacts	  of the existing	  and proposed future	  development in and around Paradise	  Ridge,	  has 	  been 	  added 	  to 	  the 	  FEIS Chapter 6, Indirect 	  and 	  Cumulative 	  Effects.	  General Response Safety-‐5	  describes how the different alternatives address safety deficiencies at Reisenauer  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  this project—closely—since the late 1990s. For many of us, the uncertainty about where this highway will go	  has interfered	  with	  the use and	  disposition	  of our property for a decade. More importantly, 	  we 	  and 	  the 	  thousands 	  of 	  vehicles 	  that travel Highway 95 daily have endured a dangerous roadway for	  too long. There are numerous reasons why we believe E2 is the best alternative and some are	  listed below. But the	  bottom line	  is we	  support Route E2 because it is the safest, least disruptive, and least expensive	  alternative. ITD’s 	  DEIS 	  has 	  done 	  a 	  remarkable 	  job 	  in 	  identifying and assessing	  the	  potential impacts of the	  alternative	  routes. We	  recognize	  that there	  will be	  adverse	  effects with any route. But the	  positive	  aspects of replacing the current	  highway far	  outweigh	  any of the potential ill effects. Nevertheless, we urge ITD	  to conscientiously mitigate those adverse effects on both the environment and impacted homeowners. With respect to the environment we believe that appropriate	  mitigation 	  of 	  the 	  impacts 	  to 	  wildlife, biologic resources, and	  landscape can	  be accomplished and—possibly—enhanced with Alternative E2. We support, and	  many of our members would be willing participants in, programs to preserve and improve habitat	  in the corridor. We strongly believe ITD should ensure that environmental mitigations be	  local and serve	  to replace the resource in this area, rather	  than cash payments to	  another agency. With respect to the acquisition of private property,  Hill. General Response Safety-‐3	  provides information regarding the updated Safety Analysis, which considers the remaining sections of	  US-‐95. −  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  we similarly believe that any relocation or purchase should also be on the basis	  of replacing like property. Over the last decade many homes in	  the area	  have	  lost value	  due	  to the	  uncertainty in this decision. We believe it would	  be unfair for ITD to	  benefit by lower condemnation compensation to homeowners who	  have suffered	  diminution	  in	  value due to	  ITD’s delays. Regarding those who	  will be relocated or	  will lose significant	  portions of	  their	  property, we encourage ITD to	  assist them with	  sufficient compensation in	  order to	  obtain	  comparable property	  elsewhere and maintain their quality of life. We are willing and anxious to cooperate with ITD in “fine-‐tuning” Alternative Route E2 and the acquisition of the	  new right-‐of-‐way.	  However, the process	  of taking our land must be completely necessary and	  fairly compensated. We support Alternative E2 because we are convinced	  that this section of Highway 95 must be made as	  safe as	  possible for the thousands, ourselves included, who	  use it daily, and	  it must be built as	  quickly as	  possible. ITD 	  has 	  done 	  a 	  commendable 	  job 	  on 	  this 	  DEIS 	  and of responding to	  all the complaints and	  comments that	  dangerously stopped this project	  years ago. ITD is 	  now 	  recommending 	  the only route that: • avoids lethal Reisenauer Hill; • provides the straightest route that avoids prime farmland;  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  • has the support of the landowners/farmers who own that land; • impacts the least number of homes and businesses; • provides the fewest and safest accesses; • has environmental impacts that can be effectively mitigated locally; • does not have an impact on an endangered species; • avoids historic preservation issues; • is the safest and most cost-effective route. − We congratulate you on a job well done	  in the	  interest 	  of 	  all	  those 	  who 	  traverse 	  this 	  beautiful	  state and who value the Palouse in particular. − Many of those opposed to Alternative Route E2 claim to do so in the interest of Paradise Ridge.	  But in 	  reality, 	  these 	  opponents	  are attempting to prescribe what to	  do	  with	  someone else’s private property. We, Citizens for a Safe 95, are also	  environmentally sensitive: it is our land and we	  are	  responsible stewards. This highway has and will continue to pass	  through our property. We appreciate	  the	  character of and the	  importance	  of Paradise	  Ridge	  to the	  community. Many of us would  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  rather	  not	  see Paradise Ridge developed; but	  residential encroachment	  on farm and woodlands on	  the Ridge is a private property issue, and	  a far greater endangerment to	  habitat than	  this highway.

General Comments: My name is Ian Von Lindern. I have resided at 1075 Snow Road,	  Moscow 	  Idaho 	  for 	  the 	  past 	  27 	  years. 	  I	  am a	  licensed Professional Engineer in the	  State	  of Idaho,	  Chief 	  Executive 	  Officer 	  of 	  TerraGraphics Environmental Engineering, and hold a	  PhD in Environmental Science and Engineering from Yale University. I have directed more than 50 major  ITD 	  and 	  IDFG 	  have 	  met 	  during 	  the 	  FEIS 	  development	  and agreed upon the	  mitigation measures described in Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments. ITD has committed to work	  with IDFG before final design	  to	  further	  refine the mitigation measures. See General Response Agency. ITD 	  recognizes 	  that 	  the 	  majority of the comments in	  opposition	  to	  ITD's Preferred	  Alternative are located	  outside of the project area and	  are directed	  towards indirect 	  effects;	  however,	  NEPA 	  requires 	  that 	  all	  substantive public	  and agency comments	  on the DEIS must be considered.  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  environmental assessment and restoration projects over the past 40 years and, in	  the course of my career reviewed several hundred environmental assessments and impact studies. I currently serve	  on	  the Science Advisory Board	  for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. I present this testimony in both a Professional capacity and as a resident	  of	  the affected area. I	  have 	  reviewed 	  the entire	  ITD Environmental Impact 	  Statement 	  (EIS) 	  report 	  and 	  find 	  it 	  to 	  be,	  perhaps, the most comprehensive environmental analysis per mile	  of highway ever accomplished in Idaho,	  matched 	  only 	  by 	  the 	  Wallace 	  Overpass 	  and Sandpoint Bypass in northern Idaho. The alternatives are	  well-‐researched and conclude, much as the last round in 2003, that route E2along the base of	  Paradise Ridge is 	  the 	  safest, 	  shortest, least 	  expensive, 	  and 	  least 	  disruptive 	  alternative.	  The majority of us who live and	  work in	  the area, overwhelmingly support Alternative E-‐2	  that ITD has identified	  as the preferred	  alternative. We support ITD, commend you for your thoroughness, encourage	  you to mitigate	  any adverse	  effects, and urge you	  to	  move forward	  ASAP to	  produce the Final Environmental Impact Statement without further	  delay. There are, however, a	  couple of areas where ITD did not do	  enough	  to	  recognize the impacts on	  people who own, and live on, the land actually touched by these routes – as opposed to Moscow City	  people and outsiders – who are trying to dictate other citizens’ use of their private property. Our family	  is	   Regarding litigation, additional clarification	  has been	  added to the	  FEIS	  Executive	  Summary and Chapter 1, Introduction. 	  	  ITD 	  and 	  FHWA 	  recognize 	  that 	  continued delay of the project could	  result in	  additional deaths and injuries on this dangerous stretch	  of roadway and	  are	  committed to working	  with all agencies and the	  public to	  implement a solution	  to	  address the identified	  deficiencies. General Response Schedule describes the next steps in the environmental process and the anticipated schedule. As stated	  in	  your comment letter, Paradise Ridge is privately owned	  property with	  development and	  that there are voluntary restoration efforts being completed on some properties. ITD and FHWA have proposed	  mitigation	  measures	  to minimize indirect effects to Paradise Ridge and these restoration sites. See	  FEIS	  Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments. Additional information	  regarding the indirect and	  cumulative effects	  to Paradise Ridge,	  including 	  existing and proposed private	  development has been added to the FEIS Chapter	  6, Indirect	  and Cumulative Effects.	  The FEIS	  has been revised to reflect your well located at 1075	  Snow Road.	  The E-‐2	  Alternative would offer the greatest safety benefit as explained	  in	  General Response Safety-‐3. General Response Safety-‐5	  describes how the different alternatives address safety deficiencies at Reisenauer Hill. General Response Weeds discusses the alternatives’ indirect 	  effects to vegetation. General Response Wildlife discusses the alternatives’  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  among	  those	  who live	  here, do business here, have	  our lifetime investments here, pay taxes on	  this property, and	  live on	  and	  use this highway every day. The residents and property owners whose land is directly touched	  by the four alternatives overwhelmingly support Alternative E2 because it directly affects their everyday home life. We have submitted Group Comments	  for Citizens	  for a Safe 95	  that includes 	  signatures 	  from 	  more 	  than 	  90 landowners 	  and 	  includes 	  owners 	  of 	  more 	  than 	  80% of the property directly impacted	  by the four Alternatives (including the No-‐Action	  Alternative). In 	  contrast,	  most 	  of 	  those 	  that 	  oppose 	  the 	  E2 alternative	  largely live	  outside the Study Area, do	  not own	  property directly affected	  by the alternative	  routes, and are	  concerned about indirect 	  effects on	  Paradise Ridge,	  much 	  of 	  which 	  is on	  the periphery or outside the Study area. − Continuing Litigation Issues Nevertheless, the Paradise Ridge Defense Coalition and other environmental activist groups have	  mounted vigorous opposition based on perceived, but often	  unsubstantiated, potential environmental impacts.	  These groups, through canvassing events such as	  University of Idaho athletic	  and cultural events, the	  Jazz Festival, and social networking	  can amass more	  signatures than there	  are	  residents in the study area. Many of	  these adherents are unfamiliar with	  the area and	  the issues, but nevertheless, wish	  to	  dictate what happens on	   effects to the	  vegetation and wildlife	  on Paradise	  Ridge. The well was added to the FEIS	  Section 3.7.3.  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  other citizens’ private property. Those of us that are directly impacted	  cannot match	  them in	  numbers because their support overwhelmingly comes from outside the Study Area. We are also 	  concerned 	  that 	  history 	  of 	  the 	  project presented	  in	  the DEIS is not entirely forthcoming. It is 	  true 	  that 	  Alternative 	  10A 	  was 	  selected 	  by 	  ITD 	  and FHWA and a	  Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI)	  was issued in May 2002; and that	  the was litigated 	  by 	  the Paradise Ridge Defense Coalition, Inc. 	  in 	  2003. 	  However,	  the 	  court 	  finding 	  that 	  an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) would be required for	  the northern 4.6 mile segment	  between	  Thorncreek Road and Moscow was predicated	  largely on	  the ITD’s failure to	  properly consider the comments	  of the Idaho of Fish and Game Agency (IF&G) in completing the FONZI. The statement in this	  DEIS “… to allow full consideration of the impacts by the public and	  agencies” was actually related	  to	  the two	  Agencies’ (ITD and	  IF&G) failure to cooperate on impact	  assessment	  and mitigation issues. This discordance seems to be ongoing in the current DEIS, where it is noted that there is a continuing failure to cooperate, agree on impacts,	  and disputed	  notions of appropriate mitigation. It seems that	  ITD failed to provide IF&G the DEIS in a timely manner requiring an extension to the comment period. The end	  result of this failure in	  2003 has been	  that we have lived	  with	  the 4th	  – (No-‐action) Alternative for 6 years, and	  will continue to	  do	  so	  for	  another	  3-‐4	  years. In that decade many people  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  did, and	  will continue to, die and	  suffer debilitating injuries, 	  and 	  $10s 	  of 	  millions 	  of 	  dollars 	  in 	  health 	  and property damages. We fear that the continued	  failure of	  ITD and IF&G to collaborate will provide fodder	  for	  additional lawsuits that	  will needlessly squander more lives	  and inflict terrible pain, suffering, and damage on highway users	  and adjacent landowners. In 	  order 	  to 	  forestall	  such 	  an 	  unfortunate outcome, we have appealed directly to the Board of ITD, State Fish and Game	  Commissioners, the	  Agency Directors, the Governor and the Board of County Commissioners to	  see that all of our public servants cooperate, select the appropriate alternative and	  mitigation, and construct this new route as soon as practicable. Copies of those letters are attached. We also urge you to consider the comments of the federal Department	  of	  Interior, clarify the EIS by providing additional information, and	  propose appropriate mitigations in	  implementing Alternative E-‐2. Safety	  and Delay	  Issues No More Delay. This decision process has been going	  on for nearly	  20 years. This is one	  of the	  most dangerous stretches of major highway in	  all of Idaho,	  and 	  the most dangerous in	  our region, extending	  from Benewah County to Riggins. Too many people have died and suffered severe injuries while this delay has proceeded. Our friends and neighbors continue to	  use this road	  every day and	  we and our families are at unnecessary risk. There	  should be no further delays. The safest road  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  possible should	  be built ASAP. Any extension	  of the review period or	  more litigation should be discouraged. − Safety	  is the	  Main Issue. Three of the top thirteen most dangerous half mile segments in all of Idaho	  highways are found	  in	  these 5 miles. Considering Idaho’s 	  terrain 	  and 	  climate,	  this 	  is 	  remarkable. 	  The high	  accident rates are due to	  too	  many private accesses, curves, hills, bad weather conditions, and ever increasing	  traffic volume. The	  DEIS	  cites five fatalities and 18 severely debilitating injury accidents occurred since	  the	  current court imposed delay, nearly ten	  years ago, and	  the publication	  of the report. Most	  of	  us will remember	  the young area	  family lost on Reisenauer hill not included in these statistics	  (a pregnant woman, another mother and 10	  month old infant and a	  grandmother). The	  preferred	  alternative, Route E2 is the safest and	  is estimated to reduce	  accident rates by 69%, the	  most of any alternative. That would have translated to four	  less 	  deaths, 	  13 	  less 	  severely 	  debilitating crashes, and 150 less	  accidents	  over the past ten years. More of these tragic	  crashes are projected to occur in	  the future, as traffic volume increases We have counted five injurious accidents and one death, a father of five, during this eight week comment period alone, that, unfortunately, must be added	  to	  the record	  of carnage. − E2	  is clearly the Safest Alternative. It is the straightest, flattest, shortest, least expensive route;  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  with the fewest accesses, and least poor weather conditions. E2 is	  the only	  alternative that eliminates	  Reisenauer Hill,	  minimizes 	  curves,	  has 	  the 	  minimum number of accesses and	  is most favorable for conversion to “no access” status	  for the next generation of highways. The EIS should also point out that Alternative E-‐2, as opposed to Alternative C-‐3	  will result in the conversion of the existing highway from the Moscow City Limits to	  Reisenauer Hill to a County Road. This will result in all of the current 66 access	  points being onto	  a County Road	  with significantly less traffic volume. This is particularly important for the harvest equipment that	  must	  pull onto to highway with heavy loads, during the time of heavy traffic with	  students returning to the University of	  Idaho;	  and 	  the businesses whose customers impede the high speed traffic on the current	  two lane system. All of	  us who live 	  and 	  work 	  in 	  this 	  area 	  will	  be 	  at 	  much 	  reduced risk in accessing the County road, as opposed to the US Highway. Both	  speed	  and	  weight restrictions can	  be enacted	  locally to	  further reduce the danger. Alternative C-‐3	  will keep the majority of these access points on the	  federal Highway, leaving	  us to content with the through traffic	  and interstate trucks. − Private	  Property and Land Use Disruption Issues E2	  is the Least Disruptive Alternative. Nearly all the land 	  in 	  the 	  corridor 	  is 	  private 	  property.	  The 	  owners of more than	  80% of the land	  directly impacted	  by the four	  alternatives have notified the ITD that	  they  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  prefer alternative	  E2. E2 is less disruptive	  of local businesses;	  minimizes 	  residential	  and 	  business relocation,	  and 	  the 	  number 	  of 	  remaining 	  homes and businesses that must access the	  highway directly; results in	  the least fragmentation	  of farming operations; best	  preserves, protects and services	  the current agricultural practices	  in the area; and is the	  least likely to encourage	  suburban encroachment into some	  of the	  best farmland in the northwest. The vast	  majority 	  of 	  farmers impacted 	  by 	  all	  three 	  routes 	  agree 	  that 	  E2 	  is 	  the best alternative and	  least interferes with	  their operations. − Paradise Ridge is 	  Private 	  Property. Most of the opposition	  to	  Route E2 centers around	  potential impacts 	  to wildlife, remnants and restoration of native prairie, and	  visual effects on Paradise	  Ridge. These alleged effects occur on private land at the base of the ridge on	  the periphery of the study area, or largely outside the study area on	  the ridge itself. All of this land	  is private property. Currently, the ridge is subject	  to considerable pressure for	  residential development, is becoming less accessible	  to the	  public, and less hospitable	  to wildlife. As the ridge area continues to develop and is	  fragmented into suburban homes	  and lots, human	  interaction	  and	  habitat loss will be particularly significant with	  respect to	  big game and	  predator species, and	  predation	  and	  disturbances by suburban	  pets will more adversely affect these and other non-‐game	  populations than the	  proposed  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  highway. Weeds, invasive domestic plant species, and disease	  will become	  ever more	  prevalent with the suburban residential creep occurring on the ridge. This trend is likely to get	  worse in the future. − Stewardship of Paradise Ridge. Most of the landowners 	  on 	  and 	  adjacent 	  to 	  the 	  ridge 	  are responsible stewards and many generously have allowed public access to their property for generations, although no trespassing	  signs are	  becoming more prevalent. With	  respect	  to prairie restoration, significant	  portions of	  these efforts are being undertaken	  by landowners who	  support alternative	  E2. Many of these	  owners view alternative	  E2	  as a	  restraint on ridge	  development and suburban encroachment from the	  west. They believe locating the highway at the base of the ridge may, in the long run, better	  preserve the current environment. However, it must be remembered that	  all of	  these efforts are voluntary. There are no guarantees that future owners and potential development	  will decide to ensure the perceived	  character of the ridge, sought by the opponents of this Alternative E2. − Quarreling Views of the Ridge. With respect to visual effects, the	  perspective	  of those	  who look at the area differs 180 degrees from those of	  us who look 	  from 	  within 	  the 	  area.	  Those 	  who 	  view 	  the 	  ridge from the urban area of	  Moscow believe the highway at the base of the ridge will diminish	  their view. Landowners from the area believe the view  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  from alternative E2 will enhance the view to the west and be an attractive gateway to Moscow. − Environmental Mitigations Required	  and	  Proposed.	  The required and proposed mitigations to offset adverse	  environmental effects are	  nearly identical for	  all three routes as follows. C3 actually requires the most	  mitigation, including the only cultural heritage impacts. E2 has the largest wildlife impact associated with a	  stand of Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) timber, planted	  in	  the 1930s, that may be habitat for three species of potential concern	  (bat,	  songbird 	  and 	  lizard). 	  W4,	  incidentally,	  is 	  the route that	  potentially most	  impacts the only endangered species found in the	  study area, and more CCC and earlier (1904) conservation tree plantings will be destroyed. The suggested	  mitigation summary shows W4 – 29	  mitigations required, C3 -‐30	  mitigations required, and E2	  -‐29	  mitigations required. Omission of Well on Snow Road Property. The	  DEIS	  does not show the well on	  our property at 1075 Snow Road, which was originally hand dug in 1877 and has been in the	  Idaho Department of Environmental Quality groundwater quality monitoring database for the last two decades. Thank you for your consideration in this important matter.  L-‐26  Allison United States Department of the Interior	   O’Brien Environmental Officer  See	  Comment Letter and Response	  for US	  Department of the Interior in Section	  10.3 Agency Comment Responses  −  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  Office of Environmental Policy and Compliance  L-‐27  Kas and Deborah  Dumroese  Adam Rush Public Involvement Coordinator ITD 	  Office 	  of 	  Communications 3311	  W. State Street Boise, ID 83707 − 22	  February 2013 Dear Mr. Rush, Thank you for the opportunity to comment	  on the Draft Environmental Impact Statement concerning reconstruction of	  US-‐95	  from Thorncreek Road to Moscow. Our comments are general and specific; they focus on three issues: safety,	  access,	  and environment. We	  look forward to the	  Department’s responses. In 	  section 	  “ES.2 	  Purpose 	  and 	  Need”	  (p 2), the purpose is clear: The purpose of this project is 	  to 	  improve 	  public 	  safety and	  increase highway capacity on US-‐95	  south	  of Moscow….	  On p 26, the need	  is clearly presented	  too: It [US-‐95] supports multiple local	  uses, 	  including 	  primary 	  access 	  to agricultural, residential, commercial, and	  industrial land 	  located 	  directly 	  adjacent 	  to 	  the 	  highway. My first comment is that the purpose is to IMPROVE public safety,	  not 	  maximize 	  it. 	  Safety 	  should 	  be neither trivialized	  nor overstated, and	  as I’ll show, I believe the later is the case presented	  in	  this DEIS. ITD’s 	  engineers and designers have	  done	  an exemplary job of preparing	  routes with  The purpose and need for the project	  is to improve public safety and increase	  capacity within this section of US-‐95. While the purpose and need is not to maximize safety, it is ITD’s Strategic highway Safety Plan is to maximize	  safety. The reference to 23	  CFR 771	  does call upon a balanced consideration of the needs	  for a safe and efficient transportation system. ITD and FHWA feel that	  the environmental impacts from the	  E-‐2	  Alternative, with mitigation, are balanced and do not outweigh the significance of the safety and societal benefit of the	  project. See General Response Safety-‐6	  regarding the significance of the differences	  between the safety of the alternatives. The responses below refer to the headers and numbers in 	  your 	  comment 	  letter. Safety The Idaho	  Transportation	  Department’s Office of Highway Safety reports that 53,899 crashes occurred in the State of	  Idaho in 2011 with the economic costs of	  the crashes equaling $2,166,493,801. ITD is committed to reducing the total number	  of	  crashes on its highways. ITD’s Strategic Highway Safety Plan	  is “Towards Zero Deaths”	  and the	  vision of the	  plan is “Death and Injury	  Free	  Travel on Idaho Roadways During an Entire Year”. One factor that will help ITD	  achieve	  this goal is by selecting	  the	  safest alternative proposed	  to	  replace the section	  of highway in	  District 2  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  extraordinary levels of safety―those	  achievements need	  not be buried	  under non-‐objective hyperbole. − Second, the	  need is to support multiple	  local uses. I believe that the two	  real choices for	  the new route (C-‐3	  and E-‐2) offer drastically different end results in 	  terms 	  of 	  the 	  multiple 	  local	  uses 	  they 	  support.	  According to	  23 CFR	  771 – FHWA Environmental Impact 	  and 	  Related 	  Procedures,	  Sec. 	  771.105b,	  decisions should	  be made “…based	  upon	  a BALANCED CONSIDERATION of the need	  for safe and efficient transportation; of the	  social, economic, and environmental impacts of the	  proposed	  transportation	  improvement…” − SAFETY On p 38, the DEIS concludes that “Any of the proposed	  Action	  Alternatives would	  reduce	  the	  projected	  crash	  rate for this segment of US-‐95	  by more than 50 percent”,	  which 	  clearly 	  meets 	  the purpose of the project to	  improve, not necessarily maximize, public safety. The main reason E-‐2	  is the preferred alternative is safety.	  This appears to be the “trump” card in 	  all	  discussions about route location	  – E-‐2	  is declared the have “the greatest	  safety improvement” (p 15), achieved through shorter length, more	  four-‐lane distance, and	  minimized	  access points (p	  15 & 178). LENGTH. Indeed, E-‐2	  is 475	  feet shorter (p 174).	  Using the predicted million vehicle miles (Appendix D	  in the Safety Technical Report) and route lengths (p 174), one can predicted the number	  of	  one-‐way  that	  currently has the highest	  crash rate and the most	  high	  crash	  locations. General Response Safety-‐6	  explains the significance of the differences in length and safety between	  alternatives. Regarding four-‐lane 	  distance, 	  the 	  predicted 	  crash 	  rates for	  rural US-‐95	  on both the E-‐2	  and C-‐3	  alternatives is 1.1	  crashes per mile per year as shown in Appendix C of the Safety Technical Report. The calculated 1.8 crashes per mile per year in your letter for the E-‐2	  are not accurate. The	  C-‐3	  Alternative has a	  much longer fivelane 	  suburban 	  section 	  with 	  a 	  two-‐way left-‐turn lane that	  has residential and commercial approaches. The AASHTO Highway Safety Manual Analysis predicts a crash rate of 3.4 crashes per mile per year on the fivelane 	  suburban 	  section 	  of 	  the 	  C-‐3	  Alternative. Access points are considered	  in	  the Safety Analyses. The Safety Analysis has been revised since the DEISwas published	  but the findings remained	  valid. See General Response Safety-‐3	  for a	  summary of the Revised Safety Analysis. See	  General Response	  Safety-‐2	  regarding how wildlife collisions	  were considered in the Safety	  Analyses. 1. ITD’s Strategic Plan is clearly focused on maximizing public safety.	  No demarcation or thresholds exist between	  improving public safety and	  maximizing public safety; however, there would be 46 fewer total crashes	  and 9	  fewer fatal and injury crashes with the	  E-‐2	  Alternative compared	  to	  the C-‐3	  Alternative over the 19-‐year design period, which	  is considered	  by ITD, FHWA to be	  a	  significant benefit in terms of lives and affected individuals and families. See	  General Response	   #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  “trips” made across each route per year. Using the predicted	  crashes estimates (p	  173), one can	  divide	  “safe trips” (no crashes)	  by “total trips”.	  This shows that	  the chance of	  traveling the length of	  C-‐3	  safely during a year is 99.99951% compared	  to	  99.99966% for	  E-‐2. That 1.5-‐in-‐a-‐million improvement with E-‐2	  is 	  about 	  the 	  same 	  odds 	  as 	  an 	  average 	  person who also drives on E-‐2	  also dying that year from the flu/pneumonia (www.cdc.gov). In other	  words, not	  very	  likely. FOUR-‐LANE DISTANCE. The	  Department estimates the four-‐lane 	  portion 	  of 	  C-‐3	  would average 1.1	  crashes	  per centerline mile (p 178) compared to 1.8	  for	  E-‐2	  (calculated from data	  presented on p 173174); 64% more crashes on E-‐2. True, C-‐3	  has a	  longer 	  urban 	  section 	  and 	  25 	  more 	  access 	  points than E-‐2	  (p 135), which purportedly gives it a	  higher crash rate in that area, presumably	  because of turning traffic associated with access points (intersections). But	  is that	  argument	  valid? − ACCESS POINTS. Using the data for daily turns on	  and off the	  routes (2600	  for C-‐3, 940	  for E-‐2; Appendix D of the Safety Technical Report) and	  assuming	  ALL crashes occur at access points, the	  likelihood 	  of 	  having 	  an 	  accident 	  per 	  all	  turning events during	  a	  year on C-‐3	  is 0.0011%, HALF	  that of E-‐2	  (0.0022%). According to the DEIS, animals do not pose a sufficient risk to	  be included	  in	  crash	  predictions, but animals appear to be more important 	  than 	  access 	  points.	  The 	  DEIS 	  indicates  Safety-‐6	  regarding the significance of the differences between	  length	  and	  safety between	  alternatives. 2. When you refer to the	  “other method”, we	  are	  assuming	  that you are	  referring	  to the	  safety analysis in Appendix D that is titled	  Thorncreek Road to Moscow Environmental Matrix Safety Analysis Alignments Carried	  Forward	  published	  on	  February 15, 2011. Please	  note	  the	  second to the	  last paragraph on Page	  1	  of the Safety Technical Report indicates that the US-‐95	  Thorncreek Road to Moscow AASHTO Highway Safety Manual Analysis for Alignments Carried Forward (ITD 2012a), which	  is the basis for crash	  predictions in	  the DEIS, replaces the February 2011 report which is no longer 	  applicable.	  	  No 	  information 	  from 	  the 	  February 2011	  report was used in the DEIS. The Safety Analysis Technical Report for the DEIS	  (ITD, 2012a) and the Revised Safety	  Analysis Technical Report (ITD, 2013) both	  use the AASHTO Highway Safety Manual methodology to predict accidents on each alternative. See	  General Response	  Safety-‐7	  regarding the methodology for	  the Safety Analyses. 3. Facts as well as assumptions were used	  to	  predict crash data for Thorncreek	  Road to Moscow. The following facts are used in the Highway Safety Manual equations The overall length of the E-‐2	  Alternative is less than the C-‐3	  Alternative. The length of the suburban	  section	  in	  the E-‐2	  Alternative is shorter than	  the length	  of the suburban	  section of the C-‐3	  Alternative. More accidents are predicted	  per mile in	  the suburban	  section	  than	  the rural section due to increased turning traffic, more  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  that	  more animals are likely near	  E-‐2	  because of its proximity to	  Paradise Ridge (p 106), and IDFG’s	  map in 	  the 	  Wildlife 	  Technical	  Report 	  shows 	  E-‐2	  traverses an ungulate impact 	  zone 	  not 	  associated 	  with 	  routes further	  west. Thus, one could conclude that	  potential animal collisions would	  decrease on	  routes more distant	  from Paradise Ridge. Therefore, the 10-‐year data for the existing, most westward route compared with C-‐3	  and E-‐2	  (p 112) that shows	  11% of crashes	  involved animals	  compared with 8%	  of crashes occurring at access points (and noting that the current route has the most access points of any route), suggests that E-‐2	  may not be safer because access	  is	  limited. − 1. Please identify the demarcation between improving 	  public 	  safety and maximizing	  public safety? How are these thresholds	  defined? 2. Please explain/clarify how these alternative evaluations of safety,	  in 	  terms 	  of 	  length, four-‐land distance, and	  access points are not valid	  and/or how they compare to	  the other method	  used	  to	  generate	  crash predictions. 3. Please clarify/identify the assumptions made for determining the crash	  data presented	  in	  Table 2. − In 	  the 	  DEIS,	  safety is 	  defined 	  solely 	  in 	  terms 	  of predicted	  crash	  rates (Table 2, Table 51). These crash rates	  are undoubtedly	  based on a set of assumptions placed into the	  model. It is also quite	  likely 	  that 	  the 	  model	  provides 	  an 	  estimate 	  of variance around the means and	  generates  access points, narrower	  separation between the northbound	  and	  southbound	  directions, and	  a greater traffic volume, The E-‐2	  Alternative has fewer residential and commercial approaches	  than the C-‐3	  Alternative. The C-‐3	  Alternative has five public road approaches and the	  E-‐2	  Alternative 	  has 	  two 	  public 	  road approaches. The facts used in the crash estimates are easily quantified	  for each	  of the proposed	  alternatives selected and all are safety advantages for Alternative	  E2	  over C3. The traffic predictions, their growth	  rates, and	  Crash	  Modification Factors are considered assumptions. Traffic predictions are included in Appendix C and E	  of the AASHTO Highway Safety Manual Analysis. The Crash	  Modification	  Factors as well as the calibration	  factor	  are included in Appendix E. Please	  notice	  that all three proposed Alternatives use exactly the same Crash Modification Factors for each highway type. If you change any	  of the Crash Modification Factors, the crash predictions on	  all three alignments will increase or decrease	  by about the	  same	  amount. 4. See General Response Safety-‐6	  regarding the significance of the differences	  between alternatives. Confidence intervals or estimates of variance are not typically calculated with safety predictions made from the AASHTO Highway Safety Manual to analyze different proposed	  alignments, but in	  some instances it is 	  possible 	  to 	  calculate 	  confidence 	  intervals.	  	  In 	  the prediction	  of crashes on	  Thorncreek to	  Moscow, a confidence interval cannot be calculated because some  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  confidence intervals	  for the data presented in Table 2. − 4. Please share those confidence intervals / estimates of variance. Discuss whether those	  values overlap	  for C-‐3	  and E-‐2	  predictions, and if so, are the differences in predictions really significantly different? − This is particularly important because the DEIS	  indicates 	  the 	  new 	  road 	  from 	  the 	  Lewiston 	  Hill	  to Thorncreek is held as the standard for safety (p 134). On that highway, ITD reports about 2	  injury or fatality accidents per	  centerline mile (p 134). However, the predictions for either C-‐3	  or E-‐2	  (p 173-‐174) are only about one-‐third that	  of	  what	  is being seen	  in	  reality on	  the new highway. − 5. Please	  explain how the	  predictions for injury/fatality 	  crashes 	  on 	  C-‐3	  and E-‐2	  are apparently so different than the observed injury/fatality crashes	  on the new roadway. Does	  this	  suggest that the models are poor	  predictors of	  crashes, or	  that	  the data used in 	  the 	  models 	  is 	  faulty? − In 	  Table 	  30,	  31 	  crashes 	  involved 	  animals 	  (11% 	  of total crashes), but	  on p 114, 37 crashes involving animals occurred in the	  project area. − 6. Please explain the discrepancy between vehicleanimal crashes along	  the	  existing	  route	  and within the project	  area.  of the crash	  modification	  factors do	  not have a standard error published with them. All of the crash modification factors used are widely accepted by committees	  who wrote the AASHTO Highway	  Safety	  Manual and generally have low standard error associated with them. Since	  Crash Modification Factors used in the	  analysis for all three	  proposed alternatives are	  the	  same	  for each alignment, the	  crash predictions for each	  of the alignments have significance. All three proposed	  action	  alternatives use the same	  crash modification factors	  for each highway	  type. The facts used in the crash estimates are easily quantified for	  each of	  the proposed alternatives selected and all are	  safety advantages for Alternative	  E2	  over C3. If you change any	  of the assumptions, the crash	  predictions on	  all three alignments will increase or decrease by about the	  same	  amount. 5. You have indicated that the DEIS	  reports about two injury 	  or 	  fatal	  crashes 	  per 	  centerline 	  mile 	  from Lewiston Hill to Thorncreek	  Road on	  Page 134. Page 134	  discusses maintenance energy,	  not 	  crashes between	  the Lewiston	  Hill and	  Thorncreek Road. Two	  injury 	  or 	  fatal	  accidents 	  per 	  centerline 	  mile 	  on 	  the newly constructed	  4-‐lane 	  section 	  between 	  the Lewiston	  Hill and	  Thorncreek Road	  is not accurate. At the public hearing, 0.38 fatal and injury crashes per	  centerline mile were reported between the Lewiston Hill and Thorncreek Road since the new highway was constructed. The AASHTO Highway	  Safety	  Manual Analysis predicts about 0.59 fatal and injury	  crashes per centerline mile. This suggests that construction	  of  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  − On p 171, the DEIS says that C-‐3	  “would not correct the curves and grade to the extent	  of	  E-‐2	  or W-‐4. Therefore, it may be more difficult to	  spot wildlife and	  recover from potential wildlife collisions in	  some locations 	  of 	  C-‐3 compared to the other Action Alternatives.” However, on p 175, the DEIS says “The improvements to	  the roadway curvature and	  grade as well as the wider typical section, would	  improve 	  the 	  ability 	  for 	  drivers 	  to 	  spot 	  wildlife 	  and maneuver if wildlife enter the roadway.” − 7. Given that all Action Alternatives meet AASHTO for	  grades and curves, please explain the apparent	  discrepancy in	  the purported	  risk of vehicles hitting animals due	  to road design features. On p 204, the DEIS concludes “…safety between	  Action Alternatives does not differ substantially.” 8. Please explain the contradiction between this statement and the repeated statements	  in the DEIS that	  E-‐2	  is “safer”. ACCESS A	  repeated	  argument for E-‐2	  is that it limits access points. This	  is	  justified on the argument that fewer access points equals “more safety”,	  but 	  as 	  seen above, this argument, given the	  exemplary job of ITD 	  designers 	  and 	  engineers 	  in 	  preparing 	  routes with extraordinary levels of safety, appears to be overstated. Please	  recall that purpose	  of the	  project is to improve 	  safety,	  not 	  maximize 	  it. In 	  addition 	  to 	  safety,	  the 	  DEIS 	  incorporates 	  the  a	  new four-‐lane 	  divided 	  section 	  between 	  Thorncreek Road	  and	  Moscow would	  have fewer crashes than	  predictions from the AASHTO Highway Safety Manual Analysis; however the	  proposed horizontal and vertical alignment will be	  slightly different between Thorncreek Road	  and	  Moscow than	  the newly constructed	  fourlane 	  section 	  from 	  the 	  Lewiston 	  Hill	  to 	  Thorncreek 	  Road.	  	  The differences in horizontal and vertical alignment between	  the Lewiston	  Hill and	  Thorncreek Road	  and	  Thorncreek Road to Moscow may lead to a	  slightly different crash	  rate prediction. In	  our judgment, the difference in	  crash	  rates between	  observed	  data from Lewiston Hill to Thorncreek	  Road and predicted data between	  Thorncreek Road	  and	  Moscow appear reasonable. 6. The total animal crashes on the Chart on Table 30	  are	  correct. The	  total animal crashes listed within the	  project area in	  the DEIS page 114 was corrected	  in	  the respective paragraph in the FEIS Section 3.10.3. 7. See General Response Safety-‐2	  for an explanation of how wildlife crashes were considered	  in	  the Safety Analyses. Sight distance is typically greater on	  roadway sections	  that are straight than on roadway sections	  with a curve even if the	  roadway is built to AASHTO Standards. Also, sight distance	  is greater on flat curves than sharp curves. The referenced section in the DEIS page 171 has been	  clarified	  in	  the FEIS Section	  3.10. The existing alignment does not meet AASHTO standards for curvature; therefore, sight distance on	  any of the	  action alternatives will be	  greater than the	  existing	  alignment. 8. The reference sentence in the DEIS	  page 204	  was  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  language 	  of 	  the 	  Latah 	  County 	  Comprehensive 	  Plan (p 71)	  to justify reducing access points	  on the NEW alignments. 9. Please clarify whether the County Commissioners and	  spirit of the plan	  is to	  reduce current access	  of county	  citizens	  to US 95, or, whether the spirit of the law	  is to limit new	  access points as it pertains to	  new commercial and	  residential development. On p 140, “C-‐3	  would	  improve the safety of US-‐95	  and	  improve the highway access for all users but to	  a	  lesser extent compared	  to	  the E-‐2	  and	  W-‐4	  alternatives.” 10. Please clarify/explain how residents of Woodland Heights, Cameron Road,	  Zeitler 	  Road,	  Snow Road,	  Jackshaw 	  Road,	  and 	  Hidden 	  Village/ Benson’s / Eid	  Road	  have improved	  access, particularly in	  terms of distance driven, to	  US-‐95	  if E-‐2	  is built, and compare that to the distances traveled if 	  C-‐3	  is constructed. 11. For residents of Woodland Heights, Cameron Road,	  Snow 	  Road,	  and 	  Zeitler 	  Road,	  describe 	  this improvement 	  as 	  it 	  pertains 	  to 	  southbound 	  travel	  on US-‐95. For residents of Hidden	  Village/ Benson’s / Eid Road, describe this improvement as it pertains to northbound travel on US-‐95. 12. What data	  exists that residents of Hidden Village/ Benson’s / Eid Road would travel to Moscow via E-‐2, considering they would have to backtrack south	  a mile up	  the dangerous Reisenauer Hill? 13. Please clarify the configuration of mobile homes  revised in the FEIS. Access 9. ITD has no jurisdiction over Latah County Comprehensive Planning. ITD has jurisdiction	  over state highways and	  access control policies. All three routes will be subject to the same level of access control as described	  in	  General Response Access. 10. ITD does not anticipate a	  substantial difference between the E-‐2	  and C-‐3	  Alternative in this distance traveled or	  access, however, the travel on both the existing	  US-‐95	  loop, the new US-‐95, and accesses onto the new US-‐95	  will be safer. See General Response Safety-‐3	  regarding how the safety of existing 	  US-‐95	  was considered in the Revised Safety	  Analysis	  (ITD 2013). 11. Existing US-‐95	  will perform as a	  local collector to provide access to	  both	  the north	  and	  south	  intersections 	  of 	  the 	  new 	  US-‐95. 12. No data	  exists. ITD anticipates travelers will utilize the closest	  access. Residents along Eid Road are expected to continue	  to utilize	  the	  existing	  US-‐95, which would have lower predicted crashes due to the lower 	  traffic 	  volumes. 13. See FEIS	  Section 4.1	  for the clarification. 14. The safety of the accesses onto	  US-‐95	  from the existing	  US-‐95	  would be improved for the residents on Eid Road that remain; however, there would be no improvements 	  to 	  the 	  access 	  from 	  Eid 	  Road 	  onto existing	  US-‐95	  unless negotiated with LCHD. However, crashes	  are expected to decrease due to the lower traffic volumes using the existing US-‐95	  loop as evaluated in the	  Revised Safety Analysis. See	  General Responses Maintenance-‐1, Maintenance-‐2	  and Safety #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  in 	  Benson 	  Park 	  (p 	  140). − The first paragraph on p 141: E-‐2	  would	  benefit park residents by improving the safety of US-‐95	  and	  improving 	  highway 	  access 	  and 	  mobility.	  Construction of additional travel lanes would improve 	  the 	  roadway’s 	  level	  of 	  service,	  reducing commute times	  and facilitating more efficient access to	  services. Ingress and	  egress of vehicles, including 	  emergency 	  response 	  units, 	  would 	  be enhanced by	  the	  use	  of a turn bay. Hidden Village	  and	  Benson	  Park residents would	  still be able to	  access existing	  US-‐95	  approximately one mile south	  of Eid	  Road. − 14. Please clarify/explain again how access is improved 	  (in 	  terms 	  of 	  distances 	  and 	  commute times)	  with an E-‐2	  route versus a	  C-‐3	  alignment for Hidden Village/ Benson’s	  /	  Eid Road, especially when all residents of the Benson	  Park are displaced. 15. Please clarify/explain the implications for first responders to residences within the project	  area under a C-‐3	  or E-‐2	  alignment, particularly given this statement in 4.10.4 Emergency Response Time (p 177): The C-‐3	  Alternative	  would provide	  the	  most convenient access	  and best emergency response times to the populations on the existing US-‐95. 16. Please clarify/explain exactly how that second sentence of the first paragraph on p 141 benefits	  park residents in	  their daily commute. 17. Please provide data	  that the increase in travel distance is realized	  in	  reduced	  commute times and	   3. Also see responses	  to comments	  #10 and #11. 15. ITD anticipates responder times will remain the same for residences	  located off current US 95 and that the first	  responders will benefit	  from the improved safety of the new alignment as well as the reduced traffic volumes on	  the existing US-‐95	  loop. Response times will improve for	  those in outlying areas to the south of Reisenauer Hill.	  See FEIS Section 4.10 for additional clarification. 16. Commuting would be enhanced	  by improving the safety of the new US-‐95	  and access points from the existing	  US-‐95	  loop onto the new US-‐95. The crash rates on the existing US-‐95	  loop will also be reduced due to	  the decreased	  traffic volumes as described in General Response Safety-‐3. 17. Access, mobility and travel user costs are further evaluated in the	  FEIS	  Section 4.10 and in the	  Mobility and Road User Cost Study (ITD, 2014a). The description	  of travel times in 	  relation to park residence	  has been	  revised	  in	  the FEIS Section	  4.2. 18. The residents will realize the benefit of improved safety when utilizing this section of US-‐95, regardless if they still live in the project	  boundaries. Environment FHWA and	  ITD must balance both	  the human	  and	  natural environmental impacts with	  the safety benefit for	  the general public. General Response Alternative describes why FHWA	  and	  ITD identified	  the E-‐2	  Alternative as the Preferred	  Alternative. 19. Additional information	  regarding the loss of tax base as a result of the alternatives has been	  added	  to	  FEIS	  Section 4.1, Socio-‐economic and Environmental  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  in 	  reduced 	  overall	  cost 	  to 	  park 	  residents. − And	  finally, on	  p	  142, “The E-‐2	  Alternative would	  improve 	  the 	  safety and	  capacity of US-‐95	  for all users including	  residents of the [Benson] mobile home park.” − 18. Please clarify/explain how these residents, displaced	  by construction	  of E-‐2, realize improved safety in 	  a 	  tangible 	  way. − ENVIRONMENT To reiterate, the purpose of	  the new road is to improve, 	  not 	  necessarily 	  maximize, 	  safety. FARMING IMPACTS. Contrary to the	  claims of The Citizens for a Safe Highway 95, C-‐3	  has, compared to E-‐2, the most benign effect on farming. E-‐2	  would convert 55%	  more total land,	  100% 	  more prime farm land, 36% more farmland of state importance, 	  almost 	  500% 	  more 	  land 	  currently 	  being protected	  from erosion	  by the Conservation	  Reserve Program, and	  double the number of farming operations of	  20 acres or	  less (Table 42;	  p 147-‐148). LOSS OF LAND FROM THE TAX BASE. E-‐2	  removes 34% more land from the Latah County tax base through new right-‐of-‐way acquisitions. 19. This point about taxes should be made somewhere in the FEIS. IMPACTS 	  ON 	  ANIMALS,	  PLANTS,	  WATER,	  AND PEOPLE. Except for	  linear	  feet	  of	  tributaries affected, E-‐2	  has  Justice Effects. 20. The discrepancy of wetland impact indicated in your letter (4.9 acres vs. 3.61 acres)	  compared the DEIS page 13 to	  a draft Wetland	  Functional Assessment report	  (Gilmore 2006)	  that	  was circulated as a draft	  for	  review in 2006 but	  was never	  finalized and was not	  part of the DEIS or DEIS Technical Reports that were circulated for public	  comment. Instead	  the functional assessment and wetland delineation information was combined into one report titled Wetland Delineation Technical Report (Gilmore 2012), which was provided as a	  Technical Report to the	  DEIS	  during	  the	  recent public comment period. This 2012 report	  (Gilmore 2012) does not include impact calculations. Wetland impact 	  calculations 	  are 	  only 	  included 	  in 	  the 	  DEIS narrative; therefore, the 3.61 acres of wetland	  impacts for	  the E-‐2	  Alternative which was stated on page 13	  of the DEIS is 	  correct.	  	  	  Please 	  do 	  not 	  consider 	  the 	  draft Wetland Functional Assessment report (Gilmore 2006) as part of the	  DEIS	  submission. 21. See General Response Weeds for information regarding effects to Palouse grasslands and rare vegetation. The referenced statement is in a	  Section of the DEIS that	  discusses the early screening of	  alternatives. The	  E-‐3	  Alternative intercepted and would have had	  direct effects on	  two	  remnants of value 2; The E-‐1	  Alternative intercepted two remnants of value 2	  and 4; and the E-‐2 Alternative adjoined	  one remnant of value 2, but the footprint is 50 ft. away and	  does not directly affect it. The referenced	  statement was modified to state that the E-‐2	  Alternative would not “directly”	  affect rare	  plant communities.

It is 	  not 	  clear 	  why 	  Table 	  1, 	  p 	  13 	  shows 	  3.61 	  acres 	  of wetlands affected by E-‐2, but Gilmore’s	  Wetlands	  Functional Assessment shows indicates 4.9	  acres. − 20. Please explain/clarify the different acreages presented	  for wetlands affected. On p 45, Eastern Corridor, the second	  paragraph	  erroneously states that E-‐2	  was the only eastern alternative	  to not affect rare	  plant communities. 21. Please amend this sentence to show that E-‐2	  has the greatest impact on	  rare plant communities. It 	  is 	  not 	  just 	  the 	  Idaho 	  Natural	  Heritage Program that	  considers the Palouse Grasslands an endangered ecosystem (p 96-‐97). 22. Please amend this sentence to show the other agencies (e.g., USFWS) that also consider this ecosystem critically endangered. Only E-‐2	  affects palustrine scrub-‐shrub	  wetlands (p	  155). These PSS	  wetlands have, for all practical purposes, “old-‐growth” canopies	  of Crataegus	  douglasii. This slow-‐growing	  shrub is also important for	  many bird species protected under	  the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA). 23. Given the importance of	  this wetland type to species	  NOW and the decades	  required to grow new PSS, please explain	  how any mitigation	  other than avoidance is realistically feasible.  Section 2.5.2	  Screen Alternatives, Eastern Corridor. The DEIS	  and the FEIS	  both disclose that the E-‐2	  Alternative would	  have the greatest indirect effect to	  rare plant	  restoration efforts compared to the alternatives evaluated in detail in the	  DEIS	  (DEIS	  page	  167) because	  it would be	  closer to planned and ongoing restoration	  efforts compared	  to	  the other Action	  Alternatives and	  could	  result in	  weed	  establishment and spread. 22. This clarification has been made in the FEIS	  Section 3.8.3. 23. ITD has already completed	  the Cow Creek Mitigation site that would replace any wetland functions and values that	  are impacted by the project. In 	  addition,	  any 	  remaining 	  mitigation 	  requirements would be provided at a greater than 1:1.5 ratio depending on	  the functions and	  values impacted, 	  to compensate for the temporal loss. The mitigation site converted approximately	  11.5 acres	  of eroded stream channel to a higher functioning wetland for water quality,	  hydrologic 	  function 	  and 	  habitat 	  function. 	  	  See FEIS	  Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments and	  the Conceptual Wetland	  Mitigation	  Plan	  for additional detail regarding mitigation	  for wetland	  impacts. 24. The referenced statement has been corrected and rephrased in the FEIS. 25. The statement was corrected to state:	  “The remaining Palouse grassland remnants continue to be threatened by weed invasion and residential development”. See FEIS Chapter 6, Indirect and	  Cumulative Effects for	  additional information. 26. See FEIS	  Section 3.8	  for clarification and additional  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  With all due respect, Section 6.2.3, Cumulative Effects to Resources, is the weakest section	  of the DEIS. On p 210 and 216, the DEIS asserts, I presume, European settlement of the Palouse “in the early 1800s”, remarkable in that Lewis and Clark did not visit Idaho until 1804 and that the most significant conversions of Palouse Prairie occurred	  from about 1880	  through 1920	  (Tisdale 1961). 24. Please rewrite this sentence using some data, not a best guess. 25. On p 210, this statement “remaining Palouse remnants continue to be eliminated through conversion to cropland”	  is not accurate	  according	  to Tisdale (NW Science, 1961) and Daubenmire (Ecology, 1940). Please amend. Along that same line, on	  p	  97 (Palouse Grassland	  Remnants) the second	  paragraph	  lacks clarity. “There are many areas of remnant patches of grassland	  that do	  not constitute part of the Palouse Grasslands ecosystem and were not considered Palouse remnants. This was because they are actively cultivated	  agricultural land	  or they have been	  converted	  to	  Conservation	  Reserve Program (CRP)	  lands.	  These 	  lands 	  contain 	  limited 	  grass species	  including; (sic) bluebunch wheatgrass, …” 26. This section needs to be rewritten to clearly state that there are other grasslands	  on Paradise Ridge,	  but 	  they 	  are 	  not 	  remnants 	  of 	  Palouse	  Grasslands because they are CRP or other stands on formerly cultivated (and hence, converted from Palouse	  Grassland) fields.  information 	  regarding 	  of 	  Palouse 	  Grasslands. 27.

The statement was deleted. 29. Information regarding isolation and gene flow of Palouse	  remnants and specific species has been clarified in 	  the 	  FEIS 	  Section 	  3.8 	  and 	  4.8. 30.

Please substantiate the statement on p 211	  that “Because of their isolation, gene flow is restricted, which may contribute to reduced genetic diversity and	  fitness of the populations.” Given the amount of work being done at the University of	  Idaho, the DEIS should have been able to justify definitive statements on this topic. In addition, the	  DEIS	  should have	  explored the	  difference in	  genetic diversity and	  gene flow of a particular species (e.g., Pygmy Nuthatch	  or Palouse thistle), as well as the	  genetic diversity and gene	  flow with the community of	  species within a Palouse	  Prairie remnant. 29. This topic must be more clearly and accurately presented	  in	  the FEIS. 30. Please clarify if these two statements on p 211 are	  correlated: The number of homes in	  the wooded	  areas and	  areas on	  or near Paradise Ridge continues	  to increase. The continual elimination of trees and shrubs	  that provide suitable cover for browsing ungulates and	  general wildlife has degraded	  the availability of quality habitat in	  the project area. 31. If the intent is to suggest that home building on Paradise	  Ridge has reduced	  tree/shrub	  habitat on	  Paradise	  Ridge, then please	  provide	  some	  data	  that shows	  (1)	  homes have reduced shrub/forested cover on the Ridge and (2) homeowners	  have not reforested large areas of	  the Ridge.

It is	  believed that the project effects are	  adequately portrayed based on the	  wide	  range of	  species described. This approach	  is holistic in	  that	  it	  addresses a wide spectrum of	  wildlife species present, not just ungulates. 35. The statement came from page 11	  of the report titled Biological Evaluation on the Long-‐eared myotis and Pygmy nuthatch (December 2005) (ITD, 2005) prepared	  by Dr. Melquist. Dr. Melquist made his observations after reviewing the site and	  was based	  on	  his professional judgment. 36.

In addition, please synthesize this	  section with the information about	  Palouse	  Prairie restoration found on p 167. Future	  Effects (p 211). The	  first two paragraphs of this section cannot, in my opinion, be justified. 32. If they can be justified, then please do so with citations	  or data, not opinions. One could counter argue	  that development on Paradise	  Ridge has reduced habitat	  loss and decreased fragmentation because new landowners have built homes on	  former	  farm ground and reconnected existing remnant	  vegetation by planting	  native	  and nonnative vegetation, and	  through	  extensive reforestation have improved ecosystem function and improved habitat for a	  wider diversity of wildlife. 33. Please cite examples of moose relocation from Paradise	  Ridge,	  or 	  from 	  any 	  urban/wildland interface 	  in 	  Latah 	  County 	  to 	  justify 	  the 	  speculation about moose-‐resident	  interactions. Cumulative Effect (p	  212). This sentence “Many of the wildlife species that	  would occur	  in the project	  area	  are non-‐native species and	  habitat generalist species	  like raccoon, white-‐tailed deer and	  a	  variety of other common	  species” shows	  a surprising level of ignorance of the fauna of Paradise Ridge.	  More than 140 species of	  birds have been recorded at 1096	  Eid Road, and of those only about 6	  are nonnative. How many native species of insects, especially beetles and pollinators, occur in Palouse	  Prairie remnants? Of	  the larger	  fauna, bobcat, cougar, moose,	  elk,	  white-‐tailed deer, mule deer,  37. The sentence is changed to “Additional suitable habitat is available nearby at Paradise Ridge and	  throughout	  Northern Idaho. There are several mitigation measures that would mitigate for the loss of the 3.9 acres of	  pine stand including nest	  boxes that	  will be installed per Dr. Melquist’s recommendation.	  	  Any necessary tree felling will occur outside of the breeding period. See FEIS Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments for additional mitigation	  measures. Indirect 	  effects 	  are 	  considered 	  in 	  the 	  DEIS 	  and 	  FEIS Section 6.1. 38. Additional detail regarding the effects of	  highway noise on	  the pine stands and	  the resulting effects to	  pygmy nuthatch has been	  added	  to	  the FEIS Section	  4.8. Based on the analysis, the remaining stands will be large 	  enough 	  to 	  support 	  pygmy 	  nuthatch but there	  could be fragmentation of the habitat due to tree removal. The effects of noise on	  birds vary with	  traffic volume, speed, wildlife species	  and habitats. The study that you referenced (Foreman, 2000)	  has useful information regarding the effects of busy roads on	  wildlife. The study indicated that traffic	  noise from busy roadways	  could affect bird communication for grassland birds. However, it must be recognized that the study was based	  on	  a road	  with	  between	  45,000 vehicles per day to 150,000 vehicles per	  day, which is between 5 and 18 times greater	  than the Thorncreek Road to Moscow project.

The preceding section should be rewritten to truly represent	  the diverse native fauna that	  occur	  on	  Paradise Ridge and that wildlife	  diversity compared to that found in cultivated farmland.	  Please	  explain/clarify why any discussion of “wildlife”	  focuses almost exclusively	  on ungulates and species of concerns, rather than a	  more	  holistic definition. One of those 140 species of birds is the Pygmy Nuthatch. On p 169 the sentence says that the pine stand “could offer potential nesting habitat” for this	  nuthatch, but the Melquist technical report clearly states	  that this	  species	  is	  known to nest in 	  this stand. 35. Please explain/clarify this discrepancy (on p 166	  and 169) about Pygmy Nuthatches breeding	  in the	  pine stand. In 	  addition,	  the 	  statement 	  “this pine stand is small with ten snags and only four mature pine trees suitable for pygmy nuthatch nesting	  habitat”	  is not accurate. Please	  come	  out and take	  a	  walk. 36. This sentence should be modified to show what the necessary habitat	  requirements are for	  nesting Pygmy Nuthatches, especially given Burleigh’s (Birds of Idaho, 1972) conclusion that this species is one “whose habitat requirements in Idaho are so exacting”	  that “I have	  never at any	  time	  observed any tendency on	  the part of the small flocks to	  leave the areas they show such a liking for.” 37. Given Burleigh’s appraisal, 	  please 	  explain/clarify  the existing corridor. In 	  a 	  more 	  recent 	  Massachusetts 	  (USA) 	  study 	  by 	  the same author (Foreman, et al, 2003), highways	  with moderate traffic volume (8,000-‐15,000	  ADT) had no effect on bird presence, although breeding	  was affected for 400	  meters. For relatively light traffic volume (3,000-‐8,000	  ADT) there was no significant effect on grassland bird distribution. This study of the	  light 	  traffic 	  volumes is 	  more 	  comparable 	  to 	  this 	  project than the study of	  the high volume roadway. Additional information 	  regarding 	  the 	  potential	  effects 	  of 	  traffic noise has been	  incorporated	  into	  the FEIS Section	  4.8. Additional detail regarding the E-‐2	  Alternative's effects on	  the pine stand	  and	  the effects to	  pygmy nuthatch is also included in the	  DEIS	  and FEIS	  Section 4.8. 39.

Then, please explain/clarify whether the actual loss 	  of 	  3.9 	  acres 	  of 	  pine 	  forest 	  represents 	  the 	  real	  loss 	  in 	  terms 	  of 	  suitable 	  habitat 	  otherwise 	  disrupted by noise. This section on p 138	  describing C-‐3	  displacements appears incorrect: “C-‐3	  would	  displace seven	  residences. Six are houses and one is mobile home in the Hidden Village Mobile Home Park. Approximately two acres of the mobile home park property would	  be affected.” 40. Please explain/clarify how C-‐3, built on the current roadway	  footprint that avoids	  Hidden Village, would cause displacement of six houses and one mobile home in	  Hidden	  Village. 41.

These explanations/clarifications 	  should 	  be extended to p 140, where	  these	  statements are	  made again, and where the number of displaced mobile homes is different than that given on line 138. On p 180, section 4.11.1 Visual Quality Assessment Findings, the	  DEIS	  states that C-‐3 generated, negative visual effects “would occur near South Clyde Road, Zeitler Road,	  and 	  near 	  Eid 	  Road. 	  This would affect the residential and recreation  consistency	  with the City	  of Moscow Transportation and Comprehensive	  Plans has been	  added	  to	  the FEIS Sections 3.2	  and 4.2. 45.

The referenced statement regarding	  topography has been	  clarified	  in	  the alternative descriptions in	  the FEIS.

On p 143, “C-‐3	  is	  viewed by the City of Moscow as	  the most	  consistent	  with land use goals…” and “E-‐2	  would present challenges for future connectivity to the planned Ring Road Project. However, the project	  is 	  conceptual	  and 	  currently 	  unfunded.” 44. Please clarify/explain why the City of Moscow viewpoint has seemingly	  little effect on the selection process. 45. Please explain/clarify why thinking about future transportation needs and their	  organization on the landscape 	  is 	  not 	  a 	  prudent 	  part 	  of 	  selecting 	  the Action	  Alternative. On p 34 the project area “represents a change in topography from rolling hills to more mountainous terrain” but	  on p 106 both the central and eastern corridors	  are “characterized by rolling topography.” 46. Please clarify which is the more accurate statement. IDFG,	  USFWS,	  and 	  EPA 	  all	  unequivocally 	  state opposition	  to	  E-‐2. They all unequivocally state that the best	  mitigation for	  environmental impacts is to first	  AVOID the natural values and functions, and if	  they cannot	  be avoided, to then minimize the  included 	  in 	  the 	  calculation 	  of 	  70 	  percent 	  cover.	  See FEIS	  Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments. ITD will also establish a	  Weed Inventory and Control Plan and a Vegetation Management Plan that will include funds for	  biological, chemical and physical control of	  weeds, monitoring and establishing perennial native vegetation. 48. The Cow Creek Mitigation site was approved by USACE in August 2010. It was determined by the USACE to have successfully achieved the success criteria for replacing wetland functions	  and values	  and is 	  considered 	  by 	  the 	  USACE 	  as 	  effective.	  	  In 	  addition, because the mitigation	  site has already been	  created, there is no temporal loss.	  	  	  More 	  than 	  80 	  percent 	  of 	  the planted	  vegetation	  was successfully established. 49. See response to 48. The Cow Creek Mitigation Site is 	  located 	  within 	  the 	  same 	  watershed 	  and 	  would replace the impacted ecosystem functions. 50. In 2010	  the cow creek mitigation 	  site 	  was 	  signed 	  off with less than 20 percent of non-‐native species present. ITD is required	  to	  control noxious weeds on	  their	  construction projects and right-‐of-‐way and strives to meet	  this requirement	  through a number	  of	  maintenance 	  activities 	  and 	  through 	  standard 	  operating procedures. The ITD is required	  to	  have a greater than	  70	  percent coverage on seeded areas and the Lewiston site has	  met those requirements. The Cow Creek mitigation site had an 80 percent survival rate for	  native plants with	  less than	  20 percent non-‐native invasive 	  species 	  present.	  Additional	  information regarding BMPs,	  standard 	  specifications 	  and 	  mitigation measures for weed control is in FEIS Chapter 9,  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  effects. The significant	  environmental impacts of	  E2	  can be avoided by choosing C-‐3, which, compared to E-‐2, minimizes environmental impacts. •	  If the Department believes the extensive environmental impacts of E-‐2	  can be mitigated, than the Department	  should	  provide data on	  how successful their seeding and transplanting mitigations were on the Lewiston Hill to Thorncreek segment. Specifically: 47. Specifically, on seeded cut and fill slopes, how effective	  was the	  establishment of desired vegetation vs. occurrence of non-‐desired	  and	  invasive 	  species? 48. How effective is the wetland mitigation at Cow Creek? 49. How effective is the wetland mitigation in terms of restoring ecosystem function? 50. What is the percentage cover of desired species versus non-‐desired	  species on roadsides and at	  Cow Creek? 51. Given the growth rates of woody species at Cow Creek, how long would	  it take to	  mitigate the PSS wetlands removed by E-‐2? Given that “The primary threat to	  the persistence of Palouse remnants in their present state is colonization 	  be 	  weeds”	  (p 97), the	  lack	  of discussion on	  weeds vs. reseeding success is an	  egregious omission. − DISPLACEMENTS 52.

In addition, the Contractor replaced dead trees and shrubs in 2007. This includes approximately 3.8	  acres of PSS	  wetland.

People	  who purchase homes a mile or so from federal highways assume existence free of highway impacts. CONCLUSIONS Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the DEIS. The purpose of the project is to improve, not maximize, public safety.	  C-‐3	  and E-‐2	  both satisfy the purpose and need of the project. C-‐3	  and E-‐2, because of the efforts of ITD designers and engineers, have	  an extraordinary level of safety.	  This safety, when looked at using various methods, suggests both route are equally safe. C-‐3	  provides safe access to more citizens	  of the project area than	  E-‐2, as well as providing increased safety in 	  terms 	  of 	  first 	  responder 	  access. C-‐3	  is preferred by the City of Moscow. E-‐2	  has the greatest negative impacts on rare plants and animals, rare	  plant communities, wetlands, and farmland and ability to cultivate	  the	  land, removes  alternatives are	  addressed in General Response Safety6. The differences in access, mobility and travel user costs between	  alternatives are further evaluated	  in	  the FEIS Section 4.10	  and in the	  Mobility and Road User Cost Study (ITD, 2014a). The City of Moscow supports any of the action	  alternatives and safety improvement.	  	  Any 	  of 	  the action alternatives would be	  consistent with their land use plans; however, the C-‐3	  Alternative would be the least 	  consistent 	  because 	  the 	  longer 	  5 	  lane 	  section 	  could increase 	  traffic 	  and 	  growth	  on	  the north	  end	  of the project.

[Dumroese personal	  communication] There is no doubt there will be more big game crossing E2 than C3 –a	  professional consultant suggested underpasses	  for big game on E2, but the ITD 	  does 	  not 	  include 	  this 	  in 	  their 	  proposal. 	  The natural resource agencies (Idaho Department of Fish & Game, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Fish	  & Wildlife Service) all prefer C3 over E2 (p. 16 of DEIS, Executive Summary) because of the presence of big game. When	  considering the corridor accident rate, adding	  in only	  a	  small factor for	  additional animal-‐caused crashes	  on E2 raises	  its	  accident number to approximately that of C3. [Flint] Considerable local traffic will still use old	  Highway 95	  if E2	  is built. What is most appropriate for route selection is	  the number of accidents in	  the “US 95 corridor” rather than just on the proposed new construction. The City of Moscow Sustainable Environment Commission	  also	  has concerns here: SEC also takes issue	  with ITD’s findings regarding driver safety on the preferred alternative, E-‐2. First, the current	  data set	  for	  weather	  conditions prepared	  by ITD is significantly lacking in	  information 	  to 	  accurately 	  conclude 	  that 	  any 	  one alternative	  is safer than another. Second, ITD does little 	  to 	  mitigate 	  the 	  potential for	  vehicular	  ungulate collisions	  on the E-‐2	  alternative. E-‐2	  is the only alternative	  with a	  marginal to moderate	  effect on ungulate habitat suggesting more ungulate  All travelers would	  benefit from the improved	  safety of the roadway.

The footprint of each alignment is based on a	  conceptual level of detail and is	  shown in the FEIS Section 2.6	  Alternative Alignment Exhibits. During development of the DEIS, ITD worked	  with	  jurisdictions and experts to estimate	  where	  development is likely to occur with	  or without the project. That information	  is provided	  in	  the Community Effects Technical ReportCommunity Profile	  & Induced Development (HDR 2005a) and the Induced Development Update (HDR 2011c). All of the action	  alternatives would	  have Expressway Access Control, with	  five-‐lane 	  sections 	  on 	  the 	  north end of the	  project; however, the	  E-‐2	  Alternative would have a	  shorter 5-‐lane 	  section 	  than 	  the 	  C-‐3	  Alternative which would result in fewer new	  accesses, less development pressure and	  congestion	  and	  would	  improve 	  safety at the	  south end of Moscow. The DEIS	  and FEIS	  state that growth is expected to occur up to approximately	  one mile south of Moscow regardless of	  whether	  the project	  is constructed or	  not. However, to mitigate for that growth, the action alternatives would have	  Expressway Access Control which is expected to limit development pressure, numbers of access points and	  reduce the potential for potential crashes.

IDFG states that “avoidance	  of impact is the primary mitigation	  tool available” [October 26, 2007	  letter IDFG (Dave	  Cadwallader, Clearwater Regional Supervisor) to	  ITD (James Carpenter, District	  Engineer)]. As there are two other	  alternatives available that	  meet	  ITD standards	  for safety, it is	  unclear 	  why 	  ITD 	  would 	  risk further	  accidents on the E-‐2	  alternative. Further, it is 	  unclear 	  what 	  mitigation 	  measures 	  ITD 	  will	  take 	  as ITD 	  will	  “implement 	  stipulations 	  in 	  a 	  Memorandum of Understanding with	  IDFG which	  is currently being developed” (DEIS, Chapter	  9, Environmental Commitments, pg. 230). At a minimum, ITD should	  consider either a) avoiding the E-‐2	  alignment or b) constructing passage structures	  for large animal movement to reduce vehicular-‐ungulate collisions. Many believe the weather will be more severe – more snow-‐packed, icy conditions and	  fog – on	  E2. Much anecdotal data support this. However, ITD only conducted	  their weather measurements for 5 months during an exceedingly mild, snow-‐free winter. Stations were	  not positioned to compare	  the	  central alternatives with others; hence	  C3	  is considered equivalent to E2 in fog when they	  are likely 	  different.	  The 	  weather 	  study 	  measured 	  wind but no	  wind	  data are presented. Residents are familiar	  with high winds which would be hazardous to high-‐profile vehicles	  and are likely	  higher on E2 than C3, but	  this question cannot	  be answered because adequate data were not collected, despite nearly 10 years in	  which	  this could	  have been	  done.

It does admit E2 would be	  the	  least 	  safe 	  from 	  the 	  perspective 	  of 	  wildlife-‐caused accidents. A	  small difference between	  C3 and	  E2 is frequently cited as	  the reason for the selection of E2.

It did	  determine that wind	  speed	  at the edge of the roadway increased with fill height. Figures in the report	  show wind speeds	  of up to nearly 60 mph for a	  flat section and around 80	  mph for a	  90-‐foot	  fill at	  the roadside for	  the same mean wind speed. With wind comes the potential for winter whiteouts and snow drifting	  across the	  roadbed as well as effects on larger vehicles. − LENGTH Alignments C3 and	  E2 are the same length	  for all practical purposes. “E2 is shorter” should	  not be  Preferred Alternative. Ungulates The rationale for conducting multiple wildlife studies is explained in the	  FEIS	  Section 3.8. See	  General Response Agency for an	  explanation	  of the difference in 	  opinions 	  regarding 	  FHWA’s 	  and 	  ITD’s 	  Preferred Alternative. Pine	  Forest Habitat The impacts to the 3.9-‐acre	  pine	  stand would have	  some impacts	  as	  stated; however, there is	  available habitat for the species in	  other pine stands in	  the general area. Farmland While the E-‐2	  Alternative would impact more prime farmland soils	  and more producing farmland than the C-‐3	  Alternative, it would avoid the highest producing farmland that	  the Modified W-‐4	  Alternative would impact.	  	  Construction All the alternatives would	  have similar widths where the clear	  zone would be cleared of	  vegetation to improve 	  sight 	  distance.	  	  The 	  areas 	  outside 	  of 	  the pavement would	  not be bare but would	  be planted	  with native grasses and other vegetation which would reduce weed establishment	  and spread. Staging areas, haul roads, batch plants, material sources are	  described	  in	  the DEIS and	  FEIS Chapter 8, Construction	  Phasing and Funding. These	  sites will be	  determined during the design	  process. Mitigation The majority of the land that is directly impacted by the E-‐2	  Alternative is cultivated	  wheat fields and	  cultivated	   #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  used	  as a selection	  criterion. − SOCIAL ISSUES DISPLACEMENTS In 	  the 	  DEIS,	  Table 	  8 	  (p53) 	  and 	  Table 	  39 	  (p135) 	  both say residential displacements	  of	  7 for	  C3 and 5 for	  E2, business displacements 8	  for C3. The table on p. 17	  in the "Selection of Alternatives" technical document says there would	  be no	  business displacements but 3 residential displacements on	  C3 and	  5 on	  E2. [Flint] ITD 	  right-‐of-‐way specialists	  state that no businesses will be displaced for any alignment, and that one residence would be displaced under	  either	  C3 or	  W4. An entire mobile home park plus one residence will likely be displaced under E2. ITD 	  Administration 	  now 	  reportedly 	  states 	  that 	  it 	  is unknown	  at this time (March	  2013) what businesses and residences will be	  affected and to what extent. [Meyer 2013].	  Decisions of alignments must not be based	  on	  fluid	  numbers. It would	  seem that the right-‐of-‐way experts would have	  the	  most reliable	  numbers. Which	  indicates that E2 would	  be a poor choice. − QUALITY OF LIFE The City of Moscow Sustainable Environmental Commission	  again	  weighs in: The SEC has noted that the DEIS does not address certain quality	  of life issues	  that may	  be of concern to Moscow residents. The E-‐2	  alignment will be  land 	  that 	  has 	  been 	  placed 	  into 	  the 	  CRP 	  program 	  and has already been	  disturbed. The E-‐2	  Alternative avoids directly affecting all Palouse remnants and	  native grassland. Habitat connectivity	  has been considered 	  in the project	  and will be accommodated by designing overcrossings and	  culverts to allow movement	  of	  terrestrial and aquatic species. Context	  Sensitive Design must consider both human and social factors. See	  General Response	  Weeds and Wildlife. Measures that will mitigate for impacts to resources as a	  result of unavoidable	  effects to resources are	  listed in the FEIS Chapter	  9, Environmental Commitments. Additional information	  has also	  been	  added	  to	  Chapter 9	  regarding ITD’s relevant Standard Specifications and Best Management Practices that will help	  minimize harm for each	  action	  alternative. See	  General Response	  Agency regarding the	  difference	  in 	  opinion 	  regarding 	  ITD’s 	  and 	  FHWA’s 	  Preferred Alternative. The FEIS	  Chapter 9	  describes	  environmental commitments	  that would be proposed for each of the action alternatives. The	  ROD will identify the	  environmental commitments and mitigation measures for	  the Selected Alternative. All mitigation, including mitigation	  for vegetation	  impacts	  due to weeds	  are discussed in General Response Weeds and	  FEIS Chapter 9. Latah County	  Comprehensive	  Plan ITD 	  and 	  FHWA 	  must 	  balance 	  the 	  goals 	  and considerations	  of numerous	  different stakeholders. US-‐95	  serves not only the county but also the City of Moscow, regional and	  intra state travel. However, one  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  coming down a ridge line much closer to Moscow than the current	  alignment, which will likely increase 	  the 	  noise pollution	  for Moscow residents. The E2	  alignment will increase the light pollution for residents living on the south side of	  town. In addition, the	  SEC believes that the	  E-‐2	  alignment will reduce recreational opportunities available to Moscow residents who	  enjoy this area for its endangered Palouse	  Prairie habitat, wildlife viewing, hiking, etc. E2	  would or could: result	  in a greater	  degree of	  visual quality effects than other	  alternatives (p. 180, Table 55). E2 clearly will have a greater visual impact and along a substantial portion of the route the roadway will appear to dominate	  the	  landscape. affect recreational view points and the	  view shed of Paradise	  Ridge from Moscow, Eid Rd and Cameron Rd	  (p. 181) and	  this could	  affect usage and	  access of the prairie. generate	  greater traffic noise impacts 	  than 	  C3 	  or W4 (p. 182, Table 56) and this could affect usage of the area by ungulates and birds. − DEVELOPMENT What areas are likely to be	  developed with each alternative?	  Who is to gain financially?	  How are	  these individuals influencing ITD? No consideration has been given in the DEIS to incorporating 	  frontage 	  roads 	  along 	  C3, 	  which arguably would increase	  the	  safety there. Parts of the	  DEIS	  say that E2	  will be	  controlled of the primary goals of the Comprehensive Plan	  is to	  retain the rural nature of	  the county. The E-‐2	  Alternative recognizes that growth	  is predicted	  south	  of Moscow and	  that growth	  is not desired	  along the roadway. The limited access will help reduce development pressures and	  also	  improve public safety,	  which also addresses the purpose, and need for the project. Mitigation measures include many measures to minimize harm	  and that address the natural resource elements noted in your letter. During	  the	  DEIS	  development, the mitigation	  for impacts was not yet fully developed and was not	  required by FHWA NEPA regulations (23 CFR 771.1)	  to be included in the DEIS. Since	  then additional planning has occurred. Additional detail regarding mitigation	  has been	  added	  to the FEIS Chapter	  9, Environmental Commitments. Thank you for your analysis of the Latah County Comprehensive Plan. See General Response Agency regarding the difference in opinion regarding FHWA’s and ITD’s Preferred Alternative. The	  discussion of mega	  loads 	  on 	  US-‐12	  is a	  topic unrelated to this project and outside of the logical termini for	  this project. Within the project	  limits there is no known method for	  predicting future mega load	  usage of US-‐95. Roads are available	  for commercial uses. Recently Canadian purchasers of mega load	  equipment have announced	  that	  they will be purchasing within Canada to avoid delays due to	  mega load	  transport; therefore, Mega	  loads 	  through 	  the 	  project 	  area 	  are 	  generally 	  expected to decline but	  are not	  specifically considered in the project’s cumulative effects analysis.  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  access, and discounts that there	  will be	  additional entryways in the	  future. Other parts say that there	  would be growth along E2—which would decrease the safety of E2. The City of Moscow is concerned about potential development along	  E2: The report states that “E-‐2	  could also increase property values and	  have growth	  along its alignment; however it would be	  less growth than W-‐4	  and would have controlled access.” Increased strip development along the E-‐2	  corridor, especially if 	  it 	  included 	  an 	  extended 	  5 	  lane 	  (4 	  travel	  and 	  center turn)	  facility south of	  Moscow, would generally not	  be desirable. Increased	  access points, traffic signals and overall congestion in an area	  of fairly significant grade	  in the transition from Paradise Ridge to the [sic]	  Moscow could impede the safe function and operation	  of the highway system. [comment letter from the City of	  Moscow to ITD] − COST Estimated E2	  and C3	  costs are about the same (although it	  is unclear	  exactly what	  is included in the figures)	  – but mitigation	  costs would	  be higher per Idaho	  Department of Fish	  and	  Game recommendations for	  E2. − ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS PALOUSE	  PRAIRIE As you	  are aware, our Palouse Prairie is 	  a 	  highly endangered ecosystem, with an estimated lessthan-‐one-‐percent of its historic extent remaining; aproximately 99% of the	  Palouse	  Grasslands have	   −  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  been	  converted	  to	  cultivated	  agricultural lands (Noss et	  al., 1995). Loss of	  Palouse Grasslands has contributed to a number of plant species	  associated with the Palouse Bioregion being classified as species	  of conservation concern (Lichthardt and Moseley, 1997). The Palouse Grasslands are considered by	  the Idaho Natural Heritage Program to be one of	  the most endangered ecosystems in the U.S. (Noss et	  al., 1995). This ecosystem is the basis of the highly productive agriculture	  in the	  area. The	  soils are	  good and generally	  deep, and the	  diverse	  and beautiful prairie grasses and	  flowering plants have deep	  roots. These deep	  soils and	  root systems are home to beneficial worms and other	  underground and aboveground creatures. The Palouse Prairie is 	  targeted 	  as 	  a 	  habitat 	  to protect by various federal and	  state agencies (including U.S. EPA, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Washington Department of Fish and Game). The Nature Conservancy, the more local Palouse Land Trust, and the Palouse Prairie Foundation also focus on	  protecting Palouse Prairie. In	  addition, the Latah	  County Comprehensive Plan	  mentions protection	  of Palouse	  Prairie. Between 1995	  and 2001, Washington's Department of Natural Resources Region	  5 spent 38% of its $425,446 Wildlife Incentive 	  Program 	  budget 	  on 	  restoring 	  native Palouse	  Prairie	  flora. Recently, the	  Nature	  Conservancy purchased	  more than	  100,000 acres of the Zumwalt	  Prairie in an effort	  to preserve a northeastern	  Oregon	  version	  of Palouse Prairie.  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  The project area	  includes about 18.3	  acres of highest-‐quality Palouse prairie remnants and	  17 acres of medium-‐high	  to	  medium-‐low 	  quality remnants [p. 97]. Twelve remnants are near	  W4, 14 are	  near C3, and 24	  are	  near (within 0.6	  mile) E2	  [p. 206]. C3	  has no remnants really close, whereas E2	  has a number within	  100 yards or less. One km (0.6 mile) is the distance used in the vegetation technical report	  as their	  weed impact	  zone. The weed impact zone would extend to the top of Paradise	  Ridge if 	  E2 	  is 	  built. “Thirty-‐two areas were identified as Palouse prairie remnants. The primary threat	  to the persistence of	  Palouse	  remnants in their present state	  is colonization by	  weeds.” [p. 206] The E2	  alignment would be devastating to Paradise Ridge prairie lands owing to	  weed	  invasion	  [see pages 64-‐68	  in the Vegetation Technical Report]. In that	  report, Prather and	  Lass state, “Hopefully in	  some small measure the number of introductions	  and their potential spread to critical prairie	  remnants can be reduced by implementing prevention, monitoring and	  mitigation	  plans.” − E2	  would or could affect more than	  twice as many prairie remnants in	  the project area as C3 or W4 (24 vs. 14 or 12 remnants, respectively, p. 207, Table 62); come closer to the largest and highest quality prairie remnants in	  the project area (p. 26, Vegetation Technical Report, Lichthardt 2005); put at risk a higher proportion	  of globally imperiled	  plant species found	  in	  Palouse Prairie than C3 or	  W4  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  (Vegetation Technical Report, Lichthardt, 2005) − WEED IMPACT A	  Bureau	  of Land	  Management publication	  cites road building 	  and 	  weeds 	  as 	  the 	  primary 	  threats 	  to Palouse	  Prairie (Weddell and Lichthardt, 1998). − “Thirty-‐two areas were identified as Palouse prairie remnants. The primary threat	  to the persistence of	  Palouse	  remnants in their present state is colonization by	  weeds.” [p. 206] E2	  would or could Put a	  higher number of prairie	  remnants including those found on the ridgeline of	  Paradise Ridge at risk of	  weed invasions created by highway construction and vehicular transport	  of	  weeds (p. 17, Vegetation Technical Report, Lass and Prather 2007); Put all prairie	  remnants in the	  project area	  at risk of invasion 	  by 	  new 	  weed 	  species 	  from 	  adjacent counties, states	  and countries	  connected by	  the U.S. 95 corridor (Vegetation Technical Report, Lass and Prather 2007); − GIANT PALOUSE EARTHWORM The wildlife assessment improperly states that no suitable habitat for Driloleirus americanus,	  the 	  giant Palouse	  earthworm, will be	  affected. It also misspells both the genus and species epithets. A	  number of the most recent discoveries of this worm have been	  from locations on	  Paradise Ridge and the	  habitat is not strictly undisturbed	  prairie but also	   #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  transitional zones. Palouse	  earthworm, Drioleirus [sic]	  amercanus [sic]: The	  Palouse	  earthworm is endemic to the	  Palouse	  bioregion. The species was first reported	  in	  1897, and was described as being	  common in the	  area	  around Pullman, Washington; however, reported occurrences are very rare and	  there have been	  no	  recent	  confirmed occurrences	  reported in Idaho. Palouse	  earthworms inhabit relatively loose, rich soils	  in undisturbed bunchgrass	  prairie. Threats	  include 	  loss 	  of 	  native 	  Palouse 	  habitat 	  to 	  agriculture, development and	  other disturbances, as well as introduction 	  of European earthworm species. Determination of Effect and Rationale: No Effect There have been no reported occurrences of Palouse	  earthworm in the	  project area. No remnant Palouse plant communities (suitable habitat) will be effected	  [sic] by the project. [GENERAL WILDLIFE 	  ASSESSMENT 	  THORNCREEK ROAD TO MOSCOW p. 8] This information should be updated in the final EIS. − POLLINATORS There is no discussion in the DEIS	  on pollinators. Flowering plant species need pollinators. There	  is a	  very	  rich bee fauna on Paradise Ridge. Preserving Palouse	  Prairie is 	  important 	  not 	  only 	  for its 	  own 	  sake, 	  but 	  also 	  for 	  providing 	  refugia 	  for pollinators, which	  are needed	  for plant reproduction—including 	  crops. “If the	  bee	  disappeared off the	  face	  of the	  earth,  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  man would only have four years left to live.” Albert Einstein [probable misattribution] These prairie remnants are likely an important resource for	  pollinators. “Most	  flowering plants depend	  on	  bees, butterflies, and	  other animals for pollination.	  … 	  Pollinators 	  have 	  evolved 	  with 	  native plants, which	  are best adapted	  to	  the local growing season, climate, and soils. Most pollinators	  feed on specific	  plant species… Non-‐native plants may not provide pollinators with	  enough	  nectar or pollen, or may be inedible…” “Pollinators are vital to maintaining healthy ecosystems. They are essential for	  plant	  reproduction… Insects and other	  animals pollinate one-‐third of	  the food we eat	  – all kinds of fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts, and beans. … the economic value of insect pollination worldwide has been	  estimated	  at $217 billion.” [U.S. Forest Service] Studies are	  ongoing at UI regarding relative	  pollinator diversity across native Palouse Prairie,	  lands 	  in 	  the 	  Conservation 	  Reserve Program, and active	  agricultural lands. − WETLANDS E2	  would affect more than twice the acreage of wetlands as C3 but not as much as W4 (p. 146, Table 45); this is significant in terms of wildlife habitat and	  also	  flood	  control, in	  which	  wetlands play a significant 	  role. − WILDLIFE E2	  divides an area	  of significant large game migration. With their water supply on one side of  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  the highway and cover	  on the other, deer (sometimes more than 100 a day), elk and moose will endanger themselves as well as motorists. Paradise	  Ridge is 	  also 	  home 	  to 	  many 	  bird 	  species including 	  wild 	  turkeys 	  and 	  pheasants, 	  and 	  coyote and fox. E2	  would affect the greatest number of new rightsof-‐way (p.193, Table 61) which could reduce habitats that provide for habitat connectivity of prairie fauna, including pollinators (Hatten	  et al., 2013); E2	  would affect more wildlife species dependent on the prairie or	  intergraded habitats of	  Paradise Ridge (p. 163, Table	  47); The Moscow Sustainable Environment Commission again weighs in: The SEC is greatly troubled that ITD acted unilaterally when	  choosing E-‐2	  as their preferred alternative, ignoring	  recommendations from US	  Fish and Wildlife	  Service, Environmental Protection Agency and	  Idaho	  Department of Fish	  and	  Game. These Agencies all recommend avoidance of E-‐2	  as this alignment	  “will have the greatest	  direct	  and indirect 	  impacts 	  to 	  wildlife 	  and 	  other 	  resources.” [October 26, 2007 letter IDFG (Dave Cadwallader, Clearwater Regional Supervisor) to ITD (James Carpenter, District Engineer)] − UNGULATES The Idaho Department of Fish and Game stood up against the	  eastern alignment from the	  very beginning, but ITD continually pushed	  the E2 route,  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  calling in 3 different Wildlife experts (2005, 2007, and 2010). All three	  stated that the	  eastern alternative	  posed the	  largest concern for big	  game	  among	  the	  3	  alternatives being	  considered. − E2	  would or could pass through higher quality habitat for ungulates, including elk,	  moose and deer,	  that 	  utilize 	  prairie 	  (p. 	  171) 	  increase 	  noise and human	  presence in	  habitat used	  by ungulates (p. 171) affect more acres of ungulate habitat than	  C3 or W4 (4.4 ac vs. 0 and	  0, respectively, p. 171), an estimate	  that is low because	  this acreage	  does not include 	  prairie 	  found 	  in 	  the 	  area 	  which 	  ungulates certainly	  use for forage, movement, or refuge; − PINE	  FOREST	  HABITAT Approximately 89% of the ponderosa pine communities	  have been lost in 	  Latah 	  County.	  − E2	  would affect more acreage of coniferous forest than C3 or	  W4 (3.9 ac v. 0 and 0, respectively p. 164, Table 48), destroying habitat for northern alligator lizard, pygmy nuthatch and long	  eared myotis; The northern alligator lizard (Elgaria	  coerulea)	  and pygmy nuthatch (Sitta pygmaea)	  are among the species	  listed as	  “Species	  of Greatest Conservation Need in the Palouse Prairie”	  [(IFG xxxx)] Anecdotal: A	  woman	  who	  lives on Eid Road in a	  house that would	  be destroyed	  by E2 says that they have 15-‐20	  owls living in some trees behind their house. Species of owl unknown.  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  − FARMLAND E2	  would take twice as much prime farmland as would C3. “The recommended alternative from the perspective of impact on	  farmland	  would	  be the C-‐3	  alignment.” [DEIS	  summary of results] The C3	  alternative would split fewer farms (4) than would E2 (6) and would result in fewer “remnant farms” of	  less than 20 acres (2 for	  C3, 5 for	  E2). (Community Impact	  Assessment	  Ch 3 Land Use Plans and Policies, p. 15) [FLINT] SEC is concerned that E-‐2	  impacts the most acreage of prime farmland of all the alternatives. C-‐3	  has the least 	  impact 	  to 	  prime 	  farm 	  land 	  and 	  the 	  least amount of	  new impervious pavement. This is of	  interest 	  because 	  it 	  may 	  impact 	  the 	  future sustainability of local food production. As	  indicated by the recent Palouse-‐Clearwater Food	  Summit (January 28, 2013 at	  the 1912 Center, Moscow, ID), there is an increasing demand for locally produced foods. − CONSTRUCTION The C3	  alternative has smaller cut and fill maximum heights and	  requires 26% less total excavation. This means less disturbed ground in C3. Disturbed ground is prime	  habitat for invasive	  and noxious weeds. Given	  that ITD may clear “330’ from the edge of traveled way” to permit	  big game to be seen along E2	  (p. 7	  Safety Analysis), the disturbance footprint of E2 is truly massive.  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  Staging areas, haul roads, batch plants, gravel or fill sources	  and rubble pile locations 	  all	  have 	  impacts, both	  in	  terms of possible direct impacts to	  prairie remnants and in terms of	  additional disturbed ground susceptible	  to invasive	  weeds. These	  areas need	  to	  be specified	  in	  the DEIS, not left to	  the design	  phase. [FLINT] − MITIGATION The primary means of mitigation	  is avoidance of disturbance. Palouse	  Prairie cannot simply	  be re-‐created because it 	  consists 	  of 	  so 	  much 	  more 	  than 	  just 	  the 	  plant community	  that many	  people associate with the prairie. It can	  be argued that	  the greatest	  loss is below ground	  – the complex character, properties, and biotic communities of uncultivated native	  soil are	  irreplaceable. These	  soils have	  required thousands of	  years to develop and are basically destroyed	  with	  any disturbance. The scientific	  community	  knows	  very	  little about the soil ecology	  of native soils; consequently, the danger of losing something without even knowing it exists	  (Dr. Dave Huggins, WSU	  Soil Scientist). The EPA noted for this project, “One of the most critical aspects of applying context sensitive design	  is 	  the 	  preservation 	  of 	  ecological	  connectivity… 	  This can best be achieved using avoidance and minimization of impacts – which are the first and second priorities	  for mitigating impacts	  … Compensatory mitigation	  is appropriate	  only for truly unavoidable impacts that	  cannot	  be further	   #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  addressed through improved siting	  and design when an action alternative is selected. …	  We anticipate	  that avoidance	  of sensitive, rare, and/or high	  value terrestrial and	  aquatic habitats	  will be the most	  significant	  environmental need for	  this proposed	  project. Maintaining habitat connectivity …	  will be a necessity.” Under “Topics of Concern and Controversy” the DEIS states, “there has been disagreement between IDFG 	  and 	  ITD 	  regarding 	  appropriate mitigation.” One recent mitigation proposal by IDFG is to put funding in 	  a 	  “bank” – $750,000	  for E2	  and $325,000	  for	  C3. This is another	  indication that	  the E2 alignment is much worst environmentally. I	  cannot 	  comment 	  on 	  specific 	  mitigation 	  measures as such measures will not be	  identified until the	  Record	  of Decision	  is issued. (“FHWA	  will issue a Record	  of Decision	  (ROD) selecting an	  Action	  Alternative, a combination	  of the Action	  Alternatives, or the No	  Action	  Alternative. The ROD will also provide the rationale for the decision and identify 	  mitigation 	  measures.” 	  [Executive 	  Summary ES.11	  Next Steps]) It 	  is 	  obviously 	  far 	  superior 	  to 	  avoid 	  damaging 	  the prairie rather than	  to	  damage the ecosystem and	  then try to mitigate by other	  means. It 	  is 	  not 	  appropriate 	  to 	  suggest 	  that 	  as 	  there 	  will	  be increased 	  building 	  following 	  construction 	  of 	  the highway, the environmental effects of the highway will be overshadowed and no mitigation will be necessary. There is no mention of environmental mitigation for  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  harm to	  vegetation	  because ITD does not believe that	  there is any direct	  impact. However, Prather’s vegetation study	  shows the inevitability	  of this happening and	  there should	  be some recognition	  by ITD 	  of 	  reparation – farmers also should be concerned that their fields	  are going to receive more weed pressures than they currently do. It 	  is 	  unclear 	  what 	  mitigation 	  measures 	  ITD 	  will	  take as ITD will “implement stipulations in a	  Memorandum of Understanding with IDFG which is currently	  being developed”	  (DEIS, Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments, pg. 230). At a	  minimum, ITD should consider either a) avoiding the E-‐2	  alignment or b) constructing structures for large 	  animal	  movement 	  to 	  reduce 	  vehicularungulate collisions. [SEC letter] Mitigation 	  must 	  include 	  a 	  management 	  plan, 	  as 	  the indirect 	  effects of the realignment will continue to	  damage adjacent Palouse Prairie.	  Also, decisions of mitigation acreage must be based on more than presence	  of a	  few plant species. Ideally, the	  determination	  would	  be made by an	  informed, independent 	  party.	  And 	  it 	  should 	  be 	  spelled 	  out 	  in the FEIS, not	  the ROD. Latah County	  Comprehensive	  Plan The E-‐2	  alignment goes against much of the Natural Resource Element	  in Latah County’s Comprehensive Plan. − Latah County	  Comprehensive	  Plan NATURAL RESOURCE ELEMENT Goal: To ensure sound stewardship of the County’s  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  natural resources.

Box 7129 Boise, ID 83707-‐1129 − March 5, 2013 − Subject: U.S. 95, Thorn Creek Road	  to	  Moscow Project − To whom it may concern: Since	  1973, the	  Idaho Conservation League	  has been	  Idaho’s voice for clean	  water, clean	  air and	  wilderness—values 	  that 	  are 	  the 	  foundation 	  for Idaho’s 	  extraordinary 	  quality 	  of 	  life. 	  The 	  Idaho Conservation	  League works to	  protect these values through public education, outreach, advocacy and policy development. As Idaho's largest state-‐based	  conservation organization, we represent over 20,000	  supporters, many of whom have a	  deep personal interest in	  protecting human	  health	  and	  the environment. − We appreciate the fact the transportation safety is a	  top priority for the	  Department. At the	  same	  time, we believe	  that there	  are	  steps that the	  Department can take to reduce the effects of its projects to	  the environment. −  ITD 	  will	  mitigate 	  for 	  the 	  impacted 	  functions 	  and 	  values of the wetlands according to	  33 CFR	  Parts 325 and	  332, Compensatory Mitigation	  for Losses of Aquatic Resources. The wetland	  mitigation	  is described	  in	  the Conceptual Wetland	  Mitigation	  Technical Report (ITD, 2013) and summarized in Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments. It will include use of credits from the Cow Creek Mitigation	  Site, which	  is	  within the same watershed just south of the impacted wetlands. Mitigation credits will also be purchased from a mitigation bank if more area is needed. The cumulative impacts	  to wetlands	  are also evaluated by	  the USACE as part	  of	  their	  permitting program and are	  considered in the mitigations	  that they	  require for all wetland impacts. ITD has committed to many other mitigation measures including sediment and erosion control measures	  during construction, reseeding, stormwater treatment to reduce water	  quality impacts and weed management to minimize	  weed dispersal from the project, and wildlife crossings. ITD 	  has 	  been 	  working 	  with 	  agencies 	  including 	  USFWS and IDFG to develop mitigation measures for wildlife. All required permits and approvals, including	  permits for	  in water	  work, will be obtained prior	  to construction should an action alternative be selected. The commitments and mitigation that ITD and IDFG agreed upon are	  identified in the	  FEIS	  Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments. ITD 	  will	  design 	  crossings 	  that 	  are 	  within 	  a 	  100-‐year  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  For example, many of ITD’s projects involve	  the	  loss of wetlands, which	  are important to	  wildlife and	  water quality protection. The preferred alternative will reduce area wetlands by more than three acres. On its face, this might appear to be negligible, but the incremental loss of	  wetlands over	  time, for	  a variety	  of reasons, is like death by	  a thousand paper cuts. As such, we recommend	  that the Department mitigate for the loss of these wetlands. Ideally, a wetland mitigation program would restore historical wetlands within	  the affected	  watersheds. The Department could utilize historical information, such as	  aerial photos, to determine the location and extent of wetlands that have	  been lost over time, and then target these	  locations for restoration. Similarly, the	  Department should consider funding a	  mitigation program, which would restore habitat for wildlife 	  and 	  plants.	  In 	  this 	  particular 	  area, 	  restoring patches of Palouse Prairie habitat would	  make the Thorn Creek to Moscow Project	  more palatable from and environmental standpoint. Another concern	  that our members have with ITD projects is the effects to	  water quality.	  During construction, the contractors	  need to take steps	  to reduce erosion and sediment	  delivery to waterways. There are many best practices that have been	  developed	  by transportation and construction officials around	  the country, which	  may be employed here	  to reduce	  erosion and sediment. All necessary water quality and	  fill permits must be obtained	  before construction	  begins.  floodplain to pass the 100-‐year flood event, however, the remainder	  of	  the crossings will be designed to pass a	  25	  or 50-‐year flood depending	  on the site. Disturbed	  ground along	  the	  roadway	  will be	  seeded with native grasses and forbs that will be	  successful and will minimize weed establishment. Trees and shrubs will not be planted	  next to	  the roadway to	  discourage wildlife from browsing along the roadway, to prevent ice 	  from 	  forming 	  in 	  shaded 	  areas 	  of 	  the 	  roadway 	  and 	  to improve 	  sight 	  distance.	  	  	  However, 	  the 	  grass 	  and 	  forb seed mix along the roadway will uptake nutrients	  and help	  to	  filter sediments and	  toxicants in	  the stormwater,	  thereby 	  helping	  to improve	  water quality.	  See	  FEIS	  Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments.  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  At tributary crossings, we appreciate	  the	  fact that structures	  will be placed to accommodate stream flows. All crossings should accommodate 100-‐year flood events and provide passage for	  aquatic organisms. We also	  recommend	  planting riparian	  buffer strips along these tributaries within	  300 feet of the shoulder of the road. The riparian	  strips should consist of native grasses, sedges, shrubs, and trees. This will reduce the amount	  of	  pollution draining from the road	  surface into	  the waterway. Finally, we	  believe	  that ITD should monitor the	  number of vehicle-‐wildlife collisions that occur between	  Lewiston	  and	  Moscow. The locations of these collisions should be recorded by species, date, time of	  day, latitude and longitude. While recording such information has	  been traditionally been documented	  by milepost, latitude and longitude information 	  will	  yield 	  more 	  meaningful	  data.	  This information 	  should 	  be 	  compiled 	  in 	  an 	  annual	  report and made	  available	  to the	  public and the	  Idaho Department of Fish and Game. The reports would help	  inform future safety and wildlife	  mitigation needs should	  they arise. − Sincerely, Brad	  Smith, Conservation	  Associate  L-‐31  Sharon W.

Box 7129 Boise, ID 83707-‐1129 − Dear Mr. Rush: I	  am 	  writing 	  you 	  with 	  concerns regarding the proposed	  Highway 95 rerouting, south	  of Moscow. If 	  you 	  would 	  please 	  take 	  a 	  moment 	  to 	  consider 	  the following, I would greatly appreciate it. Please note that	  I do not	  reside anywhere near	  the proposed alternatives, therefore	  I do not stand to personally benefit or face losses related	  to	  the outcome of this decision, other than	  as a concerned	  Moscow resident. I	  went 	  to 	  the 	  ITD 	  Public 	  Hearing 	  on 	  January 	  23rd and was thankful for the	  friendly assistance	  I received from the ITD staff	  and consultants.	  I	  went to the meeting with several key concerns; how do the E-‐2	  and C-‐3	  alternatives compare regarding safety,	  how 	  will 	  weather 	  conditions 	  affect 	  traffic safety on alternatives	  E-‐2	  and C-‐3, and which eight businesses will be displaced if C-‐3	  were chosen?	  I was very surprised by what I learned and would like to share these insights with you. First, I spoke	  with Curtis Amzen, ITD District 2	  Project Development Engineer. He	  informed me	  that	  the main reason E-‐2	  is safer	  than C-‐3	  is that it  between	  alternatives. See	  the	  FEIS	  Section 4.10	  for additional detail regarding the severity of	  crashes in different	  locations, including Reisenauer Hill.	  Improvements at Reisenauer Hill	  are discussed	  in General Response Safety-‐5. The alternatives would have Expressway Access Control as described in General Response	  Access. General Response Weather-‐2	  regarding the reference five-‐month data set and how it relates to the larger 30+-‐year data set. See	  Response	  L-‐21	  for a	  response to Bradley Halter’s comments. See	  General Response	  Weather-‐1	  regarding how information 	  for 	  the 	  C-‐3	  Alternative was evaluated in the Weather	  Analysis. General Response Weather-‐8	  discusses the validity of the Weather Analysis and	  the Safety Analysis. The Weather Analyses (Qualls 2014) describe the general climate	  of the	  region based on historical climate information such as	  data from the University	  of Idaho 	  Plant 	  Sciences 	  Farm 	  (PSF),	  which 	  extends 	  back 	  to 1892. The climate is the same for all their alternatives. The variability	  in weather characteristics between alternatives is based on physical and topographic variations in the landscape and alignments but all the alternatives would be	  designed to AASHTO standards and will be	  safe. The relative safety is 	  reflected 	  in 	  the Revised	  Safety Analysis (ITD 2013). General Response Weather-‐3, Weather-‐4, Weather-‐5	  and Weather-‐6	  address comments on ice, snow, snowdrift, fog and wind.  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  has less distance (0.7 miles) of 5-‐lane 	  highway 	  (4 lanes 	  with 	  a 	  center 	  turn 	  lane).	  This 	  is 	  where accidents are	  greatest due	  to increase	  vehicle	  travel from entering and exiting businesses.	  I	  find 	  this 	  ironic 	  because	  looking	  at the	  safety concerns	  of most people in our community	  they	  are worried about accidents on Reisenauer Hill,	  where actual fatalities occur at high speeds. As you may know, the predicted crash rate (crashes/year) is 10.9	  for C-‐3	  and 7.7	  for E-‐2. But when looking at injury/fatality 	  numbers 	  for 	  E-‐2	  and C-‐3, the difference is very little; 3.8 and	  4.7 respectively. If you look	  at the rural divided highway	  segment, which most of -‐2	  is, you’ll find that it actually has a	  HIGHER fatality and injury rate than C-‐3’s similar segment. Another consideration	  is that as development occurs along the undeveloped	  portion	  of E-‐2	  near Moscow, additional access points may be created. Although	  Type IV right -‐of -‐way will be purchased for	  the E-‐2	  alignment and it has been stated that new access points would	  not easily be granted, it is still possible. Any additional future access	  points	  along	  E-‐2	  would decrease the safety of the highway bringing it closer to	  that of C-‐3. Much of the development along C-‐3	  has already occurred and the likelihood of	  additional access points there would appear to be less. I	  also 	  talked 	  with 	  Dr. 	  Russell	  Qualls,	  ID 	  State Climatologist and	  ITD’s weather consultant for the safety study. It is	  not a secret here in Moscow that many think the weather data taken for five months  See	  General Response	  Displacment-‐1	  for a clarification	  of the potential residential and	  businesses impacts.	  FHWA and ITD must balance	  both the	  human and natural environmental impacts with	  the safety benefit for	  the general public.

He said that the only way to “infer” data from one unrelated	  site to	  another is if the data is collected	  at locations 	  specific 	  to 	  the 	  alternatives 	  over 	  a 	  long period	  of time. Here are a couple of Mr. Halter’s responses from a recent	  email: “The	  report refers to the	  desire	  to characterize	  the	  climate of the study	  area, yet only	  data from Jan. through May 2005 were included in the study. Since the word "climate" usually refers to some long-‐term average	  of meteorological variables, preferably 5 to 10	  years, it would appear to me that this study falls far	  short	  of	  characterizing the climate of	  the study area.” “It appears to me	  that the	  C-‐3	  alternative was eliminated from consideration at the	  very beginning.	  No measurements were made in the vicinity	  of the new alignment sections, which deviate from the present 95. In	  analyzing the possible new alignment corridors for 95 on	  pp. 2526, assessments are given for the Eastern and Western alternatives. However, of the Central Corridor, the report, in	  its first mention	  of the  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  Central Corridor, says only that it "... is described	  better by the climate description	  of the Eastern	  Corridor...” So, the Central Corridor has not actually been	  characterized	  in	  its own	  right by the study!” If 	  the 	  methodology 	  used 	  to 	  collect 	  weather 	  data 	  can be deemed	  inaccurate, then	  Mr. Amzen’s safety study should be re-‐evaluated with proper climate	  data. And, if climate differences are present then	  this could cause the alignments to have crash modification or calibration factors applied affecting the outcome of	  weather	  related crash data. It	  seems	  prudent that if safety is	  a top priority then you should use your due diligence to ensure that the data is as accurate as possible. Over the course of the nine years during which the DEIS was drafted, that quality data could have been collected. Many	  people who visit and live on the ridge in winter	  have seen increased levels of	  snow, ice, 	  snow 	  drifting 	  due 	  to 	  high 	  winds 	  and 	  ice 	  forming fog, but	  we have no way of	  proving this scientifically in 	  a 	  measured 	  way 	  due 	  to 	  lack 	  of 	  data.	  Please collect proper data before drawing a potentially	  incorrect 	  conclusion 	  as 	  to 	  the 	  safety of the E-‐2	  alternative. If weather had been taken seriously as	  a safety factor in the DEIS studies, would the conclusion have been that the E-‐2	  and C-‐3	  alternatives are	  equally safe?	  Or would the	  C-‐3	  alternative	  have	  been projected as the	  safest alternative?	  If Mr. Halter were	  to attempt to use	  Mr. Quall’s	  weather data to guess	  at conditions	  on the proposed alternatives, here is what	  he says: “Even with the	  lack	  of data, I think	  a consideration  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  of the C-‐3	  alignment topography and the conclusions	  drawn from the assessments	  of the Eastern and Western Corridors can	  lead	  to	  some useful conclusions regarding C-‐3. The Western Corridor assessment includes a higher likelihood	  of cold air drainage temperatures	  leading to possible icy 	  or 	  frosty 	  road 	  surface.	  This 	  is 	  because 	  the Western Corridor includes significant sections	  in the lowland 	  flats.	  The 	  new 	  C-‐3	  alignment, located on higher sloping terrain	  to	  the east of present 95 could very	  well be above much of the cold air pooling which	  occurs in	  the flats below. Furthermore, being lower in elevation than the	  Eastern Corridor, it would	  more frequently be below the fog, which	  was recorded	  at the eastern	  monitoring site. Note that it is the high elevation sites, the eastern (over the western shoulder of Paradise	  Ridge)	  and Reisenauer	  Hill,	  that 	  had 	  the greatest reductions in visibility	  due	  to fog.”	  At the IDT Hearing, I also	  spent more than	  an	  hour talking with Tim Long, District	  Right	  of	  Way Supervisor, and Carmen Reese, Senior Right of Way Agent. We looked	  at which	  eight businesses would be displaced	  on	  alternative C-‐3. They informed me that	  in fact	  “no businesses” will be displaced, and the widening of	  current	  Hwy 95 would have no effect beyond a	  potential noise increase.	  I	  was surprised that ITD had “eight businesses displacements” as one of its main	  four reasons for not choosing C-‐3	  as its preferred alternative since this information is inaccurate. Tim Long wanted me to stress in this letter	  that	  there will be “no  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  definitive businesses displacement” (on	  C-‐3) and this is “misleading” to the public. I expect	  to see this information 	  corrected 	  in 	  the 	  subsequent 	  ITD Hearing information boards and in the DEIS/FEIS. Another concern	  for Moscow and	  the surrounding communities	  is	  the displacement of residents. On February 11, 2013	  I spoke	  again with Tim Long to clarify	  what we may	  expect for residential displacements. He said	  that E-‐2	  would displace the most residents because of issues with a displaced well and that ITD had decided to relocate all of the residences within the mobile home park and a house above the park on	  Eid	  Rd. He also	  stated	  that only one residence would	  be displaced	  along the C3	  route. This information is very different than that presented	  at the 01/23/13 public hearing and	  in	  the	  DEIS, which stated that C-‐3	  would displace 7	  residences and E-‐2	  would displace only 5. It appears that	  there has been an error	  made in the information 	  disseminated 	  to 	  the 	  public 	  and 	  to 	  the board	  making the final alignment decision. The issues I have pointed out	  above are a select	  few that	  I felt	  were especially important	  in terms of	  safety and impact on residents along	  the	  two alternatives. I have	  not covered the	  importance	  of preserving prime farmland,	  ungulate habitat, and	  the last	  few remaining examples of	  intact	  Palouse Prairie.	  I am requesting you consider changing the preferred	  alternative to	  C-‐3, which is comparable in safety and mobility to E-‐2, but will create less displacements of human	  settlement, less negative impact 	  on 	  wildlife, 	  help 	  maintain 	  plant  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  communities, and conserve prime farmland. Please take into account	  these considerations when making your final decision on the realignment of US-‐95.

Box 7129 Boise, ID 83707-‐1129 − Dear Mr. Rush: Citizens for a Safe 95 is a group	  of more than	  90 landowners 	  who 	  own, 	  rent, 	  and 	  reside 	  on 	  property impacted 	  by 	  one 	  or 	  more 	  of 	  the 	  alternative alignments assessed in the	  Thorn Creek-‐to-‐Moscow Highway 95 Draft Environmental Impact Statement [DEIS].	  Collectively, we own more than 80% of the property ITD needs to	  acquire for any of the proposed	  new routes. We previously supplied ITD with a map showing our supporters (an updated version is attached). We believe the ITD has done a comprehensive, detailed, and thorough job with the DEIS. We unanimously support the Preferred Alternative—Route E2. Everyone signing this letter	  is a landowner, tenant, or business owner* in	  the area affected	  by one or another of the	  proposed routes for the	  new section of highway. We have followed	  this project— closely—since the late 1990s. For many of us, the uncertainty about where this highway will go has  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  interfered 	  with 	  the 	  use 	  and 	  disposition 	  of 	  our property for a decade. More importantly, we and	  the thousands of	  vehicles that	  travel Highway 95 daily have endured	  a dangerous roadway for too	  long.	  There 	  are 	  numerous 	  reasons 	  why 	  we 	  believe E2	  is the best	  alternative and some are listed below. But the bottom line is we support Route E2 because it 	  is 	  the 	  safest, 	  least 	  disruptive, 	  and 	  least 	  expensive alternative. ITD’s 	  DEIS 	  has 	  done 	  a 	  remarkable 	  job 	  in 	  identifying and assessing	  the	  potential impacts of the alternative	  routes. We	  recognize	  that there	  will be	  adverse	  effects with any route. But the	  positive	  aspects of replacing	  the	  current highway far outweigh	  any of the potential ill effects. Nevertheless, we urge ITD	  to conscientiously mitigate those adverse	  effects on both the	  environment and impacted homeowners. With respect to the environment we believe that appropriate	  mitigation of the	  impacts to wildlife, biologic resources, and	  landscape can	  be accomplished and—possibly—enhanced with Alternative	  E2. We	  support, and many of our members would be willing participants in, programs to preserve and improve habitat	  in the corridor. We strongly believe ITD should ensure that environmental mitigations be	  local and serve	  to replace the resource in this area, rather than cash payments to	  another agency. With respect to the acquisition of private property, we similarly believe that any relocation or purchase should also be on the basis	  of replacing like  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  property. Over the last decade many homes in	  the area	  have	  lost value	  due	  to the	  uncertainty in this decision. We believe it would	  be unfair for ITD to	  benefit by lower condemnation	  compensation	  to	  homeowners who	  have suffered	  diminution	  in	  value due to	  ITD’s delays. Regarding those who	  will be relocated or	  will lose significant	  portions of	  their	  property, we encourage ITD to	  assist them with	  sufficient compensation in order to obtain comparable property	  elsewhere and maintain their quality of life. We are willing and anxious to cooperate with	  ITD in	  “fine-‐tuning” Alternative Route E2 and the acquisition of the	  new right-‐of-‐way.	  However, the process of taking our land	  must be completely necessary and	  fairly compensated. We support Alternative E2 because we are convinced	  that this section of Highway 95 must be made as	  safe as	  possible for the thousands, ourselves included, who	  use it daily, and	  it must be built as quickly as possible. ITD 	  has 	  done 	  a 	  commendable 	  job 	  on 	  this 	  DEIS 	  and of responding to	  all the complaints and	  comments that	  dangerously stopped this project	  years ago. ITD is 	  now 	  recommending 	  the 	  only 	  route 	  that: avoids lethal Reisenauer Hill; provides the straightest route that avoids prime farmland; has the support of the landowners/farmers who	  own	  that land; impacts 	  the 	  least 	  number 	  of 	  homes 	  and 	  businesses; provides the fewest and	  safest accesses;  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  has environmental impacts that can	  be effectively mitigated locally; does not have an	  impact on	  an	  endangered	  species; avoids historic preservation issues; is 	  the 	  safest 	  and 	  most 	  cost-‐effective	  route. We congratulate you on a job well done in the interest 	  of 	  all	  those 	  who 	  traverse 	  this 	  beautiful	  state and who value the Palouse in particular. Many of those opposed to Alternative Route E2 claim to do so in the interest of Paradise Ridge.	  But in 	  reality, 	  these 	  opponents 	  are 	  attempting 	  to prescribe what to	  do	  with	  someone else’s private property. We, Citizens for a Safe 95, are also	  environmentally 	  sensitive:	  it 	  is 	  our 	  land 	  and 	  we 	  are responsible stewards. This highway has and will continue to pass	  through our property. We appreciate	  the	  character of and the	  importance	  of Paradise	  Ridge	  to the	  community. Many of us would rather	  not	  see Paradise Ridge developed; but residential encroachment	  on farm and woodlands on	  the Ridge is a private property issue, and	  a far greater endangerment to habitat than this highway. We ask that ITD proceed with Alternative Route E2 and respect the	  concerns of those	  who must give up their	  homes and property for	  the safety of those who use Highway 95. We urge you to listen to and consider the comments	  of all citizens, develop an effective mitigation strategy for the Preferred Alternative Route E2, publish	  the Final EIS selecting Alternative Route E2, and	  move forward	  with	  design	  and	  construction that minimizes	  the adverse impacts	  to  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  the landowners affected.

FHWA and ITD must balance	  both the	  human and natural environmental impacts with	  the safety benefit for	  the general public. General Response Alternative describes why FHWA and ITD identified the	  E-‐2	  Alternative as the Preferred	  Alternative. See General Response NEPA	  and	  Schedule regarding the environmental process and the	  anticipated schedule. Property and Safety Issues for the	  People	  Who Live	   #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  The alternatives are well-‐researched and conclude, much as in the last round in 2003, that route E2 along	  the	  base	  of Paradise	  Ridge is 	  the 	  safest, shortest,	  least 	  expensive,	  and 	  least 	  disruptive alternative. Nevertheless, the Paradise Ridge Coalition	  promises to mount	  vigorous opposition based on perceived, but often	  unsubstantiated, potential environmental impacts. This group can mobilize 	  more 	  people 	  than 	  there 	  are residents in the study area. As we are limited to those who are directly impacted, we cannot	  match them in numbers because most	  of	  their	  support	  comes	  from outside the Study	  Area. We, however, have the facts on our side. ITD recognizes this in the draft	  EIS and has identified E2 as the	  preferred alternative. We	  need to support ITD,	  commend 	  them 	  for 	  their 	  thoroughness,	  encourage	  them to mitigate	  any adverse	  effects, and urge	  them to move	  forward ASAP	  to produce	  the Final Environmental Impact Statement without further	  delay. Margrit and I are, unfortunately, out of town for the hearing on	  January 23, and	  several other members of our group	  are also	  unable to	  attend. Those who	  can go to the hearing should attend, listen politely	  to	  ITD's presentations, and	  offer 1 to	  3 to	  (perhaps) 5	  minutes of oral testimony during the open microphone. Your comments can be extemporaneous, or you can read a	  short statement if 	  that 	  is 	  more 	  comfortable, 	  or 	  offer 	  written testimony. Be sure to indicate that	  you might	  offer	   There ITD 	  recognizes 	  that the	  landowners who live	  within the	  project area and	  would	  be directly affected	  support the E-‐2	  Alternative and the majority of those supporting the C-‐3	  Alternative reside outside of the project area	  and would be	  indirectly affected. However, through the	  EIS	  process ITD is required to consider all substantive public	  and agency comments	  regardless	  of whether the commenters live within the project area. The improvements to the roadway would benefit all of the traveling public. The impacts to farms, residences and	  businesses are considered very	  important in the decision-‐making	  process. During the right-‐of-‐way and design processes when detailed geotechnical and survey data is available, and should an action alternative	  be	  selected, then ITD would work closely with impacted landowners on	  right-‐of-‐way, access and design details. Any relocation or	  acquisition will be conducted fairly and equitably according	  to the	  Uniform Relocation Act. See	  Appendix 5 Safety and Delay See	  General Response	  Schedule	  for a	  description of	  the environmental process and the	  anticipated schedule. In response to public comments, the comment	  period was extended to March 23, 2013. The Safety Analysis has been revised since the DEISwas published	  but the findings remained	  valid. See General Response Safety-‐3. Private	  Property and Land Use	  Disruption Issues General Response Displacement-‐1	  offers clarification regarding residential and business impacts. All affected  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  more thoughts later in additional written testimony. We should do this, if for no other reason, to keep the opponents from monopolizing the conversation and the	  microphone. After the hearing we should	  meet as a group	  prior to the February 23 closing of the comment period. We can then help each other to provide conscientious	  written testimony	  to support our position	  and	  help	  ITD to	  move this process forward. Because the draft Environmental Impact Statement supports	  our position, you can take your	  testimony directly from ITD's summaries. Use those materials they have sent	  you, or	  use some the quotes from the document	  below. Feel free to use anything you like. There are a	  couple of areas where ITD did not do enough as I discuss below. I suggest we	  emphasize	  these in our	  formal written statements. These have to do with failure to recognize the impacts on people who	  own, and	  live on, the land	  actually touched by these routes -‐as opposed to Moscow people and	  outsiders -‐who are trying to dictate	  other people about the use of their private property. Be sure to	  mention	  in	  your testimony that you are one of those who lives there, does business there, have your	  lifetime investment	  there, pays taxes on this property, and lives on and uses this highway every day. Property and Safety Issues for the	  People	  who live	  there. There are two categories of issues that ITD does not appropriately emphasize. Both have	  to do with the	   landowners 	  and 	  residents 	  will	  be 	  compensated according	  to the	  Uniform Relocation	  Act. See FEIS Appendix 5, Uniform Relocation	  Act. General Response Displacement-‐1	  offers clarification regarding residential and business impacts. General Response Access provides updated information 	  regarding 	  Access 	  Control	  for 	  the 	  action alternatives. Additional information	  regarding Visual Impact has been	  the added	  to	  the FEIS Section	  4.11. As a correction, while the C-‐3	  Alternative would be very	  close to one National Register eligible resource, it would avoid physically impacting it. The summarized information from	  the DEIS is accurate with the following clarifications: The Safety and Weather Analyses were revised but the findings remain valid. Access, mobility and	  travel user costs are further evaluated in the	  FEIS	  Section 4.10 and in the Mobility and Road User Cost Study (ITD, 2014a). See	  General Response	  Weeds and Wildlife	  regarding Paradise	  Ridge	  and Palouse	  remnants. ITD 	  has 	  met 	  with 	  IDFG 	  and 	  come 	  to 	  an 	  agreement 	  on mitigation measures as described in Chapter 9 Environmental Commitments. ITD is committed to continue to work	  with IDFG and other resource agencies throughout final design and project implementation 	  to 	  further 	  refine 	  the 	  mitigation measures described in Chapter 9. See	  General Response	  Agency regarding the	  disagreement between	  ITD and	  agencies regarding ITD's 	  Preferred 	  Alternative.  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  impacts 	  to 	  those 	  property 	  owners 	  and 	  residents that	  live within the areas impacted by the	  decision and those	  local residents who travel this highway system on a daily basis. These residents	  and property owners overwhelmingly support Alternative E2 because it directly affects their everyday home	  life. In contrast, most of those	  that oppose the E2 alternative largely live outside the Study Area, do not own property directly affected by the alternative routes, and	  are concerned	  about indirect 	  effects on	  Paradise Ridge,	  much 	  of 	  which 	  is on	  the	  periphery or outside	  the	  Study area. Safety and Delay Issues No More Delay.	  This decision process has been going	  on for nearly	  20 years. This is one	  of the	  most dangerous stretches of major highway in	  all of Idaho,	  and the most dangerous in	  our region, extending	  from Benewah County	  to Riggins. Too many people have died and suffered severe injuries while this delay has proceeded. Our friends and neighbors continue to	  use this road	  every day and	  our families are at unnecessary risk. There should	  be no	  further delays. The	  safest road possible	  should be built ASAP. Any extension of the review period	  or more litigation	  should	  be discouraged. Safety	  is the	  Main Issue.	  Three of the top thirteen most dangerous half mile segments in all of Idaho highways are found	  in 	  these 	  5 	  miles.	  Considering Idaho's 	  terrain 	  and 	  climate,	  this 	  is 	  remarkable. 	  The high	  accident rates are due to	  too	  many private accesses, curves, hills, bad weather conditions, and ever increasing	  traffic volume. Five	  fatalities and 18  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  severely debilitating injury accidents occurred since the current	  court	  imposed delay, nearly ten years ago. Most of us will remember the	  young	  area	  family lost	  on Reisenauer	  hill not	  included in these statistics. The preferred alternative, Route E2 is	  the safest and is	  estimated to reduce accident	  rates by 69%, the most of any alternative. That would have translated to four	  less deaths, 13 less severely debilitating crashes, and	  150 less accidents over the past ten	  years. More of these tragic crashes are projected	  to	  occur in 	  the 	  future, 	  as 	  traffic 	  volume increases. E2	  is clearly the Safest Alternative. It 	  is 	  the straightest, flattest, shortest, least expensive route; with the fewest accesses, and least poor weather conditions. E2 is	  the only	  alternative that eliminates	  Reisenauer Hill,	  minimizes 	  curves,	  has 	  the 	  minimum number of accesses and	  is most favorable for conversion to "no access"	  status	  for the next generation of highways. Private	  Property and Land Use	  Disruption Issues E2	  is the Least Disruptive Alternative.	  Nearly all	  the land 	  in 	  the 	  corridor 	  is 	  private 	  property.	  The 	  owners of more than	  80% of the land	  directly impacted	  by the three alternatives have notified the ITD that	  they prefer	  alternative E2. E2 is less disruptive of	  local	  businesses;	  minimizes 	  residential	  and 	  business relocation,	  and 	  the 	  number 	  of 	  remaining 	  homes and businesses that must access the	  highway directly; results in	  the least fragmentation	  of farming operations; best	  preserves, protects	  and services	  the current agricultural practices	  in the  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  area; and is the	  least likely to encourage	  suburban encroachment into some	  of the	  best farmland in the northwest. The vast	  majority of	  farmers impacted 	  by 	  all	  three 	  routes 	  agrees 	  that	  E2 is the best alternative and	  least interferes with	  their operations. Paradise Ridge is 	  Private 	  Property. Most of the opposition	  to	  Route E2 centers around	  potential impacts 	  to 	  wildlife, 	  remnants 	  and 	  restoration 	  of native prairie, and visual effects on Paradise	  Ridge. These alleged effects occur on private land at the base of the ridge on	  the periphery of the study area, or largely outside the study area on	  the ridge itself. All of this land	  is private property. Currently, the	  ridge is subject	  to considerable pressure for	  residential development, is becoming less accessible	  to the	  public, and less hospitable	  to wildlife. As the ridge area continues to develop and is 	  fragmented 	  into 	  suburban 	  homes 	  and 	  lots, human	  interaction and habitat loss will be	  particularly significant with	  respect to	  big game and	  predator species, and	  predation	  and	  disturbances by suburban	  pets will more adversely affect these and other non-‐game	  populations than the	  proposed highway. This trend	  is likely 	  to 	  get 	  worse 	  in 	  the future. Stewardship of Paradise	  Ridge.	  Most of the landowners 	  on 	  and 	  adjacent 	  to 	  the 	  ridge 	  are responsible stewards and many generously have allowed public access to their property for generations, although	  no	  trespassing signs are becoming more prevalent. With	  respect to	  prairie  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  restoration, significant	  portions of	  these efforts are being undertaken	  by landowners who	  support alternative	  E2. Many of these	  owners view alternative	  E2	  as a	  restraint on ridge	  development and suburban encroachment from the	  west. They believe locating the highway at the base of the ridge may, in the long run, better	  preserve the current environment. However, it must be remembered that	  all of	  these efforts are voluntary. There are no	  guarantees that future owners and	  potential development will decide to	  ensure the perceived	  character of the ridge, sought by the opponents of this Alternative E2. Quarreling Views of the Ridge.	  With respect to visual effects, the	  perspective of	  those who look at the area differs 180 degrees from those of	  us who look from within the area. Those who view the ridge from the urban area of	  Moscow believe the highway at the base of the ridge will diminish	  their view. Landowners from the area believe 	  the 	  view from alternative E2 will enhance the view to the west and be an attractive gateway to Moscow. Environmental Mitigations Required	  and	  Proposed. The required and proposed mitigations to offset adverse	  environmental effects are	  nearly identical for	  all three routes as follows. C3 actually requires the most	  mitigation, including the only cultural heritage impacts. E2 has the largest wildlife impact associated with a	  stand of Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) timber, planted	  in	  the 1930s, that may be habitat for three species of potential concern	  (bat, songbird and lizard). W4. incidentally. is the  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  route that	  potentially most	  impacts the only endangered species found in the	  study area, and more CCC and earlier (1904) conservation tree plantings will	  be 	  destroyed.

You will also find these in the Executive and Brochure Summaries provided by ITD. Please feel free to copy these directly to include in your	  testimony. History In 	  1999,	  FHWA 	  and 	  ITD 	  began 	  developing 	  an Environmental Assessment (EA) for a	  20.4	  mile improvement 	  of 	  US-‐95	  from the Top of Lewiston Hill to Moscow. Alternative	  10A was selected by ITD and FHWA and a	  Finding	  of No Significant Impact (FONSI)	  was issued in May 2002. The project	  was litigated 	  by 	  the 	  Paradise 	  Ridge Defense Coalition, Inc. 	  in 	  2003. The court found that an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) would be	  required for the	  northern 4.6	  mile segment between Thorncreek Road and Moscow to allow full consideration of the impacts by the public and	  agencies. The southern	  15.8 miles was allowed to proceed and construction was completed in October 2007. Accidents  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  The crash statistics for the highway between 2001	  and 2010	  show that this section of US-‐95	  averages 22.0	  crashes per year and is expected to reach 24.8	  crashes	  per year by	  2017. Three High Accident Locations	  (HALs) are located within the project limits 	  (see 	  Table 	  31.	  High 	  Accident 	  Locations 	  (HALs).	  These segments have the highest crash rates in ITD District 2 and are in the top 13 highest crash locations 	  in 	  the 	  State 	  of 	  Idaho.	  The 	  crash 	  rates 	  in these locations and	  throughout the corridor are expected to increase	  as traffic volumes increase (ITD 2012a). Between	  2002 and	  2011 approximately 40 percent of the accidents in	  the project area occurred	  while a driver was negotiating a curve. Most severe in	  head-‐on	  collisions occurred	  while passing and	  private accesses. Most accesses and	  curves in	  C-‐3. Most associated with inclement weather. Worst weather in W-‐2, Icy road conditions may result from condensation on road surfaces	  during freezing conditions. Reisenauer Hill,	  had 	  the 	  highest 	  total number of hours with	  frost conditions, followed	  closely	  by	  the western corridor. The southern portion	  of the study area has the most severe frost conditions. E-‐2	  and C-‐3	  are included in 	  the 	  eastern corridor for weather and would both have less	  than half the number of hours with	  frost conditions than	  Reisenauer Hill and	  the western	  corridor. The frequency of wild animal crashes in 	  the 	  project area	  is much less	  than many other sections	  of US-‐95	  and many other highways in Idaho (Ruediger 2007). Crash	  data from 2002 thru	  2011 indicated	  that  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  there were 437 wildlife crashes along US-‐95	  in District 2. Of those, 37 occurred within the project limits.	  None 	  involved 	  injuries. Based	  on	  the low severity and randomness	  of the wildlife crashes, they are not	  anticipated to be a primary factor	  in the evaluation of	  the alignment	  alternatives. Table 1. High Accident Locations (HALs) Milepost/Location on U.S. 95/Idaho HAL Ranking Mile Post 337.67-‐338.17	  Danger Ranking Statewide 6 Mile Post 338.67-‐339.62	  Danger Ranking Statewide 13 Mile Post 340.62-‐341.12	  Danger Ranking Statewide 4 The Alternatives The No Action and 10	  Action Alternatives were identified 	  and 	  categorized 	  into 	  the western, central and eastern corridors. One	  alternative	  from each corridor was	  forwarded for detailed analysis	  to give a	  range	  of alignment alternatives. W-‐4 W-‐4	  is aligned west of existing US-‐95. W-‐4	  would displace fewer residences than	  C-‐3	  or E-‐2	  and would have similar effects to	  hazardous materials compared to E-‐2. W-‐4	  would have the greatest effects to wetlands, floodplains,	  and cultural/Section 4(f) resources. It would have the greatest number of tributary crossings and would require the greatest	  amount	  of	  new right-‐of-‐way.	  W-‐4	  would not affect potential long-‐eared myotis, northern	  alligator lizard, and	  pygmy nuthatch habitat associated	  with	  ponderosa pine stands near  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  Paradise	  Ridge.	  Of the alternatives, W-‐4	  would be the least	  consistent	  with the land use plans. C-‐3 The C-‐3	  Alternative would run closest to the current highway and	  would	  utilize much	  of the existing US95	  alignment. It would	  have the highest crash	  rate of the Action	  Alternatives. The primary differences between	  the C-‐3	  Alternative and the other Action Alternatives are that C-‐3	  would require the least amount of new right-‐of-‐way compared to W-‐4	  and E-‐2	  but would have the greatest business displacements. Similar to	  E-‐2, C-‐3	  would avoid cultural/Section 4(f) resources	  and would have the same number of tributary crossings. However, it would affect approximately three times the length of tributary channel compared to the E-‐2	  Alternative. It would	  avoid	  the pine stands that are potential Pygmy nuthatch, northern	  alligator lizard, and long-‐eared myotis habitat similarly to W-‐4. C-‐3	  would also have the least wetland effects. It would have the greatest effect to	  residences, 	  businesses,	  and hazardous material sites. E-‐2	  (Preferred	  Alternative) E-‐2	  is aligned east of existing US-‐95. The primary advantages of E-‐2	  are that it is aligned through flatter	  topography, has the fewest	  number	  of	  approaches, and has the	  greatest safety improvement 	  compared 	  to 	  the 	  other 	  Action Alternatives. E-‐2	  would affect the least amount of tributary channel and would avoid floodplains.	  Similarly to C-‐3, it would avoid cultural or Section 4(f)	  resources. The primary disadvantage of	  E-‐2	  over  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  the other	  alternatives is that	  it	  would be located closer to the base of Paradise Ridge and closer to moderate wildlife habitat. E-‐2	  would affect pine stands	  that are potential long-‐eared myotis, northern	  alligator lizard	  and	  pygmy nuthatch habitat. It would	  also	  have the highest noise impacts 	  of 	  the 	  action 	  alternatives. Preferred Alternative	  E2 The evaluation of effects during the screening process	  and the detailed analyses	  presented in this	  DEIS resulted in the lead agencies, FHWA and ITD, identifying 	  the 	  E-‐2	  Alternative as the Preferred Alternative. The final selection	  of an	  alternative will not be made until the alternatives' effects and	  comments on the DEIS from the public hearing have been	  fully evaluated. The E-‐2	  Alternative is identified 	  as 	  the 	  Preferred 	  Alternative 	  for 	  the following reasons: • It would have the greatest safety improvement. • It would have the fewest access points 	  and 	  atgrade	  county	  intersections. • It would have the least effect to streams. • It would avoid effects to cultural/Section 4(f) resources, businesses and floodplains. • It would have the shortest length with the shortest travel time. • It would have better weather conditions for driving than	  W-‐4. • It best meets the project purpose and need. Controversies that were Studied	  Extensively During the public and agency involvement processes, it became evident through	  repeated  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  written and verbal comments, that there were specific	  concerns	  and controversy related to the following topics: •	  Effects of the E-‐2	  Alternative on Paradise Ridge including 	  effects 	  to 	  the 	  Palouse 	  remnants, 	  potential	  wildlife effects and mitigation for wildlife	  impacts •	  Effects of weather on safety within corridors •	  Visual impacts to Moscow residents In 	  response 	  to 	  public 	  and 	  agency 	  concerns,	  FHWA and ITD prepared detailed studies on wildlife	  habitat, wildlife movement, weather, and visual quality. Wildlife Habitat and Wildlife Movement.	  IDFG, EPA and USFWS	  prefer the	  C-‐3	  Alternative to the E-‐2	  Alternative. This is primarily due to	  the perceived	  effects of the	  E-‐2	  Alternative on wildlife habitat and movement based on its proximity to Paradise Ridge.	  The primary reasons that C-‐3	  was not identified as the Preferred Alternative is because it	  would have the highest	  crash rate with the greatest	  number	  of	  at-‐grade	  access points compared to the other Action	  Alternatives and	  would	  have the highest business and	  residential displacements (eight businesses and seven homes). IDFG 	  proposed 	  that 	  ITD 	  deposit 	  funds 	  into 	  a 	  bank 	  or trust, to be used to purchase easements, complete habitat improvements in	  the Palouse region, or other activities that would	  benefit wildlife in	  the Palouse	  Ecoregion. IDFG proposed $500,000	  for W4, $325,000	  for C-‐3	  and $750,000	  for E-‐2	  depending on	  the selected	  alignment alternative. The studies concluded that wildlife species	  including  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  ungulates, may utilize the project area which	  offers low 	  to 	  moderate 	  quality 	  habitat 	  for 	  wildlife.	  The eastern corridor has more	  suitable	  habitat than the	  central or western corridors. More suitable habitat is 	  available 	  north, 	  south 	  and 	  east 	  of 	  the 	  project 	  area or concentrated	  in	  the gullies (Ruediger 2007). The studies concluded that none of the Action Alternatives would	  bisect important ungulate habitat or known	  migration	  corridors and	  that population-‐level	  effects 	  from 	  highway 	  construction were unlikely. Weather Conditions.	  During the public meetings held	  from 2004 to	  2006, weather as it pertained	  to	  safety was a major topic of concern. The public expressed concern that the	  topographic differences between	  the alternative corridors (west, central and	  east), could result in differing	  climatic conditions that	  could influence safety. To respond to this concern, a detailed weather analysis	  was	  developed that	  evaluated the differences in the weather in	  three corridors. The study measured wind speed, precipitation, snow, and	  road	  ice over the five month winter period. The study concluded that while there may be minor variations in climatic conditions	  in the corridors, they	  were not substantial. − The improvement of the lane widths, clear zones, steep grades	  and curves	  are more influential factors	  to safety.	  Therefore, weather was considered when developing the design	  elements but will not be a major factor for comparing the alternatives.  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  − Visual. There are differing opinions regarding the visual effects of the	  W-‐4	  and E-‐2	  alternatives. The Citizens for a Safe Highway 95, claiming to	  represent	  people collectively owning 80 percent	  of	  the land along E-‐2, were in favor	  of	  the E-‐2	  Alternative due to	  the "spectacular view" of the Palouse	  and of the	  City of Moscow for travelers. They believe that the beauty of Paradise Ridge could transform the highway	  into a gateway	  for Moscow, and that E-‐2	  could promote and preserve the Palouse landscape through scenic highway status. The group opposed alternative W-‐4, stating that it would disrupt westerly views and promote farmland conversion disrupting the agricultural setting (HDR 2005a). The Paradise	  Ridge Defense Coalition, who	  opposed	  the E-‐2	  Alternative, felt the expansion of the	  roadway should follow the	  existing	  route as much as possible in order	  to minimize the ecological footprint of road. In the	  view of those	  opposed to an E-‐2	  alignment, the ridge should remain untouched because it	  provides both aesthetic and environmental value	  as the	  last remaining natural prairie in the area (HDR 2006). Safety E-‐2	  would result in the greatest travel time reduction. Shortened travel times could improve the economic vitality of	  the area and could benefit	  freight	  transport, emergency service response, school access, bicyclists/pedestrians,	  and 	  mail delivery.  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  The C-‐3	  Alternative would have the highest	  predicted	  fatal, injury and	  total crashes of all the Action	  Alternatives. The C-‐3	  Alternative would be the least	  safe because the extra intersections, approaches, and suburban section would create	  turning traffic across US-‐95. The E-‐2	  Alternative would have the shortest alignment, the fewest public road	  intersections, the fewest commercial and residential approaches and would have	  better weather conditions for roadway safety compared to W-‐4. E-‐2	  would also have the greatest length of the	  four	  lane divided highway. These factors all contribute to E-‐2	  having the lowest predicted crash rate compared to the other	  alternatives. The E-‐2	  Alternative is predicted	  to	  reduce the crash	  rate of the existing alignment	  by about	  69	  percent. The W-‐4	  Alternative would encroach upon approximately 1.73	  acres of the	  Desteen/Davis Farmstead. This encroachment would not adversely affect any of the	  historic buildings but would remove several of	  the trees which were planted in the 1930s by the Civilian Conservation Corps. These trees provide a partial visual screen between the roadway and the farmstead. Removing the trees could alter the views	  of the farmstead adversely	  affecting	  the	  setting. Acquiring	  right-‐of-‐way and removing the trees would result	  in a Section 4(f)	  use. There are approximately 2.23 acres of Wetland	  9	  within the boundary farmstead. The W-‐4	  Alternative would	  affect 0.84 acres of the wetland	  located 	  on 	  the 	  farmstead.	  See 	  Sections 	  3.6 	  and 	  4.6	  for	  a discussion of	  wetlands.  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  − W-‐4	  would have increased noise and visual effects to the University of	  Idaho Arboretum, located on a hill approximately three-‐quarters of a mile north	  of W-‐4. It would have potential effects to the planned ball fields and	  nearby senior center on	  the southwest side of Moscow approximately one-‐half mile north of W-‐4. W-‐4	  would also have potential noise and	  visual effects to	  a master-‐planned	  community	  approximately	  one-‐quarter mile north	  of W-‐4. A new development planned near the	  C-‐3	  Alignment could	  potentially increase traffic and	  traffic related conflicts and access issues in the area. C-‐3	  would have indirect effects to businesses and approaches along	  the existing	  US-‐95	  alignment. − The primary indirect effect of E-‐2	  would be a	  visual effect to residents on Paradise	  Ridge due to	  the roadway alignment	  and acceleration of	  development. There could	  be more conversion	  of farmland up	  to	  one mile south	  of Moscow where growth is predicted with any	  of the	  alternatives. W4	  could result in greater indirect effects compared to the other	  alternatives because there are larger	  tracts of	  farmed land 	  on 	  the 	  western 	  corridor compared to the farmland near the E-‐2	  corridor. The rate of farmland conversion for W-‐4	  could also be expected	  to	  be higher because it would	  be closer to the universities, more accessible to the cities and closer to planned developments. − The floodplains (and a regulatory floodway)	  in the  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  project area are concentrated	  at the north	  end	  of the project	  within the Moscow Area of	  Impact	  where growth is expected and along the W-‐4	  alternative. There	  While none of the alternatives would directly affect	  federally listed threatened or	  endangered plants, they would bring the road closer	  to the Spalding's catchfly	  population and Palouse remnants. This	  could introduce weeds	  or have other indirect effects that	  could affect	  Spalding's catchfly plants found near	  the project	  area. The distance of	  each alternative	  from the	  Spalding's catchfly plants are	  shown in Table 63. Alternative Distances	  to Spalding's Catchfly. The	  project May Affect but is Not Likely 	  to 	  Adversely 	  Affect 	  (NLAA) 	  Spalding's catchfly	  due to these potential indirect effects. See Biological Assessment Technical Report. Measures that	  will be taken to minimize harm are described in Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments. Habitat loss and fragmentation resulting from the increased 	  development 	  on 	  Paradise 	  Ridge will continue, irrespective of the construction of the highway. Because deer commonly	  feed on lawns, ornamental plants, and	  fruit trees, the effects on	  deer would	  be minimal as deer thrive near humans. However, moose would likely be negatively affected as complaints by homeowners that moose	  are	  eating	  ornamental shrubs in their yards or tearing	  down	  fences often	  lead	  to	  the removal of animals.	  In 	  the 	  Paradise 	  Ridge 	  area,	  if 	  removal	  exceeds replenishment	  from immigration, moose would become temporary and	  intermittent residents.  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  Finally, thousands of acres of public lands with more suitable wildlife habitat are available north and east of Paradise	  Ridge and just over the	  Washington State Line. Because of the abundance of suitable habitat and	  the abundance of species, there is not	  expected to be substantial cumulative effects to wildlife	  and the	  effects would not reduce population	  viability.

As we are commenting on	  your DEIS, allow us to	  provide a little background	  on	  our organization. The Palouse Prairie Foundation (PPF) is a	  nonprofit organization	  dedicated	  to	  the preservation	  and	  restoration of	  native Palouse Prairie. The PPF's Board	  of Directors has considerable knowledge of the Palouse Prairie ecosystem and hands-‐on	  experience	  with its restoration. The	  PPF	  has an active membership that draws	  from multiple counties	  in the region and a mail list that reaches	  hundreds in	  multiple states. Our members include home owners, prairie enthusiasts, farmers, conservationists, teachers, students, scientists, agency personnel, etc. The PPF has	  an active outreach	  program with	  a high	  traffic website, a quarterly newsletter, and	  regularly scheduled	  presentations and	  workshops. The PPF also	  administers a	  mini-‐grant program to foster conservation, restoration and education activities	  pertaining	  to Palouse	  Prairie. The PPF	  is actively involved in shaping policies to conserve Palouse Prairie at the	  county level. For example, recent amendments to the	  Latah County Comprehensive Plan, and	  expected	  revisions to	  the Whitman County Critical Areas Ordinances, are the  earthworm and importance	  of pollinators has also been	  considered. See General Response Weeds. To	  offer additional detail regarding weed establishment	  and dispersal, we	  also incorporated more	  information from the Vegetation Technical Reports into the FEIS. These are concentrated in the FEIS	  Sections 3.8, 4.8	  and Chapter 6, Indirect and Cumulative	  Effects. None of the action	  alternatives would	  directly affect Palouse	  remnants; however all alternatives including the No Action Alternative would have indirect	  effects. Weed dispersal and establishment can also be increased 	  by 	  other 	  land 	  uses 	  such 	  as 	  residential	  development. Should	  an	  action	  alternative be selected, ITD 	  will	  implement 	  mitigation 	  measures 	  as 	  outlined 	  in Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments. ITD will collaborate with IDFG, USFWS, NRCS, and Conservation District staff during the design process to ensure successful mitigation 	  for 	  potential	  weed 	  impacts.	  Mitigation for weed dispersal and establishment will involve 	  minimizing 	  soil	  disturbance, 	  revegetating 	  bare soils	  to reduce risk of establishment, and species	  selection that will consider quick and sustainable groundcover. Additional mitigation measures are described	  in	  the FEIS Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments ITD will employ consultants when	  necessary who	  have expertise and	  knowledge of mitigation measures and species or environmental resource the mitigation measure is for. Mitigation	  measures are included in project costs. ITD and FHWA received a report	  Conservation of	  the Palouse Prairie Ecosystem -‐Phase	  3	  (Hill, 2011) and associated GIS	  information 	  from 	  USFWS.	  	  It 	  contained 	  information 	  on  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  product of PPF's local partnerships and	  efforts. The PPF	  played a	  key role	  in helping Whitman County to assess impacts of a	  wind farm (the	  Palouse	  Wind Project) on Palouse	  Prairie, and to develop a	  mitigation strategy for losses	  to prairie due to wind farm development. The PPF	  has been working in partnership with local conservation districts, the Idaho Department of Fish and Game, the	  Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to develop	  fine-‐scale, ground-‐truthed maps of	  Palouse	  Prairie in 	  Latah 	  and 	  Whitman 	  Counties.	  There have been surveys and inventories of Palouse Prairie	  within various target areas at various levels of mapping resolutions, including maps by the Natural Heritage Program; the map of prairie remnants in the current	  Project	  Area by Lichthardt	  (2005)	  that	  is utilized throughout	  the DEIS; the land cover map of Black	  et al. (1998); the survey	  of conservation priorities	  for threats	  to Palouse	  and Canyon	  Grasslands by Weddell and	  Lichthardt (1998); and the recent	  fine-‐scale map of prairie in a section of Latah and Whitman Counties	  by Looney and Eigenbrode	  (2012). These	  studies contribute	  to the science and body of	  literature regarding the quality and	  extent of Palouse Prairie. Why the fuss about Palouse Prairie?	  Well, as is touched upon in the DEIS, the Palouse Prairie once covered hundreds	  of thousands	  of acres	  in northwestern	  Idaho	  and	  southeastern	  Washington	  (Noss	  et al. 1995, Tisdale 1961), and comprised a	  mosaic of habitats including  species	  occurrences, plant communities and	  Palouse Prairie	  remnants. This information was considered and incorporated 	  in 	  the 	  DEIS.	  The 	  report 	  and 	  GIS information 	  also 	  includes 	  the 	  previous 	  cited 	  Palouse Prairie	  and plant data	  collected in previous years. Information 	  has 	  also 	  been 	  added 	  to 	  Chapter 	  9 regarding standard specifications and standard operating procedures that are typically included	  in	  project contracts, which	  would	  also	  minimize potential indirect 	  effects 	  to 	  Palouse 	  remnants.	  The 	  statement regarding perceived effects has been revised in the FEIS ES.8. ITD 	  and 	  FHWA 	  received 	  a 	  report 	  and 	  GIS 	  information from USFWS which was considered and incorporated in the DEIS. Additional information has since been provided	  and	  is included	  in	  the FEIS Section	  3.8. The spelling of the genus and	  species for the giant Palouse	  earthworm has been corrected in the	  FEIS	  3.8, 4.8	  and the General Wildlife Assessment Technical Report (IDFG 2006). Additional information	  regarding potential effects to	  the giant Palouse earthworm has been	  added	  to	  the FEIS 3.8 and	  4.8. When comparing the GIS data, the PG remnant data, which was provided with the report, were many small polygons of grassland, which	  encompassed	  a much	  smaller area than the remnants	  that were identified in ITD's 	  2005 	  report. Therefore, the 2005	  data	  was used but was supplemented	  to	  include two	  additional remnant	  areas that	  were not	  previously identified.  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  bunchgrass meadow-‐steppe communities, shrub thickets, open ponderosa pine parkland, low meadows and riparian areas (Daubenmire 1942, 1970). However, with agricultural intensification	  over the last 150 years, the prairie has been	  severely reduced and now occupies	  only a small fraction of	  its former	  range (Black et	  al. 1998). In fact, so much of	  the prairie has been lost	  that	  the Palouse	  Prairie is 	  widely 	  recognized	  by scientists as a	  critically endangered ecosystem with less than 0.1% remaining (Noss et al. 1995, Samson and Knopf 1994, Tisdale	  1961). Despite the severe losses to Palouse Prairie and the	  need	  for additional studies to	  adequately describe this ecosystem, it	  is clear	  that	  remnant	  prairie is a treasure-‐trove of	  biological diversity that	  must	  be conserved! The prairie is	  home to several hundred species	  of flowering plants	  (Lichthardt and Moseley 1997, Hanson et al. 2008, Skinner and Hall 2011), a	  number of woody shrub	  and	  tree species, perhaps hundreds of species of birds (palouseprairie.org/birds/swift.html), a number	  of	  large 	  ungulate species	  (including deer,	  elk and moose), and a	  much larger number of invertebrate	  species including 	  soil-‐surface dwelling species	  (e.g. insects) (Hatten et	  al. 2006, Looney et	  al. 2009), arachnids (Hatten unpublished), myriapods, mollusks, soildwelling species (micro-‐flora and micro-‐and mesofaunae)	  (Sánchez-‐de León	  2007), canopy species (Looney and Eigenbrode 2011), mycorrhizae, and a vast array	  of butterfly	  species (Pocewicz 2006,  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  Pocewicz et al. 2009, pollinatorwatch.org), and moth (Thompson 2006) and bee pollinators (Hatten et al. 2013, pollinatorwatch.org). Despite the fragmented condition of Palouse habitats, the prairie supports endemic and	  rare species. For example, found here are a dozen or more globally imperiled plant species with six of these occurring in Idaho (Lichthardt	  and Moseley 1997), a	  federally listed (Threatened)	  plant	  species (Spalding’s catchfly,	  Silene	  spaldingii)	  (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2007) and the rare giant Palouse earthworm (Sánchez-‐de León	  2007). The western bumble bee (Bombus	  occidentalis)	  was common on the Palouse and throughout the western USA, but populations of this species have experienced dramatic declines (Cameron et al. 2011) including on the Palouse where it hasn't been found since 1977 (Hatten et	  al. 2013). However, a	  population	  of this species has very recently been	  discovered	  in	  a Pacific Northwest bunchgrass grassland, the	  Zumwalt Prairie, some	  150 miles south of the Moscow-‐Pullman area	  (Kimoto et al. 2012). The discovery shows that the species is not extirpated in	  the Inland	  Pacific Northwest, and	  that it 	  may 	  yet 	  be 	  detected 	  in 	  Palouse 	  Prairie or forest communities	  of the region. Because of this, it is	  critical to preserve remaining remnants	  of Palouse Prairie. There are social, cultural and	  biological implications for	  those areas on the Palouse with remnant	  native habitats. Donovan	  et al. (2009) found	  that the Paradise	  Ridge area	  is both biologically and socially  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  important, 	  with 	  scenic 	  views, 	  outdoor 	  recreation,	  and biodiversity of the	  ridge	  identified by study participants as important. Less easily defined	  but equally important to study participants was the	  “sense	  of place”	  and “attachment”	  that they	  felt for Paradise	  Ridge	  and other butte	  outcroppings found	  in 	  the 	  agriculturally-‐dominated	  Palouse landscape. During the January 23 public hearing in Moscow, ID	  for	  the Highway 95 DEIS, multiple individuals gave testimony to the great	  significance of	  Paradise Ridge in	  their lives. Some said	  that it was their	  favorite place to “get	  away from it	  all.” Others said it 	  was 	  their 	  place 	  to 	  hike, 	  bike 	  and/or 	  ski, 	  and others mentioned	  birding and	  botanizing on	  the ridge and in the prairie. These testimonials and the aforementioned scientific study demonstrate	  just	  how important Paradise Ridge and	  native habitats are	  for the	  well being	  and health of local residents. Thus, the rarity of this habitat with all its diversity of plants and	  animals, and	  the love that locals have for it, 	  warrants 	  its 	  protection 	  and 	  restoration. The	  PPF	  and other organizations are	  committed to doing	  just that. GENERAL COMMENTS ON	  THE DEIS The difficulty that we have with the ITD's E2	  alternative	  is that it passes too high on the	  ridge	  and too close	  to some	  of the	  best and largest remaining prairie remnants in	  the region. This is stated in the technical reports	  of the DEIS. We summarize these points	  here. E2 would: • affect more than twice as many prairie remnants in 	  the 	  project 	  area 	  as 	  would 	  C3 	  or 	  W4 	  (24 	  vs.	  14 	  or  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  12	  remnants, respectively, p. 207, Table 62); • come closer to the largest and highest-‐quality prairie remnants in	  the project area (p. 26, Vegetation Technical Report, Lichthardt 2005); • by virtue of point 2	  above, put at risk a	  higher proportion	  of globally imperiled	  plant species found in 	  Palouse 	  Prairie than would C3 or	  W4 (Vegetation Technical Report, Lichthardt 2005); • put a	  higher number of prairie remnants, including 	  those 	  found 	  on 	  the 	  ridgeline 	  of 	  Paradise Ridge,	  at 	  risk 	  for weed invasions created by highway construction and vehicular transport of weeds	  (p. 17, Vegetation Technical Report, Lass and Prather 2007); • put all prairie remnants in the project area	  at risk for	  invasion by new weed species from adjacent	  counties, states and countries connected by the U.S. 95 corridor (Vegetation Technical Report, Lass and Prather 2007). We believe that the ITD deserves credit for all the expertise	  that was assembled to generate	  the	  technical reports and DEIS. However, you consistently fail to heed the advice of	  your	  own experts, and fail to acknowledge	  the	  devastating	  consequences	  that E2 would have on the prairie and Paradise	  Ridge ecosystem. It is even likely that E2	  would affect more prairie than is stated in the DEIS, because the standards used by Juanita Lichthardt (see	  her Vegetation Technical Report) to map the prairie were somewhat strict, requiring remnants to be 1/10th of	  an acre or	  larger	  and to have greater than	  50% of the plant community  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  weed (i.e. exotic species) free. Ms. Lichthardt provides a rationale for these criteria, and	  we respect	  these criteria and those used by the Conservation	  Data Center during the study. Nevertheless, this methodology may have underestimated	  the amount of prairie in	  the project	  area, and it left out any characterization of matrix habitats that prairie remnants are embedded	  in. Matrix habitats can allow for movement and use of this habitat	  by animals and provide varying degrees of habitat connectivity among remnants (Daily 1997, Daily et al. 2001, Looney et al. 2009, Looney and Eigenbrode	  2011, 2012, Ricketts et al. 2001). Because E2 would	  cut right through	  these matrix habitats, further fragmenting this important portion	  of the ridge, it is certain	  that the effects of E2 on prairie, rare plant species and	  plant communities, wildlife and invertebrates have been underestimated. Mitigation We feel strongly that any compensatory mitigation that	  is to occur	  must	  be open for	  discussion and clearly	  articulated prior to the close of the FEIS. Here are a few important points that you must consider concerning prairie restoration. Restoration	  efforts thus far have been	  able to	  recreate only	  rough approximations	  of the original Palouse	  Prairie (professional opinion, PPF Board	  of Directors). •	  To do more will take a	  tremendous amount of time, energy,	  dedication,	  and 	  resources. •	  Some of the parts (especially soil organisms) may  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  be missing and	  we may never know what they were. • This makes the existing	  remnants very	  valuable, as it 	  is 	  far 	  easier 	  and 	  less 	  expensive 	  to 	  preserve 	  them than to restore them. • Damaged prairie cannot simply be repaired by seeding “native grasses.” • The vegetation mitigation suggested in the DEIS	  is totally inadequate and inappropriate. • The only way to protect the ecosystem is to avoid it 	  during 	  siting, 	  construction, 	  and 	  operation 	  of 	  the highway. • In a	  letter to ITD, IDFG recommended avoidance of the eastern	  alignment (E2). “It has been	  IDFG’s position	  from the start – a	  position	  supported	  by recommendations from the other	  resource agencies – that	  the eastern alternative will have the greatest direct and	  indirect impacts to	  wildlife and	  other resources.

SPECIFIC COMMENTS	  ON THE	  DEIS The Palouse Prairie Foundation cannot support alternative	  E2	  because	  it would pass far too close	  to Paradise	  Ridge and thus jeopardize	  the	  structure	  and biological integrity of Palouse	  Prairie	  found in the project	  area. Section ES.8, Topics of Concern or Controversy, page 16: “IDFG,	  EPA,	  and 	  USFWS 	  prefer 	  the 	  C-‐3	  Alternative to the E-‐2	  Alternative. This is 	  primarily due to	  the perceived	  effects of the E-‐2	  Alternative on	  wildlife habitat and	  movement based	  on	  its proximity to	  Paradise Ridge.” This statement is inaccurate as the USFWS	  has stated that their concerns	  over E2 include impacts to Palouse Prairie habitat, wildlife and	  sensitive plants. The Palouse Prairie Foundation	  is in	  complete agreement with the USFWS on this	  point, so please revise appropriately. Moreover, we object to the wording of	  this Section,	  especially 	  the 	  use 	  of the phrase “perceived effects…” We believe that	  the biologists contracted to do the technical reports for	  the DEIS, as well as the work of	  ITD biologists and the	  opinions of many professionals and residents during past	  and recent	  hearings, provide	  ample	  evidence	  that such effects are	  not just “perceived”	  and instead are	  “likely”	  if not “inevitable.”  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  Lichthardt (2005) shows in the	  Vegetation Technical Report that four rare plant species tracked	  by the Conservation	  Data Center (now the Natural Heritage Program) occur in the project area. Two of these species (Palouse goldenweed and Palouse milkvetch) are ‘globally imperiled’ and two (Palouse thistle and broad-‐fruit	  mariposa lily)	  are ‘vulnerable globally,’ meaning	  that they	  are	  endemic and rare. Lichthardt (2005) provides a map of these	  species’ occurrences, and	  shows that they occur most often	  east of E2 and closer to this route	  than the	  others (Maps 1 -‐5). Moreover, most of these populations fall squarely within the 1 km weed infestation 	  zone of Lass and	  Prather (2007), and	  thus E2 would	  have the greatest	  impact	  on rare plant	  species. Furthermore, as Lass and Prather (2007) state	  that some weed species	  will disperse more readily in an easterly direction, these	  rare	  plant species will be	  at an even greater risk by every alternative, but especially by E2. Section 2.6, Comparison of Alternatives, E-‐2	  (Preferred Alternative)	  page 55: “The primary disadvantages of E-‐2	  compared	  to	  the other alternatives are that it would	  be located	  closer to	  the base of	  Paradise Ridge .	  .	  . .” Alignment E2 is not “closer to	  the base of Paradise Ridge…”, it is on Paradise Ridge and above the base of it! Because of this, ecological effects from E2 would engulf the whole upper portion	  of the ridge. As shown	  in	  Lass and	  Prather's Vegetation	  Technical Report (2007), the 1 km weed	  infestation	  zone around each alternative	  will extend to the	  top of  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  the ridge if	  E2 is built. This is a terrible disadvantage of E2 as greater densities, and, almost certainly, new species of weeds would	  invade this very important 	  area 	  (Lass 	  and 	  Prather 	  2007), 	  affecting and destabilizing	  the	  ecology of the	  critically endangered Palouse	  Prairie and all the	  rare	  plant species	  found therein (see discussions below concerning ecological consequences of exotic species). Moreover, while Spalding's catchfly (Silene	  spaldingii) has not been	  found	  on	  the ridge, the ridge is "suitable habitat" (Lichthardt	  2005)	  for	  the species	  and the ridge is designated by the USFWS as a	  key conservation area. Therefore, the ecological disadvantage of E2 is the primary disadvantage of this alignment. This ecological disadvantage is large and should not be	  ignored! − Section 3.8.2, Methodology, Vegetation	  Studies, page 95: − The Palouse Prairie Foundation has been a	  proponent of developing fine-‐scale, ground-‐truthed maps of Palouse Prairie. To this end, information was provided to the IDFG and USFWS that was used to develop a map of	  Palouse Prairie in the portion of Latah	  County covering the project area. Were these maps not	  provided to you by the USFWS, and why were they not included or, at least mentioned, in 	  the 	  DEIS? − Section 3.8.3, Existing Conditions, Invasive	  Plants,  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  page 100:	  Latah 	  County 	  has 	  about 	  260 	  listed 	  nonnative, invasive plant species that affect agricultural, rangeland, pastures, and	  forests. Sixtyfour	  noxious weeds are listed in Latah County. Of	  those, five species of	  noxious weeds were found in the project	  area (Lass and Prather 2007)." − More details from the Vegetation Technical Report of Lass and	  Prather (2007) need	  to	  be noted	  here. For example, they state	  that the	  counties adjacent to Latah have an additional 32 weed species not	  found in the county, and that	  Latah County and adjacent counties have	  27	  highly invasive	  species in common. Also, please note that Latah county	  and adjacent counties with Highway 95	  passing	  through them (Benewah and Nez Perce)	  have 26 highly invasive 	  species 	  in 	  common, 	  and 	  that 	  these 	  and	  those not	  found in common will provide a source pool for the project area. − Section 3.8.3, Existing Conditions, General Wildlife	  Species, page	  101: Table	  25.

The Wildlife Technical Report entitled “General Wildlife Assessment Thorncreek Road to Moscow” states, “Palouse earthworm, Drioleirus [sic]	  amercanus [sic]: The Palouse earthworm is endemic to the Palouse bioregion. The species was first	  reported in 1897, and was described as being common in the area around Pullman, Washington; however, reported occurrences are	  very rare	  and there have been no recent	  confirmed occurrences reported in Idaho. Palouse earthworms inhabit	  relatively loose, rich soils in undisturbed bunchgrass prairie. Threats include loss of native Palouse habitat to	  agriculture, development and other disturbances, as well as introduction	  of European	  earthworm species (IDFG 2006, p.8).” “Determination of Effect and Rationale: No Effect − • There have been no reported occurrences of Palouse	  earthworm in the	  project area. • No remnant Palouse plant communities (suitable habitat) will be effected	  [sic] by the project . (IDFG 2006, p.8)” − The wildlife assessment (IDFG 2006) states that no suitable habitat for Driloleirus	  americanus, the giant  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  Palouse	  earthworm, will be	  affected. This	  information 	  is 	  incorrect 	  and 	  must 	  be 	  corrected 	  and updated. Some of the most recent discoveries of this worm have been from locations on Paradise Ridge and its habitat seems not to be	  exclusively undisturbed	  prairie but also	  transitional zones. − In 	  two 	  separate 	  findings,	  confirmed 	  giant 	  Palouse earthworms were	  found on Paradise	  Ridge in 	  2012.	  Moreover, in 2010, two worms (one adult, one juvenile) 	  were 	  found 	  in 	  the 	  large 	  ridge-‐top prairie on	  Paradise Ridge by UI	  scientists. 	  In 	  2005,	  a Palouse	  earthworm was found at Smoot Hill Ecological Preserve in Whitman County in a	  Palouse Prairie remnant. In 1986 or	  1987, about	  five Palouse earthworms were	  found near Moscow. Circa	  1978 one Palouse earthworm was found near	  Moscow. Also	  circa 1978, one Palouse earthworm was found	  at the	  top of the	  Lewiston Grade	  along	  U.S. Highway 95. − Section 4.2	  Land Use	  and Recreation Effects, E-‐2	  (Preferred Alternative), page 143: “E-‐2	  would	  affect the same types of	  land 	  use 	  categories 	  as 	  the 	  other alternatives; but would	  affect more CRP land	  than	  other alternatives.” − Table 42	  (p.145) shows that E2	  would affect much more CRP land than would C3 or W4 (43.5 ac, 9 ac and 9	  ac, respectively). While	  CRP	  fields are	  not always planted to native	  vegetation, they are	  always planted to perennial habitat (Fargione	  et al.  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  2009). Such habitat helps to make up the landscape (i.e. the matrix)	  in which native habitats such as Palouse	  Prairie are	  embedded. This is 	  important, because matrix habitats can	  provide refuge, food	  and movement corridors for remnant-‐inhabiting animals (Daily 1997, Daily et al. 2001, Ricketts et al. 2001). Multiple studies show that CRP	  benefits wildlife (Herkert 2007, Fargione et al. 2009, Stanley 2010, Grovenburg et al. 2012). Directly adjacent to the project	  area, Hatten et	  al. (2006)	  found that	  ground-‐dwelling beetle species preferentially used	  reduced-‐tillage agricultural fields as compared to conventional-‐tillage fields outside of	  the	  prairie, very	  likely	  due to the more stable and enriched environment that such fields provide. Moreover, Hatten et al. (2013) found a relationship between	  numbers of bumble bee species in	  Palouse Prairie and complexity of the	  landscape surrounding prairie, consistent with	  the findings of authors in	  other regions (Steffan-‐Dewenter et al. 2002, Hines and Hendrix 2005, Hendrix et al. 2010). These	  authors found Palouse	  Prairie	  to harbor 10	  bumble	  bee species – a	  sizable	  number considering 	  that only 50 species are found	  in	  the entire United	  States (Hatten et al. 2013) – and found more	  of these species in prairie remnants of	  Latah County that	  adjoin forest, other	  remnants and/or	  CRP grasslands than were	  in remnants of Whitman County that are	  bordered more	  consistently by agricultural fields. The	  large	  ridge-‐top remnant	  on Paradise	  Ridge was one of the Latah County remnants sampled by Hatten et	  al. (2013). This  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  study suggests	  that habitat complexity on the granitic outcrops may increase effective patch size of the prairie by providing additional habitat and	  connectivity	  for the bees. In addition, Looney	  et al. (unpublished)	  found up to 100 species of	  bees in Palouse	  Prairie, and found robust populations using CRP fields. Pollinators	  are increasingly at risk due to habitat loss, deterioration	  and	  exotic pathogens (Cameron et	  al. 2011), and thus perennial and relatively undisturbed habitats such as Palouse Prairie	  and some	  matrix habitats are	  increasingly important 	  for 	  their survival. It is reasonable	  to expect, then, that greater losses in CRP	  caused by E2	  would affect bee populations as well as wildlife and other animals in the	  project area, especially when one considers that E2 would come closer to prairie than	  would	  C3 and W4	  and reduce	  and further	  compromise the quality of	  matrix habitats of the upper ridge where the best prairie and	  largest 	  populations 	  of 	  rare 	  plant 	  species 	  are 	  found. Despite the importance of matrix habitats to the persistence of flora and	  fauna of remnant	  native habitats, it is important to	  point out that CRP grasslands are	  not without their problems and they	  are	  not a	  surrogate	  for native	  habitat. For example, while CRP provides benefits for wildlife (see previous paragraph), the composition	  and	  structure of vegetation	  in	  CRP is often	  dissimilar from that of native grassland/prairie systems (Baer et al. 2004), and does not provide equivalent habitats for some animals	  such as	  grassland birds	  (Bakker and  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  Higgins 2009). Moreover, Lichthardt (2005, p.10) found that the invasive, rhizomatous exotic species tall oatgrass was frequently abundant in	  the borders of remnant	  prairie adjacent	  to CRP fields in the project	  area. So, while	  CRP	  provides important perennial habitat, it requires management, and	  it is not a replacement	  for	  native prairie. Consider, also, that	  it 	  is 	  very 	  difficult 	  to 	  restore 	  prairie 	  habitats 	  (Baer 	  et al. 2004); native	  grasses may be	  restored relatively quickly, but to	  establish	  less common	  forb	  species critical to biodiversity	  is	  very	  difficult 	  (Clarke 	  and Bragg 1994, Kindscher and	  Tieszen	  1998). Thus, it is best to	  avoid	  disturbing the prairie. − Section 4.12, Noise	  Effects, page	  182. − Where is the discussion regarding noise impacts 	  on wildlife? Multiple studies show	  that noise is disruptive to	  wildlife. Forman	  (2000) found	  road	  noise to	  have a major effect on	  forest nesting birds due to	  its interference with	  bird	  communication	  during incubation	  and	  fledgling phases of reproduction. − Section 6.1, Indirect effects by resource,	  Vegetation, page 207: “Thirty-‐two areas were identified 	  as 	  Palouse 	  remnants 	  during 	  the 	  2005 inventory 	  (Lichthardt 	  2006).	  The 	  primary 	  threat 	  to the persistence of	  Palouse remnants in their	  present	  state is	  colonization by weeds; expansion of those present as well as invasion	  by new arrivals.”  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  − This is an accurate statement. However, the potential consequences of weed	  colonization	  to	  the ecological integrity of the	  32 prairie	  remnants in the	  project area needs to	  be discussed, and	  it needs to	  be discussed	  throughout the document including in	  the Cumulative Effects section (6.2.3). There is	  plenty of evidence showing that exotic species (i.e. weeds) can pose very serious challenges for the conservation of remnant prairie and grassland	  habitats (Scheiman	  et al. 2003). Weeds diminish	  habitat quality and	  adversely affect biodiversity (Parker	  et	  al. 1993). They do so by altering the composition and structure of native communities. With niches to exploit, they compete for available nutrients, light, water and	  space (Trammell and	  Butler 1995, Svedvarsk and	  Van	  Amburg 1996, Scheiman et al. 2003). Such effects are	  not restricted to the plant	  community, but	  instead have bottom-‐up	  effects on	  the food	  web	  which	  influences 	  all	  organisms 	  in 	  the 	  affected habitat. Weeds, for example, alter trophic relationships, outcompeting or dominating forage species needed	  for	  the survival of	  native ungulates (Trammell and Butler 1995), or altering community composition	  critical for survival of grassland bird species	  (Scheiman et	  al. 2003). These are but	  a few examples of the	  serious effects of weeds on communities; many	  more are to be found in the scientific	  literature. It follows	  that weed infestations	  that	  would result	  from the proposed realignments, and especially if E2	  is constructed (see	  your  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  commissioned report by	  Lass	  and Prather 2007), could be expected to have very	  serious	  and longlasting 	  ecological	  consequences 	  for 	  the 	  ecology within the project area. − The last sentence in this same paragraph, “All remnants identified	  in	  the project area	  are bordered	  completely or partially by weedy vegetation”	  further deflects from the needed	  discussion	  by implying that	  weed colonization is not	  an issue, presumably because remnants are already bordered	  by weeds or are weedy. Clearly, weed infestation is an issue	  in the project	  area (Lass and Prather	  2007), not	  unlike the situation for	  native grassland habitats everywhere	  (see	  any of the	  preceding	  literature	  references). Nevertheless, “the game” is not	  up with remnant prairie 	  in 	  the 	  project 	  area 	  just because weeds have gained	  a foot-‐hold	  here. − Much of this prairie remains in fair to excellent condition as	  measured by	  “cover and extent of nonnative species” within	  the remnants (Lichthardt 2005, p. 4). Lichthardt (2005, p. 6), for example, classified 14 of the 32 remnants	  as	  grassland communities, and of these, ranked seven with a top condition score of ‘A,’ five with ‘B,’ and two with ‘C.’ In 	  order 	  to 	  be 	  scored 	  an 	  ‘A,’	  observed 	  weed 	  patches needed	  to	  be minor (in	  extent and	  abundance) with	  80-‐90% of the grassland community relatively weed-‐free and biologically intact. A score of	  ‘B’ indicated 	  weeds 	  had 	  ”made 	  inroads” 	  throughout the remnant, and remnants scored with a ‘C’ had  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  extensive	  annual weed coverage. Lichthardt also mapped weed infestations in the	  other remnant habitat types in	  the project area, and	  found	  that composition of weed infestation varied by	  remnant (Lichthardt	  2005, Maps 7 & 8). A list	  of	  these remnants, along with detailed information on plant	  species, plant	  communities and dominant	  exotic species	  found therein, is	  provided in Appendix 3 (Lichthardt	  2005). We ask you to re-‐examine	  your commissioned Vegetation reports, and you will see that	  great	  habitat	  is found in the project	  area and much of it remains in good condition. − It 	  is 	  clear 	  that 	  road 	  construction 	  and 	  operation 	  in close proximity	  to or on the ridge, such as	  that posed	  by E2, would	  expose remnant habitats including 	  the 	  relatively 	  weed-‐free ‘A’ condition grasslands to resident and new weed species. Local landowners, 	  the 	  Palouse 	  Prairie Foundation and other local, state and	  federal organizations are working to	  keep	  weeds out of these remnants and E2 would exacerbate this problem. Lichthardt (2005) warns of this threat, stating that	  noxious weeds known to occur	  in and around the	  Moscow area	  – including 	  yellow-‐star thistle, spotted knapweed, teasel, and Dalmatian toadflax – could invade Palouse remnants	  in the project area. Lass and	  Prather (2007) also	  provide ample	  evidence	  for this scenario, showing a high	  number of weed	  species that could	  invade the area. We urge you to reexamine the evidence provided by your commissioned	  biologists regarding these  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  dangers, and	  especially the dangers that the high	  elevation E2 alignment would face if constructed. − IN 	  CLOSING − The U.S. Department of Transportation Act of 1966	  states, “It is	  the policy of the U.S. Government that special effort should be made to preserve the natural beauty of the countryside...” ... “The Secretary may approve	  a	  transportation	  program or project... only if: There is no	  prudent and	  feasible alternative	  to using	  that land...” (DEIS	  5.1	  Regulatory Framework and	  Policies, Section	  4(f)). We direct your attention to the numerous letters from resources agencies (including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Idaho Department of Fish and Game) that also are	  asking	  the	  ITD to choose	  a	  different alternative than	  E2 because of how hard	  this route would be on the Paradise Ridge ecosystem. The	  DEIS	  provides prudent and feasible	  alternatives to E2. ITD should proceed with one	  of them and stop pursuing alternative E2. − We have shown throughout this letter that alignment E2	  is environmentally and ecologically the worst alternative and	  we call upon	  ITD to	  recognize this and remove alternative E2 from consideration as	  the “preferred alternative.” Doing so will help to preserve Paradise Ridge and the	  prairie for the enjoyment of residents, travelers on Highway 95, and the rare plants and animals that  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  reside there.

I	  have 	  been 	  contacted 	  by 	  constituents 	  who 	  have concerns	  about the Publication, "Guide to the Draft Environmental Impact 	  Statement," 	  and 	  other information 	  in 	  the 	  DEIS.	  They 	  have 	  asked 	  me 	  for more specific details regarding some of the areas discussed, and	  I would	  appreciate having you	  supply the information. Reason	  C-‐3	  was not identified: 1. It would displace eight businesses – what businesses would	  be displaced? What businesses would be adversely affected, and how? 2. It would have the greatest affect on residences what residences would be affected by C-‐3	  and E-‐2?	  Would E-‐2	  displace all residents of	  the mobile home park near Eid	  Road? 3. It would have the highest crash rate of any of the alternatives -‐how significant is the statistical difference, and	  are potential accidents related	  to	  wildlife given consideration? Do you have information 	  that Idaho 	  Fish 	  and 	  Game 	  predicts 	  that the road through deer,	  elk,	  and 	  moose habitat will likely 	  cause 	  "a 	  number 	  of 	  big 	  game/vehicle collisions	  in the future?" E-‐2	  is the safest alternative -‐did	  your studies of  Displacement-‐2	  regarding differences between what was stated in the DEIS sections and the DEIS hearing by ITD 	  staff 	  regarding 	  residential	  and 	  business 	  impacts. Additional detail regarding impacts and	  potential impacts 	  to 	  residences 	  and 	  businesses has been	  prepared, however; due to	  the conceptual level of detail that is currently available the exact displacements are unknown. The Safety Analysis has been revised since the DEIS	  was published	  but the findings remained	  valid. See General Response Safety-‐3. See	  General Response	  Safety-‐6	  regarding the significance of the differences	  between alternatives. The DEIS	  does state that there would be shorter commute times	  but does	  not claim this	  to be a significant difference.

E-‐2	  would have the shortest travel time -‐can you discuss the significance of the difference? 5. The report mentions that E-‐2	  affects wildlife habitat, and	  affects more farmland and wetlands. It seems	  significant that C-‐3	  would require the least amount of right-‐of¬ way. How much	  did	  these factors weigh in your	  decision? 6. Your report indicates that 8	  businesses would be displaced	  by C-‐3. What are those businesses and how are they affected? I	  note 	  the 	  following 	  statement 	  in 	  the 	  DEIS:	  "C-‐3	  is believed	  by business owners to	  have the least indirect 	  effects because the access would	  be similar, although it would be	  changed to a	  limited access facility. Traffic would continue to pass by the existing	  business which would encourage	  businesses to stay or	  locate in the area. W-‐4	  and E-‐2	  would have greater effects to visibility and access to existing	  businesses; however they could also potentially encourage growth	  in	  the area. While safety and direct routes to and from Moscow and Lewiston are	  also believed to be	  an important consideration for area businesses	  and goods	  movement, the travel times and safety between Action	  Alternatives does not differ substantially." There were other concerns, but I would appreciate your response to those I have detailed. I find them bothersome, along with	  information	  I have that IDFG,	  EPA,	  and USFWS prefer the C-‐3	  alternative to the E-‐2	  alternative.  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  We have waited a long time for improvements on this stretch of	  highway.

Skinner. March 19, 2013 − Idaho 	  Transportation 	  Department:	  I	  have 	  worked 	  with 	  Palouse 	  Prairie professionally since 1996. During that time I have learned much about the	  ecosystem. From that experience, and from the scientific background that	  i have from both	  education	  and	  long-‐time experience in the sciences, I have the following concerns	  about the Draft EIS for US 95 and in particular proposed route E2. E2	  is environmentally untenable. There are other alternatives available	  which are	  just as feasible	  and which are superior in many other aspects. Alternative E2 has so	  many obvious faults and	  flaws it 	  is 	  difficult 	  to 	  imagine 	  what 	  ITD 	  engineers 	  were even thinking	  about when they decided E2 was their	  “preferred	  alternative”. Many of the reasons for this untenability below come either from personal experience or from the body of scientific literature related	  to	  grassland	   FHWA and ITD must balance	  both the	  human and natural environmental impacts with	  the safety benefit for	  the general public. General Response Alternative describes why FHWA	  and	  ITD identified	  the E-‐2	  Alternative as the Preferred	  Alternative. As stated	  in	  the FEIS Section	  4.8, the E-‐2	  Alternative would avoid directly affecting rare plant populations that	  the E-‐2	  Alternative and would avoid direct effects to Palouse remnants on Paradise Ridge.	  However, it would be closer and could result in indirect effects.	  As stated in the DEIS, there are many other potential sources	  of weed dispersal including residential, commercial development and CRP land. Additional information 	  regarding 	  the 	  ongoing 	  efforts 	  for 	  weed control and prairie restoration has	  been added to the FEIS	  Section 3.8	  and 4.8	  and Chapters 6	  and 9. Additional weeds that could 	  be 	  introduced 	  from outside of Latah	  County have been	  added	  to	  the FEIS Section 3.8. There	  are	  several mitigation measures, including 	  monitoring 	  and 	  a 	  vegetation 	  management plan	  that are proposed	  which	  would	  minimize the potential for indirect effects including weed	  dispersal.

I have not provided references	  here as	  i doubt ITD staff have or will take the time to read the literature. However, i can supply the references if 	  you 	  so 	  desire. E2	  comes very close to Palouse Prairie remnants on Paradise	  Ridge. This is both a	  direct and indirect threat to said remnants and I therefore believe it	  should not	  be the “preferred	  alternative” just 	  for 	  that 	  reason alone. Palouse	  Prairie once covered	  much	  of eastern	  Whitman County and western Latah County but today is rare. Because the	  environmental conditions that formed the Palouse Prairie are	  the	  same	  ones that made	  it some of the most productive agricultural land in the world, over 99%	  of the prairie has been converted to agriculture and other	  uses and Palouse Prairie is	  one of the rarest ecosystems in	  the world. The exact amount of remnant Palouse Prairie is 	  not presently known, but it is less than	  1% of its original extent. On that basis alone the few small and widely scattered remnants that remain	  should	  be protected	  from further harm. They provide habitat for	  many species including beneficial soil microbes, pollinators and	  other beneficial insects, birds and	  small mammals, and large game animals. Most of the remaining Palouse Prairie is 	  in 	  small, isolated 	  fragments.	  Fragmentation 	  results 	  in 	  lower animal movement, lower gene	  flow, less movement  General Response Agency discusses the agencies’ differences in	  opinion	  regarding FHWA’s and	  ITD’s Preferred Alternative. The value of remnants was based upon the extent of non-‐native invasive species and	  also	  considered	  size. See	  the	  Vegetation Technical Report under the	  description	  of Methodology. See	  General Response	  Weather-‐2	  regarding the 5month data set	  and how it	  relates to the larger	  30+year data set.

It 	  is 	  important 	  to 	  maintain 	  as 	  much 	  connectivity as possible between	  the fragmented	  remnants of Palouse	  Prairie. Fragmentation can lead to extinction locally or over an entire	  species range	  when the	  fragments are	  no longer 	  large 	  enough 	  to 	  provide 	  ecological	  support for	  that species. Highways fragment landscapes and habitat. While not a totally impervious barrier, roadways certainly	  restrict or adversely	  change connectivity	  and increase	  the	  effects of fragmentation resulting	  in 	  more 	  isolation 	  of 	  species, 	  more 	  inbreeding depression, and greater extinction pressure. E2	  would have the most detrimental fragmentation effects of the	  suggested alignments because	  it is closest to more and higher quality	  Palouse Prairie than C3 or	  W4. The few, scattered remnants remaining today are preserved	  primarily because they lack value as agricultural land, usually being	  too steep or rocky. The biggest threat to these remnants is not farming, but destruction	  and	  weed	  invasion	  caused	  by construction projects!

Additional information	  on	  giant Palouse earthworm occurrences, bees, Palouse remnants, fragmentation, noise impacts 	  on 	  birds, 	  and 	  other 	  information requested by agencies and	  the public regarding vegetation, fish and wildlife have been added to the FEIS	  Sections 3.8, 4.8, and Chapter 6, Indirect and Cumulative Effects.	  See General	  Responses for IDFG regarding the pygmy nuthatch.	  The gray wolf has been delisted by the USFWS	  in the state of Idaho and therefore is	  not discussed in Sections 3.9	  and 4.9	  Threatened and Endangered Species and is not listed in the	  Biological Assessment. Mitigation measures and standard specifications that	  are	  typically applied on ITD projects that could minimize harm	  to resources are detailed in the FEIS Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments. ITD has committed to a Weed Inventory	  and Control Plan and a Vegetation Management Plan that will include 	  funding for	  monitoring, establishing native perennial vegetation and the biological, chemical and/or physical control of weeds. ITD will comply	  with the Construction General Permit (CGP) which requires that areas disturbed	  will have 70%	  vegetation cover (not including invasive 	  species) 	  post 	  construction.	  ITD 	  will	  use 	  highly visible fencing	  during	  construction to keep contractors out of sensitive areas such	  as wetlands. ITD will implement 	  BMPs to minimize construction impacts. ITD will investigate engineering solutions during final design	  to	  further avoid	  or minimize impacts to	  natural resources where feasible. As noted, there have been disagreements between	  ITD and	  IDFG, primarily  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW)	  considers Palouse Prairie to be among the most endangered ecosystems in the US and	  endorses its preservation. The Environmental Protection Agency (Region 10), The Nature Conservancy, the Palouse Land Trust, and the	  Palouse	  Prairie Foundation all support preservation	  of the small amount of Palouse Prairie that	  remains. The Idaho Department of Fish and Game (IDFG), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the US	  Fish and Wildlife	  Service	  (USFWS) prefer avoidance	  of the E-‐2	  Alternative. They have determined this thru a thorough examination of	  the science involved.	  Yet, 	  ITD 	  insists 	  on 	  playing 	  semantic 	  tricks to belittle and dismiss the scientific opinions of	  other agencies by saying “this is primarily due to	  the perceived	  effects of the E-‐2	  alternative on	  wildlife habitat”	  (emphasis mine) (DEIS pg	  16). This demonstrates ITDs lack of willingness to	  listen	  to	  any opinion or fact that deviates from their own predetermined	  conclusions. The Palouse Prairie Foundation, also after a	  thorough scientific examination, recommends avoidance	  of alternative	  E2	  for many of the	  same	  reasons as IDFW, EPA and USFWS. E2	  would affect more than twice as many prairie remnants in the project	  area than C3 or	  W4. There are	  24	  remnants near E2	  vs. 14	  for C3	  and 12	  for W4. (DEIS p. 207, Table 62). E2	  passes much closer to some of the remnants	  than does either	  W4 or	  C3.  because the affected	  habitat is primarily farmland,	  which serves as marginal habitat for ungulates. The affected land is entirely privately owned parcels with no	  federally protected	  species therefore ITD maintained that while measures to minimize harm	  are proposed	  by ITD, no	  additional compensatory mitigation was warranted. Since the publication of the DEIS, ITD	  has met with IDFG	  and come to an agreement on	  mitigation	  measures for impacted	  wildlife and	  habitat which	  is described	  in	  Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments. ITD is committed 	  to 	  continue 	  to collaborate with IDFG and other resource agencies	  before final design	  and	  project implementation	  to	  further	  refine the mitigation measures described in Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments. Mitigation	  for	  weed dispersal and establishment will involve	  minimizing soil disturbance, revegetating bare soils to reduce risk of	  establishment, and species selection that	  will consider quick and sustainable groundcover. Additional mitigation	  measures are described	  in	  the FEIS	  Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments. ITD and IDFG 	  have 	  met 	  about 	  a 	  potential	  mitigation 	  for 	  effects to fish and wildlife and their	  habitat	  and agreed upon the mitigation measures described in Chapter	  9, Environmental Commitments. Temporary construction impacts including due to staging, stockpiling, and indirect effects are	  described in 	  the 	  respective 	  sections 	  of 	  the 	  DEIS 	  and 	  FEIS 	  Chapter 4. It is also discussed in Chapter 6, Indirect and Cumulative Effects.	  Measures to minimize harm to	  resources including weed control and impacts to staging and stockpile sites	  are described in Chapter 9,  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  The remnants on Paradise Ridge are	  larger and of higher quality than	  those elsewhere in	  the project area	  (DEIS	  Vegetation Report by Lichthardt 2005). Because of the above, E2 would 	  have 	  a 	  much greater detrimental effect on the	  endangered Palouse	  Prairie ecosystem than C3 or W4. Because the largest and	  highest quality remnants are	  on Paradise	  Ridge,	  E2 	  would 	  put 	  at 	  risk 	  a 	  higher proportion of	  globally imperiled plant	  species such as Palouse	  milkvetch (Astragalus arrectus)	  broad fruit	  mariposa (Calochortus nitidus), and Palouse goldenweed (Pyrrocoma liatriformis). Presence	  or absence	  of rare	  plants should not be	  the sole determining factor in	  whether a prairie remnant	  is valuable. Because of	  the rarity of	  the ecosystem, all of the	  remnants are	  valuable, whether or not they contain rare plants, and whether or not they contain invasive weeds. Restoration	  efforts thus far have been	  able to	  recreate only	  rough approximations	  of the original Palouse	  Prairie. To do more will take a	  tremendous amount of time, energy,	  dedication,	  and 	  resources. Some	  of the	  parts (especially soil organisms) may be	  missing and we may never know	  what they were. This makes the existing remnants very valuable, as it 	  is 	  far 	  easier 	  and 	  less 	  expensive 	  to 	  preserve 	  them than to restore them. Damaged prairie cannot simply be repaired by seeding “native grasses”. The vegetation mitigation	  suggested	  in	  the DEIS is totally inadequate and inappropriate. The only way  Environmental Commitments. The Weather Analysis states that the climate is already established for the	  area	  based on historical data	  from	  published	  literature and	  data from the PSF. Additional data from the weather stations was collected	  and	  incorporated 	  into 	  the 	  Revised 	  Weather 	  Analysis 	  (Qualls 2014). General Response Safety-‐3	  provides information regarding the updated Safety Analysis, which	  considers the remaining sections of	  US-‐95. Access for emergency response vehicles would be safer	  because it	  would use portions of the new US-‐95	  and the traffic volumes on	  the existing US-‐95	  loop would be much lower. ITD 	  and 	  FHWA are not required to select the alternative	  with the	  least amount of right-‐of-‐way.	  See	  the	  FEIS	  3.2	  and 4.2	  regarding the	  alternatives’ consistency	  with the Comprehensive Plans and the	  Ring	  Road	  project. While all the action alternatives would have greatly improved 	  safety,	  the 	  straighter 	  alternatives 	  would 	  have better sight distance which	  would	  reduce animal collisions	  and increase overall safety.  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  to protect	  the ecosystem is to avoid it	  during siting, construction, and operation of the highway. Avoidance of impact is the only realistic mitigation	  available	  for Palouse	  Prairie. The first and preferred mitigation is avoidance of disturbance of any Palouse Prairie. ITD 	  does 	  not 	  have 	  the 	  expertise,	  the 	  funds,	  or 	  the desire to	  do	  compensatory mitigation	  for any Palouse	  Prairie impacted 	  by 	  highway 	  construction. ITD 	  has 	  consistently 	  rejected,	  rebuffed,	  and/or stonewalled any suggestions	  from IDFG regarding mitigation for any of the environmental impacts of highway construction. ITD has shown	  a reluctance to work with anyone or	  any group who might	  have an opinion differing	  from ITD. In 	  a 	  letter 	  to 	  ITD,	  IDFG 	  recommended 	  avoidance 	  of the eastern alignment. (E2)	  “It 	  has 	  been 	  IDFG’s position	  from the start – a	  position	  supported	  by recommendations from the other	  resource agencies – that	  the eastern alternative will have the greatest direct and	  indirect impacts to	  wildlife and	  other resources.”	  Again, avoidance	  of impact is the	  primary mitigation	  tool available. In 	  a 	  letter 	  to 	  the 	  Federal	  Highway 	  Administration 	  on March 8, 2004, the EPA notes	  that avoidance and minimization are the first and second priorities in mitigating impacts. Compensatory mitigation is only appropriate	  when impacts cannot be	  avoided or minimized. “We anticipate that avoidance of sensitive, rare, and/or high	  value terrestrial and	  aquatic habitats will be the most significant environmental need for this proposed project.”  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  (letter	  in the appendices of	  the DEIS). Avoidance and minimization are	  only achieved by not building	  alternative	  E2! Furthermore,	  in 	  the 	  DEIS 	  under 	  “Topics 	  of 	  Concern and Controversy” it states, “there has been disagreement between	  IDFG and	  ITD regarding	  appropriate mitigation.”	  One	  recent mitigation proposal by IDFG suggests ITD could	  set aside compensatory	  mitigation funds	  of $750,000	  for E2	  and $325,000	  for C3. Even this grossly underestimates the cost of restoration	  for damaged	  Palouse	  Prairie. The differing numbers suggested by IDFG, however, demonstrate how much	  more valuable the habitat is 	  in 	  the 	  vicinity 	  of 	  E2.	  Of 	  course, 	  ITD 	  has 	  resisted any suggestions regarding	  mitigation. There is little mention of vegetative mitigation in the DEIS except	  that	  mentioned by other	  agencies and groups and an ambiguous statement regarding	  weed control on pg 231. ITD has	  failed to consider mitigation and has developed no plans for doing any mitigation despite	  having	  it brought to their attention. One	  must conclude	  either that ITD has no intention 	  to 	  mitigate 	  for 	  environmental	  damage 	  or that	  they desire to keep any mitigation plans out	  of	  the public view until all possibility of	  public comment has	  expired. There is no mention of species to be used. There are no details as to seeding rates, timing, establishment, follow-‐up	  for unsuccessful seedings, soil preparation, or tactics for	  maintaining the stand once it is established.  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  Native species often do poorly in competition with weedy species on the exposed subsoils of road cuts and fills. The species which do best on roadcuts and fills are often	  non-‐native and	  invasive. There is 	  no 	  mention 	  in 	  the 	  DEIS 	  of 	  any 	  actual	  weed control away	  from the right-‐of-‐way (ROW), only that	  ITD will seed the ROW to some unnamed species	  which will magically prevent weeds	  from spreading out of the ROW. They only suggest they will	  consult 	  with 	  “local	  weed experts”. There	  is no mention of who they might be	  or if anyone else with	  valuable input will be consulted. Pesticide	  applicators should be	  trained to recognize	  the species they might	  encounter. At	  present	  the knowledge level of	  ITD applicators in this regard is woefully inadequate. Vegetation mitigation should be subject to public review and should be planned and detailed out	  in the FEIS. There is no discussion of impacts outside the ROW from such activities as equipment	  parking, equipment maintenance, and materials stockpiles despite the fact that these activities can	  have serious	  impacts	  on nearby habitat. These can be major sources of new weeds. Because these activities can	  be the result of agreements between contractors and local	  landowners, 	  they 	  can 	  also 	  have 	  major 	  impacts which may be outside the direct control of ITD, including 	  the 	  destruction 	  of 	  important 	  habitat 	  and  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  contamination of valuable farmland. There is no mention of how ITD plans to control unauthorized	  access to	  lands outside the ROW by contractors	  and employees	  within and outside of their	  actual performance of	  duties. Such activity resulted in the destruction of	  rare plants on the earlier construction project on US95 from the	  top of the Lewiston Grade to Thorn Creek. The weather data	  relied upon in the DEIS	  is seriously flawed. On page 1 of the Weather Technical Report it states “ITD 	  desires 	  to 	  characterize 	  the 	  climate 	  of 	  the 	  study area	  with	  respect to	  variables which	  affect driving conditions	  and traffic	  safety.” Climate is determined by extensive weather measurements over an	  extended time	  of many years. The	  study lasted for only five months, not even	  remotely sufficient to	  determine any climatic trends. ITD 	  relies 	  solely 	  on 	  a 	  weather 	  study 	  conducted 	  from January 2005 thru May 2005. This study failed to capture data for half of a winter and then only	  captured data for half of a very	  unusual Palouse winter which was noted for its lack of snow. • The weather study was conducted during one of the mildest, driest year on record for more than 30 years. It is inadequate at best! This means the supposed superior safety of alternative	  E2	  is, in fact, incorrectly calculated and does not account for normal snow, ice and	  fog which can be expected in most winters, especially given the	  increased elevation of alternative	  E2. The Weather Technical Report did not even  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  evaluate	  snow levels because	  there	  was no snow to evaluate	  during	  the	  time	  period of the	  study! Again, how could	  ITD claim to	  have considered	  weather conditions	  in deciding which was	  the safest alternative? ITD 	  itself 	  reports 	  that 	  nearly 	  60% 	  of 	  accidents 	  on 	  US 95	  are weather related, yet they recommend alternative	  E2	  based on faulty information. On pg 5 of the Weather Technical Report it states “measurements are ongoing”. However, this report only includes data from January 1, 2005 through	  May 1, 2005. If the data collection is indeed ongoing, why is it not reported	  in	  the DEIS published	  in	  2013, nearly 8	  years later?	  I must conclude that either the statement in the DEIS is	  incorrect 	  and 	  no 	  further 	  follow-‐up	  weather data was collected, or ITD decided to ignore any further data collected. Either indicates unwillingness on	  the part of ITD to	  really consider all the	  facts before	  making a decision. The weather data	  for this short period of time was collected from only	  3 stations	  (DEIS pg 2) within the study area. Anyone remotely familiar with the Palouse	  knows that the	  topography creates multiple	  microclimates which 3 widely scattered instrument sites	  would never possibly hope to cover. The 3	  stations were not even correlated to specific routes and none of	  the data reflects conditions on the C3 alternative because no instruments were placed	  anywhere near that route except the top	  of Reisenauer Hill,	  a 	  site 	  which 	  is 	  common 	  to 	  all 	  three alternatives.  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  If 	  ITD 	  is 	  really 	  interested 	  in 	  safety,	  as 	  they 	  claim,	  it seems	  they should have taken steps	  a long time ago to ensure that	  accurate data was collected. Over the 8 years between the time ITD commissioned the study and the time they released the DEIS, they could have gathered plenty	  of valuable data. They	  did	  not! This reflects ITD’s intention	  to	  build	  E2 without considering contrary information. They are obviously not interested	  in	  facts! E2	  covers the distance from Thorn Creek to Moscow at the	  highest elevation of the	  3	  possible	  alignment choices. Much of it is	  above 2800 ft., reaching above	  3,000	  ft in places. Those of us who have lived in 	  this 	  area 	  for 	  any 	  length 	  of 	  time 	  know 	  that elevation equals more	  snow, ice, freezing	  temperatures and fog. Higher	  elevations are also subject to higher winds	  and more snow drifting. Many of us need only look out our windows to	  see this on Paradise Ridge!	  Those of	  us who drive US95 know that the worst road conditions are frequently	  encountered on the	  tops of Reisenauer Hill,	  Steakhouse	  Hill, and several other hills to the	  north. The	  weather analysis did not note	  any of this because it was not properly conducted	  over time and did not have	  enough properly located instrument 	  sites! During the winter, school bus drivers and residents of the area report frequent fog on	  the higher parts of	  Eid Road than on lower	  elevations where the current US95 runs. The weather analysis	  did not note this because it was not properly conducted	  over time and	  was not conducted	  during a typical  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  winter. Additionally, the instruments were not properly located	  to	  capture this data. E2	  will be more expensive to maintain. Not only will snow and ice at higher elevations	  make the road less 	  safe 	  to 	  travel, 	  it 	  will	  also 	  increase 	  the 	  costs 	  of maintenance to deal with the snow and ice removal and/or abatement. Weed invasions 	  are 	  known 	  to 	  occur 	  primarily 	  along roads. The impacts from weeds would be much greater along	  alternative	  E2 than along	  any	  of the	  other alternatives. “New roadway alignments, induced development and	  weed	  distribution	  through	  vehicles can	  contribute to the establishment	  and spread of	  weeds and could contribute to the degradation of nearby Palouse remnants. Remnants within	  0.6	  miles of the highway are at greatest risk to weed invasion”	  (emphasis mine) (Lass and Prather Technical Report 2007). The potential weed infestation 	  zone 	  for 	  E2 	  extends 	  to 	  the 	  top 	  of Paradise	  Ridge! It 	  is 	  true 	  that 	  there 	  are 	  already 	  weeds 	  on 	  Paradise Ridge.	  This, however, is not the point.	  Many of the landowners 	  on 	  Paradise 	  Ridge 	  are 	  already working	  hard	  to	  control weeds in	  remnant native vegetation	  and in farmland.	  Considerable amounts of money and time	  have	  already been invested by landowners as well as state	  and federal agencies in the	  control of weeds which	  threaten	  Palouse	  Prairie remnants. E2	  would destroy many of the gains already made and contribute	  to more	  weed invasion. ITD 	  seems 	  to 	  think 	  the 	  mere 	  existence 	  of 	  other  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  threats to the integrity of	  Palouse Prairie remnants justifies 	  introducing 	  a 	  new 	  threat 	  in 	  the 	  form 	  of 	  a new roadway (E2). This argument shows either a blatant disregard	  for or a complete lack of understanding of ecological principles. Existence of other threats does not justify adding new threats! Rather,	  it 	  mandates 	  avoiding 	  the 	  introduction 	  of more threats! This means avoiding the E2 route altogether. Putting a	  major highway up on Paradise	  Ridge opens the area to	  invasion	  by new weeds. These are weeds that are not yet established in Latah County	  or are	  present in only	  isolated populations elsewhere in	  the county. For a list of these weeds, view the Idaho State Department	  of	  Agriculture Noxious Weed	  List at http://www.agri.state.id.us/Categories/PlantsInsect s/NoxiousWeeds/watchlist.php The weeds in the “Statewide EDRR List” and the “Statewide	  Control List”	  are	  among	  the	  ones which threaten Palouse Prairie remnants. US95 runs from the Canadian Border to the Mexican Border thru 5 states. Vehicles can and do easily carry weed seeds and propagules long	  distances, opening new areas to	  weed	  invasion	  from distance sources. Construction	  equipment is also	  a significant vector	  for	  moving weed propagules from one site to another. The	  DEIS	  makes no mention of any ITD requirement	  for	  cleaning and inspecting equipment	  for	  weed propagules before transporting. One can probably deduce that ITD has no	  such	  program.  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  According to	  the DEIS 	  Vegetation 	  Technical	  Report of Lass and	  Prather (2007), counties adjacent to	  Latah County	  have	  32 invasive	  weeds that are	  not found in Latah County. E2 would offer	  an easy corridor to new invasions	  of the Paradise Ridge ecosystem by many of these weeds. Additionally, E2 would offer an easy colonization corridor for other invasive 	  weeds 	  not 	  yet 	  found 	  of 	  Paradise 	  Ridge 	  but present in	  other parts of Latah	  County. Alternative E2 requires a comprehensive and	  ongoing program by ITD to	  monitor and	  control invasive 	  weeds, 	  yet 	  no 	  mention 	  of 	  such 	  program appears in the	  DEIS. ITD 	  does 	  not 	  have 	  the 	  expertise,	  the 	  funds,	  the equipment, or the	  desire	  to mitigate	  for weed impacts 	  0.6 	  miles 	  from 	  the 	  roadway.	  ITD 	  cannot 	  and will not provide sufficient weed	  control monitoring and prevention. Because	  of this, alternative	  E2	  should be avoided! The cost of weed control away from the E2	  right-‐ofway will fall to Latah County and the landowners affected. Active farmland is 	  a 	  very 	  effective 	  barrier 	  to 	  weed encroachment because	  weeds need time	  to establishment and farmers are	  very diligent about weed control in their cropland. Thus C3 or W4 would be much better at preventing weed spread into 	  adjoining 	  lands 	  than 	  E2.	  Parts of E2 would	  pass thru land in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP)	  and near	  remnant	  native vegetation which are	  not as actively managed for weeds. Weeds could quickly	  and easily	  spread from the roadside  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  into 	  adjacent 	  lands 	  in 	  this 	  situation.	  In 	  fact, 	  on pg 206	  of the DEIS, it is stated “intensively 	  managed cropland is	  believed to provide a more efficient buffer to	  new weed	  invasion	  compared	  to	  native vegetation or CRP plantings.” If 	  E2 	  is 	  built,	  there 	  is 	  no 	  access 	  for 	  people 	  living along	  present US	  95. They will still travel the existing	  US	  95 with all its hazards. School buses would still travel the	  old section of US95, including Reisenauer Hill,	  to 	  pick 	  up 	  and return children of	  families living along the old route. Existing US95	  would be turned over to Latah County and the	  county would have	  to maintain the	  roadway for	  access to the homes in that	  area if	  E2 is built. According to	  the DEIS (pg 4) the existing section	  of US95 has a substandard rating for the pavement surface. Both the	  surface	  roughness and the	  amount of cracking	  fall below the	  minimum standard indices	  used to determine acceptable pavement performance. The county will be responsible for	  maintaining and repairing a substandard road if E2 is	  built. While Latah County employees 	  are 	  very 	  capable and work hard at their jobs, the	  fact is that Latah County has many more miles of roads to	  maintain	  with fewer people and lower budgets than ITD. This means county roads do not get plowed out or maintained as well as state highways, making them	  more dangerous to travel, especially in bad weather. One of the most dangerous sections, Reisenauer  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  Hill,	  would 	  still 	  exist 	  as 	  it 	  is 	  today 	  if 	  E2 	  is 	  built. 	  Local traffic would still need to use Reisenauer	  Hill. This hill would be even more dangerous because it would not be maintained as well in inclement weather as it was when it was part of US95. Instead,	  if 	  the 	  C3 	  alignment 	  is 	  built,	  the 	  highway over Reisenauer Hill will be built to current AASHTO standards	  and will be much safer than the existing roadway. If 	  E2 	  is 	  built,	  there 	  would 	  still	  be 	  accidents 	  on 	  the existing	  stretch of US95. Looking	  at the	  overall picture, the accidents on	  existing US95 should	  be attributed to building	  E2. If we	  imagine for	  a second that	  ITD correctly calculated accident	  rates, when this is factored in, it	  is likely the predicted accident	  rates would be very similar. However, in view of	  the fact	  that	  ITD did not	  have enough weather	  data to correctly	  predict accident rates, it is	  quite likely that the total accident	  rate for	  E2 would be higher	  than for	  C3. Emergency equipment would also need to travel this section of	  US95 to respond to emergencies on the property of	  local residents. In 	  a 	  letter 	  to 	  the 	  editor 	  of 	  the 	  Moscow-‐Pullman Daily News, the Moscow Rural Fire District Board of Commissioners supported	  E2 because they thought it 	  would 	  improve 	  safety and response	  time. They are	  mistaken. C3	  would improve	  safety and response time to local residents. E2 would have no	  access to local residents along	  existing	  portions to US95. At best that would leave response times where they are now. During severe weather events,  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  response times would likely be even longer. − There appears to be a	  widespread misconception that	  houses on	  Paradise Ridge cause environmental degradation. While home sites can cause degradation if not properly managed, home sites also	  can	  result in	  great improvements to habitat. Paradise	  Ridge is 	  all	  privately 	  owned.	  The 	  good remnants can span multiple landowners. A	  number of landowners are aware of the uniqueness of the Palouse Prairie on	  their land	  and	  are	  actively working	  on protecting	  and restoring	  parts of it. Since	  the	  home	  sites are	  frequently multiple	  acre	  parcels, this is often	  a good	  way to	  preserve and	  even expand habitat. Indeed,	  having 	  a 	  home 	  site 	  owner 	  with 	  an 	  interest in 	  creating 	  and/or 	  preserving 	  habitat 	  may 	  be preferable from an	  environmental aspect to	  the land 	  remaining	  in the	  hands of a	  farmer where	  it might again be either pastured or plowed out to grow crops. I	  have 	  occasionally 	  consulted 	  with 	  new 	  home 	  site owners in	  local rural areas (although	  not yet on	  Paradise	  Ridge). They are usually interested in locating 	  the 	  home 	  on 	  the 	  worst 	  habitat 	  so 	  that 	  they can preserve the best. There is conflicting information about displacements. The DEIS	  claims C3	  would displace 7	  residences, E2	  would displace 5, and W4 would displace 3 (DEIS pg  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  13). The DEIS	  claims 8	  businesses would be displaced by C3, none by E2 or W4 (DEIS pg 13). The “Screening of Alternatives”	  Technical Report claims	  C3 and W4 would each displace 3 residences, E2	  would displace 5	  (pg 17	  of	  Tech Report). No business displacements are mentioned	  in	  this report. According to	  a recent Letter to	  the Editor in	  the Moscow Pullman Daily News, a local resident was informed 	  by 	  2 	  employees 	  of 	  ITD 	  that 	  no 	  businesses would be displaced	  by C3. Also, according to	  the same letter, during a followup	  conversation	  the same resident was informed	  by one of the same ITD staff members that E2 would	  displace the most homes and	  C3 would	  displace only 1 home. If 	  the 	  DEIS 	  is 	  correct,	  ITD 	  has 	  done a	  very poor job of informing their own	  employees of their plans. If ITD 	  has 	  such 	  poor 	  communications 	  with 	  their 	  own staff, can the public	  expect ITD to give them factual information? 	  Not 	  even 	  the 	  DEIS 	  agrees 	  with 	  itself! If 	  the 	  ITD 	  staff 	  members 	  are 	  correct	  and the DEIS is incorrect, 	  why 	  was 	  the 	  DEIS 	  not 	  updated 	  to 	  reflect the correct	  information. Again, how can the public expect ITD to give	  them factual information? Either way, it appears ITD is not really interested in the truth, but	  only in obfuscation to	  deceive the public and	  that they plan	  to	  build	  E2 without regard	  for	  conflicting evidence. With careful planning and design, ITD should be able	  to avoid any displacements by shifting	  the	   #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  roadway. Engineers often take pride in saying “nothing	  is impossible”. Impacts 	  on 	  wildlife. Idaho 	  Dept. 	  of 	  Fish 	  and 	  Game,	  US 	  Fish 	  and 	  Wildlife Service	  and Region 10	  of the	  Environmental Protection Agency all recommend avoidance	  of E2	  because of its potential impacts on	  wildlife and	  habitat. E2	  is closer to moderate ungulate habitat and	  would increase the likelihood of vehicle-‐ungulate collisions. This	  creates	  a wildlife impact issue and a human	  safety issue 	  as 	  well	  as 	  causing 	  increased property damage. C3 would	  have the least affect on	  wildlife 	  in 	  general. E2	  would pass through higher quality habitat for ungulates including elk,	  moose and deer (DEIS pg 171). E2	  would increase noise and human presence	  in habitat used	  by ungulates (DEIS pg171). E2	  would generate greater traffic noise than C3 or	  W4 (DEIS pg 182, Table 56) and this would negatively affect usage of the area by animals and	  birds. E2	  would reduce connectivity between remnants for	  prairie fauna, including pollinators. Connectivity is 	  also 	  important 	  for 	  gene 	  flow 	  in 	  plants 	  to 	  reduce inbreeding 	  depression. E2	  would affect more wildlife species dependent on the prairie or	  intergraded habitats of	  Paradise Ridge (DEIS pg 163, Table 47). E2	  would affect critical habitat for the giant Palouse earthworm (Driloleirus americanus). The DEIS  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  incorrectly 	  characterizes 	  the 	  Paradise 	  Ridge area	  as unsuitable habitat for D. americanus. In	  fact, most of the recent discoveries of D. americanus have been	  from Paradise Ridge. Even if the highway avoids direct impact to D. americanus habitat, indirect impacts from increased weed invasion are still a threat to D. americanus. E2 has the greatest potential to	  impact habitat and	  therefore the giant	  Palouse earthworm. The Biological Assessment concludes “the project	  will have no effect on the gray wolf.” However, wolves have been reported on Paradise Ridge by at least 	  2 	  reliable 	  sources.	  This 	  suggests 	  the 	  Biological	  Assessment, dated 2007, needs to be	  updated. E2	  impacts 4	  acres of pine stands. These pine stands are	  habitat for northern alligator lizard, pygmy nuthatch and long	  eared myotis. C3	  and W4	  impact no	  pine stands and	  no	  habitat of northern	  alligator lizard, 	  pygmy 	  nuthatch 	  and 	  long 	  eared 	  myotis.	  Many of the pine stands of Latah County have already been lost. Page	  169	  of the	  DEIS	  calls this pine	  stand “potential habitat” for pygmy nuthatch,	  yet 	  the 	  wildlife technical report	  states that	  pygmy nuthatch are already known to inhabit the	  stand. It appears ITD is willing to distort facts in order to support their predetermined	  “preferred	  alternative”	  . Pygmy nuthatch is rare	  in northern Idaho and populations here are considered	  imperiled.	  Any loss of habitat has a cumulative effect on	  already imperiled 	  populations 	  (DEIS 	  Melquist 	  Technical	  Report, pg 13. E2 destroys habitat for the birds. C3  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  and W4	  do not. Melquist (DEIS Technical Report, pg 15) recommends avoidance of	  E2 for	  this very reason! ITD 	  on 	  pg 	  169 	  of 	  the 	  DEIS 	  calls 	  such 	  loss 	  of 	  habitat for	  pygmy nuthatch “minor”, ignoring	  the	  technical data and	  without any supporting evidence for their contrary	  opinion. Again it appears	  ITD is	  willing to distort facts in	  order to support their predetermined	  “preferred	  alternative”! Pygmy nuthatches prefer south slopes of mountains. E2 would impact the populations on Paradise	  Ridge and they cannot simply move	  to other parts of Paradise Ridge, as suggested	  in	  the DEIS (pg 169) because the other parts are not suitable habitat. C3 and W4 do not impact pygmy nuthatch. Even if the pygmy nuthatch habitat is not directly affected, indirect effects from increased traffic noise will have a large impact on the nesting sites. Putting up a	  few “nest boxes” (DEIS	  pg 231) will not mitigate for the impact of E2. The birds will not use the otherwise suitable habitat	  because of	  the increased noise. E2	  would affect more CRP	  land than other alternatives (DEIS	  pg	  143). CRP	  is important habitat for	  grassland nesting birds. Grassland nesting bird populations are under serious decline nationwide. The loss of CRP	  grasslands is nearly 5	  times more for	  E2	  compared to C3	  or W4	  (DEIS	  pg 145). Bat populations are declining globally, nationally, and locally. Habitat loss and habitat degradation are	  considered important factors	  in this	  decline. E2  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  destroys or degrades habitat for bats. C3 and	  W4 do	  not. E2	  will result in increased noise levels 	  near 	  suitable habitat for long eared	  myotis Increased	  noise will likely 	  cause 	  the 	  bats 	  as 	  well	  as 	  pygmy 	  nuthatches 	  to avoid otherwise	  suitable	  habitat. These additional considerations all suggest that E2	  should NOT be the “preferred	  alternative”. C3 would	  have the most access points and	  this would be most convenient for local residents and provide best emergency response times to	  local residents. Access points will have turn lanes and merge lanes so that turning traffic does not	  need to slow down or stop on the roadway and vehicles	  entering	  the	  highway can get up to speed before	  merging. E2	  has much higher noise impacts 	  for 	  those 	  people living 	  in 	  the 	  area. E2	  requires more new right-‐of way acres	  than C3 and only 3	  less acres than W4	  (DEIS	  pg	  53, table	  8). E2	  goes against much of the Natural Resource Element in Latah County’s Comprehensive Plan. E2	  opens Paradise Ridge to new and greater	  fire hazards. The window for fire in 	  agricultural	  land 	  is rather	  short. CRP grasslands, prairie grasslands, and forests have a much wider	  window. Activities along roadways are a common ignition source for	  wildfires. C3 and	  E2 have about equal construction	  costs. C3 and	  E2 have a similar number of residential displacements, if the DEIS numbers are assumed	  to	  be accurate. We have seen	  from above that they  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  may very well not be! C3 is more compatible with	  a proposed	  Moscow ring road than E2 or	  W4. C3 is the most consistent with	  Moscow and	  Latah	  County land	  use goals C3 is only 0.09 miles longer than	  E2. That is less than 500 feet! C3 requires the least amount of new right-‐of-‐way.	  The policy of the Federal Highway Administration is to take the least	  new right-‐of-‐way. E2 does not meet this requirement. C3 has less noise impacts 	  to 	  area 	  residents. C3 would	  have the least adverse visual impact.	  C3 would	  take the least amount of prime farmland,	  farmland of	  statewide importance, and CRP land. Alternative E2 would	  take twice as much	  prime farmland and nearly 5 times as much CRP lands as C3. C3 would	  be a new highway engineered	  to	  today’s American	  Association	  of State Highway and	  Transportation Officials (AASHTO) standards. Curves would be designed	  for high	  speed	  travel. Straighter does not equal safer with	  these design	  standards! The divided portion of US95	  from the top of the Lewiston Grade	  to Thorn Creek is 	  not 	  straight, 	  yet 	  it is 	  constructed 	  to 	  AASHTO 	  standards 	  and the curves are	  safe	  by those	  criteria. C3 has the least new area (acres) of impervious surface. This	  is	  significant in terms	  of the amount of pollutant runoff into	  area streams. If either W4 or E2	  is built, the existing US95	  would still be providing access	  to local residents	  and the impervious	  surface  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  there combined with that	  from the new alignment	  would add to the runoff. C3 is viewed	  by the City of Moscow as the most consistent with city	  and area land use goals. C3 is more compatible with	  a proposed	  Moscow ring road than is E2. E2	  will affect over twice as many acres of wetlands as C3	  but not as much as W4	  (DEIS	  pg	  146, Table	  45). Wetlands are important wildlife habitat and also important in flood control. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1970	  requires ITD to mitigate for any wetlands impacted.	  The 	  best 	  mitigation 	  policy 	  is 	  to 	  avoid wetlands. C3 avoids the most wetlands. During the construction of the divided portion of US95 from the top of the Lewiston Grade to Thorn Creek,	  a 	  contractor 	  for 	  ITD 	  buried 	  and 	  destroyed 	  a Spalding’s catchfly (Silene	  spaldingii)	  population that	  had been reported to ITD. Spalding’s catchfly was and is currently listed as threatened by the US Fish and Wildlife	  Service. ITD 	  did 	  not 	  take 	  adequate steps	  to prevent this	  from happening. Why could they be trusted to build a highway in an even more environmentally sensitive	  area? Latah County	  Commissioners wrote	  a letter in support of E2. Unfortunately, they did no research of their	  own. They relied on hearsay and misinformation and refused to listen to any contrary	  evidence. They	  obviously	  did not even bother to	  read	  the DEIS. It appeared	  they had	  already made	  up their minds before	  bringing	  the	  issue 	  up 	  in 	  a 	  public 	  meeting.  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  The	  EPA policy is to make	  the	  least impact on the	  environment. ITD is required to choose	  the	  alignment that will best meet this criterion. E2	  does not meet this requirement. In 	  Section 	  2.6,	  page 	  55 	  of 	  the 	  DEIS 	  ITD 	  states 	  “The primary disadvantages of E-‐2	  compared to the other alternatives are that it would	  be located	  closer to	  the base of Paradise Ridge .	  .	  .	  .” This is another example	  of ITD using	  confusing	  language	  to obscure	  the impacts of	  what	  they want	  to do!	  E2 is not	  “closer to the base”. It is, in fact, on Paradise	  Ridge	  above	  the	  base! E2	  will be	  on Paradise	  Ridge! In 	  2002,	  ITD 	  proposed 	  to 	  build 	  a 	  new 	  highway 	  over Paradise	  Ridge.	  They did so without any public involvement 	  and 	  were 	  disdainful	  when 	  met 	  with resistance from the public. In 	  2003 	  they 	  were 	  taken 	  to 	  court 	  over 	  the 	  issue 	  and the court	  decided that	  ITD had not	  followed the law or sufficiently considered	  environmental impacts. ITD 	  was 	  ordered 	  by 	  the 	  court 	  to 	  conduct environmental studies and prepare an Environmental Impact Statement. Ordinarily, an EIS is produced in a year or two. ITD chose to delay	  the process	  for over nine years, finally publishing a draft	  EIS in late 2012. One would suppose that this extraordinary time frame would result	  in an excellent evaluation of the environmental impacts, but this sadly was not the	  case. The DEIS is	  full of holes, poor data, and even incorrect 	  conclusions 	  drawn 	  from 	  that 	  data.	  With this much sloppy work, it	  is unlikely the FEIS will be any better. It makes one	  wonder whether ITD  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  engineers had their egos bruised by the	  public reaction and court	  decision and decided to halfheartedly jump	  thru	  some hoops and	  still trot out the same old bad idea. As is seen	  from the evidence above, alternative E2 is 	  really 	  the 	  worst	  alternative, not	  the best. I call upon	  ITD to	  do	  the right thing, admit they were wrong about building a highway on Paradise Ridge,	  and get on with the	  business of serving	  the	  public by building a highway which	  is both	  environmentally less damaging and safer	  to travel along	  the	  C3	  alignment.

From our farm, we do business	  and personal commerce from Thorn	  Creek to	  Lewiston	  and appreciate	  the	  improved safety and capacity 	  of the south portion of	  Hwy 95. We look forward to the improved safety and higher	  capacity on the north	  Highway 95 realignment. Our family farm, in its fourth generation of operation, is located	  on	  the west side of Hwy 95 along	  Thorn Creek Road	  and	  to	  Reisenauer Hill,	  as well as the east side of Paradise Ridge.	  We also have the privilege and	  responsibility of caring for the Palouse Prairie and woodlands we	  own on the west and east slopes of Paradise Ridge. The west route replaces Idaho's and the world's prime agricultural with	  Highway 95 for all time. This is 	  the 	  least 	  favored 	  route 	  according 	  to 	  the 	  studies and citizen comments. All routes greatly improve	  the safety and capacity of Hwy 95. Therefore, our comments	  reflect on one question we ask	  ourselves	  often	  as stewards of agricultural, native prairie, and	  other lands:	  Is 	  there 	  value 	  to 	  preserve 	  Idaho's largest 	  and 	  most 	  diverse 	  Palouse 	  Prairie remnant? We hope our response to this question, located on the following pages, will be helpful in your	  review of	  the east	  and central routes. How do we do the least harm to this heritage land? The Palouse grassland does not face serious threats from agriculture because nearly all of	  the habitat	  has already been	  converted. Degradation	  of the remaining fragments continues to be a problem..." World Wildlife Fund (NA0813). The degradation, caused by	  weeds	  and development, is	  less	  plant  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  diversity. Based	  on	  the DEIS Prather & Lasser (2007) study on	  weed migration and invasive behavior, and studies by the Federal Transportation	  Administration, highways become weed	  corridors from 0.6 miles of the highway edge. As the caretakers of	  this land, we know the difficulty	  in preventing	  stray	  invasive weeds from getting a foothold, and eradicating or controlling present weed invasions. We, along with our employees, spend	  hundreds of hours yearly searching and then either hand pulling or spot spraying invasive weeds	  on Paradise Ridge.	  As land stewards	  of the largest congruent Palouse prairie in Idaho,	  we 	  ask 	  for 	  your 	  assistance 	  in 	  maintaining 	  its health	  and	  diversity for future generations. We are a family that has deep roots with the land on	  the Palouse. However, if we want to	  be 'native to this place' as farmers and citizens of	  the Palouse, today and in the future, we need to respect	  the prairie, the memory it holds and	  the lessons can	  it can teach us. Please feel free to contact us	  if 	  you have questions at (208) 882-‐9143	  or at JLWJensen@gmail.com. Sincerely, Wayne	  and Jacie	  Jensen − Is 	  there 	  value 	  to 	  preserve 	  Idaho’s 	  largest 	  and 	  most diverse Palouse Prairie remnant	  and	  ecosystem? The Palouse Prairie has value to	  us as farmers in	  the Palouse	  region. − Our best teacher is the land itself. As farmers we observe the prairie in	  awe of its  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  efficiency, its sustainability, and its sufficiently to balance soil, water and air. This	  balance is	  as	  important 	  to 	  agriculture 	  as 	  it 	  is 	  to 	  nature.	  Nature may not provide the final answers, but it is worthy of our attention. For over twenty years on our farm we	  have	  implemented 	  soil-‐saving tillage and waterway practices, and soil-‐health	  crop	  rotations and	  micronutrient practices. We continue to	  adapt to	  new farm practices as the science in soil health and conservation advances	  because what happens	  below ground	  directly impacts what grows above ground. Our Palouse	  soil	  is 	  our 	  life-‐blood. − Science	  is beginning to understand how much our native soils have to	  teach	  us. For us as Palouse farmers, the Palouse prairie is a teaching and research laboratory for	  our	  grain, legume and brassica operations. By practices such	  as lengthening	  crop rotations, introducing	  animal and perennial crops with	  different roots structures and	  diversity, replenishing specific micro-‐nutrients and	  micro-‐biotics, and	  attempting to	  bring our rising soil pH back to	  normal levels, we have begun	  a highly simplified approach to mimic	  the prairie as	  closely as practical. We	  are	  attempting	  to keep our Palouse	  soils	  healthy for four more generations. We have learned to view our farm as a whole system, not as	  individual crops	  with individual inputs 	  and 	  outputs needs. Wheat is our cash	  crop, but crops like peas and	  barely will continue to	  have important 	  non-‐economic role	  on our farm. Like	  the	   #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  Prairie, it is not the	  individual flora	  and fauna	  species	  that make a healthy and balanced ecosystem, but the	  interaction 	  and 	  interconnection over time of all species in	  a place. An	  intact healthy Palouse Prairie ecosystem leaves us in	  agriculture and	  other land	  management with	  options to	  discover the answers to	  questions we do	  not even	  know yet to ask. To be	  good stewards of all our lands, it is important we	  have	  a	  baseline	  – a	  reference point. In the Palouse agricultural region that	  reference point	  is the Palouse Prairie. Our native grass and forb (wildflower) seed farm operation	  depends upon	  a healthy Palouse	  prairie	  ecosystem on Paradise	  Ridge. The best land	  solutions are built upon	  the uniqueness of each	  place. On the Palouse, soilerosion is the	  biggest threat to its agricultural land. Our farm land east of Paradise Ridge,	  with 	  its historical lower soils depths, was the place we chose to start implementing no-‐till conservation tillage and using the Conservation Resource Program. In 	  2004,	  when 	  the 	  wheat 	  price 	  was 	  $3.00/bushel,	  we knew	  we had to make changes	  on fields	  with lower 	  than 	  average 	  production 	  but 	  require 	  the same inputs. Once again, our land east of Paradise Ridge is 	  where 	  we 	  chose 	  to 	  increase 	  our 	  farm diversity by growing crops that have grown	  here for a	  millennium – native	  grasses and fobs (wildflowers). Our	  thought	  was “If	  the native grasses and wildflowers can grow on this soil without our assistance, can we grow	  them for seed  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  for	  public and private seed markets, and for	  the use on	  our own	  land?” At the time native Palouse	  wildflower seed was not available on the market. Today we have approximately 400	  acres of 10	  species	  of native grass	  seed and 30+ acres	  of 5 species	  of native wildflower seed in production on our farm. All of our native wildflower fields and	  2 of our grass fields originate from seed	  collected	  on	  the prairie on	  Paradise Ridge.	  An additional	  species of Paradise	  Ridge	  Palouse	  wildflowers are	  in production	  in	  an	  acre seed-‐increase 	  field 	  for 	  future seed production fields, small order sales to land owners, University and	  government research	  and	  restoration projects and nurseries. Pollinators from the Palouse prairie on Paradise Ridge required for	  seed production As with	  many US crops, our native wildflower fields require pollinator	  to produce seed. The Palouse prairie ecosystem on	  Paradise Ridge provides over 20	  different native pollinator species for our native wildflower production. As of today, we have not had	  to	  pay for additional pollinator 	  services. Current research	  at the University of Idaho	  is indicating 	  that 	  an 	  increase 	  in 	  invasive 	  weeds 	  and 	  a decrease in	  native or non-‐native grasses in	  natural and pasture	  lands, decrease	  the	  survival of birds possibly to	  due to	  the weeds not supporting the protein	  (insects) required	  during bird	  breeding and	  fledgling feeding. Our	  natural lands and agricultural production	  are interconnected	  on	  our farm. The Palouse prairie is increasing the diversity of all our natural and	  non-‐farm land.  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  Over time, our Conservation Reserve	  Program (CPR) land 	  has 	  increased 	  in 	  flora 	  and 	  fauna 	  diversity 	  by native wildflower species moving	  out from the prairie and	  into	  to	  the adjacent non-‐farm land. To reduce the time it takes nature to increase CRP	  diversity on	  its own, we are working in	  cooperation	  with the Pullman Plant Material Center USDA-‐NRCS, on	  four research	  project areas on	  our Paradise Ridge land.	  The 	  purpose 	  of 	  the 	  project 	  areas 	  is 	  to determine the best seeding methods and	  specie mix to increase wildflower	  diversity and therefore all diversity in	  retired	  farm land	  and	  CRP. This information 	  will	  be 	  shared 	  with 	  landowners.	  The key is not the just the Prairie itself, or the individual	  species, 	  but 	  the 	  diversity 	  of 	  species 	  in 	  a given	  habitat	  on Paradise Ridge.	  Attached	  is list of plant species found	  on	  our prairie land 	  on 	  Paradise 	  Ridge.	  This list does not include the mosses, lichens, fungi and such that	  flourish as the biotic soil crusts that protect the space or “skin” between	  prairie plants of the Palouse.

Box 7129	  Boise, ID 83707 − Dear Mr. Rush, I	  attended 	  the 	  public 	  hearing 	  on 	  23 	  January,	  2013,	  talked with several of	  the people there to help us understand	  this project, and have spent considerable time since then studying the DEIS material and talking with local people about this project. In	  the end, what I don't comprehend	  is ITD's 	  commitment 	  to 	  the 	  E-‐2	  Alternative. You will see throughout this	  letter the tread of it appearing  FHWA and ITD must balance	  both the	  human and natural environmental impacts with	  the safety benefit for	  the general public. General Response Alternative describes why FHWA	  and	  ITD identified	  the E-‐2	  Alternative as the Preferred	  Alternative. The E-‐2	  alternative was developed through a	  process of identifying 	  a 	  range 	  of 	  reasonable 	  alternatives 	  then screening them based on the purpose and need as	  well as human and natural environmental impacts. See General Response NEPA. The number of access points is considered as part of the modeling for	  the safety analysis. The AASHTO Highway Safety Manual uses the number of commercial, residential, and	  industrial approaches in	   #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  to me as though ITD started this project	  with the solution in mind and fit their arguments	  to that end. It 	  has 	  left 	  me 	  with 	  the 	  overriding 	  question 	  of 	  what is 	  the 	  real, 	  unspoken, 	  factor 	  that 	  is 	  influencing 	  ITD's choice. Whether this	  is	  true or no, unfortunately it	  will never be disclosed. That speculation aside, here are	  what I see	  are	  the	  issues with ITD's preferred alternative. − First, it appears that ITD's argument in favor of E-‐2	  seems	  to be based primarily on safety issues.	  However, there are a number	  of	  ways in which safety issues	  could be mitigated. For instance, the number of access points for C-‐3	  is greater than for E-‐2, but the number is not the real issue; that's only a	  way of using	  a	  number to make	  a	  point. The	  real issue 	  is 	  how	  those access points are handled, and any access could be	  handled in a	  way to make	  it safer. Another safety issue 	  relates 	  to 	  weather.	  One 	  error in 	  this 	  part 	  of 	  the 	  report 	  is 	  that 	  the 	  weather 	  data used	  in	  the analysis is scanty and	  biased	  by being for	  only part	  of	  a year, and an anomalous year	  at	  that	  (the year	  2005 being warmer	  and dryer	  than usual). In	  addition, it doesn't take into	  account the fact	  that	  E-‐2	  stays at a	  higher elevation longer and is through an area more prone to fog and ice.	  Clearly, the safety study should be re-‐evaluated with proper climate data and take into account the weather specific	  to each alternative. However, in my mind these concerns are not so telling as the fact	  that	  *all* of	  the routes being  its 	  formula's 	  to 	  predict 	  crashes.	  	  The 	  formulas 	  predict 	  a greater number of crashes on highways with more	  commercial, residential, and industrial approaches. The level	  of 	  design 	  for 	  an 	  EIS 	  is 	  typically 	  at 	  a 	  very 	  rough concept level and the level of analysis	  should be similar between	  alternatives. ITD does not work with	  landowners 	  on 	  right-‐of-‐way or access details during this concept	  level of	  design. This is typically completed during preliminary and	  final design	  after the EIS process	  has	  been completed and when detailed survey and geotechnical information is available. See	  General Response Displacement-‐1	  regarding clarification of the residential and business impacts. See	  General Response	  Weather-‐2	  regarding the fivemonth data set and how it relates to the	  larger 30+year data set. See	  General Response	  Weather-‐3, Weather-‐4	  and Weather-‐5	  regarding elevation, ice and weather related road conditions. While the original weather	  report	  utilized appropriate methodology and had valid findings, a supplemental Weather Technical Report has been	  prepared	  to	  address public comments as described	  in	  General Response Weather-‐8. General Response Safety-‐6	  explains the significance of the differences in safety between	  alternatives. See	  General Response	  Agency regarding the	  difference	  in 	  ITD 	  and 	  agency 	  opinion 	  regarding 	  the 	  Preferred Alternative. The wildlife experts that evaluated the existing conditions, project impacts	  and made mitigation recommendations provided consistent	  findings 	  that were stated in the DEIS and FEIS. They found that the  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  considered are safe. Highway 95 goes over many other places in	  its long run	  that are equally high	  and	  prone to	  bad	  weather. Federal regulations set standards	  of safety for	  our	  highways, and ITD knows how to	  make safe roads. I know safety is a hotbutton	  issue with the public, so it appears to me that	  ITD is playing that	  issue in order	  to have the decision	  fall where it wants it. Why it wants it there is 	  not 	  yet 	  clear 	  to 	  me.	  Please 	  note 	  also 	  that 	  the 	  DEIS states	  "Any of the proposed Action Alternatives	  would reduce the projected	  crash	  rate for this segment of US-‐95	  by more than 50	  percent," so none of the choices would	  be unsafe, and	  they all would be a substantial improvement over the current road. My real concern is environmental. It seems that the environment always takes a	  back seat to things like	  cost, efficiency, or something else that translates	  to "lets	  barge ahead and get this	  done the easiest, fastest	  way possible." IDFG thinks that	  E-‐2	  has more suitable wildlife habit than either of the other two choices, to the	  tune	  of requesting	  more	  than twice	  the amount	  ($750,000 vs $325,000)	  be allotted for	  mitigation. In addition to IDFG, EPA and USFWS don't like E-‐2	  either. It seems that ITD has taken the input 	  from 	  all	  the 	  wildlife 	  experts 	  and 	  distilled 	  it down	  to favor	  what	  they would like to do, not	  what	  that	  data really say should be done. The crux of it is that Paradise Ridge is 	  an 	  important bit of the environment, in	  terms of habitat, wetlands, native plants, and especially as one of the largest 	  remnants 	  of 	  Palouse 	  Prairie remaining. My  project area does not contain	  any critical ungulate habitat or high	  quality habitat and	  that the E-‐2	  Alternative would	  not result in	  population	  level impacts to ungulates. This was confirmed	  as well by the IDFG Wildlife Linkage Report that identified a 1.98 mile segment of E-‐2	  as a	  low priority linkage area. The wildlife experts made optional recommendations that could lower potential animal vehicle collisions. Clearing roadside vegetation, improving sight distance and improving 	  shoulders 	  and 	  clear 	  zones 	  are 	  mitigating measures that have been proven to lower animal vehicle collisions on US-‐20	  by 85	  percent. The findings of the reports are not distilled	  but are explained	  in	  the	  FEIS	  Section 3.8	  and 4.8. It is stated throughout the	  DEIS and FEIS but primarily concentrated within Section 4.8. Mitigation measures for wildlife and vegetation have been	  added	  to	  Chapter 9 Environmental Commitments. ITD 	  recognizes 	  the 	  local	  importance	  of Paradise	  Ridge and the	  wetlands, native	  plants and Palouse	  Prairie found there. The E-‐2	  Alternative would avoid directly impacting 	  Paradise 	  Ridge;	  however, 	  there 	  may 	  be indirect 	  effects due to	  weeds. See the FEIS Chapter 6 about the	  indirect effects. See	  General Response	  Weeds and Wildlife. See the FEIS Sections 3.2 and 4.2 for	  clarification regarding how Ring Road was considered. ITD is	  currently	  working with the City	  of Moscow on	  the Gateway Beautification	  Committee.  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  wife and I have put a great deal of effort into removing horticultural, invasive, and non-‐native plants from our small property and	  planting Palouse Prairie	  natives because	  we	  think it's that important. We don't live on Paradise Ridge, so it's not a matter of "not in	  my back yard". It's that we value native ecologies rather than we've	  heard it's a	  good idea. We put our work into what we believe is important. Paradise	  Ridge	  is not as	  undeveloped as, say, Kamiak Butte	  or Steptoe, which are	  protected now, but if it's the best we have, we should	  do	  the best we can to avoid messing it up when it can be avoided. Clearly alternative	  C-‐3	  is better in this regard than E-‐2. Displacements is 	  another 	  concern 	  in 	  this 	  project.	  The DEIS	  indicates a	  preference for E-‐2	  over C-‐3	  because it has fewer displacements. However, at the that	  January 23rd meeting, I was told that, in fact, no businesses will be displaced, and the	  widening of current US95 in the C-‐3	  corridor would have no	  effect beyond	  a potential noise increase.	  I	  realize that	  there is a lot	  of	  concern over	  displacements, and	  that usually the only ones that notice are those being displaced,	  so 	  they 	  often stand in a minority, and I don't want to gloss	  over the impact	  it	  has on those people or	  businesses, but	  where's the truth? If they are not really being displaced	  and	  noise is the only factor, then	  in	  my mind it is a much lower level concern, and	  it certainly	  doesn't rise to the level of environmental factors. I	  would 	  also 	  like 	  to 	  reiterate 	  something 	  a 	  friend  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  learned 	  from 	  a 	  conversation 	  with 	  Tim 	  Long, 	  District Right of Way Supervisor: apparently E-‐2	  would displace the most residents because of issues with	  a displaced	  well and	  that ITD had	  decided	  to	  relocate all of the	  residences within the	  mobile	  home	  park and a	  house	  above	  the	  park on Eid Rd. He	  apparently also stated that only one	  residence	  would be displaced along the C-‐3	  route. This information is very different	  than that	  presented at	  the public hearing on January 23rd and in the DEIS, which states that C-‐3	  would displace 7	  residences and E-‐2	  would displace only 5. Again, I'm left to wonder why ITD is interpreting the data the way it does. One factor that concerns me a lot is with regard to how this work would	  mesh	  with	  plans for a Moscow bypass and/or ring road. It's hard	  for me to	  fathom how ITD could	  not address this as part of the US95 realignment. To start	  with, it's totally absurd that a	  major highway like US95 still goes through downtown	  Moscow! And	  yet no	  one wants to	  acknowledge	  this elephant in the	  room. Does ITD figure that	  it	  can be delayed enough that	  your	  successors	  will deal with it rather than yourselves? Well, rest assured that	  I don't	  think this is what	  you should be doing. I think ITD and the city of Moscow should be working this	  out together, and nothing started on the US95 realignment until the overall plan	  is in	  place. There is so	  much	  evidence here that urgency is taking priority over the best solution, on	  the part	  of	  ITD, the city of	  Moscow, and Latah County, and	  I don't agree with	  that approach. It's  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  not cost effective in	  the long run, and	  is less likely to	  deliver the best results. Another argument from the DEIS report	  (pg. 147)	  is that	  the C-‐3	  Alternative would convert the least acres of prime	  farmland and farmland of statewide	  importance 	  to 	  other 	  uses.	  It's 	  a 	  factor 	  that 	  doesn't grab the	  attention of many	  people, but our farmland is slowly getting converted	  to	  residential or other uses. I think this has a long term consequences	  ITD should not ignore. That sums up my perspective on the US95	  realignment. I strongly support	  the C-‐3	  alternative, primarily on	  environmental reasons, but there are a number of other reasons why C-‐3	  is a	  better choice. I	  hope 	  the 	  work 	  you 	  put 	  into 	  a 	  final	  EIS 	  is 	  more accurate	  and better analyzed than is the	  case	  of the	  Draft EIS. Thank you for your attention.

Of	  those, the E-‐2	  Alternative would	  offer the greatest safety benefit as described	  in	  General Response Safety-‐3.  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  P.O. Box 7129 Boise, ID 83707-‐1129 We live approximately a quarter of a mile north of Snow Road on	  the east side of Highway 95 which	  is in 	  the 	  middle 	  of 	  the 	  Thorncreek 	  Road to Moscow Highway 95 project area. Our house is	  located approximately a	  hundred yards from the	  highway. Our property is one of the original Snow brother's homesteads. The comments that follow reflect our concerns, our support of the E2 alignment for the Thorncreek Road to Moscow Highway	  95 Project, and support of the	  Idaho Transportation Department's draft EIS for that project. Our concerns focus mainly on safety issues.	  First 	  the current unsafe conditions	  of Highway	  95 in the study area and particularly the stretch of	  road that	  runs adjacent	  to our	  property. Just	  in the last	  week Nancy was in the south lane waiting to turn across traffic to enter	  our	  driveway when a pickup, coming up	  behind	  her, failed	  to	  see her until the last minute and passed without slowing	  down on	  the narrow outside shoulder with	  horn	  blaring. It was broad	  daylight in	  the middle of the day with	  nothing to	  impair 	  vision 	  and 	  she 	  had 	  been 	  signaling 	  all	  the 	  way from the top of	  the hill. (I did verify that	  her	  turn signals	  and taillights	  were working.) It 	  is 	  remarkable that	  the pickup made it	  past	  without	  rear-‐ending	  her or turning over in	  the ditch. It is inconceivable to me that	  the driver	  could not	  see her	  Subaru station wagon (big and white against a black road surface). This	  is	  not unusual as	  both of us have had	  many similar narrow escapes. Statistics would  Additional information	  regarding safety as it relates to speed limits	  is	  provided in General Response Safety-‐4. Regarding the botanical and	  wildlife value of Paradise Ridge see General Response Weeds	  and Wildlife. Regarding weather, your detailed	  observations are consistent with the findings	  of Russ	  Quall, the State Meteorologist who prepared the original Weather Technical Report. A The Weather Analysis was revised	  and summarized in the	  FEIS	  Sections 3.10	  and 4.10. See	  General Responses Weather-‐3, Weather-‐4, Weather-‐5, and Weather-‐6	  regarding elevation, temperature, ice, snow and fog.

Residences and	  businesses that	  are impacted will be considered	  as part of the Uniform Relocation	  Act, which is summarized in the FEIS Appendix 5, Uniform Relocation	  Act.  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  suggest that it is	  only a matter of time and the odds	  will catch up with us. I worry terribly about my four grandchildren who live	  in Moscow and often visit with our son and daughter-‐in-‐law. An	  additional concern	  is that many drivers think that	  because the portion of	  highway that	  passes our	  property is a gently curving stretch	  of road, they can	  speed at 70 or 75 mile per hour. This	  happens	  with frequent	  rapidity. I don't	  know if	  it	  is because they feel that	  they can make up for	  time lost	  on slower	  portions of the highway north	  or south	  of that stretch, or if it is	  the first place they feel that they can pass	  a car that is	  already	  traveling at the speed limit 	  but 	  slowing 	  them 	  down, 	  or 	  exactly 	  what.	  I	  do know that there is a huge difference between how local	  drivers 	  respect 	  the 	  dangers 	  of 	  the 	  road 	  and the apparent	  perceptions of	  others. There seems to be a prevalent attitude among many 95 travelers that	  this stretch of	  road is a 4 lane interstate instead of the	  2 lane	  cow path that it really is. So please expedite the process without delay. The sooner we have a safe alternative in place, the better for all travelers on	  95. We are also concerned about the safety issues connected with construction of	  the W2 and C3 alternatives, particularly the	  C3	  alternative	  as it tracks much of	  the existing Highway 95 footprint. The E2	  preferred alternative will have considerably less 	  impact 	  on 	  traffic, 	  and 	  therefore 	  construction safety, because it only affects the existing highway at the	  ends of the	  project. The north facing slope of Reisenauer Hill,	  shaded 	  by  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  steep inclines	  on the east side of the road, has	  led to many accidents due to slick road surfaces and orientation. Relegating Reisenauer Hill to	  local traffic by building the E2 alternative would remove the issue for	  the highway (which would still be an issue 	  in 	  both 	  the 	  W2 	  and 	  C3 	  alternatives 	  as 	  they follow the old 95 footprint	  down Reisenauer	  Hill). The E2	  alternative not only 	  eliminates 	  the 	  north face of	  Reisenauer	  Hill but	  also eliminates an additional hill to be	  traversed on the	  north end of the project	  (Valhalla Hill for	  C3 and Clyde Hill for	  W2). The following comments are a	  rebuttal to comments	  in opposition to the E2 preferred alternative. Many opponents to E2	  represent Paradise	  Ridge in 	  terms 	  implying 	  a 	  pristine environment. From a	  Landscape	  Ecology point of view, Paradise Ridge is of low value as a botanical niche and	  as wildlife habitat. Existing plant populations and	  patch	  sizes are insufficient to	  remain viable, and in most	  cases without	  corridors or "bridges"	  to connect them. If there were no structures, no domestic	  herbivores	  (including horses), and	  no	  roads, then	  maybe there would be sufficient geologic	  and biological structure to support a pristine habitat, but I doubt it. Paradise Ridge is an	  island	  unto	  itself, subject to	  plant invasion 	  and 	  susceptible 	  to 	  the 	  incursion 	  of 	  the human	  species regardless of the presence of the E2	  alternative. There	  are	  some	  vestiges of Palouse	  Prairie (not	  located in the E2 alignment)	  for	  which every effort should be	  made	  to protect and  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  mitigate, even though they are on private property. The sad truth is that Paradise Ridge is 	  mostly privately owned	  and	  a desirable location	  for housing development, and	  developers and	  speculators	  continue to respond to market demands to	  further develop	  the Ridge for residential purposes. Existing land parcels will continue to	  be subdivided	  until there is a matrix of housing and	  roads further fragmenting the biological/ecological landscape. The clock cannot be reversed, no matter	  the dedication and efforts of	  those who dream of	  a pristine Paradise Ridge. Pristine	  ended when the first settlers began to utilize the resources on	  Paradise Ridge. A	  black and	  white photograph (which you can see in the lobby of the restaurant just south	  of the intersection	  of 95 and Palouse	  River Drive-‐currently	  the Iron Wok) is	  a historical picture looking south	  and	  east from the CCC	  camp	  to	  Paradise Ridge and	  in	  that picture a very	  different ecology	  is present. The vegetative community	  that is	  present now is	  the result of CCC tree plantings in the 30s and not	  typical of	  pre settlement. The Palouse	  prairie	  was a	  fire	  ecology driven	  process and	  very different from what now exists on Paradise	  Ridge. The	  mantra	  of those	  who oppose the E2 alignment is "Don't Pave Paradise". And	  yet every time they put in	  another access road	  or build	  another house or out building, they are reducing the permeability and degrading the structure of the soil that supports	  the ecosystem they desire to protect. The weather that is prevalent in the study area	  can  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  be extreme in	  any location	  and	  at any elevation. The study corridor is narrow and	  the alternative alignments relatively close	  together. Because	  the	  E2	  alignment is the	  safest, least disruptive, and least expensive	  alternative	  we	  support it above	  the	  other two. Most	  people tend to take a static view (a snapshot if you	  will) of the weather conditions at any particular time	  and place	  and use	  that for comparison. In reality, what we call "the weather"	  is	  a	  dynamic, ongoing, hydrologic process not bounded	  by artificial lines drawn	  on	  a map. Over the last	  several years we have lost large portions of roofing due to wind, first	  from our	  garage and then from our	  house (and that	  with a shelterbelt	  of	  trees to break the winds intensity). That	  same wind that	  removed our	  roofing came out	  of	  the southwest	  and blew up the	  slope	  with	  the same ferocity to	  Paradise	  Ridge.	  Ground fog, that starts out at the base of the ridge as a band, travels down	  the slope and eventually across our place. At any particular time it	  may be clear	  at	  our	  place and foggy to the east up	  the slope. Yet, through	  the dynamics of ground and air temperature, humidity, and other atmospherics, the	  belt of fog	  will move	  down the	  slope so that we are eventually in fog and everything	  above	  is clear. Depending	  on conditions, a	  fog	  belt may move	  up	  or down	  in	  elevation. Even	  on	  the ridge itself, conditions and	  resulting effects will differ between the north face, the west face, and the	  south face	  at any given time. I travel 95	  through Moscow every workday and back again each evening	  and Nancy traveled 	  to 	  work 	  at 	  a  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  biotech	  lab	  on	  the south	  outskirts of Moscow which	  faces the ridge and back each afternoon or	  evening. We both have observed the north and east face of the ridge for	  many years, in all conditions, and for	  extended periods of time. In our observations, there are times when there is a prevalent	  fog on the north	  face of the ridge extending north	  down	  towards the lower	  reaches of	  the agricultural land, that	  seldom comes far	  enough west	  to reach the proposed	  roadbed	  of the E2 alignment as it rises from Moscow and turns south along the base of	  the ridge. From where we live, we sometimes see a fog cap that sits	  on the top of the ridge but seldom comes	  further down the west slope than the base of the tree line. What causes that phenomena, I can	  only guess at. The	  obvious point is that the	  fog	  cap and the	  north face	  fog	  bank rarely reach as far as the E2 alignment. We have observed that	  the atmospherics that produce	  black ice	  and hazardous driving conditions, occur at differing elevations and	  times during the day (or	  season), the most	  severe being due to	  highway shading on	  the north	  sides of Reisenauer and	  Valhalla Hills. If we have a dry year, then both the low and higher	  elevations in the study area get less	  snow. In wet years	  all elevations	  get more snow. But the overall proportional differences between	  lower and	  higher elevations in	  the study area are minimal and remain the same regardless of	  a dry or	  wet	  year. There seems to be a	  mistaken perception that wild ungulate populations travel a north/south traverse along	  the	  corridor. In reality, these	  wildlife	   #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  populations are small and	  traverse east/west (particularly at	  the north base of	  Reisenauer	  Hill), following the ridges into Washington State where they have higher quality habitat (including orchards left 	  from 	  old 	  homesteads) 	  and 	  return 	  to 	  graze 	  on shrubbery planted around human habitations	  on Paradise	  Ridge.	  Their egress crosses all	  three of the alignments, but would be	  least impacted by the E2 alternative. We both feel strongly that ITD should make every effort to mitigate	  the	  impacts to wildlife, biologic resources, landscape, and impacted homeowners. Those who will lose their homes, that in some cases have spent their lifetimes developing, should	  be fairly compensated. By fairly, I mean replacement	  in a	  comparable	  setting. Current appraisals, in most cases, are considerably	  under what it will cost to relocate to a like structure, landscape, and acreage because of the litigation	  which	  has delayed	  the project for so	  long. These landowners should	  not be penalized	  by the actions of others and	  circumstances	  they	  did not propagate themselves. In 	  some 	  cases,	  it 	  may 	  be 	  advisable 	  to 	  provide 	  the homeowner the option	  to	  have their structures moved	  to	  a comparable setting, trading land	  with	  the homeowner-‐and providing	  infrastructure	  to make the property fully functional. We fully agree with the ITD DEIS assessment regarding wildlife, plant, and	  landscape resources. We both	  strongly believe ITD should 	  ensure 	  that 	  environmental	  mitigations be local and serve to replace the resource in the affected area, rather	  than cash  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  payments to	  another agency looking to	  augment their	  operating budget. Where possible, small and un-‐farmable fragments of	  agricultural land, resulting from the E2 easement, should be purchased	  from land	  owners and	  dedicated	  to	  mitigate wildlife and plant habitat. Overall we were impressed with the thoroughness and completeness of the	  draft EIS	  and applaud the	  ITD 	  document,	  both 	  its 	  analysis	  and conclusions. It is 	  now 	  time 	  to 	  move 	  on 	  without 	  delay 	  and 	  get 	  the road built. We both support	  the preferred alternative	  route	  E2	  and encourage	  implementation of that route from Thorncreek Road to Moscow.

C-‐3	  is acceptable!" (Lewiston Tribune, LTE-‐Feb. 3) In fact, C-‐3	  is preferable	  according	  to IDFG (Idaho Dept. of Fish and Game), USFWS	  (Fish and Wildlife	  Service) and the EPA (The Environmental Protection Agency). (DEIS, Executive Summary, page 16)	  A letter	  from IDFG,	  10/26/07,	  (DEIS 	  Appendix 	  1) 	  states:	  “In closing, we feel it is	  important to repeat one additional mitigation recommendation we	  have	  made in the Wildlife Assessment and at every opportunity: We recommend	  avoidance of the eastern alignment. It has been IDFG's position from the start	  – a	  position supported by recommendations from the other resource agencies-‐...	  We recommend avoidance of alternative	  alignment E-‐2." ITD asked for input from these key agencies, but	  then ignored it!	  Why? ITD had	  2 other acceptable alternatives to	  work with. Why did it continue to try to justify	  choosing	  E-‐2? C-‐3	  is a	  safe alternative. The DEIS	  Safety Report states, "AII existing alternatives	  would meet the ITD Design Manual and AASHTO (Assoc. of State Hwy and Transportation Officials) standards. "AII existing	  alternatives will flatten curves to the AASHTO standard."	  Unfortunately, if E-‐2	  is built rather than C-‐3, Reisenauer Hill and the	  dangerous descending	  curve will remain as	  is, becoming a county	  road. Still unsafe! For the local population	  south	  of Moscow, this unimproved	  county road	  will be necessary for daily use as well as access to	  emergency services.	  The DEIS, "Environmental Consequences", 4.10.4	   #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  “Emergency	  Response	  Time" states, "The	  C-‐3	  Alternative would	  provide the most convenient access and best emergency response	  times to the	  population	  on	  the existing US 95.." "The segments of existing US-‐95	  that may be turned over to the North Latah Highway District would be utilized for local	  circulation 	  and 	  emergency 	  service 	  access." Although	  some belittle preserving remaining treasures of	  Paradise Ridge's ecosystem,	  this 	  is another critical reason to choose	  safe, acceptable	  Alignment C-‐3. There is so much to lose, unnecessarily, by cutting a huge swath	  across the shoulder of Paradise Ridge. It is NOT NECESSARY! The US	  Department of Transportation Act of 1966	  states, "It is	  the policy of the US government that special effort should be made to preserve the natural beauty of the countryside..." The DEIS (4.17 Irreversible 	  and Irretrievable 	  Commitment 	  of Resources) states, "To	  the greatest extent possible, the Action Alternatives would use existing right-‐ofway." Therefore, the alignment taking the least new right-‐of-‐way and preserving the natural beauty of the countryside should be the first	  choice of	  ITD for	  the new 4-‐lane 	  Highway.	  This 	  points 	  to 	  selecting 	  C3! Finally, C-‐3	  should be the preferred alignment rather	  than E-‐2	  for many more reasons; E-‐2	  would require far	  more new Right-‐of-‐Way, would impact twice	  as much prime	  farmland,	  would 	  impact 	  twice the acreage of	  wetlands, would create 7 times more noise impacts, 	  would 	  be 	  subject 	  to 	  more 	  extreme winter weather hazards, would affect 2 domestic  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  wells causing an entire trailer village 	  to 	  be displaced, would	  increase the likelihood	  of vehicleungulate collisions, would negatively	  impact 24 of the last	  remnants of	  the original Palouse Prairie and bisect a prairie restoration	  site, destroy up to 4 acres of a	  pine	  stand -‐habitat for a number of rare species, and would have the greatest negative visual impact.	  Thus, 	  the 	  action 	  of 	  building 	  the 	  E-‐2	  Alignment would	  do	  irreversible damage to	  the unique ecosystem of Paradise Ridge.	  Please follow the most	  responsible and correct	  choice and build the C-‐3	  Alignment!  L-‐43  Paradise	  Ridge Defense Coalition  −  Paradise	  Ridge Defense Coalition (PRDC) Comments Addressing the U.S. 95 Thorn	  Creek Road	  to	  Moscow Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) & Section 4(f) Evaluation − ITD’s 	  Project Purposes:	  Build 	  a 	  Safe 	  Road 	  and Increase 	  Traffic 	  CapacityW-‐4, C-‐3, and E-‐2	  ALL meet these purposes and are acceptable to ITD.

There are strong objections to choosing E-‐2	  and strong recommendations for choosing C-‐3. − Below are comparisons primarily between	  C-‐3	  and E-‐2:  While many of the statements in your comment are valid and are stated in the DEIS, there are a few inaccuracies 	  that require clarification. While 7 residences would have noise levels 	  that 	  reach 	  the FHWA noise	  impact criteria, 5	  of those	  residences were	  due to	  be displaced	  and	  would	  therefore, no	  longer be considered to have noise impacts. In addition, the cost that	  you quoted for	  the noise wall for	  E-‐2	  would not be a	  factor because	  a	  noise	  wall was not determined to meet the cost benefit criteria and therefore would not be constructed. FHWA does not have	  a	  requirement to use	  the	  least new right-‐of-‐way for	  new highways. While this is one consideration, there are many	  other considerations	  including 	  ability 	  to 	  meet 	  project 	  purpose 	  and 	  need, impacts 	  to 	  residences 	  and 	  businesses and other environmental effects. It 	  was 	  determined that	  the E-‐2	  Alternative would have no	  population	  level impacts and	  that wildlife crossing structures	  would be ineffective due to the lack of land  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  CONSTRUCTION Federal Hwy Policy for new Hwy: Use the least new Right Of Way (ROW).

It 	  is 	  apparent 	  that 	  ITD 	  ignored 	  the 	  input 	  solicited from a number	  of	  key resource agencies and from much of the public from	  the very early stages of the project. In	  the DEIS, Executive Summary, page 16, it	  states, "Idaho Department of Fish and Game (IDFG), The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS)	  prefer	  the C-‐3	  Alternative to the E-‐2	  Alternative." Furthermore, a	  letter from IDFG dated Oct. 10, 2007	  (Appendix 1	  of the DEIS) states: "In closing, we feel it	  is important	  to repeat	  one additional mitigation recommendation we have made in the Wildlife Assessment and at every opportunity: We recommend avoidance of	  the eastern alignment. It	  has been	  IDFG's position	  from the start – a	  position supported by recommendation from the other resource agencies...We recommend avoidance of	  alternative	  alignment E-‐2." SAFETY The DEIS	  Safety Report states: "All existing  General Response Safety-‐6	  explains the significance of the differences	  in length and safety between	  alternatives. See	  the	  General Response	  Weather-‐2	  regarding the 5month data set and how it relates to the larger 30+year data set. Providing the	  "Guide	  to the	  DEIS" to the	  public was an effort to summarize	  information 	  in 	  the 	  EIS, 	  to 	  notify the public of	  an opportunity to comment	  on the DEIS and to attend the	  public hearing.  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  alternatives would meet the	  ITD Manual and AASHTO standards... All existing alternatives will flatten curves to the AASHTO standard." Thus, C-‐3	  and W-‐4	  for that matter would both be safe. However, if E-‐2	  is built rather than C-‐3, Reisenauer Hill and the	  dangerous descent and	  curve will remain as is, because it	  will become a county road and will not be	  changed to meet AASHTO safety standards. Building C-‐3	  would fix that dangerous section, which so many testified about at the hearing. The DEIS, "Environmental Consequences", 4.10.4	  "Emergency Response Time" states, "The C-‐3	  Alternative would	  provide the most convenient access and best emergency response	  times to the	  population	  on	  the existing US 95." In	  addition, E-‐2	  is adjacent to prime	  ungulate habitat and	  passes through marginal to moderate ungulate habitat	  and vehicle -‐ungulate collisions will be greater than	  for C-‐3, which passes through poor to marginal ungulate habitat. DIFFERENCES: SIGNIFICANT OR NON-‐SIGNIFICANT? The DEIS	  and the "Guide to	  the Draft Environmental Impact 	  Statement" 	  Brochure 	  contain misinformation and biased presentation of information 	  which 	  deceives 	  the 	  public.	  The 	  pros 	  are presented	  first in	  the E-‐2	  descriptions and the cons are	  presented first in the	  C-‐3	  descriptions. During the ITD public hearing on 23 February 2013, Tim Long, District Right of Way	  Supervisor, and Carmen Reese, Senior Right of Way Agent, informed	  that "no businesses will be moved, and widening the current Hwy	  95 would have no effect beyond	  a  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  potential noise increase." 	  However, 	  in 	  ITD's 	  "Guide to the DEIS" Brochure it	  states "displacement	  of	  8 businesses" as one of its 4 main	  reasons for not choosing C-‐3	  as its preferred alternative. In addition, Tim Long	  said that E-‐2	  would	  displace the most residents because of issues with a displaced well and that ITD had decided to relocate all of the residences within the mobile home park and a house above the park on	  Eid	  Rd. He also	  stated	  that only one residence would	  be displaced	  along	  the	  C3	  route. However, the DEIS	  stated that C-‐3	  would displace 7 residences and	  E-‐2	  would displace only 5. It 	  appears 	  that 	  ITD 	  defines 	  "displacement" 	  as "impact"	  rather than "removal"	  as	  the dictionary and most people	  define	  "displacement". These	  "tricks" deceive the public, public policy makers, and more	  importantly those	  making	  the	  final alignment decision. Further deceptions are	  contained in the	  DEIS	  and its "Guide"	  based on non-‐substantial or nonstatistically significant differences: It 	  is 	  stated	  that E-‐2	  would be the shortest alternative	  (by 0	  .09	  miles =	  475	  ft. vs. C-‐3) "E-‐2	  would result in the greatest travel time reduction." (32 seconds faster	  than C-‐3)•	  That E-‐2	  is the safest	  route, only considers "predicted rates of	  crashes". Statistically,	  the 	  differences 	  are 	  not 	  great;	  predicted	  fatal and	  injury crashes for 2017 are: E23.8	  and C3	  -‐4.7. The predictions do not take into account accidents that will occur on the	  ITDabandoned "US95", which includes a	  longer stretch with E-‐2	  vs C-‐3.  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  "Estimated Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT)" C-‐3	  =	  31,862	  and E-‐2=	  31,433. Significant?•	  "Estimated Operational Energy Use" C-‐3	  =	  50,633	  and E-‐2	  =	  49,951. Significant?•	  Although the DEIS	  states that "approximately 57% of crashes	  during the past 10 years occurred during inclement weather." The weather analysis was extremely inadequate; Jan. 1May 31 in 2005, one of the driest, mildest years on record, so the scope did not	  include snow, wind, and drifting. Moreover, the	  C-‐3	  corridor was not actually characterized. (Weather stations were only near E-‐2	  and W-‐4.). C-‐3, which is between the existing	  highway (low elev.) and E-‐2	  (high elev.), would escape much of the frost that occurs on the existing	  route	  and snow and wind that occurs on E2.In conclusion, we strongly urge ITD	  to choose the very	  acceptable, safe, and responsible alignment, C3!

I	  do,	  however,	  have 	  several	  remaining 	  concerns with respect to the possible selection of E2. I have resided for	  twelve years on the western end of	  Paradise	  Ridge which, I believe, has provided some real world observations and experiences on which  See	  General Response	  Weather-‐2	  regarding the fivemonth data set and how it relates to a larger 30+-‐year data set. The North Latah Highway District will be responsible for	  maintaining the existing US-‐95	  if it is transferred to them as described General Response Maintenance-‐1. Information 	  regarding 	  snow 	  accumulation 	  and snowdrifts	  are also discussed in General Response Weather-‐4. The information regarding ungulates is the best available	  information at this time. Information regarding moose relocations has been added to the FEIS	  Section 3.8. The	  wider typical section, clearing vegetation along	  the roadway	  and improving	  sight distance will help	  reduce the probability of animal vehicle collisions. This	  has	  been proven to reduce animal vehicle	  collisions by 85	  percent on US-‐20. See General Response Safety-‐2. General Response Safety-‐3	  provides information  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  to base my concerns for	  safety,	  wildlife 	  habitat 	  and water resources. Safety: I	  am 	  concerned 	  that 	  the 	  weather 	  conditions measured to not reflect the conditions that actually occur along the northern	  two	  thirds of the proposed	  E2 route. The weather collection	  site was at the	  top of Reisenhower Hill where	  it would not capture the actual wind speeds	  that occur as	  the wind is “funneled” to the north of the ridge. Weather collection data was only collected for one year which those of us who live on the ridge know can vary	  significantly	  from year to year. Wind will play a significant factor in winter as it moves snow back and forth across E2. Question: Why wasn't more weather	  data collected? What preventative measures will IDT take to prevent snow drifts along E2? I am specifically interested 	  in 	  the 	  E2 	  section 	  where 	  IDT 	  proposes 	  to "dig down"	  65 feet west of my property. Who would be responsible for maintaining the current Hwy 95 if either E2 or W4 options are chosen? Wildlife Habitat Based	  on	  personal observation	  I am concerned	  that the project	  area research did not	  fully identified the number of moose,	  elk and deer that	  reside	  along	  the proposed E2 route. For	  example, this winter	  our	  resident	  cow moose and bull calf	  have been highly visible. The bull was observed in my	  lower barn, then two days later	  on the University of	  Idaho  regarding the updated Safety Analysis, which considers the remaining sections of	  US-‐95. See	  General Response	  Safety-‐4	  regarding smaller improvements 	  to 	  the 	  existing 	  US-‐95. If 	  the 	  E-‐2	  Alternative is selected water features impacted 	  by 	  the 	  alignment 	  will	  be 	  replaced 	  on 	  the 	  east side to be utilized by wildlife if the sites	  are compatible with 	  wildlife 	  use 	  and 	  the 	  landowners 	  are 	  willing.	  	  	  The alligator lizard is a	  species of greatest conservation need	  as prioritized	  by IDFG's Conservation	  Strategy; however, there are no	  special protections that would	  be required	  for this species. There should	  be sufficient additional habitat located nearby that would continue	  to support	  the species. Blasting is not anticipated	  to	  displace the band	  of water that	  you are referring to. See General Response Water. The contractor is required to engineer and perform blasting in	  a safe and	  professional manner. Prior to	  completing blasting, the contractor is	  required to submit a blasting plan to the ITD for approval. The blasting plan	  will provide details of charge loading, blast hole spacing, and	  blasting sequence	  among	  other items.	  	  	  This 	  helps 	  ensure 	  that 	  the 	  blast 	  charges 	  do 	  not become too	  great. If Alternative E2 is selected, the production	  rate of the well referred	  to	  above will be tested prior	  to blasting and immediately after	  blasting to verify that	  no	  damage to	  the production	  rate of the well was made. If damage is made to the production rate of	  the well by blasting, ITD will compensate you for	  the damages, by either	  paying you money, or	  drilling a new well. Based	  on	  preliminary geotechnical information and  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  campus	  and several days	  after that in the Moscow Cemetery. Several days later he	  was again observed in 	  my 	  barn. Another example is the frequent observation	  of a herd	  of approximately 30 head	  of elk and numerous white tail deer,	  although 	  the 	  number 	  is 	  much 	  lower due to	  a blue tongue	  outbreak three	  years prior. Question: What control measures will be utilized to reduce the probability of	  vehicle vs animal collisions? If 	  E2 	  is 	  selected 	  my 	  farm 	  pond 	  will	  be 	  one 	  of 	  only two on the east	  side of	  E2. What	  sources of	  water	  will IDT provide for	  wildlife? I	  have 	  captured 	  and 	  released 	  three 	  northern alligator lizards on my property. Does this species require any special provisions? Water: This is without a	  doubt my number one concern. The depth and flow rates of area	  wells indicate a	  significant	  but	  narrow band of	  water	  along the north	  side and	  southwest side of Paradise Ridge.	  If E2	  route is selected the 65' " dig down" west of my property with	  the use of explosives could	  potentially cause a displacement of this band	  of water. Question:	  What 	  is 	  IDT'S 	  plan 	  to 	  reduce 	  the probability of such	  a displacement? If a displacement of this band	  of water occurs, what actions will IDT	  take	  to endure	  my well is able	  to supply the water my property requires? Minor Concerns: Use of explosives:	  What 	  provisions 	  will	  IDT 	  take 	  to  conceptual level detail, there should be sufficient area within the proposed alternative right-‐of-‐ways to accommodate	  staging, stockpiling	  and other associate	  construction areas. ITD will make every	  feasible effort to keep construction within the right-‐of-‐way.	  If additional areas are	  needed during	  construction due	  to geotechnical constraints or other information, then the	  impacts 	  would 	  be 	  evaluated 	  during 	  the 	  reevaluation process. Northern alligator lizards have no special protections under federal or state regulations.  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  minimize potential impact on my property and animals when using	  explosives? Right of Way slopes:	  Will	  the 	  right 	  of 	  way 	  footprint be increased	  or decreased	  on	  the east side of E2, if selected, if rock is	  encountered? In 	  summary,	  I	  am 	  sure 	  you 	  have 	  received 	  many verbal and written comments with respect to which route to select. In your	  selection process I encourage	  you to place	  more	  value	  weight on the	  comments	  of those of us	  directly	  impacted by	  the rout	  selected, whether it is E2, C3 or W4.

Box 7129 Boise, ID 83707-‐1129 − Dear Mr. Rush, I	  am 	  writing 	  this 	  correspondence 	  as 	  an 	  adjacent land 	  owner 	  impacted 	  by 	  improvements 	  proposed 	  to US 95. The well documented lethality of Reisenhaur Hill support a concurrence with ITD's preferred alternative	  "E-‐2”. I support this alternative after careful consideration, study	  and dialogue with neighbors, friends and	  local Businesses impacted	  by the project. Although I am a staunch supporter	  of	  our local environment, I feel that any environmental impacts mitigated to accommodate	  this project	  should first	  and foremost	  address the protection	  of human	  life.	  The 	  studies 	  provided 	  by  FHWA and ITD must balance	  both the	  human and natural environmental impacts with	  the safety benefit for	  the general public.

General Response Schedule describes the next steps in the environmental process and the anticipated schedule. General Response Safety-‐5	  describes how the different alternatives address safety deficiencies at Reisenauer Hill. General Response Displacement-‐1	  offers clarification regarding residential and business impacts.  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  the FHWA and ITD has substantially addressed the safety benefits of E-‐2	  versus the other alternatives. The main purpose of the realignment slated by these agencies would be to "improve the safely and travel time". I understand that any location of the proposal would	  have displacement and	  environmental impacts. No amount of mitigation can alleviate all considerations. The existing US	  95	  would become a	  county road that	  would still service the existing Businesses south	  of Moscow, resulting in	  minimal impact. The E-‐2	  route will be less invasive of our streams and wetlands, would not substantially impact air quality and is not located within a	  flood plain. As a concerned	  citizen	  and	  impacted	  land	  owner I would urge ITD to execute the intent of the relocation and observe	  "Safety First". Thank you, Gloria Taylor, Member Citizens for a safe 95 1020	  Zeitler Rd, Moscow, ID 83843 −  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response   L-‐46  Malena Karen  Braatne Knoff  Dear Idaho Transportation Department, − Safety is the	  number one	  concern for the	  Idaho Transportation Department and residents of Moscow when choosing a new alignment for	  US 95 from Thorn Creek to Moscow. I strongly disagree with the E-‐2	  alignment. I don't believe one winter report	  is enough to say this route is safer	  than C-‐3. It's 	  hard 	  to 	  believe 	  that 	  a 	  higher 	  elevation 	  route 	  will	  be safer in	  the winter.	  Science 	  proves 	  air 	  is 	  cooler 	  at higher elevations thus producing more ice and	  snow. E-‐2	  will be in the highest elevation and for the longest	  distance. Since the primary concern of	  ITD 	  is 	  safety I	  think 	  another 	  report 	  should 	  be produced	  in	  a harsher winter than	  the year 2005, which was one of the mildest winters in 25 years. ITD 	  reports 	  that 	  weather 	  influences 	  57 	  percent 	  of Highway 95 accidents, so shouldn't there be more data than	  1 year showing the weather patterns of each route	  and thus determining which	  route is  FHWA and ITD must balance	  both the	  human and natural environmental impacts with 	  the 	  safety benefit for	  the general public. General Response Alternative describes why FHWA	  and	  ITD identified	  the E-‐2	  Alternative as the Preferred	  Alternative. See	  General Response	  Weather-‐2	  regarding the fivemonth data set and how it relates to the larger	  30+year data set. See General Response Weather-‐3, Weather-‐4	  and Weather-‐5	  for information regarding elevation, ice, snow accumulation and other weather patterns. The Noise Abatement Criteria	  (NAC) described in 23	  CFR	  Section	  772 (table 1)	  are very specific on what	  noise levels 	  constitute 	  an 	  impact.	  Although 	  the 	  noise might be audible at distances greater than 300 feet away from the	  proposed road the	  transect analysis shows	  that at 230 feet the noise level drops	  below the NAC of 66 dBA for residences. See FEIS Sections 4.11 and 4.12	  regarding	  visual effects and noise	  effects, respectively.  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  safer? − I	  also 	  feel	  E-‐2	  will destroy the beauty of Moscow due to	  the noise and visual presence it will have. Reports only record	  noise 300 feet from the centerline. With E-‐2	  being at a	  higher elevation it will project much farther than that. ITD admits that E-‐2	  is the noisiest and has the most negative effect on	  the environment. Visual analysis shows 50% high	  impact 	  for 	  E-‐2	  compared to C-‐3	  at 23%. The DEIS	  report	  shows that	  C-‐3	  alignment will have less effect on habitat, pine	  stands, species and farmland.	  Idaho Fish and Game do not support the E-‐2	  alignment and actually strongly recommends against E-‐2. I do think this is something to take into effect as well as the	  safety of the road. − I	  do 	  think 	  there 	  needs 	  to 	  be 	  a 	  change 	  to 	  the current highway	  however I don't think	  E-‐2	  is the best option. I strongly disagree with	  E-‐2	  based on safety,	  visual impact, 	  noise and environmental effects it will have	  in the	  Moscow area. C-‐3	  seems like 	  the 	  safer 	  route 	  when 	  looking 	  at 	  the 	  facts, 	  as well as the least impact on the Moscow	  area. Why would you choose E-‐2	  when C-‐3	  seems far superior in 	  all	  categories? 	  I	  think 	  we 	  need 	  to 	  get 	  beyond	  the want to develop and look at the truly safer route as well as preserving the beauty of the Moscow	  area. If 	  we 	  continue 	  to 	  destroy 	  the 	  beauty 	  of 	  the 	  Moscow area	  less people	  will want to live	  here. − On a side note I am frustrated that ITD has  See	  General Response	  Agency regarding differences in opinions regarding ITD and	  FHWA’s Preferred	  Alternative. See	  General Response	  Safety-‐6	  regarding the significance of	  the differences between alternatives. The E-‐2	  Alternative was identified as FHWA’s and ITD’s Preferred Alternative	  because	  it balances the	  human and natural environmental effects with the	  best safety benefit for the public. It was not identified	  as the Preferred Alternative	  due	  to political, developer or personal gain. FHWA	  and	  ITD have been	  transparent in	  evaluating	  and disclosing	  the	  environmental effects of the alternatives and the rationale for	  their	  decisionmaking process.  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  leaned	  in	  one direction	  and	  not clearly explained	  all the facts to Moscow residents.

This also could contribute to a slightly higher accident rate. This negative contribution	  could be corrected by	  the addition of a frontage road, which is currently not	  proposed by ITD. − +	  Although presented differently in the	  DEIS, Alternative C-‐3	  would only increase noise effects to eight businesses and dislodge	  one	  residence. Alternative E-‐2	  would probably undermine the viability	  of these eight businesses in the absence of Highway 95	  traffic, and will dislodge	  an entire	  trailer park (five residences or greater). − =	  Although Alt.

However this	  safety analysis is flawed for at least four reasons:  ITD 	  and 	  FHWA 	  have 	  identified 	  the 	  Environmentally Preferred Alternative	  in the	  DEIS	  and FEIS. To meet FHWA NEPA requirements, the Environmentally Preferred Alternative	  must be	  identified in the	  FEIS	  and identified 	  in 	  the 	  Record 	  of 	  Decision 	  (ROD).	  In 	  doing 	  so they may consider	  both human and natural resource impacts 	  and 	  if 	  not 	  selected 	  rationale 	  will	  be 	  provided.  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  − 1) No confidence intervals or p values are provided for	  these numbers, thus it	  is not	  clear	  if	  there is any statistically significant difference between the C3 and E-‐2	  crash numbers. − 2) The weather conditions used in this analysis are from only part	  of	  one winter	  (Jan. -‐May,2005) which was such a mild winter that snow	  could not even be	  considered. And even with this inadequate weather analysis, a central alternative was not considered. Alt. E2 stays	  at the highest elevations	  the longest, thus will likely suffer	  the most	  weather	  related accidents. − 3) On the north and south ends of Alt. C3	  in particular Reisenauer Hill,	  unsafe 	  sections 	  of 	  the current highway	  would be corrected. However with Alt. E2 these unsafe areas would	  continue to	  exist as county roads, and accidents would continue	  to happen. This was not accounted	  for in	  the safety analysis. − 4) As mentioned above, numerous access points in Alt. C3 make it less safe. ITD failed	  to	  correct this with frontage roads, which would result in a better safety rating for	  C3-‐-‐possibly superior to	  that of E2. Thus	  we consider the safety analysis	  so faulty that it cannot be used to reliably	  predict differences	  in safety between the alternatives. − In 	  the 	  above 	  analysis 	  C-‐3	  is superior in nine  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  categories, C-‐3	  and E-‐2	  are similar in three categories, and E-‐2	  is not superior in	  any categories. Even if we cede superiority in safety and distance	  to E-‐2, C-‐3	  still clearly wins with superiority in nine categories, compared to two with E-‐2. − ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS: According to the DEIS; − +	  Alt. C-‐3	  will have	  the	  least effect on wetlands, whereas Alt. E-‐2	  will impact more than twice the acreage	  of wetlands as C-‐3. This is significant in terms of	  wildlife habitat	  and also flood control, in which wetlands play a significant role. − +	  Alt. C-‐3	  passes through poor to	  marginal ungulate habitat whereas Alt. E-‐2	  passes through marginal to moderate ungulate habitat. C-‐3	  affects no acres of moderate ungulate habitat whereas E-‐2	  affects 4.4	  acres. This is significant in terms of the	  conservation of native 	  wildlife.	  Also, 	  better 	  habitat 	  (E-‐2) will have more ungulates and could increase the likelihood of vehicle¬-‐ungulate collisions. − +	  Alt. C-‐3	  has the least new area	  (acres} of impervious 	  surface.	  This 	  is 	  significant 	  in 	  terms 	  of the least	  amount	  of	  runoff	  of	  pollutants into our	  streams. − +	  Alt. C-‐3	  impacts no pine stands whereas E-‐2	  impacts 	  4 	  acres 	  of 	  pine 	  stands.	  E-‐2	  will destroy this habitat for the northern	  alligator lizard, pygmy nuthatch and long	  eared myotis, C-‐3	  would not.  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  − + The DEIS	  predicts significant negative impacts to Palouse	  Prairie remnants within a 1 km distance from the highway. There are 14 Palouse prairie remnants within 1 km distance from Alt. C-‐3, whereas E-‐2	  has 24	  remnants within 1	  km distance.	  Also	  E-‐2	  would bisect a	  proposed prairie restoration site contiguous	  with the extremely significant Paradise	  Ridge prairie remnant. The DEIS weed	  analysis predicts that negative	  impacts of E-‐2	  would extend all the	  way to the top of	  Paradise Ridge where there is a large, extremely valuable prairie remnant, impacts from C-‐3	  would not. Thus, E-‐2	  would have a much greater detrimental effect on the endangered Palouse Prairie Ecosystem than C-‐3 − +	  Alt. C3	  would have the least effect	  on general wildlife − =	  Both Alts. C-‐3	  and E-‐2	  have 5	  stream tributary crossings. − =	  Alt. E-‐2	  has shorter distances along stream tributaries than C-‐3, however these stream tributary distances would still be present	  along the old	  highway with	  E-‐2. − As seen above, Alternative C-‐3	  is clearly superior in 	  six 	  environmental	  categories, 	  while 	  C-‐3	  and E-‐2	  are	  similar in two categories. From an environmental analysis, C-‐3	  is clearly superior to E-‐2	  .  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  − In 	  summary,	  we 	  request 	  that 	  ITD 	  correct 	  all	  the erroneous information	  (weather analysis, safety analysis, analysis of dislocation of businesses and residences)	  in the DEIS, and then objectively analyze	  and compare	  the	  facts as we	  have	  above. If done correctly and	  objectively, we are confident that	  ITD will come to the same conclusion as we have. Even	  if these corrections are not done, alternative	  C-‐3	  is still clearly the superior alternative, from both socio-‐economic and environmental standpoints, according	  to the	  information in 	  the 	  DEIS. − In 	  an 	  EIS,	  the 	  Federal	  Highway 	  Administration and ITD are	  required to analyze	  a	  broad range	  of alternatives, determine	  which alternatives meet the	  stated "Purpose and Need", and select that alternative	  which meets	  the purpose and need and has the least impact 	  to 	  the 	  human 	  environment.	  The DEIS	  states that all three alternatives (E-‐2, C-‐3, and W-‐4) meet the purpose and need. The DEIS	  clearly	  shows	  that alternative C-‐3	  has the least environmental impact, and E-‐2	  has the greatest environmental impact. Therefore, FHWA and ITD should select alternative C-‐3	  for implementation. The selection of alternative E-‐2	  could make this project susceptible to	  litigation. − PGSC and FOC strongly urge	  the	  agencies to get the job done, and	  select alternative C-‐3	  for implementation.  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  − Sincerely, − Al Poplawsky, Chair, Palouse Group	  Sierra Club Gary Macfarlane Friends of the Clearwater  L-‐49  James H. and Zoe A  Cooley  P.O.

Box 7129 Boise, ID 83707-‐1129 − Dear Mr. Helm: −  ITD 	  also 	  values 	  the 	  Palouse 	  Prairie and all of the	  alternatives would avoid directly affecting	  the Palouse remnants. The E-‐2	  Alternative would be closer to the Paradise	  Ridge remnant	  but	  would not	  encroach upon it.	  As 	  you 	  know 	  Paradise 	  Ridge 	  is 	  privately 	  owned 	  and 	  is already developed with residential and commercial developments. Therefore, public access may not	  be guaranteed. See	  General Response	  Weeds. The E-‐2	  Alternative would have Expressway Access Control, which	  would	  limit any new approaches onto	  US-‐95	  thereby slowing new development on the ridge.

They may not understand the complex economic aspects of a problem, but oftentimes allows for more clarity in 	  decision-‐making. − My 7th grade students at Garfield-‐Palouse	  Middle	  School in Garfield, WA recently studied the	  native	  Palouse	  prairie	  and immediately fell in love	  with it through the photos that	  they saw, shouting out, "Can we go on a field trip there!"	  My heart warmed over their excitement, but I was also saddened by the fact	  that	  these children, who call the Palouse region home, had never	  before seen the native habitat. As I am sure you	  are well aware, only one percent of the Palouse prairie remains, making it not surprising that my students were just learning	  of it. Before the lesson, they probably would	  have cited wheat fields	  as	  the native ecosystem. I hope to be able to take my students to find some of	  the remnants of	  Palouse prairie this spring. But	  after	  that, what	  will happen? If	  Highway 95 is re-‐routed through E-‐2, even less of this important habitat will be around	  for future class field	  trips, and	  even	  more importantly, 	  for 	  our 	  native 	  species 	  that 	  call	  the prairie home. − I	  also 	  understand 	  that 	  there 	  are 	  economic 	  and safety reasons for	  re-‐routing the highway. However,  FEIS	  Chapter 6. Mitigation measures to reduce any indirect effects to Palouse	  remnants as a	  result of the	  alternatives and potential development is described in the FEIS Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments.

Furthermore, the study completed to determine the winter weather conditions	  on the E-‐2	  option	  was flawed. Collecting weather data during a mild winter will not provide accurate	  information about the	  potential hazards that	  could be observed on the highway if	  built	  there. I ask you, how will building a highway at	  a higher elevation	  make it safer	  to drive on in the winter? I urge you to select the C-‐3	  option because it 	  will	  be 	  a 	  safer 	  route 	  requiring 	  less 	  road construction and disturbing the least amount of native habitat. − We value the Palouse Prairie and hope	  you will too. − Sincerely, − Audrey Squires − NSF GK-‐12	  Science Teaching Fellow, Gar-‐Pal M.S.

From my understanding, the current road is very dangerous. W-‐4	  is a	  great alternative	  because	  it has less curves than US-‐95. Also, the E-‐2	  route is a	  bad idea	  because it destroys the last	  original Palouse.

The current	  highway has many safety issues, 	  paramount 	  of 	  those 	  are 	  the 	  many county	  roads, driveways	  and business	  entrances. I counted 14 businesses between	  the Primeland	  site and Johnson Excavating. Four of those	  businesses are	  on my	  property. One of those businesses (Johnson Excavating)	  has slow moving heavy equipment entering	  the	  highway numerous times a	  day. The Latah	  County Motor Pool shop	  is also	  located 	  there 	  with 	  the 	  sheriffs' 	  department 	  coming in 	  and 	  out 	  many 	  times 	  a 	  day.	  Green Acres RV Parking has slow moving motor homes looking for a	  place to	  park overnight and	  Don's Plumbing office and dispatch are	  located on my property. I also have a spring on	  my property that supplies water to	  the businesses and any excavating for	  the central route could easily impact	  that	  resource. There are 8 businesses and	  7 homes that would	  be displaced	   Thank you for your detailed information regarding access and traffic along	  existing	  US-‐95. The C-‐3	  Alternative is not expected to affect the	  spring	  on	  your property as explained	  in	  General Response Water. The C-‐3	  Alternative is in nearly the same location 	  as 	  existing 	  US-‐95	  is and cuts and fills are expected to be	  minor in that location. If shallow groundwater is 	  encountered 	  in 	  the 	  vicinity 	  of 	  the spring by construction, the embankment and ballast will be designed to drain water through them so that flow will continue. Additional clarification of	  residential and business impacts is provided in General Response	  Displacement-‐1. Should an action alternative	  be	  selected, then the	  existing	  US-‐95	  may be turned over to Latah County Highway District; however, it is undetermined at this time if	  the speed limit	  would be lowered. See General Response Maintenance-‐2. See General Response Safety-‐3	  regarding how the safety on	  the existing US-‐95	  would be considered in the Safety Analysis. In 	  response 	  to 	  public 	  comment,	  ITD 	  has 	  provided additional detail in the	  FEIS	  regarding	  the	  indirect and cumulative	  effects to Paradise	  Ridge and Palouse	   #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  should C3 be chosen as	  well as	  the water supplies. The two trailer courts (Hidden Village & Valhalla) along	  this stretch of road also generate	  a	  significant	  amount of traffic entering	  the	  highway as well as the many driveways to homes and county roads. By moving the highway to	  the east IDT can	  control the access to the highway thus making for	  a much safer commute. The current highway would then be part of the Latah County	  Highway	  district and I would imagine	  that	  they would reduce the speed limit	  thus making the section of	  road safer. I	  have 	  been 	  closely 	  following 	  the 	  rhetoric 	  of 	  the opposition	  to	  the E2 routing and	  find	  it interesting that	  they wish to maintain Paradise Ridge as a	  somewhat pristine environment. The area has	  already been impacted with extensive	  development. Paradise Ridge is ALL private property not a public recreation area, with over 50	  homes, radio	  and	  TV towers, and	  a commercial riding arena and other endeavors. A look at a	  county map shows that	  much of	  the ridge is divided up in what	  one day may well be more development. So much for pristine. This very vocal group	  of opposition	  to	  E2 appears to be some of same folks that caused	  the stink about the megaloads. Most do not even live in the corridor.

Much has	  been said about E-‐2	  Alternative being safer. This is not a	  true statement. 1. There is sufficient evidence to indicate a driver's speed is	  a positive correlate to being in a crash. The speed limit for all routes	  will rise to 65 mph, therefore, E-‐2	  will not be any safer than the other alternatives in this regard. 2. In collisions between two vehicles of different mass, the occupants	  of the lighter vehicle are considerably	  worse off than those in the heavier vehicles. This factor plus increased speeds will not make E-‐2	  any safer than the other alternatives in this regard. 3. It is true that the number of accidents increases when cars are getting on or off a highway. On page 26	  of the DEIS	  report, it states that there were 22	  accidents in less than 7	  miles at access points in the	  10	  year period from 2002-‐2011. It is true that C-‐3	  as  The Safety Analysis 	  has 	  been 	  revised 	  since 	  the 	  DEIS 	  was published	  but the relative findings remain	  valid. The E2	  Alternative would, still offer the greatest safety benefit as explained	  in	  General Response Safety-‐3. See General Response Safety-‐6	  regarding the	  significance	  of the difference in safety between alternatives. The numbered responses below correspond to the numbers in	  your comment letter. 1. See General Response Safety-‐4	  regarding speed limits 	  and 	  safety.	  2. While the respective weights of two impacting	  vehicles may	  be a safety factor, it	  is not	  possible to predict the combinations of vehicles that could	  impact each other. Percentages of heavy trucks and passenger vehicles that are used in the safety	  analysis are the same between alternatives	  so are not a primary factor in 	  the 	  safety 	  when 	  comparing 	  alternatives.	  	  3. See General Response Safety-‐1	  regarding the consideration of frontage roads	  for the C-‐3	  Alternative. Additional clarification	  regarding access was added	  to the FEIS and is described in General Response Access. Accesses to	  and	  from US-‐95	  were minimized for all the alternatives through use	  of consolidated approaches and limited access points. Access will also be	  further evaluated when there	  is a	  greater level of detail during	  the design process. Steak House	  Hill is outside	  of the	  logical termini and is not addressed	  in	  this EIS process.  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  planned	  has more points for local access than E-‐2	  (47 versus 22 respectively, pg. 53 DEIS)	  So, it	  seems obvious that reducing the number of access points and/or the actual design of	  the access points will improve 	  safety on	  C-‐3. In other states and areas and indeed 	  on 	  US 	  95 	  at 	  Viola 	  (8 	  miles 	  north 	  of 	  Moscow), access ramps are	  designed in such a	  way that traffic coming onto the highway	  or off has	  a separate lane. It 	  is 	  also 	  curious 	  that 	  this 	  is 	  now 	  an 	  argument 	  when nothing was done to	  change the number of access point on	  the US 95 "remodel"	  over Steak House Hill a	  few years ago or up near the	  Casino south of Coeur d'Alene 4. Much has been said about E-‐2	  avoiding Reisenauer Hill and, therefore	  will be	  safer. I do not believe this is an	  accurate statement. Both	  E-‐2	  and C-‐3	  go over Reisenauer Hill and both will meet Federal Safety Standards. It will people	  who drive	  unsafely that will make the statistics. 5. The elevation of the E-‐2	  Alternative definitely makes it less safe. I live on Moscow Mt. at about the same	  altitude	  as E-‐2. We have heavy fog hang over us when	  there is no	  fog 200-‐300	  ft. lower. On Feb. 19, we	  hit a	  wall of fog crossing Steak House	  Hill that slowed traffic to 35 mph. The snow was also sticking. It was not falling	  at the	  bottom of Steak House	  Hill. This is quite common. For this reason alone, I believe it	  is inaccurate to say that	  E2	  is safer. It will also cost more for snow removal and the	  spreading	  of material to increase	  traction. 6. According to the DEIS	  (page 177) "The C-‐3	  Alternative would 	  provide 	  the 	  most 	  convenient  4. All three action alternatives would be much safer than the existing highway at	  Reisenauer	  Hill and are	  predicted	  to	  have the same number of crashes per mile of divided	  four-‐lane 	  highway.	  See 	  General	  Response Safety-‐5	  regarding Reisenauer Hill. 5. See General Response Weather-‐3, Weather-‐4	  and Weather-‐5	  regarding elevation, fog, snow and other	  weather conditions. The E-‐2	  Alternative would be located 	  at 	  substantially 	  lower 	  elevation 	  than 	  Moscow Mountain. See General Response Maintenance-‐1	  regarding winter	  maintenance. 6. Access, mobility and travel user costs are further evaluated in the	  FEIS	  Section 4.10	  and in the	  Mobility and Road User Cost Study (ITD, 2014a). General Response Access provides updated	  information	  regarding Access Control for	  the action alternatives. Regarding protection	  of Paradise Ridge,	  ITD understands the scenic beauty of the area. The E-‐2	  Alternative would	  not go	  over or through	  Paradise Ridge but would	  be closer to	  it. Paradise Ridge is all privately owned	  properties with	  no	  public access. It has over 50 commercial and	  residential developments on	  it, ITD has no	  control over future developments that could directly	  impact Palouse Prairie remnants. While ITD does not have control over its protection, the E-‐2	  Alternative, should it be selected, would restrict	  any new access onto US-‐95	  which could reduce development pressures. See General Response Wildlife regarding the alternatives’ effects to Paradise Ridge.	  General	  Response Agencies explains why there were differences in opinion regarding FHWA’s and ITD’s 	  Preferred 	  Alternative. 	  For 	  clarification,	  The 	  US  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  access and best emergency response	  times to the	  population	  on	  the existing US-‐95, while the E-‐2	  and W-‐4	  alternatives would provide improved access and quicker response	  times to some	  of the	  more	  outlying areas and	  cities. The C-‐3	  Alternative would have a longer four-‐lane 	  with 	  center 	  turn 	  lane section that would allow for easier access	  and more frequent	  opportunities to turn around in the urban areas."

It 	  appears 	  to 	  me 	  that 	  the 	  DEIS 	  does 	  not 	  use 	  a 	  logical	  process to	  select an	  action	  alternative. I will review each of the	  potential issues, using	  data	  from the	  DEIS to reach a conclusion, and will comment on missing data critical to some of the decisions. As there appears to be little support	  for	  W4, I will concentrate on the comparison of C3 and	  E2. As I suggested at the public	  hearing, and in the written copy	  of my	  remarks	  submitted that evening, I believe this analysis is suitable for a Supplemental EIS. Given the length of the DEIS and the supporting documents (estimated	  at over 1,300 pages),	  the inconsistencies 	  between 	  documents, 	  the 	  general	  lack 	  of 	  cross-‐referencing and updating in the documents (some were written	  seven	  years ago), I am disappointed that ITD and FHWA did not grant the requested extension of	  the comment	  period. While I can appreciate the difficulty in	  cross-‐referencing and updating this large amount	  of	  material, I can also construe this lack of crossreferencing as an intentional device to impair	  informed 	  public 	  comment.	  I	  cite 	  examples 	  of 	  these  See	  Safety-‐6	  regarding the significance of the differences between	  the length	  and	  safety between	  alternatives.

What needs to	  be analyzed	  now are the assumptions and	  computations for the smaller differences between	  the proposed alignments. Despite this above statement about the similarity of potential accident rates of the different alignments,  greatest safety improvement.

This sentence was not meant to obscure the impacts 	  but 	  to 	  state 	  a 	  relative 	  comparison.	  	  Table 	  42 	  of the DEIS clearly 	  presented 	  all	  of 	  the 	  acreages 	  of impacts.	  	  See 	  FEIS 	  Section 	  4.3.	  The 	  C-‐3	  Alternative would score lower on the impact rating form because of the three alternatives it would	  more closely follow the existing right-‐of-‐way and would require the least amount of productive farmland	  to	  be converted. The other alternatives would	  require that more acres be converted to right-‐of-‐way for transportation use. See the DEIS Table 42 on page 145. Additional clarification of how both	  the Farmland	  Rating scores and	  farmland	  acreages were	  considered has been added to the	  FEIS	  Section 3.3	  and 4.3. The language in the FEIS	  is not meant to be deceptive, nor was the organization	  meant to	  prevent crossreferencing.

Alignment C3	  replaces portions of the Old	  95 roadway and	  permits much of the local	  traffic 	  to 	  use 	  the 	  new 	  road.	  With C3, there will be minimal traffic on	  what is left of Old	  95.

Corridor analysis/big game: Also	  increasing the accident rate	  for E2, as compared to C3, will be	  collisions	  with big game. There is	  no doubt there will	  be 	  more 	  big 	  game 	  crossing 	  E2 	  than 	  C3 -‐a	  professional consultant suggested	  underpasses for big game on	  E2, but the ITD does not include this in	  their	  proposal. The natural resource agencies (IDF&G, EPA, USF&WS)	  all prefer	  C3 to E2 (p16 of	  DEIS, Executive	  Summary) because	  of the	  presence	  of big game (see map	  on	  p. 35 of Melquist big game biological evaluation	  in	  Wildlife Technical reports}. When considering the corridor accident rate, adding in 	  only 	  a 	  small	  factor 	  for 	  additional	  animal-‐caused crashes	  on E2	  raises its accident number to approximately that of C3. Corridor analysis/weather: Many believe the weather will be more severe -‐more snowpacked icy conditions	  and fog -‐on	  E2. Much	  anecdotal data support this. However, ITD only conducted their weather measurements for 5 months during an exceedingly mild, snow-‐free winter. Stations were  level	  alignments.	  	  No 	  specific 	  information 	  on 	  cuts, 	  fills, geotechnical information or survey	  data is 	  available 	  to determine slopes, cuts and	  fills at this time. That information 	  will	  be 	  available 	  during 	  the 	  design 	  process.	  At that time ITD will explore engineering solutions to	  further	  minimize harm to those resources. Travel Time Access, mobility and	  travel user costs are further evaluated in the	  FEIS	  Section 4.10 and in the	  Mobility and Road User Cost Study (ITD, 2014a). Speed limits and safety are	  addressed in General Response Safety-‐4. Miscellaneous The mailing address for EPA is corrected in the	  FEIS	  Appendix 3. The requirement under FHWA	  NEPA	  regulations is that	  EPA’s Regional Office be provided a copy	  of the DEIS. EPA received the DEIS and provided comments	  through mail and a copy	  was	  also hand delivered. Listings and cross-‐references to the technical reports have been	  clarified	  in	  the FEIS. A	  Revised	  Safety Analysis (ITD 2013) was prepared	  to	  address DEIS public comments. It contains all of the relevant supporting data and is	  available at public	  viewing locations. The DEIS	  discloses the alternatives’ impacts to the	  human	  and	  natural environment and	  is not meant to	  be biased. The text referred	  to	  on	  page 15 of the DEIS is 	  describing 	  the 	  primary 	  advantages 	  and disadvantages. The description	  of the primary disadvantages is not an	  all-‐inclusive	  list but summarizes resources for	  which the E-‐2	  Alternative would have the  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  not positioned	  to	  compare the central alternatives with others; hence C3 is considered equivalent to E2	  in fog when they are likely different. The weather study measured wind but no wind data are presented. Residents are familiar with	  high	  winds which would be hazardous to high-‐profile vehicles and are	  likely higher on E2	  than C3, but this question	  cannot be answered	  because adequate data were not collected, despite nearly 10	  years in which this could have been done. The study states that	  measurements are ongoing and provides a link to weather	  data, but	  the link does not	  work. Considering the corridor accident rate with	  the above	  addition of a	  factor for big-‐game-‐caused accidents, 	  and 	  now 	  adding 	  anything 	  for 	  additional	  increased 	  weather-‐related accidents on E2, E2 becomes less safe than	  C3. 2007	  request for reanalysis: It appears that in Nov 2007	  the FHWA instructed ITD to "integrate an analysis of wildlife/vehicle	  collisions	  and climate effects into the	  safety evaluation prepared for the	  project". This information	  is on	  a single page (p. 7) near the end	  of the Safety Technical report in	  Thorncreek Road to Moscow Environmental Matrix Safety Analysis Alignments Carried Forward and is titled "Climate and Wildlife Safety Analysis". Discussion of these two factors in this analysis on this page is minimal: The weather analysis in this 2007	  document focuses mostly on the effect of curve radius and does not consider any	  possible differences	  in weather between	  the alignments.  greatest impacts. Since	  the	  W-‐4	  Alternative would have greater impacts than the	  E-‐2	  Alternative, greatest wetland impacts was included under the W-‐4	  Alternative’s primary disadvantages. In addition, it	  was noted	  under the C-‐3	  Alternative that C-‐3	  would have the least	  wetland impact. −  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  Wildlife is dismissed in this 2007 document with even less discussion. It does admit E2 would be	  the	  least 	  safe 	  from 	  the 	  perspective 	  of 	  wildlife-‐caused accidents, however it uses the low number of animal-‐caused accidents	  on the existing alignment to downplay this problem. The E2 route is clearly in better big game habitat. As many big game collisions	  occur under poor light conditions, attempted mitigation such as the	  proposed clear zones	  will not prevent accidents. This integrated analysis of climate and wildlife is supposed to be available in its	  entirety on the ITD project website. The last sentence of the first paragraph	  states, "To	  review the assessments in	  full, go to the ITD 	  project 	  website." 	  I	  was 	  unable 	  to locate 	  this 	  information 	  on 	  the 	  project 	  website 	  as 	  a stand-‐alone	  object. It may have	  been included in the safety analysis which is dated 2012. If so, the	  discussion	  is inadequate. The big game discussion	  focuses on how few big game related accidents are on	  the existing road, how bad	  things are at locations 	  outside 	  the 	  project 	  area, 	  and 	  the 	  effect 	  of clearing vegetation. There is	  no real attempt to quantify what the situation	  might be like on	  E2. We are	  left	  with anecdotal information from area residents which suggests big game routinely forage on	  portions of the E2 right-‐of-‐way and adjacent areas. The	  weather discussion is simply a	  repetition of what is stated	  elsewhere. Conclusion: If accidents are	  calculated for the	  US	  95	  corridor (Old 95 and the new alignments), and weather and big game are taken into consideration,  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  E2	  would likely be less safe than C3. Residential and	  business displacements In 	  my 	  comments 	  at 	  the 	  public 	  hearing 	  (these comments	  were also submitted in writing that evening), I mentioned inconsistencies in the	  data	  between	  documents, making quantitative comparisons	  between alternatives	  difficult. Example: Alternative C3	  displaces 7	  residences in Table 8	  of the DEIS	  but only	  3 in the Screening	  of Alternatives document (p. 17). I have now learned	  that	  ITD personnel, in conversations at	  the open house and	  on	  a subsequent date, have corrected	  these estimates to only one residence (and no businesses)	  if	  C3 is built, but	  a number	  of	  residences would be displaced along Eid Road if E2 is built. (See Feb 13	  letter from Forbes for details.) This is substantially different than presented to the public	  during the comment period	  and	  has	  likely prejudiced	  people against the C3 alignment. This is a	  serious issue	  that should be	  rectified in a	  Supplemental EIS. If the	  information from these	  conversations	  at the open house and later are correct, C3 clearly	  is	  the alignment that would minimize	  the	  disruption of households. Farmland The DEIS	  and supporting documents contains deceptive descriptions of the affected	  environment which makes it difficult to accurately assess how	  the impacts 	  of 	  the 	  different 	  alternatives 	  were compared. Example: The discussion	  of farmland in the "Selection of	  Alternatives" document	  uses the "prime farmland impact rating"	  as	  a method of  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  rating the alternatives. While this derived number	  is required when farmland is converted to other	  uses, it 	  appears 	  to	  be a relative rating, comparing the quality of the impacted	  farmland. As the 3 alternatives are	  somewhat similar in this rating, acreage	  (which differs with E2	  being	  greater than C3 by a factor of 2 for prime farmland) is a more appropriate	  factor on which to base a selection. However, it is not used in the selection process. The DEIS	  (p147) states that E2	  would affect "slightly more prime farmland than the other	  Action Alternatives." While the absolute acreage is not large 	  compared 	  to 	  the	  size	  of many Palouse	  farms, E2	  actually destroys 50.8	  acres of prime farmland while C3 only covers 25. This is an example of qualitative wording being used	  to	  obscure impacts. The C3	  alternative would split fewer farms (4) than E2	  (6) and result in fewer "remnant farms"	  of less	  than 20 acres (2 for	  C3, 5 for	  E2). (From Community Impacts 	  pdf,	  Community 	  Impact 	  Assessment 	  Ch 	  3 Land Use	  Plans and Policies, p.15) Clearly, using the criteria of farmland preservation	  and farm integrity, alignment	  C3 is the logical choice. Wetlands, streams, and floodplains The DEIS	  shows E2	  clearly eliminates more wetlands than C3, but	  C3 is said to impact	  more stream channels	  and one floodplain. As	  is	  common in the document, there is no	  cross¬-‐referencing from the DEIS (Chapter 4 in this case) to the data reports, creating an obstacle to the evaluation of issues. Wetland data are readily available in the Wetland  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  report, but	  where would one look for	  a tabulation of stream (tributary) data for different 	  locations? 	  I	  do	  not find	  a detailed	  tabulation	  in	  the wetland	  report, and is not	  in the floodplain report. There is one map	  in	  the DEIS (Exhibit 26) and	  four in	  the wetland report (Appendix A) which show	  the tributaries and one can then estimate their lengths from the map. Table 44 gives overall lengths. What	  I have been	  unable to	  locate are specifics of where in	  the project	  specified lengths of	  streams would be impacted 	  and 	  how.	  Riparian 	  habitat 	  is 	  important, yet the DEIS index	  contains neither "riparian", "stream", "waterways"	  nor "tributaries". Is	  fill being placed	  into	  riparian	  areas or just nearby? Could	  the alignment be	  moved into the	  hillside	  to avoid the	  stream? As	  the streams	  paralleling the road are primarily along the existing alignment, have these streams	  already been compromised or otherwise impacted? 	  Or 	  are 	  these 	  decisions 	  being 	  postponed to the final design phase? This lack of	  information makes it impossible to compare the overall severity of the different alignments' impacts on	  waterways. There is a	  floodplain impact in C3, but it appears minor from	  the discussion in the DEIS. Vegetation The C3	  alternative has smaller maximum heights of cuts	  and fills	  (for C3, the maximum cut height is	  61% less than in E2, and the maximum fill height is	  40% less) and thus C3	  requires less total excavation (26% less)	  than E2. This provides less disturbed ground in C3. Disturbed ground is prime	  habitat for invasive 	  and 	  noxious 	  weeds.	  (Cut, 	  fill	  and  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  excavation data	  from the	  Community Impacts pdf, Environmental Justice section, Fig 2 (it's really a table). Given that ITD	  may clear "330' from the edge of traveled way" to permit	  big game to be seen along E2	  (p. 7	  Safety Analysis), the disturbance footprint of E2 is truly massive. It may nearly intrude into	  adjacent prairie	  remnants. Certainly it will put greater invasive	  weed pressure	  on the	  large	  and remarkably undisturbed prairie remnant	  atop the south end of Paradise Ridge.	  (As this remnant is on private land, few have had	  the privilege	  of visiting	  it, 	  hence 	  the 	  impression 	  among 	  some 	  supporters 	  of E2	  that “weeds are everywhere" and thus they proclaim the weed	  situation	  hopeless.) I	  have 	  not 	  seen 	  any 	  discussion 	  of 	  staging 	  areas,	  haul	  roads, batch plants, gravel or	  fill sources and rubble pile locations. These can	  all have impacts, both	  in	  terms of	  possible direct	  impacts to prairie remnants (especially if	  they are left	  to the discretion of	  unsupervised	  contractors) and	  in	  terms of additional disturbed ground susceptible	  to invasive	  weeds. These areas need to be specified in the DEIS, not left to	  the design	  phase. Similarly, unspecified	  plans for "future mitigation" have no	  accountability. Visual quality There appears to be no disagreement on this; E2	  clearly	  will have a greater visual impact 	  and, 	  along 	  a substantial portion of the route, the roadway will appear to dominate	  the	  landscape. Travel time/distance I	  view 	  the 	  travel	  time/distance 	  differences 	  between  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  C3 and	  E2 to	  be trivial; if these parameters are so	  important 	  on 	  US 95, then I suggest activity outside the project	  area could produce meaningful time and distance savings-‐-‐the Tolo Lake road avoiding Grangeville would be very effective in saving time and distance	  if it was paved and straightened. There is a	  second way to view this travel-‐time issue. The faster travel time on E2	  comes from not having to slow down as one approaches the commercial area	  south of Moscow. The	  E2	  route	  would put drivers into	  Moscow at a higher rate of speed	  than	  C3. The road	  from the northern	  terminus of	  the project into	  Moscow is relatively open	  and	  uncongested	  and	  it is difficult for drivers to	  decrease their speed	  to	  the posted	  35 mph	  and	  then to 25 mph. I have personally observed this when I volunteered as a crossing guard at Palouse Prairie School (where	  Styner crosses US	  95). Excessive speed is so common here for drivers approaching	  from the	  south that I have	  seen police	  simply waving at drivers	  to slow down rather than practicing any active enforcement. Consider that this problem occurs for	  drivers after	  they have been driving through	  an	  area signed	  at a reduced	  speed	  (past	  JJ	  Building, Primeland etc.). What	  would happen	  if they entered	  town	  by the South	  Fork Palouse	  River bridge on	  E2 at 65	  mph? Conclusion It 	  is 	  clear 	  from 	  the 	  information 	  I	  have 	  discussed 	  that there is no question alignment	  C3 is preferable from the standpoints of	  visual quality, farmland preservation, residential and	  business  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  displacement, and	  effects on	  vegetation	  and	  wildlife. From the	  perspective	  of wetland preservation, C3	  is preferable but there is insufficient information	  in	  the documents to make an informed decision on the combined wetland/stream/floodplain impacts of these alignments. I	  argue 	  that 	  the 	  safety of C3 will be equal to	  or better than	  E2 and	  that the travel time/distance issue 	  is 	  trivial	  and 	  higher 	  speeds 	  as 	  the 	  alignment reaches the South Fork Palouse River bridge will result in unsafe	  conditions on US	  95 as drivers enter the south end of	  Moscow. I	  have 	  really 	  been 	  unable 	  to 	  find 	  any 	  true arguments supporting	  E2	  over C3. Miscellaneous: DEIS, list of agencies: The mailing address for Carla Fromm in the	  Boise	  EPA office	  is incorrect.	  As 	  I	  understand	  it, EPA	  has not been	  at the Orchard	  Street location for many years. Do we	  know whether Carla Fromm received any of the necessary documents during the EIS process? Biological Assessment: On	  p.6 there is a discussion	  of negotiating	  an easement to protect Spalding	  catchfly	  and its	  reintroduction to a private prairie remnant. This work was scheduled for	  2007 and 2008. What is the current status?	  Also, what are the results of	  the 2007 and 2009 surveys (p.8)? Another example showing the	  difficulty in locating	  information 	  in 	  these 	  documents:	  The 	  IDF&G 	  wildlife assessment is cited in the	  Executive	  Summary and in 	  Chapter 	  1, 	  but 	  no 	  location 	  is 	  given.	  The 	  Wildlife  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  Technical Reports was a	  logical location, but there is no	  table of contents in this document. There are 4 reports by 3 different	  subcontractors plus the IDF&G 	  wildlife 	  assessment 	  in 	  this 	  document. 	  Only one of the five reports has a header, so	  one must literally 	  page 	  through 	  the 	  entire 	  document 	  to 	  even determine whether the IDF&G wildlife assessment is 	  present 	  there.	  The 	  DEIS 	  has 	  a 	  table 	  of 	  contents for	  this document, but	  it	  is logical one would look at	  the document	  itself	  for	  a table of	  contents. The table of	  contents in the DEIS lists the reports in the incorrect 	  order, 	  so 	  is 	  of 	  little use. The DEIS	  p15	  states that E2	  would traverse flatter topography than other	  alignments (which is one factor	  that	  makes it	  preferred by ITD), but	  I was unable to	  find	  any quantification	  of this. I can	  see where the western route traverses rough topography, but could this be	  a	  trivial numerical difference between	  E2 and	  C3? Writing in the DEIS is biased as it will ignore negative aspects of the preferred	  alternative yet call out similar problems in	  one of the other alternatives. For example, the	  Executive Summary	  (p.15)	  points out	  the length of	  tributaries affected by C3, yet makes no	  mention	  of the acres of wetland obliterated by E2. −  L-‐68  Green Sanctuary Committee of the Unitarian-‐Universalist Church	  of the  −  Comment about the ITD’s Proposed	  Highway 95Reroute between	  Thorncreek Road	  and	  South	  Moscow − March 5, 2013  FHWA and ITD must balance	  both the	  human and natural environmental impacts with	  the safety benefit for	  the general public.

The following contains the Green Sanctuary Committee's reasons why the ITD's preferred	  E-‐2	  route is the wrong choice, and why the C-‐3	  route is the right	  choice. The ITD's E-‐2	  route would take away twice as much prime farmland	  (arable land	  of statewide importance) 	  and 	  claim 	  more 	  Conservation 	  Reserve land 	  than 	  the 	  Palouse 	  community's 	  and 	  the 	  Green Sanctuary's preferred route, C-‐3. The C-‐3	  route would be more consistent with the Moscow City Council's proposed Ring Road southern access	  to Moscow and to the City's	  shortand long-‐range land use goals. The C-‐3	  route would require fewer new, ITD rightsof-‐way and	  would	  provide more points of highway access than E-‐2. Local and emergency vehicles would have faster response times to the surrounding area via the extra access	  points	  the C-‐3	  route would provide. The C-‐3	  alternative would not undermine the viability	  of 8	  businesses along the route, whereas, E2	  would route customers away from these  Much of the	  information stated is correct and consistent with the DEIS and FEIS.

All of the Action Alternatives would have Expressway Access Control, which would limit new non-‐agricultural approaches resulting in	  greater safety benefit and	  less induced	  growth. The Safety Analysis has been	  revised	  since the DEIS was published	  but the findings remained valid. See General Response Safety3. See	  General Response	  Access. Access, mobility and travel user costs are	  further evaluated in the	  FEIS	  Section 4.10	  and in the	  Mobility and Road User Cost Study (ITD, 2014a). 4.

E-‐2	  could negatively impact the continued viability, profitability, and sustainability of these businesses. Location along a highway is sometimes the key factor that determines whether or not businesses survive and	  thrive. The E-‐2	  route could also cause traffic congestion and uncontrolled strip development in east Moscow. Strip development would only benefit the pockets of	  a few developers. Having enough water to sustain life on the Palouse is 	  a 	  BIG 	  consideration 	  for 	  this 	  area.	  The 	  C-‐3	  route would not affect any domestic wells, but E-‐2	  would negatively impact at least 2 domestic-‐use wells. The C-‐3	  alternative is also preferable because it would be constructed	  at a lower elevation	  than	  E-‐2. Snow and ice	  would melt faster on C-‐3	  than on E-‐2, which would be constructed closer to the top of Paradise	  Ridge. Human lives would be	  saved on C-‐3	  because road	  conditions would	  be less slippery/treacherous	  during the winter months. The C-‐3	  route, since it is only 0.09	  of a	  mile longer than E-‐2, would cost about the same to construct. The overall environmental impact of C-‐3	  would be less 	  than 	  the 	  environmental	  damage 	  E-‐2	  would cause. C-‐3	  could potentially impact 14	  remnants of native Palouse prairie, whereas, E-‐2	  would be likely to impact	  24 priceless prairie remnants, comprising some of the best Palouse Prairie habitat that is	  left. The Idaho Native Plant Society, the Palouse Prairie Foundation, some	  University of Idaho students	  and staff, the Paradise Ridge Defense Coalition, the Wild Idaho 	  Rising 	  Tide,	  the 	  Palouse 	  Chapter 	  of 	  the 	  Sierra  5. General Response Water describes the alternatives’ impacts 	  to 	  ground 	  and 	  surface 	  water.	  	  6. See General Response Weather-‐3, Weather-‐4	  and Weather-‐5	  regarding elevation, ice, snow and other weather related driving conditions. 8. None of the Action Alternatives would directly affect Palouse	  remnants or	  Paradise Ridge; however, as stated in the DEIS, the E-‐2	  Alternative would be closer and could have	  indirect effects. For clarification, the	  E2	  Alternative would be located just west of the proposed	  Prairie Restoration	  Site but crosses through	  a portion of the property that does not have restoration	  activities planned. This is further clarified in the	  FEIS	  Section 4.8. See	  General Response	  Weeds and Wildlife. 9. See Safety-‐2	  regarding how wildlife collisions were considered in the Safety	  Analyses. 10. See	  FEIS	  Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments for	  a description of	  the mitigation measures and environmental commitments including	  mitigation for vegetation and wildlife. 11. While the majority of the wetlands in the area	  are have relatively low vegetative diversity	  they	  still provide varying levels of wildlife habitat and	  hydraulic functions such sediment	  and toxicant	  removal for	  roadway runoff, agricultural runoff	  and development	  and residential runoff. Mitigation measures for wetland impacts are described 	  in 	  Ch 	  9, 	  Environmental	  Commitments. There is currently no	  formal stormwater treatment	  system along US-‐95. The action alternatives will involve providing stormwater collection and treatment	  per	  NPDES regulations. The action alternatives will address stormwater	  and collect	  and  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  Club, the Palouse Environmental Sustainability Coalition, the Green	  Sanctuary Committee, plus other organizations and	  individuals are trying to preserve native Palouse Prairie soil, plants, wildlife, and water sources. The	  E-‐2	  route would bisect a	  proposed	  Palouse prairie restoration	  site that is meant to be contiguous with a large and important natural prairie ecosystem on	  Paradise Ridge. C-‐3	  would result in fewer deer, elk, moose, people and vehicular collisions, injuries, and deaths than E2. C-‐3	  would pass through poor to marginal ungulate habitat, but E-‐2	  would be routed through 4.4	  acres of moderate ungulate habitat. The chances	  of vehicular collisions and slaughter of both drivers and	  large wildlife would	  thus be increased	  along	  E-‐2. E-‐2	  would also harm smaller wildlife. E-‐2	  would take out 4.0 acres of pines and	  associated	  habitat necessary to	  sustain	  lizards, nuthatches, and	  bats, such	  as, the northern	  alligator lizard, the pygmy nuthatch, and	  the long-‐eared myotis bat. C-‐3	  would not impact these areas. C-‐3	  would damage fewer wetlands than E-‐2. These local	  wetlands 	  are 	  needed 	  for 	  aquatic 	  plant 	  and wildlife survival and for flood control. The wetlands need	  to	  be left alone and	  unpolluted. C-‐3	  would flush less polluted run-‐off into	  local streams and	  wetlands because it will follow	  the current highway roadbed for	  a longer	  distance than E-‐2. C-‐3	  would require less new construction with waterimpervious 	  surfacing 	  than 	  E-‐2. Conclusion:  treat	  stormwater	  per	  regulatory requirements. Additional information	  regarding the avoidance, minimization and compensatory mitigation of wetlands has been	  added	  to	  the FEIS Section	  4.6.  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  From the	  foregoing listing of socio-‐economic, safety, and environmental concerns, the committee's	  preference for the C-‐3	  alternative is obvious. The committee hopes that the ITD will do	  the right	  thing: cancel the more destructive to people, wildlife, plant life, prairie and	  aquatic ecosystems, the	  E-‐2	  route; and choose the less harmful, C-‐3	  alternative.

I have made several comments on the following 2 pages which supplement my February 18 letter. I	  remind 	  the 	  ITD 	  that 	  the 	  judicial	  decision 	  on 	  this project in	  2003 noted	  the failure of ITD to	  work together with the	  natural resource	  agencies. Looking	  at what correspondence	  is presented in the	  DEIS, and also the comments in the Department of the Interior's letter	  of	  February 22, 2013, it	  appears  ITD 	  has 	  met 	  with 	  agencies 	  to 	  discuss 	  project 	  impacts and discuss mitigation 	  strategies.	  	  Additional	  mitigation measures may be expressed in a MOU. Mitigation measures are summarized in the FEIS Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments. The purpose of the FEIS	  document is to make corrections, provide additional information, address substantive public	  comments, discuss	  mitigation measures and also to identify the Preferred Alternative of the Agency. The FEIS is an	  appropriate method	  for addressing	  your concerns and other public and agency concerns. A Supplemental EIS is	  not required at	  this time. The FEIS document	  will be made available to all interested 	  parties, 	  agencies 	  with 	  jurisdiction 	  and persons and	  agencies that provided	  comments. INTERSECTIONS:	  There 	  are 	  no 	  plans 	  to 	  include 	  a 	  stop light 	  or 	  grade 	  separated 	  overpass on	  the north	  intersection 	  of 	  Old 	  US-‐95	  and proposed US-‐95	  on the E2	  Alternative.

As we have pointed	  out in	  previous correspondence (and the Dept. of	  Interior	  has pointed out	  in their	  letter), 	  the 	  DEIS 	  (and 	  also 	  the 	  Guide 	  to 	  the 	  DEIS) have severe shortcomings. Inconsistencies, lack of data, and	  a biased	  or selective presentation of	  data all have	  led to problems in the	  ability of both the	  public and	  decision	  makers reaching an	  informed	  decision. I repeat the suggestion	  I have made previously that a Supplemental EIS is needed	  to	  properly present this information. Once the	  data	  are	  unambiguously presented in an unbiased manner, the decision process can proceed. Simply responding to comments in a Final EIS would stifle informed 	  public 	  comment. Thank you for consideration of these comments. Stephan Flint Copies: EPA	  Region	  10 EPA Boise Office ID 	  Department 	  of 	  Fish 	  and 	  Game ID 	  DEQ,	  Lewiston US Fish & Wildlife Service, Boise Scott W. Reed, Attorney − INTERSECTIONS:	  If 	  E2 	  is 	  constructed,	  the 	  amount 	  of turning traffic at	  the intersection with North Old US 95	  (immediately south	  of Moscow) will have an	  estimated 1450 turning	  vehicles per day (Appendix C4 of Safety Technical Report). This seems to	  be a substantial number of turning events	  for an uncontrolled	  intersection, especially given	  that this  accommodate	  turning	  traffic including	  grain trucks and large 	  delivery 	  trucks.	  At least one traffic signal warrant must be met in accordance with Chapter 4C of the MUTCD before a traffic signal would be considered. The reason safety predictions at intersections seem skewed is	  because the Safety Performance Function equations in	  the Highway Safety Manual do	  not use a linear 	  equation 	  for 	  predicted 	  crashes 	  and 	  the 	  volume of traffic. More details about the specific equations used	  to	  calculate crashes can	  be found	  on	  pages 9-‐11	  in the Revised Safety Analysis-‐AASHTO Highway	  Safety	  Manual Analysis. Predicted ADTs are	  different on the	  remaining US-‐95	  Loop for the	  different alternatives in the	  revised safety analysis. The	  predicted ADT’s can be	  found in Appendix C	  and	  E of the Revised	  Safety Analysis (ITD, 2013). General Response Safety-‐3	  provides information regarding the updated Safety Analysis, which considers the remaining sections of	  US-‐95. The worksheets have also been made	  more	  legible	  in this report. CALCULATING ACCIDENT NUMBERS: The method	  that you have used	  to	  calculate crashes does not follow the methods in the AASHTO Highway Safety Manual. The analyses supporting	  the	  DEIS	  and FEIS	  use	  the	  AASHTO Highway Safety Manual Methods to calculating accident numbers. This is the	  approved method for ITD and FHWA projects. BIG GAME AND SAFETY: See General Response Safety-‐2	  regarding how wild animal crashes were considered in the Safety Analyses. The fencing recommendation is a necessary component of the crossings and	  was added	   #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  turning traffic includes grain trucks etc. going to Primeland and will also include	  large	  delivery trucks servicing building supply, welding, and other businesses on	  North	  Old	  95. Are there any plans for a	  stoplight or overpass at this intersection? In 	  reviewing 	  the 	  accidents	  calculated for intersections 	  (Tables 	  6 	  and 	  7), 	  it 	  appears 	  the numbers shown	  for intersections do	  not correlate with the expected ADT (from Appendix C. 4); rather the accident	  numbers appear	  inflated for	  C3 intersections 	  and 	  deflated 	  for 	  E2 	  intersections. Specifically, for the	  C3-‐North Old 95 intersection, 0.2	  accidents are predicted per year. For E2, 0.4	  accidents per year are	  predicted despite	  the	  fact the ADT is nearly three times that	  of	  the C3 intersection.	  A 	  logical	  predicted 	  accident 	  number for E2-‐Old North 95 would be 0.6 accidents per year. How was the lower number calculated? − Other intersections have similar problems. For C3, Eid, Clyde and Cameron roads have 0.3, 0.2, and 0.2	  accidents per year, respectively. Yet these	  intersections 	  have one fifth	  or less the ADT of other intersections 	  with 	  0.2 	  estimates.	  Clearly 	  they 	  should be 0.1 or less. How were these numbers determined? (The worksheets provided	  on	  the CD are	  in part illegible, especially in what appears to be	  the most	  important	  part	  where there is a color background.) − I	  also 	  take 	  issue 	  with 	  the 	  ADT 	  predicted 	  for 	  the South Old 95	  intersection. Identical ADT	  values  to the FEIS Chapter 9, Environmental Commitments. Descriptions of the different wildlife reports are described	  in	  the DEIS Sections 1.1, 3.8 and	  4.8. The information 	  has 	  been 	  further 	  clarified 	  in 	  the 	  respective sections	  of the FEIS. WETLANDS: The Report (Gilmore, 2006) that was referenced	  was an	  early draft report and is not a	  technical report to the	  DEIS. Instead one comprehensive report was prepared that	  incorporated the functional assessment	  information 	  with 	  the 	  wetland 	  delineation.	  The comprehensive report	  received a jurisdictional determination	  from the USACE following a field	  review in 	  2012 	  and 	  was 	  circulated 	  with 	  the 	  DEIS 	  for 	  public comment. The calculations	  of wetland impacts	  were based	  on	  the final determinations following that review. During the development of the	  Wetland Report and	  the DEIS development, it was discovered	  that	  some of	  the polygons for	  some wetlands were duplicated, resulting in	  duplicate calculations of impacts 	  for 	  some 	  impacts.	  	  Therefore, 	  the 	  impacts were recalculated and reflected in 	  the 	  DEIS.	  	  The 	  new, more recent report also provides information regarding new USACE Arid	  West Supplement for wetland	  delineation	  and	  Rapanos guidance.  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  (500)	  are shown for	  both C3 and E2 (Appendix C.4). However, much more traffic will be using the South Old 95 intersection under the E2 alignment, including 	  some 	  traffic 	  from 	  Eid 	  Road 	  and 	  all	  southbound traffic	  from residences	  probably up to and past Cameron Road.	  As noted above, Eid, North Clyde, and	  Cameron	  Roads will all directly intersect the new C3 alignment. Only	  a	  very	  limited amount of traffic would	  still be using the shorter section	  of Old 95 if C3 is built. I believe the ADT for this intersection 	  would 	  be 	  considerably 	  higher 	  than 	  500 with the E2 alignment. − CALCULATING ACCIDENT NUMBERS: − Here I elaborate on	  what I discussed	  in	  my previous letter.	  Using 	  the 	  corrected 	  calculations 	  above, 	  the accidents for C3	  decrease	  to 10.5	  and those	  on E2	  increase 	  to 	  7.9.	  When 	  we 	  add 	  in 	  run-‐off-‐the road accidents on Old 95	  based on the	  ADT	  values for Old 95 if E2 is built, the corridor accident number under E2 increases to	  8.4. (See my previous letter for	  a discussion of	  why accidents should be considered on a corridor basis.) When we add in the additional animal-‐related accidents (using an estimate	  from Stakehouse	  Hill	  data), 	  the 	  E2 accident number becomes 11.4	  per year, clearly surpassing the estimated accidents	  on C3. If the additional accidents on E2	  caused by the	  more	  severe weather at this	  higher elevation (acknowledged by all the locals I talk to but	  ignored by ITD) 	  are 	  factored 	  in,	  E2 	  becomes 	  even 	  less 	  safe.  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  Note that I have been unable to find documentation of elevation	  differences between	  the alignments; elevation data	  presented in Fig	  2 (Community Impact 	  Report,	  Environmental	  Justice 	  Section) 	  are meaningless as they are	  identical for all alignments. − Big Game and	  Safety: − Clearly ITD went "consultant shopping" in	  an	  attempt to downplay the	  prevalence	  of big	  game	  along	  the	  E2	  alignment. (Note	  that the	  Department of Interior letter also	  asks how the different studies were reconciled, as this is not evident in the DEIS.) The DEIS	  (Ungulate Effects section beginning on p169) cites the work of Sawyer (2010) which	  rates the habitat	  along this route only "moderate" at	  best. Here the DEIS ignores both	  the work of Melquist (a detailed	  habitat map	  and	  a discussion	  of animal movements) along	  with the	  anecdotal evidence	  provided by local residents -‐-‐game	  trails, sign, and sightings. − In 	  Appendix 	  B3 	  of 	  the 	  Safety 	  report,	  discussing deer-‐vehicle collisions, it clearly	  states, "The only	  widely accepted method with solid evidence of effectiveness is well-‐designed	  and	  maintained	  fencing, combined with underpasses or	  overpasses as appropriate." Given the	  recommendation of Melquist and this clear statement in the DEIS	  supporting documentation, it is	  difficult to see the justification 	  for 	  the 	  proposed 	  clear-‐zone method recommended for	  E2 and ignoring the  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  recommendation of	  fencing with underpasses. − Wetlands: − The Department of Interior letter (see p. 2	  of their letter) questions how a decrease in	  wetland	  acreage (impacted by the E2 alignment)	  occurred between the 2006 field work and the current	  2012 document	  which is included as supplemental material with the DEIS. I agree. I am puzzled as to what happened as the Wetland	  Technical report states, "No	  wetland	  determinations made in	  the original 2004 through	  2005	  work would be affected by the changes in the delineation	  guidelines." This needs explanation. − #  L-‐70  Mary − Palouse	  Ridge	  Defense Coalition  Ullrich  Paradise	  Ridge Defense Coalition P.O.

State Street Boise, Idaho	  83707-‐1129 − Dear Mr. Rush, Thank you for the extension of the comment period regarding the Idaho Transportation Department's  The DEIS	  was widely distributed to the public and agencies as described in FEIS	  Chapter 7, Public Involvement and Agency Coordination. The	  DEIS	  must have detailed	  analysis of significant effects of the alternatives while 	  still	  being 	  presented 	  in 	  plain language.	  	  Unfortunately, 	  this 	  results 	  in 	  lengthy 	  and detailed	  technical reports. We appreciate the Paradise Ridge Defense Council’s and all of the public’s careful study of the DEIS and value each of the public’s comments. ITD and FHWA have given serious	  consideration to the Paradise Ridge Defense Council’s substantive comments	  with equal consideration to all other substantive public and	  agency comments. The DEIS	  discloses that the E-‐2	  Alternative is 	  similar 	  to the 10A alternative that	  was evaluated in the EA. The EIS	  for US-‐95	  Thorncreek Road to Moscow began with  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  (ITD)	  Thorn Creek to Moscow Highway 95 realignment	  project. Because of	  this, individuals, agencies, and Paradise	  Ridge Defense Coalition (PRDC)	  partners have been able to adequately invest 	  the 	  time 	  and 	  energy necessary for careful study and analysis	  of the U.S. 95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow Draft	  Environmental Impact	  Statement (DEIS)	  and Section 4(f)	  Evaluation (DEIS), which is relatively inaccessible to the public due to its length, 	  vast 	  scope, 	  and 	  detail. Individuals,	  agencies,	  and 	  members 	  of 	  the 	  coalition have made a sincere effort to	  gain	  a complete understanding of the DEIS	  and all its essential components	  that should contribute to selecting the most responsible choice of a new alignment for U.S. Highway 95. Careful analysis, accompanied by accurate	  citation of experts' studies in the	  DEIS, continually	  reveals	  that the E-‐2	  alternative	  is not the best	  or	  most	  responsible of	  the three possible alignments. As these individuals, agencies, and	  partners in	  the coalition have spent hours	  conscientiously	  reading hundreds of pages in	  the DEIS, we are expecting ITD to read and consider	  all the comments that	  they have thoroughly presented. Carefully prepared	  comments	  from agencies, such as	  the U.S. Department of the Interior Office of Environmental Policy and Compliance, the	  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the	  Idaho Departmentof Fish and Game, partners in the	  PRDC, such as the	  Palouse	  Group of the	  Sierra	  Club, and individual members of the PRDC, such as Stephan Flint, David  the Notice of	  Intent	  on November	  13, 2003. One of	  the requirements of	  NEPA is that	  a range of	  reasonable alternatives to fulfill the	  purpose	  and need be	  evaluated in the	  DEIS. There	  is no requirement to exclude	  reasonable	  alternatives because	  they had been previously considered	  as part of a separate study. During the DEIS, the E-‐2	  Alternative was one of the alternatives reviewed by the public during the first	  and second stages	  of the screening process. The rationale for	  forwarding it	  for	  detailed analysis in the DEIS and for	  identifying it	  as ITD's Preferred Alternative is summarized in the DEIS and FEIS Section 2.6. See	  General Response	  Agency regarding the	  difference	  in 	  opinion 	  regarding 	  ITD's 	  Preferred 	  Alternative.	  	  For clarification, the USACE has	  not chosen a preferred alternative	  at this time. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process provides public involvement opportunities during	  the	  development of the Environmental Impact Statement. Providing publications and materials to the	  general public is one method	  of reaching out to	  the public and	  encouraging	  their involvement. See	  General Response	  Displacement-‐1	  and Displacement-‐2	  regarding clarification of the displacements and	  impacts to	  businesses and residences. The residential and business impacts in the DEIS	  were based	  on	  conceptual level detail. The impacts were evaluated in greater detail after the	  hearing	  and clarified in the FEIS to distinguish between impacts	  and potential impacts but are based	  on	  conceptual level information.	  	  Exact 	  displacements 	  will	  be 	  determined  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  Hall, and AI Poplawski all deserve serious consideration by	  ITD. Due to the history of ITD's previous handling of public and	  agency input, we cannot help	  but be skeptical about the sincerity of ITD in truly considering input from agencies, coalition groups, and individuals. To begin with, before	  any public input, 	  the 	  first 	  map 	  of 	  the 	  U.S.	  Highway 	  95 	  corridor in 	  consideration 	  of 	  a 	  new 	  alignment 	  between Genesee and Moscow, published in January 2000, already showed, among	  11	  possible	  routes, E-‐2	  (then called 10A)	  as "ITD's Proposed Route." This alignment was determined by a	  small, unrepresentative "focus group" selected by ITD. Because ITD was required	  by law to	  offer the public at least one	  alternative	  besides their "proposed route," ITD determined that	  widening current	  U.S. Highway 95 would be the other alternative. In addition, the	  Environmental Assessment Appendix, May 2002, page 4, states, On July 12, 2001, a third Merger meeting was held in 	  Lewiston, 	  where 	  participants 	  reviewed 	  the revised Environmental Matrix (Table A-‐3). Participants discussed the	  prior meeting decision to carry	  forward Alternative 6 (current U.S. Highway 95), 10A (current E-‐2),	  and No¬ Action. The meeting concluded with participants	  agreeing to add Alternative 4 (close to	  current C-‐3) back into the decision	  process, as a "compromise" between	  Alternatives 6 and	  10A. After this meeting, ITD evaluated the project schedule delay	  implications of bringing Alternative 4 back into	  the Merger  during design	  when	  detailed	  topographic, geotechnical and design detail is available. See	  the	  General Response Displacement-‐1	  and Displacement-‐2	  for clarification of displacement information. See	  the	  General Response	  Safety-‐6	  regarding the significance of the differences	  in length and safety between	  alternatives. FHWA and ITD intend to fully comply with the	  NEPA process which	  includes considering and	  addressing all substantive comments	  received during the DEIS public	  comment period. Each comment has	  been read and considered and responses provided as appropriate. Where necessary, additional information, corrections, clarification or mitigations	  have been provided in the FEIS. General Response Schedule describes the next steps in the environmental process and the anticipated schedule.  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  discussion	  and	  decided	  to	  recommend	  to	  the Merger Agencies an action to mitigate the natural environment impacts of Alternative	  10A. After ITD was told	  by court order in	  2003 that their own	  regulations required	  that they conduct a full environmental impact statement (EIS) for the	  construction of a highway	  along a new right-‐of-‐way,	  ITD 	  went 	  to 	  the 	  general	  public 	  to 	  solicit 	  input. 	  ITD held	  public 	  workshops 	  whereby 	  hundreds 	  of concerned citizens	  came in good faith and worked together	  many hours over	  the course of	  several days to	  determine compromise alignments. Thereafter, ITD trimmed down the alternatives suggested through these workshops	  to the three¬ alignments currently under consideration. ITD then proceeded	  to	  conduct a full EIS. Ten	  years later, ITD continued to present its	  "preferred alternative"	  as	  E-‐2. Was all that public and agency input really seriously considered? After carefully examining 	  the 	  very 	  inadequate 	  DEIS and taking	  into account a	  serious lack of data	  and misrepresentation of data, the evidence favoring E2	  disappears. The DEIS	  Wildlife Technical Report, "Final Review of Wildlife Mitigation for the Thorn Creek-‐Moscow Highway Development Project (U.S. 95)" prepared by William C. Ruediger, September 2007, states, "Several resource agencies have indicated 	  that 	  their 	  'preferred 	  alternative' 	  is 	  the center route...The resource agencies	  involved in the project include Idaho	  Department of Fish	  and	  Game (IFG), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps)." It appears that	  ITD did not	  seriously consider	  input	  from agencies and experts. One	  more	  concern is the	  damage	  and control of public opinion	  due to	  the misinformation	  and	  biased	  selective presentation	  of information	  in	  ITD's "Guide to the Environmental Impact Statement"	  brochure. For most people this brochure was the only information	  that guided their comments and opinion	  of the best alignment. Not many people read the full EIS due to its great	  length and often confusing detail. The biased presentation of pros	  and cons in ITD's brochure	  undoubtedly influenced public opinion. On	  page 10, the pros for	  E-‐2	  are presented	  first with	  the shortcomings hidden	  at the end, while	  on page	  9, shortcomings (some	  of which were just not true) of C-‐3	  come first and the advantages are	  hidden at the	  end. In the	  ITD brochure, page 9, "C-‐3: The CentraI Alternative", it states, C-‐3	  "would displace eight businesses". At the hearing the Right-‐of-‐Way experts stated that in fact "No businesses	  will be displaced and the widening of current Hwy 95 would	  have no	  effect beyond	  a potential noise increase".	  The 	  Right-‐of-‐Way experts also said that E-‐2	  would displace the most residents because of issues with	  a displaced	  well and	  that ITD had	  decided	  to	  relocate all of the residences in	  the mobile park and a house above the park on Eid Rd. They further stated that C-‐3	  would displace only 1	  residence. This information makes 2 points ITD made against C-‐3	  untrue!

This borders on	  criminal! Because of our concern	  that input from important agencies and the	  public has not previously been seriously considered and incorporated into ITD's	  decision-‐making process for this project, we request to know in some detail the process by which ITD plans to	  read	  and	  act on	  the many carefully presented	  comments sent	  to ITD.

So one	  ends up asking: What corporate	  logos are	  you wearing	  on your hard hats?

Why do you keep shopping for	  "experts"	  who tell you what you want to hear?	  What's behind Idaho Department of Transportation's preference for the E-‐2	  alternative, years ago the 10A alternative, because it's not data (or	  common sense)? (And another	  thing one wonders: if	  preventing accidents were	  truly a	  priority, why didn't IDOT	  reduce the speed limit	  and/or	  put	  up warning lights on	  that curvy section	  of 95 decades ago? That would have been a no-‐brainer temporary solution.) The City of Moscow prefers the C-‐3	  alternative. The Idaho 	  Fish 	  and 	  Game 	  Department 	  and 	  US Environmental Protection	  Agency and	  Fish	  and	  Wildlife Service are opposed to the E-‐2	  route. Your DEIS	  statement is flawed and draws false conclusions. I offer the following:  Schedule	  for the	  anticipated schedule. FHWA and ITD have	  identified the	  E-‐2	  Alternative as their	  Preferred Alternative based on	  the ability to	  meet the project	  purpose and need as well as balancing human	  and	  natural environmental considerations. FHWA and ITD are	  not catering to corporations. The	  project is intended	  to	  benefit all travelers including the local	  population, 	  regional travelers and freight movement. The NEPA process does not preclude using alternatives because	  they were	  included in the	  previous Environmental Assessment. See General Response Alternative. Paradise	  Ridge is 	  an 	  important 	  local	  resource. It	  is privately owned	  with	  more than	  50 commercial and	  residential developments. Access to Paradise Ridge would be Expressway Access Control, which would limit development along the highway as described	  in	  General Response Access. The DEIS	  Section 1.1 describes the different	  wildlife technical reports and explains why multiple wildlife studies	  were completed. A	  regarding making safety improvement 	  over 	  the 	  last 10	  years, ITD has a	  Statewide Transportation Investment 	  Program,	  which considers	  how funding would be allocated based on state and regional priorities. Improving this section	  of US-‐95	  has been ITD District 2’s first priority. See General Response Safety-‐4	  regarding smaller	  safety improvements on US-‐95.

For clarification	  of your statements, E-‐2	  is shorter than C-‐3.  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  E-‐2	  has a	  longer length at a	  higher elevation =	  worse winter driving conditions. E-‐2	  crosses more	  deer corridors	  and cuts	  deer off from 4 ponds = more collisions. E-‐2	  crosses through better ungulate habitat = more collisions. E-‐2	  crosses more water courses =	  more wetlands impact. E-‐2	  requires more and deeper cuts and fills 	  and more culverts =	  more costly. E-‐2	  would displace 5	  or more residences (C-‐3, one) =	  more disruption to citizens. E-‐2	  creates more new impervious surfaces =	  more pollutant runoff near farmland.	  E-‐2	  takes more prime farmland out of production.

Lyon  February 19, 2013 − Adam Rush, Public Involvement Coordinator  1. The access for rural residents using existing US-‐95	  was evaluated and will function similarly as it does today including for	  residents on Eid Road. The existing  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  ITD 	  Office 	  of 	  Communications 3311	  W. State Street, Boise, ID 83707 − RE: Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) and Section 4(f) Evaluation US-‐95	  Thorncreek Road to Moscow. − Dear Mr. Rush, The following letter presents my	  comments on the recently released Draft	  Environmental Impact	  Statement (DEIS) for the	  Thorncreek Road to Moscow section of US Highway 95. I am concerned that	  the totality of	  environmental and social impacts 	  associated 	  with 	  the 	  E-‐2 route were not	  fully addressed in the	  DEIS. After a	  complete	  review of the DEIS and associated technical documents, I offer the following specific comments and	  concerns for	  your	  consideration: 1. Lack of access to the new highway for rural residents living along the route under the E-‐2	  alternative. As presented	  in	  the DEIS, the E-‐2	  route will leave the existing US-‐95	  corridor at the top of Reisenauer Hill and does not connect to it again until just immediately 	  outside 	  Moscow.	  This is 	  discussed 	  in numerous places throughout the DEIS as a positive attribute	  in that the	  number of "access points" to the highway will be reduced. This assumption doesn't address the impact this will have on	  rural residents living along the Thorncreek to Moscow corridor, specifically	  those residents	  from Eid Road north	  toward	  Moscow.  US-‐95	  loop will still be available for travel north and south and will allow accesses	  at the intersections	  with the new alignment. Existing US-‐95	  may be turned	  over to the NLHD but	  will have traffic volumes decrease by about 95	  to 97	  percent depending	  on the	  alternative; therefore it	  would have significantly fewer	  predicted crashes. Additionally	  the new alignments	  would be designed	  to	  AASHTO standards with	  additional lanes, a divided	  median,	  shoulders 	  and 	  other 	  design 	  elements that	  would improve safety over existing conditions. The information 	  is 	  included 	  in 	  the 	  revised 	  Safety 	  Analysis (ITD 2013)	  and included 	  throughout 	  the 	  FEIS.	  A Mobility and Road User Cost Study (ITD 2014a)	  was also prepared which addresses travel times and traveler	  costs within the project. The E-‐2	  Alternative would have improved travel times for most commuters, emergency response vehicles and school buses. This information	  has been	  incorporated	  into	  the FEIS	  Section 4.1. See	  General Response	  Maintenance2. Actual road	  elevations will be determined	  during final design. See	  General Response	  Safety -‐3	  regarding how safety of the existing US-‐95	  was considered in the revised Safety Analysis. See	  General Response	  Safety-‐5	  regarding Reisenauer Hill.	  See	  General Response	  Safety-‐2	  regarding wild animal crashes.	  See	  General Response	  Weather-‐3, Weather-‐4, and Weather-‐5	  regarding weather related safety.	  The Revised Safety Analysis also considers the use of  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  Table 9, found on page 59	  of the DEIS, indicates that over 1,200 people live along the Thorncreek to	  Moscow corridor. Nearly all of these rural residents use this route daily to commute to work, school, or other purposes. This accounts for potentially several thousand vehicle trips	  per day, at least. If the E-‐2	  alternative is constructed, nearly all of these vehicles will continue to traverse the old US-‐95	  route. Very few people, if 	  any, 	  will	  backtrack 	  the several miles	  required southward to the top of Reisenauer Hill to enter	  the new highway. For	  someone like me, who lives	  on Eid Road, backtracking would	  effectively make the 5-‐mile trip to Moscow a 7 or	  8 mile trip. In addition, emergency services,	  school 	  buses,	  garbage collection services, and mail delivery, among many	  others, will all be under the same conditions. So, while elimination of all county road access points along	  the	  E-‐2	  alternative sounds good and allows ITD 	  to 	  tout 	  the 	  preferred 	  alternative 	  as 	  the 	  safest,	  it provides absolutely no	  benefit to	  those local residents who rely on this route to travel to work and school every single	  day. I	  feel	  ITD 	  must 	  go 	  back 	  through 	  the DEIS and reevaluate all conclusions they've reached as they relate to impacts associated with removal of	  all county	  road access	  points	  from the E-‐2	  route. One such example can be found with nearly the entire second paragraph on page 141 of the DEIS. In this paragraph	  ITD states that the preferred	  alternative would "benefit" residents along Eid Road by, "...improving the safety of US-‐95	  and improving  existing	  US-‐95	  in the modeling. The information has also been revised in the	  associated technical reports. As you	  stated, the two	  access points for the E-‐2	  Alternative would	  be the intersections of the new and	  existing	  US-‐95	  alignments. Since the existing US-‐95	  may be turned over to the NLHD, it would be part of the county road system. The design details and specific elevation of the bridge structure cannot be determined until detailed geotechnical and survey	  data	  is available	  for design. This will be available during the design process. Additional information	  regarding visual impacts 	  has been	  provided	  in	  the FEIS Section	  4.11. ITD 	  will	  work 	  closely 	  with 	  farmers 	  and 	  other landowners 	  during 	  the 	  design 	  process 	  to 	  ensure 	  that farm equipment	  and other	  vehicles can pass through safely. The noise analysis 	  was 	  completed 	  using 	  FHWA 	  Noise Abatement Criteria, which	  is the approved	  methodology for predicting and modeling noise impacts.	  	  See 	  FEIS 	  Section 	  3.12 	  and 	  4.12 	  for 	  additional	  clarifications	  and corrections	  regarding noise impacts	  in the Hidden Village	  and Benson Mobile	  Home	  parks.	  See the FEIS Chapter	  4.1 for	  a clarification of	  the impacts to the Hidden Village and Benson Mobile Home Parks. The Community Impact Assessments was not prepared by the Citizens for a Safe Highway US 95 Group but was prepared	  by an	  independent consultant who	  obtained	  data from many sources and	  conducted	  interviews from a diverse population of	  community members, realtors, residents, businesses,	  government 	  agencies,	  and others as described in the DEIS and FEIS Sections  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  highway access and	  mobility," by "...reducing commute times	  and facilitating more efficient access	  to services,"	  and through "Ingress	  and egress	  of vehicles, including emergency response units… by the use of a turn	  bay." These are all absolutely incorrect.	  Access 	  for 	  residents 	  living 	  along 	  Eid 	  Road, and really all rural residents living	  in the	  corridor, will not benefit under the preferred alternative. Essentially, nothing will change regarding our ability to travel back and forth to Moscow. The "turn bay" discussed	  in	  this section	  will be located	  several miles away from	  the mobile home parks at the	  top of Reisenauer Hill.	  How does this benefit residents along	  Eid Road?	  How will it reduce	  our travel times?	  We will all primarily be driving the old US-‐95	  route that	  doesn't	  meet	  the AASHTO standards and	  has been	  identified	  as having some of the highest accident rates in State	  of Idaho (Table	  31	  found on page 131 of the DEIS). How does the E-‐2	  alternative make traveling this route safer for us? Another example of an	  incorrect finding regarding access	  can be found in the second to last paragraph on	  page 140 which	  states the C-‐3	  alternative would "...improve the highway access	  for all users	  but to a lesser 	  extent 	  compared 	  to 	  the 	  E-‐2	  and W-‐4	  alternatives." I believe	  this statement to be	  incorrect.	  Under the C-‐3	  alternative, access to the new US-‐95	  route would actually be provided for rural residents living along Eid Road. This is not	  provided	  in	  the E-‐2	  alternative as Eid Road is bypassed	  via an	  overpass. Therefore, access to	  rural residents would clearly be	  better under the	  C-‐3	   3.1.2, Methodology. The general trends regarding property value impacts were determined with input from realtors, government agencies and others. While	  there	  could be	  indirect effects to property values as a	  result of the	  road location, 	  the 	  purpose 	  and 	  need 	  of 	  the 	  project, 	  to improve 	  safety and capacity for all users will benefit property owners as well as the general travelling public. The referenced sentence on page 45	  of the DEIS	  which explains why the	  E-‐2	  Alternative was forwarded was correct. The E-‐2	  Alternative in this section is being compared to the other Eastern Corridor Alternatives	  that	  were evaluated early in the scoping and screening process. It was not comparing the DEIS Action Alternatives that were forwarded	  for detailed	  study. Therefore, the statements about the E-‐2	  Alternative having less impact to	  wetland	  and	  rare plant populations were valid. The rare plant communities that are referenced in the statement refer to those identified	  in	  the Vegetation	  Technical Report and therefore are accurate. While some wetlands may have rare plant communities, these wetlands	  are not known to fit that category. The DEIS does	  describe in Chapter 9, Indirect and Cumulative	  Effects,	  that 	  the 	  E-‐2	  Alternative would be closer to	  more Palouse remnants and	  rare plant communities	  compared to the other alternatives. See General Response Weeds and Wildlife. Additional information 	  has 	  been 	  added 	  to 	  the 	  FEIS 	  regarding Palouse	  remnants, the	  ecological function of CRP	  land, the giant	  Palouse earthworm, restoration projects,  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  alternative	  not E-‐2. Table 53	  of the DEIS	  (page 176) indicates that there are	  supposed to be	  2	  county road access points along	  the	  E-‐2	  route, however, these two access points do	  not show up	  on	  any of the maps in	  the DEIS. I can only assume those depict where E-‐2	  leaves 	  and 	  reenters 	  with 	  the 	  current 	  US-‐95	  corridor? If so, I find that to be highly	  misleading as	  these locations are not	  truly "county road" access points, at least not yet, and	  some readers may believe access to	  the E-‐2	  route will actually be provided	  via existing county roads when	  it will not be. Along these same lines, the last paragraph	  of page 176	  states that "shortened travel times"	  could benefit "...emergency service response, school access, bicyclists/pedestrians,	  and 	  mail 	  delivery." 	  I	  believe all of these statements to	  be incorrect, at least 	  as 	  they 	  relate 	  to 	  the 	  rural	  residents 	  that 	  live along	  the	  Thorncreek to Moscow route. As mentioned above, there will	  be 	  no 	  improvement what-‐so-‐ever in these services	  or in travel times	  under the E-‐2	  alternatives as there will be no convenient access	  to the route from rural locations. In 	  some 	  cases,	  especially 	  with 	  emergency 	  services,	  the E-‐2	  alternative could actually result in increased travel times. 2. I believe the reflection of proposed accident rates are misleading and do not	  accurately reflect	  travel patterns created if	  the E-‐2	  alternative is constructed. I	  have 	  concerns 	  with 	  how 	  ITD has presented	  and	   noise impacts 	  to 	  birds 	  and 	  other 	  wildlife, 	  and 	  indirect and cumulative	  effects. CRP land	  is a voluntary program on	  private lands with no	  assurance of long-‐term preservation.  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  utilized	  the crash	  data in	  the DEIS. The Safety section (3.10.3) on page 111 states	  that, "Safety issues 	  within 	  the 	  study 	  area 	  relate 	  primarily 	  to 	  the road geometry and access onto the roadway." I'm curious	  how ITD has	  determined that "access	  to the roadway" is a primary safety issue 	  based 	  on 	  the data presented	  in	  this section? On	  the following page of the DEIS, Table 29 and	  30 list specifics on	  crash data for the past ten years	  (2002-‐2012). Table 29	  indicates there were 220	  total crashes along the Thorncreek to Moscow route over the last ten years. While Table 30 indicates that 22 of those crashes	  or (10%) were "intersection related."	  Of the five crash factors or	  types presented in Table 30 (wildlife, intersection related, head-‐on, negotiating a	  curve, and weather), intersection related is followed only by head-‐on	  as the least likely factor or type of	  crash. Why then does ITD downplay the significance of wildlife and weather related accidents in the	  Safety Technical Report and focus on	  one of the least likely crash	  types as a driver for the study? ITD 	  states 	  in 	  several	  locations 	  throughout 	  the 	  DEIS that	  the E-‐2	  route will have the lowest potential crash rate of the three action alternatives. This	  finding is based on a safety analysis conducted by ITD 	  and 	  reported 	  in 	  the 	  2012 	  Safety 	  Technical	  Report. However, what this analysis fails to	  take into 	  account 	  is 	  that 	  the 	  E-‐2	  alternative will effectively eliminate	  most all rural traffic (those	  folks living north of	  Eid 	  Road) 	  from 	  utilizing 	  the 	  new highway. Those rural residents who	  drive back and	   #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  forth to Moscow on the old US-‐95	  route every single day will still be experiencing the narrow shoulders, inadequate corners, and 60 (or so) of the 66	  access points. Even those	  that choose	  to drive	  south to actually utilize the new highway (as	  proposed	  in	  E-‐2), will still have to traverse the majority of Reisenauer Hill to do so. Reisenauer	  Hill is 	  one 	  of 	  the 	  most 	  dangerous 	  parts 	  of 	  the 	  existing route. The presentation	  of crash	  data throughout the DEIS, both	  the numbers of potential future crashes and	  the fatalities associated with them, is misleading and not truly representative	  of what construction of the E-‐2	  alternative will result in. These predictions	  must be tempered with the fact that all current issues 	  and 	  concerns 	  associated 	  with 	  the 	  no 	  action alternative	  will continue	  to be	  a	  problem under this alternative. Therefore, I feel in order to truly predict potential crashes and	  fatalities associated	  with any of the action	  alternatives, but especially E-‐2, ITD must also include an analysis of the future predicted	  crashes and	  fatalities along the old	  US highway route associated	  with	  rural residential use. These figures must then be added to those predicted	  for the action	  alternatives to	  get a true sense of what the safety impacts 	  will	  be 	  for 	  all	  people who	  use this travel route. This is important as the	  historical data	  includes everyone, not just those that	  drive through from Moscow to Genesee, Lewiston, or other points south. 3. There is very little specific information provided in 	  the 	  DEIS, 	  or 	  associated 	  technical	  reports, 	  on 	  the  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  elevation of the	  E-‐2	  alternative as it crosses Eid Road	  or the design	  of the overpass. There is no discussion of	  the style and kind of	  overpass structure that is proposed	  to	  be built over Eid Road. Nor can I find anywhere within the DEIS	  how high	  the finished	  roadway will be as it crosses Eid Road and as it heads north from there. I live immediately 	  east 	  of 	  the 	  proposed	  overpass along Eid Road and can attest to the level and type of traffic Eid Road handles. It	  is very common during the spring and late summer/fall months to see large wheel tractors, combines, grain trucks, and large loaded 	  trucks 	  of 	  hay 	  traveling 	  from farm ground	  to	  the east	  and west	  of	  the proposed E-‐2	  alignment to and from US-‐95. These vehicles are all extremely tall and will likely not	  easily fit	  under	  a standard height highway overpass. I'm concerned	  that the E2	  alternative will effectively create a barrier	  to agricultural equipment movement up and down Eid Road. Currently, fields on	  both	  sides of the preferred	  alternative location	  near Eid	  Road	  are farmed. The farmer	  is reliant	  upon moving his machinery up and down Eid Road to access his fields. How will this be accomplished if his agricultural machinery will not fit under the	  overpass structure planned	  for Eid	  Road? This could	  create a potential economic	  hardship and be a mobility issue as well. This is not currently addressed at all in the	  DEIS. The viewshed analysis presented in the DEIS	  and associated technical reports doesn't adequately address viewshed impacts to rural residents.  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  I	  live 	  along 	  Eid 	  Road 	  and 	  my 	  home 	  and 	  property 	  are located 	  immediately 	  east 	  of 	  the 	  proposed 	  E-‐2	  alignment. There is 	  absolutely 	  no 	  detailed discussion	  anywhere in	  the DEIS about the nature and scale	  of visual impacts 	  associated 	  with 	  the highway and	  overpass structure proposed	  for construction near my	  property. There is	  discussion regarding impacts to viewsheds 	  from 	  the 	  top 	  of Reisenauer Hill looking 	  north, 	  or 	  from 	  the 	  City 	  of Moscow looking south, but nothing regarding the very	  real adverse impacts to rural residents along	  Eid Road. My property and home have excellent uninterrupted views of the	  Palouse	  region to the	  west and south. The foreground of these significant viewsheds will be impacted by	  the planned overpass and	  associated	  elevated	  highway proposed	  through	  the E-‐2	  alignment. I consider this to be a serious long-‐term, adverse impact	  on the visual qualities associated with my	  property	  and home. The second	  paragraph	  on	  page 181 states "A	  new bridge at Eid	  Road	  would	  create a long-‐term visual effect to residences." This needs to be changed to a "major long-‐term negative visual impact 	  on 	  residents" 	  and 	  a 	  more 	  detailed 	  analysis of what these impacts are and	  how they will be mitigated by ITD presented. The noise effects analysis is not adequate	  and doesn't address noise concerns for rural residents. In 	  reviewing 	  the noise technical report	  referenced in 	  the 	  DEIS, 	  it 	  seems 	  seven 	  noise 	  receptors 	  were placed	  in	  the general vicinity of the E-‐2	  alignment as it 	  crosses 	  Eid 	  Road.	  However, 	  five 	  of 	  these 	  locations  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  were placed in spots that will be destroyed if the preferred	  alternative is constructed. Why were these receptors placed in locations that	  will "displaced"	  if the E-‐2	  alignment is constructed?	  This is 	  a 	  major 	  failing 	  in 	  the 	  noise 	  study 	  and 	  a 	  very convenient way	  to justify	  the following statement in the first	  paragraph on page 186 of	  the DEIS "The required and optional abatement	  measures were not considered	  feasible and	  reasonable for the impacted 	  receptors 	  which 	  were 	  not 	  displaced." 	  If the receptors had been placed in locations in the Eid Road vicinity that	  were not	  being "displaced," but will for sure be impacted	  by the noise generated from this elevated highway, perhaps the	  required abatement	  measures would be justified. In 	  addition,	  what 	  criteria 	  were 	  utilized 	  when locations 	  for 	  the 	  noise receptors were	  being	  installed 	  in 	  the 	  first 	  place? 	  If 	  the 	  preferred alternative	  is built, it will be	  an elevated highway across Eid Road. Depending	  upon the	  height of this highway, the roadway will likely result in	  major long-‐term negative noise related impacts on all residences living along the first	  mile or	  so of	  Eid Road. The noise impacts from this alternative are not limited	  to	  homes within	  300 feet of the centerline. Noise can travel great distances	  and drastically alter what is now a very quiet location. I see this	  as	  a major failing of the noise analysis	  presented	  in	  the DEIS and	  this should	  be adequately addressed and more	  thoroughly researched. Receptor locations must be selected	  based	  on	  where potential impacts from the preferred  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  alternative	  will be	  felt, not underneath the	  finished roadway. Impacts 	  to 	  community 	  cohesion 	  are 	  inaccurate 	  and not fully addressed	  in	  the DEIS and	  associated	  technical reports. Page	  six of the	  Community Impact Assessment Update technical report provides the following definition 	  for 	  the 	  community 	  cohesion 	  study: The community cohesion	  evaluation	  considers any changes	  in the pattern of social networking within a neighborhood	  or community, which	  includes splitting neighborhoods, isolating groups, generating	  new development, changing	  property values, or separating residents from community facilities. The community cohesion evaluation also includes 	  noise and	  visual impacts 	  from 	  a 	  project. The primary study cited throughout the Community Impact 	  Assessment technical reports regarding	  potential impacts to	  community cohesion	  was prepared	  by the Citizens for a Safe Highway 95 group. This group has shown strong public support for the E-‐2	  route, and I question whether any "studies" they have conducted can and should be viewed as	  unbiased. I also	  strongly question	  whether ITD should rely on the findings	  of any study produced by a special interest group	  for such	  a high	  profile project. I have lived	  in	  my home along Eid	  Road	  since 2006 and have never been contacted by any group (public or private) regarding	  my	  concerns, issues, 	  or 	  beliefs 	  about 	  any 	  of 	  the 	  action alternatives reviewed in this DEIS. My home	  is  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  immediately 	  east 	  of 	  the 	  overpass 	  structure proposed	  under the preferred	  alternative, and	  my only contact regarding	  this project has been several requests from ITD to grant	  permission for	  access to my property for project related studies. The findings presented	  by the Citizens for a Safe Highway 95 group certainly	  do not reflect my	  beliefs regarding	  this issue at	  all. I also question whether	  the Citizens for	  a Safe Highway 95 group are experts in the field of community cohesion	  studies, whether they utilized	  a scientifically valid	  study design, and	  if their	  methodology and findings will hold up in court. I	  also 	  question	  how the DEIS can	  state in	  the third	  paragraph	  on	  page 138 that "...none of the alternatives would cause	  a	  major disruption to community	  cohesion."	  The density	  of homes	  along the first	  mile or	  so of	  Eid Road makes it	  one, if	  not	  the most, densely occupied communities	  along the entire	  Thorncreek to Moscow route. This community	  is	  very	  quiet and has	  excellent uninterrupted	  views westward	  towards Pullman. Construction	  of the E-‐2	  alternative will remove five homes, impact numerous others, and	  effectively cut the community in two. Using the definition provided	  in	  the Community Impact Assessment, these are exactly the kind of	  issues the community cohesion study	  was	  supposed to address	  and analyze. This is clearly not the	  case	  for the	  studies utilized	  in	  the analysis presented in the	  DEIS	  on which ITD is basing their findings. Implementation of the E-‐2	  alternative would create major, long #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  term negative noise,	  visual,	  and 	  community cohesion impacts	  for the Eid Road community. The DEIS	  doesn't address this concern at all. Potential impacts to property values of rural residences from the preferred alternative are not	  adequately addressed. It 	  is 	  stated 	  in 	  the 	  last 	  paragraph 	  on 	  page 	  143 	  of 	  the DEIS, and numerous times throughout the associated	  technical reports, that property values will either not be impacted or may even increase throughout	  the project	  area under	  the E-‐2	  alternative. I believe	  this to be	  absolutely untrue	  as it 	  relates 	  to 	  the 	  rural	  residences 	  along 	  Eid 	  Road.	  The scenic	  qualities, including natural quietness and	  uninterrupted	  views to	  the west, provide value to	  my property. Placing an elevated freeway several hundred	  meters from my property line will not increase 	  my 	  property 	  value.	  In 	  fact, 	  page 	  29 	  of 	  the Community Impact Assessment Technical Report, Part 2	  states "With respect to the	  proposed project, it 	  is 	  reasonable 	  that 	  by 	  reducing 	  access 	  to 	  a property, the value of that property may be reduced." This assertion has seemingly been ignored 	  by 	  ITD 	  and 	  is 	  not 	  discussed 	  in any manner in 	  the 	  DEIS.	  As 	  already 	  discussed 	  above, implementation 	  of 	  the 	  E-‐2	  alternative will provide no	  benefit, and	  in	  fact may actually reduce access for	  rural residents living north of	  Eid Road along the Thorncreek to Moscow corridor over the long-‐term. Therefore, I feel potential impacts to property values needs to be reassessed and adequately	  addressed in the	  DEIS.  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  Issues 	  associated 	  with 	  impacts 	  to 	  vegetation 	  and wildlife habitat are not completely accurate or adequately addressed in the	  DEIS. The first	  sentence in the last	  paragraph on page 45 of the DEIS states that, "The E-‐2	  alternative was forwarded for	  consideration because it	  had the least 	  effect 	  to 	  wetlands, 	  cultural	  resources and was the only alternative to not	  effect	  rare plant	  communities."	  This	  is	  absolutely	  not a correct statement. Table 2 on page 13 of the DEIS indicates	  that	  the E-‐2	  route impacts 3.61	  acres of wetlands while the C-‐3	  alternative would impact less than 1	  acre. The	  assertion that the	  E-‐2	  route has no	  impacts 	  to 	  rare 	  plant 	  communities 	  is 	  also 	  incorrect.	  This alternative will have the greatest impact to rare plant communities located	  along Paradise Ridge,	  and this needs to be	  addressed throughout the	  DEIS. Impacts 	  of 	  the 	  E-‐2	  alternative on Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) lands are not adequately addressed anywhere	  in the	  DEIS	  either. In the	  Citizens for a Safe 95 attachment to	  the Community Impacts 	  Assessment 	  technical	  report 	  it 	  is 	  noted 	  that CRP ground	  "...(is) less productive and poorer quality." While this may be true on	  a case by case basis, as a blanket statement this represents a clear lack 	  of 	  understanding 	  of 	  the 	  focus 	  and 	  purpose 	  of the CRP Program. The CRP program was created through the 1985 farm bill and was initially 	  focused on	  removing erosion	  prone lands from production	  through the establishment	  of	  natural covers. However, subsequent farm bills have refocused the  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  CRP program on	  the benefits of conserving lands for wildlife habitat, wetland restoration, and other resource	  based projects that benefit the	  overall conservation and preservation of natural environments. A detailed analysis of lands enrolled in 	  the 	  CRP 	  program 	  and 	  impacts 	  to 	  their 	  associated conservation benefits	  for all of the alternatives	  must be included in this DEIS. I also strongly recommend ITD hire a reputable expert	  to perform this study, not	  rely upon the findings of	  studies produced	  by special interest groups such	  as Citizens for	  a Safe Highway 95. Impacts 	  to 	  the 	  pine 	  stands 	  along 	  Paradise 	  Ridge are	  also not adequately or accurately addressed in the	  DEIS. Section 4.8.5, starting on page 167 and continuing to page 168, states	  that "The E-‐2	  alternative	  would affect 3.9	  acres...that could offer potential nesting habitat for the long-‐eared myotis and pygmy nuthatch..." This is an incorrect statement, as	  the technical report produced by Melquist (page 11) states that the pygmy nuthatch already are	  known to exist in this stand. Also, in that same section of the DEIS (4.8.5), ITD has concluded	  that	  the loss of	  this 3.9 acres of	  habitat	  is "considered minor"	  and that there is	  "an abundance of habitat nearby." Who	  concluded	  this? This is blatantly incorrect and	  obviously not the case. In	  fact, the Melquist	  report suggests	  avoiding construction along the E-‐2	  corridor for this very reason. Why is this not	  reflected in the DEIS? The last full paragraph on page 55	  of the DEIS	  states the following: "The primary disadvantages of	  E-‐2	   #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  compared to the other alternatives	  are	  that it would be located closer to the base of Paradise Ridge which provides moderate ungulate habitat and E-‐2	  would also affect pine stands that are potential long-‐eared	  myotis, northern	  alligator lizard 	  and 	  pygmy	  nuthatch habitat." While this statement is	  mostly accurate, it is	  not complete. As	  mentioned above, pygmy nuthatch are already known to inhabit this pine stand. The E-‐2	  alternative will also have adverse impacts on community cohesion, viewsheds, noise,	  property 	  values,	  access for	  rural residents, rare plant	  communities, native and restored Palouse	  Prairie habitats and	  CRP ground. In the	  second to last sentence	  of the	  last paragraph	  on	  page 45, ITD also states the E-‐2	  alternative	  was forwarded for consideration "...because it had the least overall effects	  compared to the other	  alternatives in the eastern corridor." Perhaps a	  more	  appropriate	  statement regarding the E-‐2	  alternative would be, "the E-‐2	  alternative will result in the most long-‐term adverse impacts to nearly all resources of concern	  studied	  in	  this DEIS when compared to those alternatives forwarded for analysis." I also really question whether the	  E-‐2	  alignment actually addresses the	  given purpose and need	  for this project articulated	  on	  page 2 of the DEIS. I strongly believe the E-‐2	  route will not "improve"	  safety for	  any of	  the rural residents living along	  the	  Thorncreek to Moscow route. Nearly all of us will still be required	  to	  drive the old	  US-‐95	  highway on	  a daily basis, and	  while overall traffic volume on the old route will be likely	  be greatly	   #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  reduced we'll all still have to deal with all of	  the route's current	  safety issues and the accident	  will likely 	  still	  remain high. Based	  on	  a careful review of the DEIS and	  associated technical documents, I strongly support ITD's 	  adoption 	  of 	  the 	  C-‐3	  alternative. Jason W. Lyon 1090	  Eid Road, Moscow, Idaho (208)	  669-‐1867  L-‐73  Rachel JT.  Lyon  February 19, 2013 − Adam Rush, Public Involvement Coordinator ITD 	  Office 	  of 	  Communications 3311	  W. State Street, Boise, ID 83707 RE: Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) and Section 4(f) Evaluation US-‐95	  Thorncreek Road to Moscow. − Dear Mr. Rush, The following letter presents my comments on the recently released Draft	  Environmental Impact	  Statement (DEIS) for the	  Thorncreek Road to Moscow section of US Highway 95. I am concerned that	  the totality of	  environmental and social impacts 	  associated 	  with 	  the 	  E-‐2	  route were not fully addressed in the	  DEIS. After a	  complete	  review of the DEIS and associated technical documents, I offer the following specific comments and	  concerns for	  your	  consideration: 1. Lack of access to the new highway for rural residents living along the route under	  the E-‐2	  alternative.  See	  Response	  L-‐72.  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  As presented	  in	  the DEIS, the E-‐2	  route will leave the existing US-‐95	  corridor at the top of Reisenauer Hill and does not connect to it again until just immediately 	  outside 	  Moscow.	  This 	  is 	  discussed 	  in numerous places throughout the DEIS as a positive attribute	  in that the	  number of "access points"	  to the highway will be reduced. This assumption doesn't address the impact this will have on	  rural residents living along the Thorncreek to Moscow corridor, specifically	  those residents	  from Eid Road north	  toward	  Moscow. Table 9, found on page 59	  of the DEIS, indicates that over 1,200 people live along the Thorncreek to	  Moscow corridor. Nearly all of these rural residents use this route daily to	  commute to	  work, school, or other purposes. This accounts for potentially several thousand vehicle trips	  per day, at least. If the E-‐2	  alternative is constructed, nearly all of these vehicles will continue to traverse the old US-‐95	  route. Very few people, if	  any, will backtrack the several miles	  required southward to the top of Reisenauer Hill to enter	  the new highway. For	  someone like me, who lives	  on Eid Road, backtracking would	  effectively make the 5-‐mile trip to Moscow a 7 or	  8 mile trip. In addition, emergency services,	  school 	  buses,	  garbage collection services, and mail delivery, among many others, will all be under the same conditions. So, while elimination of all county road access points along	  the	  E-‐2	  alternative sounds good and allows ITD 	  to 	  tout 	  the 	  preferred 	  alternative 	  as 	  the 	  safest,	  it provides absolutely no benefit to those	  local  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  residents who rely on this route to travel to work and school every single	  day. I	  feel	  ITD 	  must 	  go 	  back 	  through 	  the 	  DEIS 	  and reevaluate all conclusions they've reached as they relate to impacts associated with removal of	  all county road	  access points from the E-‐2	  route. One such example can be found with nearly the entire second paragraph on page 141 of the DEIS. In this	  paragraph	  ITD states that the preferred	  alternative would "benefit" residents along Eid Road by, "...improving the safety of US-‐95	  and improving highway access and	  mobility," by "...reducing commute times	  and facilitating more efficient access to services," and through "Ingress and egress of vehicles, including emergency response units… by the use of a turn	  bay." These are all absolutely incorrect.	  Access 	  for 	  residents 	  living 	  along 	  Eid 	  Road, and really all rural residents living	  in the	  corridor, will not benefit under the preferred alternative. Essentially, nothing will change regarding our ability to travel back and forth to Moscow. The "turn bay" discussed	  in	  this section	  will be located	  several miles away from	  the mobile home parks at the	  top of Reisenauer Hill.	  How does this benefit residents along	  Eid Road? How will it reduce our travel times?	  We will all primarily be driving the old US-‐95	  route that	  doesn't	  meet	  the AASHTO standards and has been	  identified	  as having some of the highest accident rates in State	  of Idaho (Table	  31	  found on page 131 of the DEIS). How does the E-‐2	  alternative make traveling this route safer for us? Another example of an	  incorrect finding regarding  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  access can be	  found in the	  second to last paragraph on	  page 140 which	  states the C-‐3	  alternative would "...improve	  the	  highway access for all users but to a	  lesser 	  extent 	  compared 	  to 	  the 	  E-‐2	  and W-‐4	  alternatives." I believe	  this statement to be	  incorrect.	  Under 	  the 	  C-‐3	  alternative, access to the new US-‐95	  route would actually be provided for rural residents living along Eid	  Road. This is not provided	  in	  the E-‐2	  alternative as Eid Road is bypassed	  via an	  overpass. Therefore, access to	  rural residents would clearly be better	  under	  the C-‐3	  alternative	  not E-‐2. − Table 53	  of the DEIS	  (page 176) indicates that there are	  supposed	  to	  be 2 county road	  access points along	  the	  E-‐2	  route, however, these two access points do	  not show up	  on	  any of the maps in	  the DEIS. I can only assume those depict where E-‐2	  leaves 	  and 	  reenters 	  with 	  the 	  current 	  US-‐95	  corridor? If so, I find that to be highly misleading as these locations are not	  truly "county road" access points, at least not yet, and	  some readers may believe access to	  the E-‐2	  route will actually be provided	  via existing county roads when	  it will not be. − Along these same lines, the last 	  paragraph 	  of 	  page 176	  states that "shortened travel times"	  could benefit "...emergency service response, school access, bicyclists/pedestrians,	  and 	  mail 	  delivery." 	  I	  believe all of these statements to be incorrect, at	  least 	  as 	  they 	  relate 	  to 	  the 	  rural	  residents 	  that 	  live  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  along	  the	  Thorncreek to Moscow route. As mentioned above, there will be no improvement what-‐so-‐ever in these services	  or in travel times	  under the E-‐2	  alternatives as there will be no convenient access	  to the route from rural locations. In 	  some 	  cases,	  especially 	  with 	  emergency 	  services,	  the E-‐2	  alternative could actually result in increased travel times. − 2. I believe the reflection of proposed accident rates are misleading and do not	  accurately reflect	  travel patterns created if	  the E-‐2	  alternative is constructed. − I	  have 	  concerns 	  with 	  how 	  ITD 	  has 	  presented 	  and utilized	  the crash	  data in	  the DEIS. The Safety section (3.10.3) on page 111 states	  that,	  "Safety issues 	  within 	  the 	  study 	  area 	  relate 	  primarily 	  to 	  the road geometry and access onto the roadway." I'm curious	  how ITD has	  determined that "access	  to the roadway" is a primary safety issue 	  based 	  on 	  the data presented	  in	  this section? On the following page of the DEIS, Table 29 and	  30 list specifics on	  crash data for the past ten years	  (2002-‐2012). Table 29	  indicates there were 220	  total crashes along the Thorncreek to Moscow route over the last ten years. While Table 30 indicates that 22	  of those crashes	  or (10%) were "intersection related."	  Of the five crash factors or	  types presented in Table 30 (wildlife, intersection related, head-‐on, negotiating a	  curve, and weather), intersection related is followed only by head-‐on	  as the least likely 	  factor 	  or  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  type of	  crash. Why then does ITD downplay the significance of wildlife and weather related accidents in the	  Safety Technical Report and focus on	  one of the least likely crash	  types as a driver for the study? − ITD 	  states 	  in 	  several	  locations throughout the DEIS that	  the E-‐2	  route will have the lowest potential crash rate of the three action alternatives. This	  finding is based on a safety analysis conducted by ITD 	  and 	  reported 	  in 	  the 	  2012 	  Safety 	  Technical	  Report. However, what this analysis fails to take into 	  account 	  is 	  that 	  the 	  E-‐2	  alternative will effectively eliminate	  most all rural traffic (those	  folks living north of	  Eid Road)	  from utilizing the new highway. Those rural residents who	  drive back and	  forth to Moscow on the old 	  US-‐95	  route every single day will still be experiencing the narrow shoulders, inadequate corners, and 60 (or so) of the 66	  access points. Even those that choose to drive south to actually utilize the new highway (as	  proposed	  in	  E-‐2), will still have to traverse the majority of Reisenauer Hill to do so. Reisenauer	  Hill is 	  one 	  of 	  the 	  most 	  dangerous 	  parts 	  of 	  the 	  existing route. − The presentation of crash data	  throughout the DEIS, both	  the numbers of potential future crashes and	  the fatalities associated with them, is misleading	  and not truly representative	  of what construction of the E-‐2	  alternative will result in. These predictions must be tempered with the fact that all current  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  issues 	  and 	  concerns 	  associated 	  with 	  the 	  no 	  action alternative will continue to	  be a problem under this alternative. Therefore, I feel in order to truly predict potential crashes and	  fatalities associated	  with	  any of the action	  alternatives, but especially E-‐2, ITD must also include an analysis of the future predicted crashes and fatalities along	  the	  old US	  highway route associated	  with	  rural residential use. These figures must then be added to those predicted	  for the action	  alternatives to	  get a true sense of what the safety impacts 	  will	  be 	  for 	  all	  people who	  use this travel route. This is important as the	  historical data	  includes everyone, not just those that	  drive through from Moscow to Genesee, Lewiston, or other points south. − 3. There is very little specific information provided in 	  the 	  DEIS, or associated	  technical reports, on	  the elevation of the	  E-‐2	  alternative as it crosses Eid Road	  or the design	  of the overpass. − There is no discussion of the style and kind of overpass structure that is proposed	  to	  be built over Eid Road. Nor can I find anywhere within	  the DEIS how high	  the finished	  roadway will be as it crosses Eid Road and as it heads north from there. I live immediately 	  east 	  of 	  the 	  proposed 	  overpass 	  along Eid Road and can attest to the level and type of traffic Eid Road handles. It	  is very common during	  the spring and late summer/fall months to see large wheel tractors, combines, grain trucks, and large loaded 	  trucks 	  of 	  hay 	  traveling 	  from 	  farm 	  ground 	  to  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  the east	  and west	  of	  the proposed E-‐2	  alignment to and from US-‐95. These vehicles are all extremely tall and will likely not	  easily fit	  under	  a standard height highway overpass. I'm concerned	  that the E2	  alternative will effectively create a	  barrier to agricultural equipment movement up and down Eid Road. Currently, fields on	  both	  sides of	  the preferred	  alternative location	  near Eid	  Road	  are farmed. The farmer	  is reliant	  upon moving his machinery up and down Eid Road to access his fields. How will this be accomplished if	  his agricultural machinery will not fit under the	  overpass structure planned	  for Eid	  Road? This could	  create a potential economic	  hardship and be a mobility issue as well. This is not currently addressed at all in the	  DEIS. − The viewshed analysis presented in the DEIS	  and associated technical reports doesn't adequately address viewshed impacts to rural residents. − I	  live 	  along 	  Eid 	  Road 	  and 	  my 	  home 	  and 	  property 	  are located 	  immediately 	  east 	  of 	  the 	  proposed 	  E-‐2	  alignment. There	  is absolutely no detailed discussion	  anywhere in	  the DEIS about the nature and scale	  of visual impacts 	  associated 	  with 	  the highway and	  overpass structure proposed	  for construction near my	  property. There is	  discussion regarding impacts to viewsheds from the top of	  Reisenauer Hill looking 	  north, 	  or 	  from 	  the 	  City 	  of Moscow looking south, but nothing regarding the very	  real adverse impacts to rural residents along	   #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  Eid Road. My property and home have excellent uninterrupted	  views of the Palouse region	  to	  the west and south. The foreground of these significant viewsheds will	  be 	  impacted 	  by 	  the 	  planned overpass and	  associated	  elevated	  highway proposed	  through	  the E-‐2	  alignment. I consider this to be a serious long-‐term, adverse impact	  on the visual qualities associated with my	  property	  and home. The second	  paragraph	  on	  page 181	  states "A new bridge at Eid	  Road	  would	  create a long-‐term visual effect to residences." This needs to be changed to a "major long-‐term negative visual impact 	  on 	  residents" 	  and 	  a 	  more 	  detailed 	  analysis of what these impacts are and	  how they will be mitigated 	  by 	  ITD 	  presented. − The noise effects analysis is not adequate	  and doesn't address noise concerns for rural residents. − In 	  reviewing 	  the 	  noise technical report	  referenced in 	  the 	  DEIS, 	  it 	  seems 	  seven 	  noise 	  receptors 	  were placed in the	  general vicinity of the	  E-‐2	  alignment as it 	  crosses 	  Eid 	  Road.	  However, 	  five 	  of 	  these 	  locations were placed in spots that will be destroyed if the preferred	  alternative is constructed. Why were these receptors placed in locations that	  will "displaced" 	  if 	  the 	  E-‐2	  alignment is constructed?	  This is 	  a 	  major 	  failing 	  in 	  the 	  noise 	  study 	  and 	  a 	  very convenient way	  to justify	  the following statement in the first	  paragraph on page 186 of	  the DEIS "The required and optional abatement	  measures were not considered feasible	  and reasonable	  for the	   #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  impacted 	  receptors 	  which 	  were 	  not 	  displaced." 	  If the receptors had been placed in locations in the Eid Road vicinity that were not being "displaced," but will for sure be impacted	  by the noise generated from this elevated highway, perhaps the	  required abatement	  measures would be justified. − In 	  addition,	  what 	  criteria 	  were 	  utilized 	  when locations 	  for 	  the 	  noise receptors were being installed 	  in 	  the 	  first 	  place? 	  If 	  the 	  preferred alternative	  is built, it will be	  an elevated highway across Eid Road. Depending	  upon the	  height of this highway, the roadway will likely result in	  major long-‐term negative noise related impacts on all residences living along the first	  mile or	  so of	  Eid Road. The noise impacts from this alternative	  are	  not limited	  to	  homes within	  300 feet of the centerline. Noise can travel great distances	  and drastically alter what is now a very quiet location. I see this	  as	  a major failing of the noise analysis	  presented	  in	  the DEIS and	  this should	  be adequately addressed and more	  thoroughly researched. Receptor locations must be selected	  based	  on	  where potential impacts from the preferred alternative	  will be	  felt, not underneath the	  finished roadway. − Impacts 	  to 	  community 	  cohesion 	  are 	  inaccurate 	  and not fully addressed in the DEIS and associated technical reports. − Page	  six of the	  Community Impact Assessment  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  Update technical report provides the following definition	  for the community cohesion	  study: − The community cohesion	  evaluation	  considers any changes in 	  the 	  pattern 	  of 	  social	  networking 	  within 	  a neighborhood	  or community, which	  includes splitting neighborhoods, isolating groups, generating	  new development, changing	  property values, or separating residents from community facilities. The community cohesion	  evaluation	  also	  includes 	  noise and	  visual impacts 	  from 	  a 	  project. − The primary study cited throughout the Community Impact 	  Assessment 	  technical	  reports 	  regarding potential impacts to	  community cohesion	  was prepared	  by the Citizens for	  a Safe Highway 95 group. This group has shown strong public support for the E-‐2	  route, and I question whether any "studies" they have conducted can and should be viewed as unbiased. I also	  strongly question	  whether ITD should rely on the findings	  of any study produced by a special interest group	  for such	  a high	  profile project. I have lived	  in	  my home along Eid	  Road	  since 2006 and have never been contacted by any group (public or private) regarding	  my	  concerns, issues, 	  or 	  beliefs 	  about 	  any 	  of 	  the action alternatives reviewed in this DEIS. My home	  is immediately 	  east 	  of 	  the 	  overpass 	  structure proposed	  under the preferred	  alternative, and	  my only contact regarding this project has been	  several requests from ITD to grant	  permission for	  access to  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  my property for	  project	  related studies. The findings presented	  by the Citizens for a Safe Highway 95 group certainly	  do not reflect my	  beliefs regarding	  this issue at	  all. I also question whether	  the Citizens for	  a Safe Highway 95 group are experts in the field of community cohesion	  studies, whether they utilized	  a scientifically valid	  study design, and	  if their	  methodology and findings will hold up in court. − I	  also 	  question 	  how 	  the 	  DEIS 	  can 	  state 	  in 	  the 	  third paragraph	  on	  page 138 that "...none of the alternatives would cause	  a	  major disruption to community	  cohesion."	  The density	  of homes	  along the first	  mile or	  so of	  Eid Road makes it	  one, if	  not	  the most, densely occupied communities along the entire	  Thorncreek to Moscow route. This community	  is	  very	  quiet and has excellent uninterrupted	  views westward	  towards Pullman. Construction	  of the E-‐2	  alternative will remove five homes, impact numerous others, and	  effectively cut the community in two. Using the definition provided	  in	  the Community Impact Assessment, these are exactly the kind of	  issues the community cohesion study	  was	  supposed to address	  and analyze. This is clearly not the	  case	  for the	  studies utilized	  in	  the analysis presented	  in	  the DEIS on	  which ITD is basing their findings. Implementation of the E-‐2	  alternative would create major, longterm negative noise,	  visual,	  and 	  community cohesion impacts	  for the Eid Road community. The DEIS doesn't address this concern at all.  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  − Potential impacts to property values of rural residences from the	  preferred alternative	  are	  not adequately addressed. − It 	  is 	  stated 	  in 	  the 	  last 	  paragraph 	  on 	  page 	  143 	  of 	  the DEIS, and numerous times throughout the associated technical reports, that property values will either not be impacted or may even increase throughout	  the project	  area under	  the E-‐2	  alternative. I believe	  this to be	  absolutely untrue	  as it 	  relates 	  to 	  the 	  rural	  residences 	  along 	  Eid 	  Road.	  The scenic	  qualities, including natural quietness	  and uninterrupted	  views to	  the west, provide value to	  my property. Placing an elevated freeway several hundred	  meters from my property line will not increase 	  my 	  property 	  value.	  In 	  fact, 	  page 	  29 	  of 	  the Community Impact Assessment Technical Report, Part 2	  states "With respect to the	  proposed project, it 	  is 	  reasonable	  that by reducing	  access to a	  property, the value of that property may be reduced." This assertion has seemingly been ignored 	  by 	  ITD 	  and 	  is 	  not 	  discussed 	  in 	  any 	  manner in 	  the 	  DEIS.	  As 	  already 	  discussed 	  above, implementation 	  of 	  the 	  E-‐2	  alternative will	  provide no	  benefit, and	  in	  fact may actually reduce access for	  rural residents living north of	  Eid Road along the Thorncreek to Moscow corridor over the long-‐term. Therefore, I feel potential impacts to property values needs to be reassessed and adequately addressed in the	  DEIS. −  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  Issues 	  associated 	  with 	  impacts 	  to 	  vegetation 	  and wildlife habitat are not completely accurate or adequately addressed in the	  DEIS. − The first sentence in the last paragraph on page 45	  of the DEIS states that, "The E-‐2	  alternative was forwarded for	  consideration because it	  had the least 	  effect 	  to 	  wetlands, 	  cultural	  resources and was the only alternative to not	  effect	  rare plant	  communities."	  This	  is	  absolutely	  not a correct statement. Table 2 on page 13 of the DEIS indicates that	  the E-‐2	  route impacts 3.61	  acres of wetlands while the C-‐3	  alternative would impact less than 1	  acre. The	  assertion that the	  E-‐2	  route has no impacts 	  to 	  rare 	  plant 	  communities 	  is 	  also 	  incorrect.	  This alternative will have the greatest impact to rare	  plant communities located	  along Paradise Ridge,	  and this needs to be	  addressed throughout the	  DEIS. − Impacts 	  of 	  the 	  E-‐2	  alternative on Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) lands are not adequately addressed anywhere	  in the	  DEIS	  either. In the	  Citizens for a Safe 95 attachment to	  the Community Impacts 	  Assessment 	  technical	  report 	  it 	  is 	  noted 	  that CRP ground	  "...(is) less productive and	  poorer quality." While this may be true on	  a case by case basis, as a blanket statement	  this represents a clear	  lack 	  of 	  understanding 	  of 	  the 	  focus 	  and 	  purpose 	  of the CRP Program. The CRP program was created through the 1985 farm bill and was initially focused on	  removing erosion	  prone lands from production	   #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  through the establishment	  of	  natural covers. However, subsequent farm bills have refocused the CRP program on	  the benefits of conserving lands for wildlife habitat, wetland restoration, and other resource based projects that	  benefit	  the overall conservation and preservation of natural environments. A detailed analysis of lands enrolled in 	  the 	  CRP 	  program 	  and 	  impacts 	  to 	  their 	  associated conservation benefits	  for all of the alternatives	  must be included in this DEIS. I also strongly recommend ITD hire a reputable expert	  to perform this study, not	  rely upon the findings of	  studies produced	  by special interest groups such	  as Citizens for	  a Safe Highway 95. − Impacts 	  to 	  the 	  pine 	  stands 	  along 	  Paradise 	  Ridge are	  also not adequately or accurately addressed in the	  DEIS. Section 4.8.5, starting on page 167 and continuing to page 168, states	  that "The E-‐2	  alternative	  would affect 3.9	  acres...that could offer potential nesting habitat for the long-‐eared myotis and pygmy nuthatch..." This is an incorrect statement, as the technical report	  produced by Melquist (page 11) states that the pygmy nuthatch already are	  known to exist in this stand. Also, in that same section of the DEIS (4.8.5), ITD has	  concluded that	  the loss of	  this 3.9 acres of	  habitat	  is "considered	  minor" and	  that there is "an	  abundance of habitat nearby." Who	  concluded	  this? This is blatantly incorrect and	  obviously not the case. In	  fact, the Melquist	  report	  suggests avoiding construction along the E-‐2	  corridor for this very  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  reason. Why is this	  not reflected in the DEIS? − The last full paragraph on page 55	  of the DEIS	  states the following: "The primary disadvantages of	  E-‐2	  compared to the other alternatives	  are that it would be located closer to the base of Paradise Ridge which provides moderate ungulate habitat and E-‐2	  would also affect pine stands that are potential long-‐eared	  myotis, northern	  alligator lizard 	  and 	  pygmy 	  nuthatch habitat." While this statement is	  mostly accurate, it	  is not	  complete. As mentioned above, pygmy nuthatch are already known to inhabit this pine stand. The E-‐2	  alternative will also have adverse impacts on community cohesion, viewsheds, noise,	  property 	  values,	  access for	  rural residents, rare plant communities, native and restored Palouse	  Prairie habitats and	  CRP ground. In the	  second to last sentence	  of the	  last paragraph	  on	  page 45, ITD also	  states the E-‐2	  alternative	  was forwarded for consideration "...because it had the least	  overall effects compared to the other	  alternatives in the eastern corridor." Perhaps a	  more	  appropriate	  statement regarding the E-‐2	  alternative would be, "the E-‐2	  alternative will result in the most long-‐term adverse impacts to nearly all resources of concern studied in this DEIS	  when compared to those alternatives forwarded for analysis." I also really question whether the	  E-‐2	  alignment actually addresses the	  given purpose	  and need	  for this project articulated	  on	  page 2 of the DEIS. I strongly believe 	  the 	  E-‐2	  route will not "improve"	  safety for	  any of	  the rural residents living  #  First Name  Name  Comment  Response  along	  the	  Thorncreek to Moscow route. Nearly all of us will still be required	  to	  drive the old	  US-‐95	  highway on	  a daily basis, and	  while overall traffic volume on the old route will be likely be greatly reduced we'll all still have to deal with all of	  the route's current	  safety issues and the accident	  will likely 	  still	  remain 	  high. − Based	  on	  a careful review of the DEIS and	  associated technical documents, I strongly support	  ITD's 	  adoption 	  of 	  the 	  C-‐3	  alternative. − Rachel JT.

Reinitiation of consultation is not warranted at this time. However, if your proposed action is modified, environmental conditions change, or additional information becomes available regarding potential effects on listed species, you should verify that your conclusions are still valid. In addition, our 2007 consultation included commitments by the ITD to proactively work towards the conservation of Spalding's catchfly and mitigate damage to an existing population (Mervyn Farm site) that occurred during construction activities associated with the Top of Lewiston Hill to Genesee project. These commitments included acquiring a conservation easement on the Renfrew property (within the Thorncreek to Moscow action area) to protect a small catchfly population and growing out and transplanting catchfly plants on the Jensen property (adjacent to the Thorncreek to Moscow action area), the Renfrew property, and the Mervyn Farm site (after rehabilitating and fencing the site). I assisted with seed collection in 2007 and know seeds were germinated at the Palouse Land Trust facility, but haven't heard anything additional in quite some time. Could you please provide me with an update on the status of these conservation efforts? Thank you. Clay U.S.Fish and Wildlife Service 1387 S.

Concurrence on the original Biological Assessment for the project was received from your office April 12, 2007 that the project is not likely to adversely affect Spalding's catchfly (Silene spaldingii) As of the latest United States Fish and Wildlife Service Species list dated August 17, 2011 the only changes to listed species within Latah County, ID is the removal of the Gray wolf, (Canis lupus) which was listed as experimental non-essential. At the time of this writing the Idaho Transportation Department has not changed the original proposed highway design and are still evaluating the three proposed alignments your office consulted on in 2007. Based on this information and the lack of substantive species change there should be no difference in the level of effect to listed species determined from the original B.A. for this project. All other components of the existing consultation remain the same and therefore, ITD believes the determination for Spalding's catchfly of "not likely to adversely affect" is still valid as originally intended and reinitiating consultation is not warranted at this time. Shawn W.

ITD D2 asked the Corps to confirm whether the Cow Creek Mitigation site (deemed successful as meeting its successcriteria by the Corps Regulatory Division (RD) on August 19, 2010)... would suffice to also provide compensatory mitigation for the remaining ThCr2M Project(s). The Corps RD scoured all our files... NWW No. 2004-0600013, KN 7769, and NWW No. 2004-0600046, KN 09294.  We also scoured the pre-application information (original mitigation plans), the monitoring plans, and other information. As far as the Corps RD can determine, the Cow Creek Mitigation Site is to serve as compensatory mitigation for all projects involved w/ US 95, Top of Lewiston Hill toMoscow, including the remaining US 95, Thorn Creek to Moscow, EIS portion of the project. In conversations w/ Mr. Shawn Smith - we both agree that should the Corps determine a shortfall in compensatory mitigation at the time of permitting for the remainingproject(s).... perhaps ITD could then avail itself of a local mitigation bank for the difference.  Yours Truly, Nicholle BraspennickxRegulatory Project Manager208-345-2287 Classification: UNCLASSIFIED Caveats: NONE List of Preparers and Reviewers APPENDIX 2.

SPECIES OF GREATEST CONSERVATION NEED; CONSERVATION RANKING	  DESCRIPTIONS Global Rank (GRANK) and State Rank (SRANK) - Idaho Natural Heritage Program The network of Natural Heritage Programs and Conservation Data Centers--which currently consists of installations in all 50 states, several Canadian provinces, and several Latin American and Caribbean countries--ranks the rangewide (GRANK or global rank) and state (SRANK or state rank) status of plants, animals, and plant communities on a scale of 1 to 5. The rank is primarily based on the number of known occurrences, but other factors such as habitat quality, estimated number of individuals, narrowness of range of habitat, trends in populations and habitat, threats to the element, and other factors are also considered. The ranking system is meant to exist alongside national and state rare species lists because these lists often include additional criteria (e.g., recovery potential, depth of knowledge) that go beyond assessing threats to extinction. Components of Ranks: G = Global rank indicator; denotes rank based on rangewide status. T = Trinomial rank indicator; denotes global status of infraspecific taxa. S = State rank indicator; denotes rank based on status within Idaho. 1 = Critically imperiled because of extreme rarity or because some factor of its biology makes it especially vulnerable to extinction (typically 5 or fewer occurrences). 2 = Imperiled because of rarity or because other factors demonstrably make it very vulnerable to extinction (typically 6 to 20 occurrences). 3 = Rare or uncommon but not imperiled (typically 21 to 100 occurrences). 4 = Not rare and apparently secure, but with cause for long-term concern (usually more than 100 occurrences). 5 = Demonstrably widespread, abundant, and secure. U = Unrankable. H = Historical occurrence (i.e., formerly part of the native biota; implied expectation that it might be rediscovered or possibly extinct). X = Presumed extinct or extirpated. Q = Indicates uncertainty about taxonomic status. ? = Uncertainty exists about the stated rank. NR = Not ranked. NA = Conservation status rank is not applicable. Examples of Use: G4T2 = Species is apparently secure rangewide, but this particular subspecies or variety is imperiled. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow Species of Greatest Conservation Need; Conservation Ranking Descriptions S2S3= Uncertainty exists whether the species or subspecies should be ranked S2 or S3. State Ranks Specific to Long Distance Migrants (Bats and Birds): A = Accidental (occurring only once or a few times) or casual (occurring more regularly although not every year) in Idaho; a few of these species might have bred on one or more of the occasions when they were recorded. B = Breeding population. M = Only applies when migrant occurs in an irregular, transitory, and dispersed manner. Occurrences cannot be defined from year-to-year. N = Nonbreeding population. Examples of Use: S4N = Fairly common winter resident. S1B,S5N = Rare breeder but a common winter resident. S2B,SMN = Rare breeder and uncommon spring and fall transient with lesser numbers remaining as local and irregular (in location) winter residents. Sources:  Accessed April 24, 2012. Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow APPENDIX	  5. UNIFORM RELOCATION 	  ACT 	  SUMMARY Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) July 2015 US-95 Thorncreek Road to Moscow The Idaho Transportation Department (ITD) is committed to compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and all related regulations and directives. ITD assures that no person shall on the grounds of race, color, national origin, gender, age, or disability be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination under any ITD service, program, or activity. The department also assures that every effort will be made to prevent discrimination through the impacts of its programs, policies, and activities on minority and low-income populations. In addition, the department will take reasonable steps to provide meaningful access to services for persons with Limited English Proficiency. Dear Fellow Idahoans: The following tells you about the relocation program benefits available if you have to move from the path of a federally funded project. To ease the problems of finding a new place to live, to do business or to farm, the Idaho Transportation Department provides two programs: THE  RELOCATION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM THE RELOCATION PAYMENTS PROGRAM This booklet is a general description of these programs. It explains who is eligible for the benefits available and how they may be obtained. Please become familiar with the parts that apply to you; it may save time and possible misunderstandings later. If you are to be displaced, you will be personally contacted by a Relocation Agent. The programs will be fully explained and you will be advised how to utilize them to your best advantage. You will be supplied with the forms needed to claim your payments and offered assistance in filling them out. It is the responsibility of the Relocation Agent to assist you and give you complete, factual relocation information. Declaration of Policy Definitions The Relocation Assistance and Payment Program Moving Expenses – Residential • Fixed Payment “Room Count” • “Actual Cost” Payment Replacement Housing Payments • Housing Supplement • Rent Supplement • Down Payment Supplement Decent, Safe, and Sanitary (D.S. & S.) Claiming Supplemental Payments Moving Expenses – Business, Farm, or Nonprofit • “Actual Cost” Move • Agreed Self Move • Fixed Payment (“in lieu”) • Re-establishment Expenses Advertising Signs Appeal Department of Transportation Policy:  The United States Secretary of Transportation stated in the Department’s “Replacement Housing Policy” in DOT Order 5620.1 dated 6/24/70, the following guidelines: It is the policy of the Department of Transportation that no person shall be displaced by the Department’s federal and federally-assisted construction projects unless and until adequate replacement housing has already been provided for or is built.  To accomplish this policy, the following three principal points must be carried out: a. Specific written assurance that adequate replacement housing will be available or provided for (built if necessary) will be required before the initial approval of endorsement of any project. b. Construction will be authorized only upon verification that replacement housing is in place and has been made available to all affected persons. c. All replacement housing must be fair housing—open to all persons regardless of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. This is in addition to the requirement that replacement housing must be offered to all affected persons regardless of their race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. If you feel that the housing is not fair housing, then you should register a complaint with the Human Rights Commission, Statehouse, Boise  ID  83720, Phone Number 208-334-2873. Displaced Person:  A “displaced person” is any person (individual, family, corporation, partnership, or association) who moves and /or moves personal property as the result of the acquisition of the real property, or as the result of a written notice from the Idaho Transportation Department to vacate the real property that is needed for a project.  In the case of a partial acquisition, the Idaho Transportation Department shall determine if a person is displaced as a direct result of the acquisition. Relocation benefits will vary upon the type and length of occupancy. Relocation Claim:  A formal application for relocation assistance payment is required, using forms provided by the Relocation Agent.  The claim form must be received by the Idaho Transportation Department no more than 18 months after the displacement date or when payment is received from the State whichever is later. Business: Any lawful activity, with the exception of a farm operation, conducted primarily for the purchase, sale, lease and/or rental of personal and/or real property, and/or for the manufacture, processing, and/or marketing of products, commodities, and/or any other person property; or for the sale of services to the public; or solely for the purpose of this Act, an outdoor advertising display or displays, when the display(s) must be moved as a result of the project; or a legal entity purposefully engaged in a legal,  not-for-profit activity (“nonprofit organization”). Farm:  Any lawful activity conducted solely or primarily for the production of one or more agricultural products or commodities including timber for sale or home use and customarily producing such products or commodities in sufficient quantity to be capable of contributing materially to the operator’s support. Nonprofit Organization:  A “business” that is licensed and/or registered, when required by local or federal authority, for operation on a not-for-profit basis and exempt from federal income taxes. Comparable Replacement Dwelling:  A comparable replacement dwelling must be “decent, safe, and sanitary,” and should be functionally equivalent to your present dwelling. Functionally Equivalent:  The term functionally equivalent means that the comparable replacement dwelling performs the same function, provides the same utility. While a comparable replacement dwelling need not possess every feature of the displacement dwelling , the principal features must be present. THE RELOCATION ASSISTANCE & PAYMENT PROGRAM What it does:  The Idaho Transportation Department will give you assistance in finding a new place to live or in which to do business.  A Relocation Agent is assigned to each highway project for this purpose.  The Relocation Agent will have lists of properties being offered for sale or rent that are in suitable condition, price, or rental range for you and your family.  Information concerning available properties, typical real estate purchase and leasing costs, available public housing and the services offered by other agencies in the area will also be available. How Soon Will I Have to Move?  You will receive at least ninety (90) days notice in writing of the date you have to move.  This notice usually will not be given until the State has acquired the property. What is the Relocation Payments Program? The Relocation Payments Program is designed to help pay the expenses encountered in moving when homes, businesses, farms, and nonprofit organizations must be relocated to make room for a highway project.  Two different kinds of payments are involved: 1. Moving Expenses Most owners and tenants of homes, mobile homes, businesses, farms, and nonprofit organizations displaced by a project will be eligible to receive payment for their actual and reasonable expenses in moving themselves, their family, business, farm operation, or other personal property, and in searching for a replacement business or farm location.  Also, payment will be made for actual direct losses of tangible personal property as a result of moving or discontinuing a business, farm operation, or nonprofit organization. 2. Replacement Housing Payments (R.H.P.) a. Replacement Housing Supplements Long term owner-occupants of homes, unable to purchase comparable replacement housing at price levels equal to what they received from the State for their homes, may be eligible to receive a Supplemental Payment. b. Rent Supplements Tenants and short-term owner-occupants of residential units, unable to rent comparable residential units at price levels equal to the rent they are paying at the time they move, may be eligible to receive a Supplemental Payment. Payments received under the Relocation Assistance Program will not be considered as income for the purpose of any income tax; nor as income or resources for the purpose of determining eligibility for assistance from the State Department of Health and Welfare.  Nor are such payments considered as income for the purpose of determining the eligibility of any person for assistance under the Social Security Act or any other Federal law. The following pages explain these payments in greater detail.  If you have any questions not covered here, please feel free to ask.  Copies of the rules and regulations governing the administration of the Relocation Assistance Program may be obtained from the Idaho Transportation Department, Right of Way Section, P.O. Box 7129, Boise, Idaho, 83707-1129. What are Moving Expenses? Moving costs or moving expenses include the costs of: 1. Transportation of displaced person and personal property 2. Dismantling 3. Disconnecting 4. Crating, Uncrating 5. Packing, Unpacking 6. Loading 7. Insuring 8. Temporary Storage 9. Unloading 10. Reinstalling of personal property, including service charges in connection with such reinstalling; temporary lodging while being moved; and transportation of eligible persons. 11. Replacement  value of personal property lost, stolen, or damaged. Moving expenses do not normally include any addition, improvements, alterations or other physical changes in or to any structure in connection with moving personal property, except when required by law. Who May Receive Moving Expenses?  Dwelling occupants, business and farm operators, and nonprofit organizations may be eligible to claim these expenses. Moving Expenses-Limit on Distance:  Payments for moving are limited to a straight-line distance of 50 miles.  Any additional mileage charges must be paid by the person being moved. Storage and Temporary Lodging Costs-Limit on Time:  If it is necessary for a person to store personal property or obtain temporary lodging, the Idaho Transportation Department will pay reasonable and necessary storage charges for no more than twelve (12) months and reasonable temporary lodging costs while goods are in transit. The Relocation Agent must approve plans for storage and temporary lodging IN ADVANCE.  Be sure to make this contact before moving. Can I Move in Advance of Purchase of My Dwelling or Place of Business? Do Not Move In Advance.  In order to be eligible for any benefits described in this brochure, you must be in lawful occupancy at the start of negotiations for the property to be acquired by the State, or have been ordered in writing to vacate your present residence or business. If you own or rent a residential dwelling, you may be eligible for a fixed payment based on “Room Count,” or the “Actual Cost” of moving your household goods.  You may choose the best method for you. Option 1: What Does Fixed Payment “Room Count” Mean?  The “Room Count” method has nothing to do with actual costs of moving and requires no proof of expenses.  It is particularly suitable for occupants who wish to move themselves. The payments are based on the number of rooms of furniture or personal belongings. If you are the owner of a dwelling or are renting an unfurnished dwelling (you own the furniture) and: If the Certified Number of Rooms is: Your Moving Payment will be: 1............................................................................$400 2............................................................................$550 3............................................................................$700 4............................................................................$850 5............................................................................$950 6..........................................................................$1050 7..........................................................................$1150 8..........................................................................$1250 For Each Additional Room Add: .............................$100 If you are renting a furnished house, apartment or sleeping room (you do not own the furniture) your payment will be $300 for the first room and $50 for each additional room. How to Claim the “Room Count” Payment:  A few days before you move, you must notify your Relocation Agent so the agent can count and certify the number of rooms for which you can be paid. Which Claim Form to Use for “Room Count” Payment? 1. After you have moved, fill out the claim form provided by the Relocation Agent. Your Relocation Agent will assist you in completing the form if needed. 2. Mail the form to the Idaho Transportation Department, Right of Way Section, P.O. Box 7129, Boise, ID  83707-1129 When to Claim Payment:  You should file a claim for your “Room Count” moving costs as soon as you have moved.  The claim must be filed within eighteen (18) months after you vacate the displacement dwelling. Option 2: What does “Actual Cost” mean?  Instead of the “Room Count” method, you may choose the “Actual Cost” method which provides for payment of actual reasonable expenses of moving up to 80 kilometers (50 miles), by a licensed commercial mover. If you choose the “Actual Cost” method, your Relocation Agent will give you a letter authorizing the move and you must do the following: 1. Contact a licensed commercial mover; 2. Move, pay the mover, and get receipted bills; 3. Fill out the claim form provided.  Attach the paid bills from the moving company and others to the claim form.  Your Relocation Agent will assist you, if needed; 4. Mail to the Idaho Transportation Department, Right of Way Section, P.O. Box 7129, Boise, ID  83707-1129. When to Claim “Actual Cost” move Expenses:  You should file your claim as soon as you have moved and paid the mover.  The claim must be filed within eighteen (18) months after you complete your move. When May I Expect payment?  You should receive payment within thirty (30) days after your moving cost claim is approved. What About Mobile Home Residents in an Established Mobile Home Park or Elsewhere?  Owner-Occupants may be eligible for the “Actual Cost” of moving such homes to new sites. Tenants of mobile homes or owner-occupants who move only their personal property will be allowed moving payments the same as occupants of other dwellings. If the displaced person owns some or all of the furniture, Option 1 will apply with the room count based on quantities of household furniture, equipment, and personal property “common” to a permanent dwelling. A few days before you move, your Relocation Agent must certify the number of rooms to be moved. 1. After you have moved, fill out the claim form provided. 2. Mail the form to the Idaho Transportation Department, Right of Way Section, P.O. Box 7129, Boise, Idaho, 83707-1129. 3. The claim must be filed within eighteen (18) months after you move. Owner-occupants and tenants who are displaced from houses, apartments, mobile homes, or sleeping rooms may be eligible for a Replacement Housing Payment in addition to moving costs. There are three (3) kinds of payments: 1. Housing Supplement 2. Rent Supplement 3. Down Payment Supplement These supplemental payments are to assure that all displaced persons will have enough money to buy or rent replacement housing which is at least as good as they had before and which also meets Decent, Safe, and Sanitary (D.S.& S.) standards. • Housing Supplement What is a Housing Supplement?  An owner-occupant of a dwelling may be eligible to receive a payment representing the difference, if any, between the price the Idaho Transportation Department paid for the displacement dwelling and the price to purchase a functionally equivalent dwelling.  This is not extra compensation for the improvement acquired by the Department, but a supplement to assist in purchasing a substitute home. Who is Eligible for a Housing Supplement?  To be eligible for a Housing Supplement, a displaced person must: 1. Have actually owned and occupied the displacement dwelling for at least one hundred-eighty (180) days before the Idaho Transportation Department made its first offer; and 2. Purchase and occupy a Decent, Safe, and Sanitary dwelling within one (1) year after receiving final payment for the displacement dwelling unit acquired by the Idaho Transportation Department. How Will the Amount of This Payment be Determined? 1.) — A study will be made by the Idaho Transportation Department to find the market selling price of a Decent, Safe, and Sanitary dwelling functionally equivalent to your own. If the price paid to you for your dwelling is lower than the price found by the study, the difference is the maximum Housing Supplement.  The final amount of the supplement will be computed from the amount actually paid for the replacement home but normally not more than the maximum. 2.) — If the dwelling you owned and occupied was mortgaged for not less than one hundred-eighty (180) days before the State’s first offer to purchase, you may be entitled to an increased interest payment if the mortgage on the replacement dwelling has a higher rate of interest than the mortgage on the displacement dwelling. 3.) — You may also receive reimbursement for reasonable expenses incurred for title search, recording fees, and other closing costs connected with the purchase of the replacement dwelling, but not including prepaid expenses. The total supplemental payment for Price Differential Payment may replacement housing (the total of 1,2 & 3 be any amount up to $10,000 above) normally cannot exceed $22,500. A written statement of the maximum amount of the housing supplement, if any (Part 1 of this payment), will be given to you at the time the Idaho Transportation Department purchases your property. The amount for Parts 2 and 3, if any, will depend on the details of the purchase of a replacement home. The total cannot normally exceed $22,500. What is Meant by Comparable Replacement Dwelling?  A comparable replacement shall be “functionally equivalent” to the displacement dwelling, providing the same utility. While a comparable replacement dwelling need not possess every feature of the displacement dwelling the principal features must be present. Be Careful! The Idaho Transportation Department is required by law to certify that the home you purchase and occupy is Decent, Safe, and Sanitary in order for you to be eligible for the supplement. On request, the Idaho Transportation Department will inspect any dwelling you may wish to purchase to determine whether or not it qualifies you for supplemental payments. When Can I File a Claim?  You may file a claim for the supplement payment any time after you have purchased and occupied a Decent, Safe, and Sanitary dwelling. However, you must file your claim no later than eighteen (18) months after the date on which you were required to vacate the displacement dwelling. If You Prefer to Rent Rather Than Buy:  If you are a displaced home owner who is qualified for a Housing Supplement but plan to rent rather than buy, you may qualify for a Rent Supplement payment. How Will the Amount of the Rent Supplement be Determined?  The Rent Supplement which normally cannot exceed $5,250, will be forty-two (42) times the difference between: 1. The amount necessary to rent a Decent, Safe, and Sanitary replacement dwelling functionally equivalent to the displacement dwelling; and 2. The fair rental value of the displacement dwelling. • Rent Supplement What Are Rent Supplements?  Eligible tenants and short-term owner-occupants who choose to rent rather than to buy may qualify for a Rent Supplement if the fair rental value of the displacement dwelling is less than the amount required to rent an available, functionally equivalent, Decent, Safe, and Sanitary replacement dwelling. How Will the Amount of the Payment be Determined? The Rent Difference Between Supplement, which normally cannot exceed $5,250, will be forty-two (42) times the difference between: 1. The base rent for a replacement dwelling; and 2. The base rent for your current dwelling. The amount of rent used in 1 above shall be the lesser of: 1. The amount computed by the State as necessary to rent a replacement dwelling; or 2. The rent the displaced person actually pays for a replacement Total Rental Assistance Up dwelling. to 42 Months - $3,150 Such Rental Supplements, when added to your present rent payments, will enable you to rent qualifying housing for up to forty-two (42) months. What Must I Do to Qualify?  You must rent and occupy a Decent, Safe, and Sanitary dwelling within one year after you vacate the displacement dwelling acquired by the State. On request, the Idaho Transportation Department will have an inspection made of any dwelling you may wish to rent to determine whether it qualifies you for supplemental rent payments. Who Determines the Amount of the Rent Supplement?  The amount necessary to rent Decent, Safe, And Sanitary accommodations functionally equivalent to the displacement dwelling will be determined by the Idaho Transportation Department from a study of available accommodations in your community or surrounding area. When Can I File a Claim?  You may file a claim for the supplement payment any time after you have rented and occupied a Decent, Safe, and Sanitary dwelling. However, you must file your claim no later than eighteen (18) months after the date on which you vacate the displacement dwelling. • Down Payment Supplement What Are Down Payment Supplements? Eligible tenants and short-term owner-occupants who choose to buy rather than to rent may receive a Down Payment Supplement. The payment, not to exceed $5,250, will be the amount normally required as a down payment on a comparable dwelling if such purchase were financed by a conventional mortgage. The Down Payment Supplement will be limited to the lesser of: 1. Required down payment for a comparable dwelling; or 2. Required down payment for a replacement dwelling; or 3. Amount computed as rent supplement; or 4. Actual down payment made on a replacement dwelling. Subject to the above limits, your payment may include reimbursement for reasonable expenses incurred for title search, recording fees, and other closing costs connected with the purchase of the replacement dwelling. What Must I Do to Qualify?  To receive a Down Payment Supplement, you must purchase and occupy a Decent, Safe, and Sanitary dwelling within one (1) year after: 1. For a Tenant, the date you vacate the acquired dwelling; or 2. For an Owner-Occupant, the latter of: the date you receive final payment or the date you vacate the acquired dwelling. DECENT, SAFE, AND SANITARY DWELLING What is Meant by a Decent, Safe, and Sanitary Dwelling?   A qualifying house, apartment, or mobile home is one that meets Decent, Safe, and Sanitary standards which are described as follows: 1. Conforms to local housing, and occupancy codes for existing structures; 2. Has continuing and adequate supply of potable water; 3. Has kitchen with hot and cold water and sink with sewage connections.  Must have areas for stove and refrigerator with available utility connections; 4. Has adequate heating system which will maintain a minimum temperature of 21°C (70°F) in the living area under normal weather conditions; 5. Has a separate, well-lighted and ventilated bathroom that provides privacy to the user; contains a sink, bathtub or shower stall, and a toilet; all in good working order and properly connected to appropriate sources of water and sewage drainage system; 6. Has an adequate and safe wiring system for lighting and other electrical services; 7. Is structurally sound, weather tight, in good repair and adequately maintained; 8. Has a safe unobstructed exit leading to a safe open space at ground level; 9. Meets the following standards of habitable floor space: a. 14 square meters (150 square feet) for the first occupant; and b. At least 9 square meters (100 square feet) for each additional occupant, or 7 square feet (70 square feet) if a mobile home. Habitable floor space means the part used for sleeping, living, cooking, and dining, and does not include closets, pantries, bathroom, service or utility rooms, hallways, foyers, unfurnished attics, storage spaces, cellars, and similar spaces. In addition, the floor space must be divided into sufficient rooms to be adequate for the family. All rooms must be adequately ventilated. A qualifying sleeping room is one which is located in a building which meets the minimum requirements of items 1,4,6,7, and 8 listed above and meets the following additional requirements: 1. Has 9 square meters (100 square feet) of floor space for the first occupant and 5 square meters (50 square feet) of floor space for each additional occupant; 2. Has available lavatory and toilet facilities that provide privacy, including a door that can be locked, if facilities are separate from the room. Who May Be Eligible?  A long-term owner-occupant is one who has owned and occupied a dwelling for at least one hundred-eighty (180) days before the State made its first written offer.  As a long-term owner-occupant, you may be eligible for a Housing Supplement if you buy or a Rent Supplement if you rent. A short-term owner-occupant is one who has owned and occupied a dwelling for less than one hundred-eighty days, but not less than ninety (90) days from the State’s first written offer.  As a short-term owner-occupant, you may be eligible for a Down Payment Supplement if you buy or a Rent Supplement if you rent. A tenant who has legally occupied a dwelling for not less than ninety (90) days before the State’s written offer to purchase the property, may be entitled to a Down Payment Supplement if the tenant buys, or a Rent Supplement if the tenant rents. CLAIMING SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS How to Claim Payment for Replacement Housing Supplement or Rent Supplement: You will be advised personally of the benefits for which you may be eligible under the Relocation Assistance Program. 1. A form letter will also notify you of the amount of either of the foregoing supplements to which you may be entitled.

The term business operator means any person involved in any lawful activity, except a farm operation, conducted primarily: 1. For the purchase, sale, lease and/or rental of personal and/or real property, and/or for the manufacture, processing, and/or marketing of products, commodities, and/or any other personal property; or 2. Primarily for the sale of services to the public; or 3. By a nonprofit organization Some moving and related expenses may be payable when outdoor advertising displays are required to be moved. What is a “Farm Operator”?  A farm operator is any person who conducts any activity solely or primarily for the production of one or more agricultural products or commodities, including timber, for sale or home use and in sufficient quantity as to contribute materially to the operator’s support. This means  that the farm operation contributes at least one-third of the operator’s income. What if Only Part of My Business or Farm Operation Must be Moved? If only part of your business or farm must be moved, you may be eligible to receive the actual cost of moving personal property of the business or farm out of the area required for the highway. • “Actual Costs” Move Most displaced businesses, farms, or nonprofit organizations can claim: 1. Actual reasonable and necessary costs of moving inventory, machinery, office equipment, and similar business related personal property, up to a distance of 80 kilometers (50 miles).  There is no dollar limit on this amount, but every dollar claimed must be supported by a receipted bill. 2. Actual direct loss of tangible personal property as a result of moving or discontinuing a business, farm operation, or nonprofit organization, but not to exceed the cost of moving the item. 3. Purchase of substitute personal property subject to certain limitations. 4. Actual reasonable expenses in looking for a replacement business or farm site, not to exceed $2,500. 5. Certain actual reestablishment expenses, not to exceed $10,000. When to Claim Actual Moving Costs:  You should file your claim as soon as you have moved and paid the mover. The claim must be filed within eighteen (18) months after removal of the personal property, or the date the business operation vacated the premises, whichever is later. How to Claim Payment for Your Moving Costs:  Fill out the claim form provided. Your Relocation Agent will assist you if needed.  Attach the paid bills from the moving company and any others to the claim form.  Mail to:  Idaho Transportation Department, Right of Way Section, P.O. Box 7129, Boise, Idaho, 83707-1129. If you choose the “Actual Cost” method, you must do the following: 1. Prepare the certified inventory of the items to be moved; 2. Have your Relocation Agent obtain two estimates from licensed moving companies; 3. Provide your Relocation Agent with reasonable advance written notice of the approximate move date; 4. Move, pay the mover, get receipted bills; 5. Prepare the certified inventory of the items that were moved; 6. Fill out the claim form provided.

Your Relocation Agent will assist you if needed. 7. Mail to:  Idaho Transportation Department, Right of Way Section, P.O. Box 7129, Boise, Idaho, 83707-1129. When May I Expect Payment?  You should receive payment within thirty (30) days after your moving cost claim is approved. Instead of “Actual Cost” payments, some businesses, farms, or nonprofit organizations may elect to receive an “Agreed Self Move” payment or a “Displaced Business (Farm Operation or Nonprofit Organization)” payment. • Agreed Self Move What is the “Agreed Self Move Expense”?  This is an alternate procedure applicable only to businesses, farms, or nonprofit organizations who wish to move through their own efforts and utilizing their own equipment.  It is an amount negotiated between the State and the business, farm, or nonprofit organization, not to exceed the lower of two estimates obtained by the State. How Does the “Agreed Self Move” Payment Work? 1. Before you are ready to move, advise your Relocation Agent, you are interested in a Self Move.  Prepare a certified inventory of the items to be moved. 2. The State will obtain two estimates from licensed moving companies and/or specialists (depending on the nature of the items to be moved). 3. You will then be contacted for the purposes of negotiating an agreed amount to cover the cost of moving through your own efforts.  Upon reaching an agreement, you will be authorized to move. 4. Upon completion of your move, prepare a certified inventory of the items that were moved.  Then advise your Relocation Agent you have moved.  Fill out the claim form provided.  It must be filed within eighteen (18) months after the move is completed.  Your Relocation Agent will assist you, if needed. 5. Your claim will be reviewed and approved on the basis upon which you and the State previously agreed. • Fixed Payment (“in lieu”) What is a “Fixed Payment” for Moving Expenses (in lieu)?  Instead of “Actual Cost” or the “Agreed Self Move” moving expense payments, and Reestablishment expense payment, you may ask to be paid an amount equal to the average annual net earnings of the business or farm. Expect that such payment shall not be less than $1,000 nor more than $20,000.  Nonprofit organizations are also eligible for a fixed payment.  However, such payment is calculated differently than business and farm operations.  Contact your Relocation Agent for more specific information. What qualifies a Business for the Fixed Payment (“in lieu”)?  For a business to be eligible, the Idaho Transportation Department must determine that: 1. The business owns or rents personal property which must be moved in connection with such displacement, and for which an expense would be incurred in such move, and the business vacates or relocates from its displacement site; and 2. The business cannot be relocated without substantial loss of patronage, as measured by a substantial decrease in the dollar volume of business; and 3. The business is not part of a commercial enterprise having at least three other establishments which are not being acquired and which are engaged in the same or similar business; and 4. The business contributes materially to the income of the displaced owner; and 5. The business is not operated at a displacement dwelling for the purpose of renting such dwelling or site to others. What qualifies a Farm Operation for the Fixed Payment? For a farm to be eligible to choose this option: 1. The farm operator must have discontinued or relocated his entire farm operation at the present location; or 2. The partial acquisition caused a substantial change in the nature of the farm operation. What Are Average Annual Net Earnings?  Average annual net earnings are one-half of any net earning of the business or farm operation, before Federal, State or Local income taxes, during the two taxable years immediately preceding the taxable year in which the business or farm operation is displaced. How Are Average Annual Net Earnings Determined?  You may support earnings by submitting copies of  State or Federal income tax returns or a certified financial statement. For the purposes of this allowance, these net earnings will include compensation paid by the business or farm to the owner or the owner’s family during the two-year period.  In the case of a corporation, net shall include compensation paid to the spouse or dependents of the owner of a majority interest in the corporation. Example: 2002 2003 2004 Annual Net Annual net Year Displaced Earnings Earnings $25,000.00 $28,000.00 Average - $26,500.00 = Fixed Payment How to Claim a “Fixed Payment” Moving Expense:  Fill out the claim form provided.  Your Relocation Agent will assist you, if needed. Mail to: Idaho Transportation Department, Right of Way Section, P.O. Box 7129, Boise, Idaho, 83707-1129. When May I Expect Payment?  You should receive payment within thirty (30) days after your claim is approved. • Re-Establishment Expenses What is a Re-establishment Expense?  A business, farm, or non-profit organization may be eligible to receive up to $10,000 for certain kinds of actual expenses necessary to re-establish the business or farm operation. Eligible expenses must be reasonable and necessary.  The agency will determine the limits of the various kinds of expenses. The expenses may include, but are not limited to the following: • Repairs or improvements to the replacement property as required by code or ordinance. • Modification to the replacement property to accommodate the business operation. • Construction and installation costs for exterior signing. • Advertisement of replacement location. • Estimated increased costs of operation during the first two (2) years at the replacement site. • Some Ineligible Relocation Expenses: 1. The cost of moving items not considered to be personal property. 2. Loss of good will, profits, or trained employees. 3. Personal injury. 4. Legal fees for any appeal of your relocation benefits. 5. Costs for storage on property already owned by you. ADVERTISING SIGNS If you have a sign that has to be moved from the right of way, the Relocation Agent will obtain two bids from licensed sign companies. The bids will contain the depreciated reproduction cost of the sign and estimated cost of moving the sign. The lesser of the two is the amount of compensation you will receive to move your sign. How to Claim a Sign Moving Expense:  Fill out the claim form provided.  Your Relocation Agent will assist you, if needed. Mail to:  Idaho Transportation Department, Right of Way Section, P.O. Box 7129, Boise, Idaho, 83707-1129. When May I Expect Payment?  You should receive payment within thirty (30) days after your claim is approved. APPEAL What if a Person is Denied a Payment or Believes it Should be Greater? If you have been denied a payment or eligibility for assistance you believe you should receive, you should write to the District Engineer at the District Office address shown on page 20.  You must make your appeal within sixty (60) days from the date you received notice of the State’s initial determination.  Your letter should state all the facts as to why you disagree with the State’s determination.  The District Engineer will promptly and carefully review the facts of the case and notify you of the decision within a few days. If you are still dissatisfied after this first review of your case, you may appeal to the Chief Engineer of the Idaho Transportation Department, the address is: Idaho Transportation Department, P.O. Box 7129, Boise, Idaho, 83707-1129. This appeal must be made within thirty (30) days after receiving the decision from the District Engineer.

You also have the right to review and copy all non-confidential material pertinent to your appeal.  The Chief Engineer will notify you in writing of the appeal results. An alien not lawfully present in the United States shall not be eligible to receive relocation payments or any other assistance provided under 49 CFR Part 24 of the Uniform Act. District No. One 600 West Prairie Coeur d’Alene, ID 83815-8767 Phone: (208) 772-1200 District No. Two PO Box 837 (2600 North and South Highway) Lewiston, ID 83501-0837 Phone:  (208) 799-5090 District No. Three PO Box 8028 (8150 Chinden Blvd.) Boise, ID 83707-2028 Phone:  (208) 334-8300 District No. Four PO Box 2-A (216 Date Street) Shoshone, ID 83352-0820 Phone:  (208) 886-7800 District No. Five PO Box 4700 (5151 South 5th Street) Pocatello, ID 83205-4700 Phone:  (208) 239-3300 District No. Six PO Box 97 (206 North Yellowstone) Rigby, ID 83442-0097 Phone:  (208) 745-7781 APPENDIX 6.
