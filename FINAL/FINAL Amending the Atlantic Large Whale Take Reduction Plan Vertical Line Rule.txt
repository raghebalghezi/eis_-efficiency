INTRODUCTION AND EXECUTIVE SUMMARY	CHAPTER 1      The Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan (ALWTRP) is designed to protect three endangered species – the western North Atlantic stock of right whales, the Gulf of Maine stock of humpback whales, and the western North Atlantic stock of fin whales – from the risk of serious injury and death associated with entanglement in commercial fishing gear. The  ALWTRP consists of both regulatory and non-regulatory measures that, in combination, seek to assist the recovery of these large whale species. Since its implementation in 1997, the National Marine Fisheries Services (NMFS) has modified the ALWTRP on several occasions to address the risk of entanglement in gear employed by gillnet and trap/pot fisheries. In light of continued entanglements, NMFS intends to promulgate additional regulatory requirements to further reduce the risks posed by commercial fishing gear.      This Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) evaluates the biological, economic, and social impacts of a range of alternatives for modifying the ALWTRP, including NMFS' preferred alternative. The discussion that follows briefly summarizes its content and key findings. Specifically:• Section 1.1 provides information on the status of Atlantic large whale species and the nature of the entanglement problem;• Section 1.2 describes current ALWTRP requirements, as well as the requirements of the regulatory alternatives considered in this analysis;• Section 1.3 summarizes the conclusions of the biological, economic, and social impact analyses and identifies NMFS' preferred regulatory alternative;• Section 1.4 describes changes made to the EIS in response to public comment on the Draft EIS issued in July 2013, the proposed rule, and new information obtained during the development of those documents;• Section 1.5 discusses areas of controversy that may influence interpretation of the report's findings; and• Section 1.6 describes the organization of the report's remaining chapters.
1.1 STATUS OF LARGE WHALES AND THE NATURE OF ENTANGLEMENTS      Right whales, humpback whales, and fin whales are listed as endangered species under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), and are, therefore, considered strategic stocks under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA). Section 118(f)(1) of the MMPA requires the preparation and implementation of a Take Reduction Plan (TRP) for any strategic marine mammal stock that interacts with Category I or II fisheries. A Category I fishery is one in which the mortality and serious injury rate of a strategic stock is greater than or equal to 50 percent of the stock's potential biological removal (PBR) level – defined under the MMPA as the maximum number of animals, not including natural mortalities, that may be removed from a marine mammal stock while allowing that stock to reach or maintain its optimum sustainable population (OSP).1 A Category II fishery is one in which the mortality and serious injury rate of a strategic stock is greater than one percent but less than 50 percent of the stock's PBR. Because the strategic stocks noted above interact with Category I and II fisheries, under the MMPA, a TRP is required to assist in their recovery. In addition, the measures identified in the ALWTRP are beneficial to the survival of the Canadian east coast stock of minke whales, a species that is not listed as endangered or threatened under the ESA. The status of each of these species is  discussed in Chapter 4 and summarized briefly below.• Right Whale: The western North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) is one of the rarest of all large cetaceans and among the most endangered species in the world. NMFS estimates a minimum population size of 444. NMFS believes that the stock is well below the OSP, especially given apparent declines in the population; as such, the stock's PBR level has been set to 0.9 (Waring et al., 2013).2• Humpback Whale: As noted above, the North Atlantic humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) is listed as an endangered species under the ESA. For the Gulf of Maine stock of humpback whales, NMFS estimates  a minimum population size of 823 and has established a PBR level of 2.7 whales per year (Waring et al., 2013).• Fin Whale: NMFS has designated one population of fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) as endangered for U.S. waters of the North Atlantic, although researchers debate the possibility of several distinct subpopulations. NMFS estimates a minimum population size of 2,817 and PBR of 5.6 (Waring et al., 2013).• Minke Whale: As previously noted, the minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) is not listed as endangered or threatened under the ESA.           1 The optimum sustainable population of any stock or species is defined as the number of animals that will result in the maximum productivity of the stock or species, keeping in mind the carrying capacity of the habitat and the health of the ecosystem of which they form a constituent element (16 USC 1362(9)).2 The parameters for calculating the PBR level are described in the MMPA (See 16 USC 1362(20)).
The best estimate of the population of Canadian east coast minke whales is 20,741, with a minimum population estimate of 16,199. The PBR for this stock of minke whales is162 (Waring et al., 2013).      Atlantic large whales are at risk of becoming entangled in fishing gear because the whales feed, travel, and breed in many of the same ocean areas utilized for commercial fishing. While fishing gear is in the water, whales may become incidentally entangled in the lines and nets that make up trap/pot and gillnet fishing gear. The effects of entanglement can range from no permanent injury to serious injury and death.Exhibit 1-1 summarizes all known “serious injury” entanglements of right, humpback, fin, and minke whales from 1997 through 20103 (Waring et al. 2013). Humpback whales account for the greatest number of serious injury entanglements (35), followed by right whales (11); minke whales account for five serious injuries, while fine whales account for four. More detail relating to large whale entanglements is provided in Section 2.3: “Rationale for Rulemaking.”Exhibit 1-1 SERIOUS INJURY ENTANGLEMENTS      Exhibit 1-2 presents available data on fatal entanglements of Atlantic large whales from 1997 through 2010 (Waring et al 2013). Minke whales account for the most known  entanglement mortalities (31), followed by humpback whales (20), then right whales (8) and fin whale account for six.3 “Serious injury” means any injury that will likely result in mortality (50 CFR 229.2).
      While entanglement is a significant source of risk for Atlantic large whales, other factors influence whale survival. Historically, commercial whaling has presented the greatest threat to whale stocks, and is largely responsible for reducing the populations of certain species to endangered status. Broad adherence to a voluntary international ban on commercial whaling has reduced this threat to the most seriously endangered species. However, other threats remain, including collisions between whales and ships, as well as the adverse effects that water pollution, noise pollution, climate change, and reductions in prey availability may have on whale stocks. These threats are discussed further in Chapter 9: Cumulative Effects Analysis.Exhibit 1-2 FATAL ENTANGLEMENTS1.2 ATLANTIC LARGE WHALE TAKE REDUCTION PLAN1.2.1 Current ALWTRP Requirements      In response to its obligations under the MMPA, NMFS established the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Team (ALWTRT) in 1996 to develop a plan for reducing the incidental take of large whales in commercial fisheries along the Atlantic Coast. The ALWTRT consists of representatives from the fishing industry, state and Federal resource management agencies, the scientific community, and conservation organizations. The intent of the ALWTRT is to provide recommendations to NMFS in developing and amending the ALWTRP.   The ALWTRP seeks to reduce serious injury to or mortality of large whales due to incidental entanglement in U.S. commercial fishing gear. The Plan consists of restrictions on where and how gear can be set; research into whale populations, whale behavior, and fishing gear; outreach
to inform fishermen of the entanglement problem and to seek their help in understanding and solving the problem; enforcement efforts to help increase compliance with ALWTRP measures; and a program to disentangle whales that do get caught in gear. The fisheries currently regulated under the ALWTRP include:• Northeast/Mid-Atlantic American lobster trap/pot;• Atlantic blue crab trap/pot;• Atlantic mixed species trap/pot which includes, but is not limited to: crab (red, Jonah, and rock), hagfish, finfish (black sea bass, scup, tautog, cod, haddock, pollock, redfish (ocean perch), and white hake), conch/whelk, and shrimp;• Northeast sink gillnet;• Northeast anchored float gillnet;• Northeast drift gillnet;• Mid-Atlantic gillnet;• Southeastern US Atlantic shark gillnet; and• Southeast Atlantic gillnet.Chapter 2 of this EIS reviews the current ALWTRP requirements in greater detail.1.2.2 Alternatives Considered      NMFS is currently considering a suite of regulatory alternatives that would modify existing ALWTRP requirements to address ongoing entanglement issues. The alternatives under consideration would seek to reduce large whale entanglement through a variety of measures, such as increasing the number of traps per trawl, establishing a maximum breaking strength for vertical line, requiring weaker weak links, and seasonal closures. The alternatives would affect all trap/pot fisheries currently covered under the ALWTRP.      Chapter 3 describes in detail the regulatory alternatives evaluated in this EIS. The primary features of these alternatives are summarized below and outlined for comparison in Exhibit 1-3. For reference, Exhibit 1-4 shows the Northeast Region’s lobster management areas:• Alternative 1 (No Action): Under Alternative 1, NMFS would continue with the status quo, i.e., the baseline set of ALWTRP requirements currently in place.• Alternative 2: This alternative would increase the number of traps per trawl based on area fished and miles fished from shore [(0-3), (3-12), and (12+)] in the Northeast Region (Maine-North Carolina). Maine waters are managed based on zone, and the proposed number of traps per trawl differ based on
Maine zone. In the Southeast Region, measures include weaker weak links, a maximum breaking strength for vertical line, and requiring the use sinking line (free of objects) for the vertical line. The Alternative also includes a more robust gear marking program coast wide.• Alternative 3: Alternative 3 is a combination of NMFS proposed traps per trawl (Alternative 2) and ideas from our State partners. Maine Department of Marine Resources provided a proposal for traps per trawl based on Maine zones and distance from shore that differ from NMFS [(0-3), (3-6), (6-12),  and (12+)]. Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries proposed a closure in the Cape Cod Bay Critical Habitat area for all trap/pot fisheries from February1 through April 30th. Rhode Island Department of  Environmental Management requested a minimum 15 trap per trawl requirement in LMA 2 (12+) as opposed to NMFS’ 20 trap per trawl limit. New Hampshire Department of Fish and Game requested that New Hampshire state waters be exempt from the Plan. NMFS proposal is in effect in all waters and times of year that are not covered by the State proposals. In the Southeast Region, measures include weaker weak links, a maximum breaking strength for vertical line, and requiring the use of sinking line (free of objects) for the vertical line. The Alternative also includes a more robust gear marking program coast wide.• Alternative 4: Alternative 4 is the same as Alternative 2 with the addition of closures in certain areas as proposed by the Conservation/Scientist stakeholder group (see Chapter 3 for charts of areas). Three trap/pot closures are included in this proposal; Jordan Basin (Nov 1 to Jan 31); Jeffreys Ledge (Oct 1 to Jan 31); and Cape Cod Bay to Great South Channel (Jan 1 to April 30). NMFS proposal is in effect in all waters and times of year that are not covered by the closures. In the Southeast Region, measures include weaker weak links, a maximum breaking strength for vertical line, and requiring the use of sinking line (free of objects) for the vertical line. The Alternative also includes a more robust gear marking program coast wide.• Alternative 5: Alternative 5 is a combination of Alternatives 3 and 4. Where proposed trap/pot closures overlap (eg, Cape Cod Bay) the larger closure in time and area is proposed. NMFS proposal is in effect in all waters and times of year that are not covered by the state proposals or closures. In the Southeast Region, measures include weaker weak links, a maximum breaking strength for vertical line, and requiring the use of sinking line (free of objects) for the vertical line. The Alternative also includes a more robust gear marking program coast wide.• Alternative 6 (Draft): Alternative 6 (Draft) is similar to Alternative 5 but only includes 1 of the three trap/pot closures proposed in Alternative 5. NMFS proposal is in effect in all waters and times of year that are not covered by the closures. For this Alternative NMFS proposal is modified in Massachusetts state waters. In the Southeast Region, measures include weaker weak links, a maximum breaking strength for vertical line, and requiring the use of sinking
line (free of objects) for the vertical line. The Alternative also includes a more robust gear marking program coast wide.• Alternative 6 (Preferred): In response to comments received on the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS), NMFS formulated a final preferred alternative that builds upon Alternative 6 (Draft). Key differences under Alternative 6 (Preferred) include the following: (1) No gear marking would be required in Maine exempted waters; (2) New Hampshire state waters would be exempt from the traps per trawl requirement only; (3) a ¼ mile buffer was created around three inhabited islands in Maine to allow singles; (4) the Pocket Waters of Maine were defined as state waters and would have a minimum of two traps per trawl required; and (5) Rhode Island state waters would have a minimum of two traps per trawl required.

1.3 MAJOR CONCLUSIONS AND PREFERRED ALTERNATIVES1.3.1 Biological Impacts of Alternatives      Gear modification requirements and closures are a key component of the ALWTRP modifications under consideration. Section 5.1 of this EIS discusses the potential impact of these requirements on whale survival. The major requirements affecting whale survival include:• Buoy Line Requirements: The requirement to increase the number of traps per trawl in the Northeast is designed to reduce the amount of vertical lines in the water and thus, benefit large whales by reducing the frequency or severity of entanglement in buoy lines and associated gear. The Southeast requirements for a sinking line buoy line (free of objects) and lower breaking strengths of buoy line will also reduce the severity of entanglement in buoy lines.• Weak Link Requirements: The potential regulatory changes analyzed include provisions such as requiring that lobster and other trap/pot gear employ a weak link on all floatation and/or weighted devices attached to the buoy line. The specified strength and placement of weak links is designed so that, if a large whale does become entangled, it could exert enough force to break the weak link. Thus, the risk of serious injury or mortality would be reduced.• Set Restrictions and Gear Stowing Requirements: The potential regulatory changes under analysis include several restrictions on how trap/pot gear can be set. The requirement that vessels in the Southeast Federal waters remove their gear from the water and stow it on board before returning to port is designed to ensure that any interactions between gear and whales would be observed and reported in a timely fashion, permitting a more rapid response.      In addition to gear modification requirements, the potential changes to the ALWTRP include a range of restrictions on the location and timing of fishing activity. These include the seasonal closures of known right whale habitat areas. The general objective of all these potential changes is to limit the frequency and severity of interactions between whales and regulated trap/pot gear while avoiding implementation of costly requirements that yield limited risk reduction.      The biological impacts analysis incorporates quantitative and qualitative indicators that facilitate comparison of the impact of the regulatory alternatives on potential entanglement risks (see Exhibit 1-5 for the upper bound of these impacts).

Using Federal and state data sources, the model estimates the number of commercial fishing vessels that participate in each fishery. Depending on the location and fishery, the model employs a variety of methods to estimate the number of active vessels this differs from the number of permitted vessels.Key:0 = no change VL= Vertical LineCO= co-occurrence      The co-occurrence value estimated in the model is an index figure, integrated across the spatial grid, indicating the degree to which whales and the vertical line employed in gillnet or trap/pot fisheries coincide in the waters subject to the Plan. Biological impacts are characterized with respect to the percentage reduction in the overall co-occurrence indicator each alternative would achieve.      Exhibit 1-5 displays the estimated change in co-occurrence under each action alternative relative to the no-action alternative (Alternative 1). Alternative 2, which includes trawling requirements but no closures, is estimated to yield a reduction in co-occurrence of approximately 36 percent. Alternatives 3 through 6 (Draft and Preferred) add incrementally to this reduction through closure of high-risk areas at various times of year. The estimated impact of these closures is greater when affected vessels are assumed to suspend fishing rather than relocate to alternative fishing grounds. The greatest reduction in co-occurrence is achieved under Alternative 5,which includes modified trawling requirements as well as three closures (Jeffreys Ledge, Massachusetts Restricted Area #1, and Jordan Basin). Under this alternative, the estimated upper-bound reduction in co-occurrence is 42 percent.      In addition to impacts on large whale species, changes to ALWTRP regulations may affect other aspects of the marine environment, including other protected species, essential fish habitat (EFH), and directed catch and bycatch in affected fisheries. Analysis of these issues, addressed in Section 5.2 of this EIS, suggests no significant differences among Alternatives 2 through 6 (Draft and Preferred) with respect to impacts on essential fish habitat, directed catch, or bycatch; in each case, the impacts are generally expected to be minor. The alternatives differ,
however, with respect to the ancillary benefits they would afford other protected species. These differences stem from differences in the extent to which the alternatives would mandate requirements that could prove beneficial to potentially affected species of whales, porpoises, dolphins, seals, and sea turtles.1.3.2 Economic Impacts of Alternatives      The economic impact analysis, discussed in Chapter 6 of this EIS, examines estimated compliance costs for model vessels and calculates the overall cost to the commercial fishing industry of complying with the regulatory changes under consideration. The analysis measures the cost of complying with these new requirements relative to the status quo – i.e., a baseline scenario that assumes no change in existing ALWTRP requirements. Thus, all estimates of compliance costs are incremental to those already incurred in complying with the ALWTRP.1.3.2.1 Estimated Vessel Compliance Costs      The economic impact analysis first calculates the compliance costs for model vessels, defined by species sought and fishing location (see Section 6.2). Estimated vessel compliance costs include both the expenses associated with reconfiguring gear as required under the new ALWTRP regulations and the costs (or savings, for some vessel groups) associated with replacing gear more (or less) frequently due to gear loss.      The cost associated with converting trap/pot to comply with the ALWTRP modifications includes the labor and material costs associated with weak links, gear marking, and buoy line (see Section 6.2.2.2). Annualized costs are derived from estimates of the initial cost fishermen would incur to convert their gear before the regulations come into effect, as well as ongoing costs thereafter. A seven percent discount rate is used to annualize costs.      In addition, the costs associated with seasonal closures were analyzed (see Section 6.3). This analysis assumed a range of impacts resulting in a upper and lower bound depending on the industry’s response to the closures.1.3.2.2 Total Industry Compliance Costs      Once compliance costs for the model vessels are calculated, the analysis estimates the number of vessels represented by each model vessel (i.e., the number of vessels within a particular category). The analysis uses data on Federal and state-permitted vessels to estimate  the number of vessels in each category, identifying vessels that have actively fished with the applicable gear types and might therefore be affected by changes to the ALWTRP. After identifying and removing vessels that operate within exempt waters, each of the remaining vessels is assigned to the appropriate model vessel category.      The product of the annualized compliance cost estimate for each model vessel and the number of affected vessels in each category provides an estimate of annualized compliance costs for the category as a whole. The sum of compliance costs across all vessel categories provides
an estimate of annualized compliance costs for the commercial fishing industry. Section 6.5 describes the estimated costs of compliance with potential changes to the ALWTRP.1.3.2.3 Economic Impact ResultsExhibit 1-6 summarizes the estimated industry compliance costs for each of the regulatory alternatives, breaking the results down by fishing sector (lobster, other trap/pot, and gillnet). Depending on the alternative and scenario (upper versus lower bound) in question, the analysis indicates that the lobster fishery would incur roughly 80 percent to 90 percent of estimated costs. OTP vessels would also incur a significant share of costs, primarily because of the proposed minimum trawl-length requirements.4 The impact of the regulatory alternatives on other fisheries is likely to be minor, reflecting the costs associated with meeting new gear marking requirements.4 Due to insufficient data on vessel activity, the analysis of compliance costs under Alternatives 2  through 6 excludes potential impacts on trap/pot vessels operating in the Northern Inshore shrimp fishery. The Vessel Trip Report data incorporated in the Vertical Line Model identify only two such vessels; this suggests that much of the activity of trap/pot vessels in this fishery is accounted for by vessels that are not subject to Federal reporting requirements, presumably because they do not hold a Federal permit and fish only in state waters. Much of this activity is likely to occur in portions of Maine state waters that are currently exempt from ALWTRP requirements; under Alternatives 2 through 6, vessels operating in these waters would only be subject to ALWTRP gear marking provisions. Given these considerations, it is unlikely that exclusion of the Northern Inshore shrimp fishery from the analysis will lead it to substantially understate the costs of complying with Alternatives 2 through 6.

This alternative incorporates less stringent trawling requirements than specified under Alternative 2 and includes only the CCB Restricted Area closure, which affects relatively few vessels and poses limited costs. Alternative 4 is likely to pose the greatest costs. It includes three closures, two of which (Jeffreys Ledge and Massachusetts Restricted Area #1) cover large areas. The estimated impact of the closures specified under this alternative ranges from $1.3 million to $2.1 million per year. The cost of complying with Alternative 5 is likely to be somewhat less than that of complying with Alternative 4. The difference is attributable to a difference in trawling requirements, which are slightly less stringent under Alternative 5. In general, compliance with gear configuration requirements imposes the greatest costs, with estimates ranging as high as $4.4 million per year. The costs attributable to the seasonal closure of restricted areas also contribute significantly to the estimate of total compliance costs under Alternatives 4, 5, 6 (Draft and Preferred). In the upper bound scenario, the overall estimate for Alternative 6 (Preferred) is slightly higher than that for Alternative 3, but lower than the estimates for the other action alternatives. Gear marking costs are significantly lower under Alternative 6 (Preferred) because it does not require gear in Maine waters landward of the ALWTRP exemption line to be marked. In the lower bound scenario, this leads the estimate of total compliance costs for Alternative 6 (Preferred) to be lower than the corresponding figures for the other action alternatives.1-16
1.3.3 Social Impacts of Alternatives      The analysis of social impacts, discussed in Chapter 7, considers how compliance with the regulatory alternatives could affect the socioeconomic viability of fishing, fishermen’s quality of life and the economic welfare of the general public.1.3.3.1 Potentially Affected Communities      The social impact analysis first uses county-level data on affected fishing vessels to identify the communities at greatest risk of experiencing adverse social impacts stemming from the ALWTRP modifications under consideration (see Section 7.3). The analysis uses additional county-level socioeconomic data to characterize key features of the at-risk communities, examining economic, demographic, and social features that may influence the impact of the regulations on the region.      Hancock and Knox counties report the greatest value of landings with ALWTRP gear ($108.7 million and $94.6 million, respectively), as well as the greatest number of vessels fishing with such gear (approximately 949 and 953, respectively). The exposure of these counties to adverse impacts is heightened by the fact that landings made with ALWTRP gear account for a high percentage (91 percent in both cases) of overall ex-vessel revenues. Washington County (ME) is also highly exposed, with potentially affected landings of $51.8 million. Each of these counties is highly dependent on fishing, as measured by Hall-Arber et al.’s OARS score. Moreover, the high poverty and unemployment rates in these counties suggest that they have limited capacity to absorb additional economic stress. As a result, they are  particularly vulnerable to the impacts of ALWTRP regulations. Exhibit 1-7 lists the at-risk counties. The list is heavily weighted toward the Northeast, particularly several coastal counties in Maine where lobstering is prevalent. Although the dealer and processing sectors are small to medium in size  in these areas, they are frequently part of small communities and play an important role in regional economies in the state. Several of the Maine counties are rural and have limited economic diversification and/or higher than average unemployment and poverty rates. Other at- risk communities include urbanized ports (e.g., Gloucester, Portland, and New Bedford) where fishing activities are linked to major processing operations.1.3.3.2 Comparison of Vessel Compliance Costs to Ex-Vessel Revenues      To further examine the potential for socioeconomic impacts from the revised ALWTRP requirements, this analysis considers the economic burden placed on different classes of vessels (see Section 7.4.1). Placing vessel compliance costs in the context of typical ex-vessel revenues helps determine whether the costs will be significant enough to cause behavioral changes (e.g., vessel retirement) on the part of vessel operators. The analysis defines “heavily affected” vessels as those for which annualized compliance costs exceed 15 percent of mean annual revenues. The analysis further defines “at risk” vessels as those for which annualized compliance costs are between 5 and 15 percent of mean annual revenues.
      To identify potentially hard-hit sectors of the commercial fishing industry, the analysis compares estimates of average vessel compliance costs to estimates of average gross revenue per vessel. There is no clearly-defined threshold at which annualized costs represent a large enough percent of annual revenues that a vessel operator would cease fishing, or would otherwise suffer social and economic hardship.      Vessels that would not be affected by the seasonal closure of designated areas (Alternative 2) are likely to face substantially lower cost burdens than those affected by such closures (Alternatives 3-6 (Draft and Preferred)). In light of this difference, the analysis in Chapter 7 separately describes the estimated impact of Alternative 6 (Preferred) on these two groups of vessels.      For all the alternatives, it is difficult to discern precisely how the operators of heavily affected vessels will respond to the regulations. The assumption that all heavily affected vessels will cease fishing is highly conservative, and fishermen identified as heavily affected might find it economically possible to adjust to the modified ALWTRP regulations (e.g., by restricting their effort to exempted waters) rather than leave fishing.Exhibit 1-7KEY COMMUNITIES AFFECTED BY ALWTRP MODIFICATIONSAt-Risk County1StateMajor Ports2WashingtonMEBeals Island/Jonesport, Cutler, Eastport, LubecHancockMEStonington/Deer Isle, BucksportWaldoMEBelfast, Searsport, NorthportKnoxMERockland, Vinalhaven, Port ClydeLincolnMESouth Bristol, Boothbay HarborSagadahocMEGeorgetown, PhippsburgCumberlandMEPortland, HarpswellYorkMEKennebunkport/Cape Porpoise, YorkRockinghamNHHampton/Seabrook, Portsmouth, Isle of ShoalsEssexMAGloucester, Rockport, MarbleheadSuffolkMABoston HarborNorfolkMACohassetPlymouthMAPlymouth, Scituate, HinghamBarnstableMASandwich, Hyannis, Chatham, Provincetown, Woods HoleDukesMAVineyard HavenBristolMANew Bedford, Fairhaven, WestportNewportRIJamestown, Newport, Tiverton, Sakonnet PointWashingtonRIPoint Judith/GalileeNotes:1	For this analysis, at-risk counties are defined as those with over 100 active vessels that must comply withALWTRP requirements and which report annual landings of greater than two million pounds by vessels using gear potentially subject to regulation under the ALWTRP.

(2001) and McCay and Cieri (2000).
1.3.3.3 	Other Socioeconomic Impacts Negative Impacts      Fishermen may realize a variety of other negative social impacts in complying with ALWTRP modifications (see Section 7.5.1):• To avoid the requirements associated with the new ALWTRP regulations, fishermen may choose to fish increasingly in previously exempted waters. This could cause congestion, gear conflicts, and competition for fishing grounds in exempted waters to increase.• Furthermore, revised ALWTRP gear modification requirements may result in an increased incidence of gear loss. In addition to the costs incurred to replace lost gear, fishermen may spend more time and resources hauling, grappling for, and repairing gear. This could potentially increase  the hours that fishermen spend at sea.• Likewise, certain modifications to ALWTRP requirements may have safety implications for fishermen. For example, some smaller vessels may have a hard time increasing the number of traps per trawl. Finally, the compliance cost burden may create a competitive disadvantage for smaller lobster vessels, causing industry consolidation.• Competition for fishing grounds may increase if changes to the ALWTRP include the seasonal closure of certain fishing grounds. Most notably, fishermen who would otherwise fish in the closed area may relocate their effort to new grounds, increasing competition in those areas. Competition for fishing grounds may also increase to the extent that fishermen relocate from their traditional fishing grounds to exempted waters or waters that are otherwise subject to more moderate regulation. Tension, resentment, and conflict may result from attempts made by outsiders to exploit areas where they have not historically participated. Fishermen who are ultimately excluded from alternate grounds, and subsequently must sit out the season, may experience stress and anxiety associated with inactivity and lost income.Positive Impacts      Changes to the ALWTRP may also have a variety of positive social impacts. To the extent that the new ALWTRP regulations successfully protect and restore whale populations, members of the public who view and photograph whales would benefit from the regulations. Annual revenues from the New England whale watching industry total approximately $30 million, and studies indicate that consumers’ enjoyment increases with the number of whales and species sighted. Consequently, whale watch operators could benefit from increased ridership and revenues as whale populations stabilize or increase.
      Economic research indicates that society places a value on the knowledge that unique environmental resources exist, even without using the resource directly (often referred to as the “existence value” of a resource). Therefore, the preservation of right, humpback, fin, and minke whales would have an existence value that is not explicitly quantified in this EIS.      In addition, it is possible that in some cases, the management measures under consideration would have a beneficial effect on fishermen. The potential for such impacts was noted in a 2012 report on a collaborative pilot project conducted by the Maine Department of Marine Resources, the Gulf of Maine Lobster Foundation, and the lobster industry (Maine DMR, 2012). This project sought to determine the impact of fishing longer trawls in areas in which lobstermen traditionally have fished singles or pairs. The fishermen participating in this effort noted several potential benefits of switching to trawls. In particular:• Several fishermen noted they were able to haul traps configured in trawls more quickly than the same number of traps configured as singles, potentially resulting in decreased time spent at sea;• Several individuals noted that their success in grappling for lost gear was greater with trawls than with singles. Thus, those who switch from singles to trawls may spend less time in their efforts to recover lost gear.5Exhibit 1-8 summarizes the social impact conclusions discussed above.1.3.4 Preferred Alternative      Integration of the biological, economic, and social impact findings allows for a meaningful comparison of the regulatory alternatives. Integrating these findings typically allows formulation of measures that characterize the benefits derived relative to the costs (or other negative effects) incurred. However, in the case of the ALWTRP modifications, development of a unifying cost-benefit analysis is complicated by two factors:• First, the costs and benefits are characterized using diverse metrics (e.g., dollars, increased use of low-risk gear, numbers of heavily affected vessels) that cannot be readily reduced to a single measure. In  many cases, costs or benefits are described only in qualitative terms or are characterized with imperfect indicators (e.g., comparative measures of risk reduction potential).• Second, as acknowledged above, several of the regulatory alternatives have very similar implications. Because the impact estimates are subject           5 These time savings may be offset by an increased incidence of hang downs with longer trawls; however, the anecdotal evidence suggests that trawls did not hang-down with any greater frequency than the usual single/double trap configured gear.
to uncertainty, the minor variations that exist among these alternatives do not allow easy differentiation.      Based on the consideration of the relative costs and benefits of the alternatives, NMFS initially identified Alternative 5 as the preferred alternative in the DEIS. The rationale provided in the DEIS emphasized that this alternative achieved a high reduction in co-occurrence and provided the greatest protection to whales.      Comments on the DEIS have guided NMFS’ development of a final preferred alternative: Alternative 6 (Preferred). This alternative integrates changes to Alternative 6 (Draft) that takes into account the comments regarding the safety of those fishing in smaller vessels around islands and close to shore. Alternative 6 (Preferred) also reduces the economic impact of the proposed action while sacrificing few large whale protection benefits. These changes and reasons for the changes are as follows:• Alternative 6 (Preferred) would require the same number of trap/pot closures as proposed under Alternative 6 (Draft); however, this is less than the number of closures proposed under the original preferred alternative in the DEIS (Alternative 5). NMFS received numerous public comments opposing the three closures stating economic concerns and lack of evidence that the three closures would maximize the conservation benefit to large whales. Alternative 6 (Preferred) will implement one trap/pot closure in an area known to be an important right whale habitat.• Alternative 6 (Preferred) would require a minimum of two traps per trawl in Rhode Island state waters. This is similar to what was proposed for Massachusetts waters under Alternative 6 (Draft). Numerous commenters cited safety concerns for those fishing in inshore waters that would prevent them from fishing with a minimum of three traps per trawl. Allowing two traps per trawl instead of three would alleviate safety concerns while still resulting in a reduction of vertical lines since single traps would be banned.• NMFS received numerous comments opposing the proposed gear marking in the exempted waters. Many considered this impractical and potentially costly. Alternative 6 (Preferred) would not require gear marking in exempt waters but would still increase the length and frequency of the marks in regulated waters.• Alternative 6 (Draft) proposed to exempt New Hampshire state waters from the ALWTRP including both current and proposed management measures. Alternative 6 (Preferred) would exempt New Hampshire state waters from the proposed management measures only. Those fishing in state waters would not have to follow the proposed minimum number of traps per trawl requirement; however, they would still be required to mark their gear and following current regulations (use of weak links and sinking groundline, etc).• Alternative 6 (Preferred) includes two changes in the coastal waters of Maine to address the numerous comments NMFS received about safety concerns regarding the proposed number of traps per trawl. First, a ¼ mile buffer would be created around three inhabited islands in Maine (Monhegan, Ragged, and Matinicus) that would allow those fishing in
these areas to continue to fish with single traps. Second, NMFS would allow those fishing in Maine’s pocket waters to abide by the proposed traps per trawl requirement for state waters even though Maine’s pocket waters occur outside the 3-mile line traditionally used to define state waters. NMFS Office of Law Enforcement defines these waters as state waters for enforcement purposes. To ease enforcement and address safety concerns NMFS would adopt this definition of pocket waters.      Because the alternatives all affect roughly the same number of vessels, the expected magnitude of such impacts across alternatives is likely to be similar. The potential for increased crowding, competition and gear conflicts, however, is greatest under Alternatives 4 and 5, which include the most extensive seasonal area closures.      The public welfare benefits associated with increased whale protection are likely to be similar across all alternatives. As noted, the analysis measures the change in whale protection offered by a given alternative as a change in the co-occurrence of whales and vertical lines. By this measure, Alternative 5 offers the greatest protection to whales, with a reduction in co- occurrence (upper bound scenario) of 42 percent. Alternative 2 offers the least benefit, with a reduction in co-occurrence (lower bound scenario) of 36 percent. These biological benefits have socioeconomic implications for the general public. Increasing whale populations would have a positive impact on the consumer surplus derived from whale watching (a use benefit) and may increase producer surplus for operators of whale watch vessels. Likewise, whale conservation may enhance intrinsic values that society holds for healthy, flourishing whale populations.

The minimum trawl length requirements yield the greatest reduction in co-occurrence for the associated compliance cost. In contrast, closures are less cost-effective, as evidenced by their higher cost per unit reduction in co-occurrence.Alternative 3 is the most cost-effective of the alternatives ($56,000 to $119,000 per unit of co-occurrence reduction). This is in part because the costs attributed to the seasonal closure of the Cape Cod Bay Restricted Area are relatively low. In addition, this alternative includes modifications to the gear reconfiguration requirements specified in Alternative 2 that are estimated to have a greater impact on co-occurrence at a lower total cost. On this basis, Alternative 3 can be considered superior to Alternative 2.      NMFS has considered the benefit and cost information presented above and designated Alternative 6 (Preferred) as its preferred alternative. The reduction in co- occurrence achieved under this alternative is greater than that estimated for some of the other alternatives considered, including than that achieved under Alternatives 2, or 3.  The reduction in co-occurrence achieved under Alternative 4 and 5 is greater than that achieved under Alternative 6 (Preferred) but does so at a higher estimated cost. NMFS believes that its preferred alternative addresses the Purpose and Need for Action stated in this FEIS, incorporating measures that will help to conserve large whales by reducing the potential for interactions with commercial fishing gear that may lead to serious injury or mortality. In addition, NMFS believes that its preferred alternative achieves these goals while reducing, to the extent possible, the adverse socioeconomic impacts of the rule. On this basis, NMFS believes that Alternative 6 (Preferred) offers the best option for achieving compliance with MMPA and ESA requirements.1.4 CHANGES FROM DEIS TO FEIS      In response to public comment on the DEIS and proposed rule, as well as new information obtained since the development of these documents, NMFS has made a number of changes to the EIS. The most important substantive changes include:• Modifications to Alternative 6 (Draft), which resulted in the addition of Alternative 6 (Preferred) to the analysis.• Alternative 6 (Preferred) was chosen as the preferred alternative instead of Alternative 5 which was previously labeled as preferred in the DEIS. Alternative 6 (Preferred) incorporates modifications to exemptions and required number of traps per trawl in New Hampshire and Rhode Island state waters; addition of a ¼ mile buffer around three inhabited Maine islands; defining Maine’s pocket waters as state waters; and modification to the gear marking scheme. Discussion of Alternative 6 (Preferred) has been added to Volume I of the EIS where appropriate.• Updates to the large whale entanglement information presented in Chapter 2 of Volume I.
• Updates on recent actions for Fishery Management Plans, which is incorporated into Chapters 4 and 9.• Expansion of “other affected species” section to further discuss the effects of climate change, ocean noise, offshore wind/energy projects and exempted areas on sea turtles.• Updates and adjustments to the analysis of Alternatives presented related to correcting a coordinate of Maine’s 6-mile line.• Addition of Volume II of the EIS, which describes NMFS’ response to comments received during the public comment period on the DEIS and proposed rule; provides a summary of written and oral comments received during the scoping meetings following the agency’s publication of the Notice of Intent to prepare an EIS; and provides copies of written comments on the DEIS that were received.1.5 AREAS OF CONTROVERSY      Numerous interest groups have participated in the formulation and refinement of the ALWTRP. In addition to ALWTRT meetings, NMFS supported this rulemaking by conducting  a series of public meetings held at various locations on the east coast during the summer of 2011, and further refined the alternatives based on public comment on the DEIS. Through public outreach, NMFS has attempted to gather and accommodate many viewpoints, pursuing whale conservation objectives while remaining sensitive to the many regulatory pressures on the fishing industry. The dialogue that has occurred highlights a number of key areas of controversy that NMFS attempted to address in the regulatory alternatives examined:• Whale conservationists emphasize that whale entanglements have continued despite the existing ALWTRP requirements. Some conservationists think that NMFS should reduce the risk associated with vertical line immediately and not wait for the rulemaking process. Continued serious injury and mortality of right, humpback, and fin whales due to entanglement is the primary motivating factor behind refinement of the ALWTRP. The alternatives under consideration seek to reduce large whale entanglement by decreasing the number of vertical lines in the  water or modifying the gear so that the resulting entanglement does not result in a serious injury or mortality. Chapter 3 of Volume I further explains the revisions under consideration to the existing ALWTRP.• A fundamental issue concerns the significance of fishing gear entanglement within the overall context of factors that contribute to Atlantic large whale mortality. The cumulative effects analysis in this EIS considers other stresses on whales (for example, ship strikes and water pollution) and the measures underway to address these stresses through other initiatives.
• Specification of areas and times of proposed closures are in effect is a major issue of concern. Because whales exhibit regular behavioral  patterns (e.g., migration, feeding), NMFS seeks to maximize the effectiveness of the ALWTRP by designating requirements tailored by region and season. Development of these spatial and temporal requirements involves the consideration of uncertainties and the integration of complex technical input from NMFS researchers and other experts. This EIS examines regulatory alternatives that introduce new gear modification requirements and other provisions that incorporate information about whale movements and behavior. Although much of this information is subject to uncertainty, the information employed in developing the spatial and temporal elements of the alternatives under consideration is the best information currently available.• Delineation of exempt waters has been a key issue. Conservation advocates stress that extending regulations to all waters offers the greatest protection against entanglement, while other groups argue for exemptions in nearshore waters where recorded whale activity is minimal. NMFS examined right, humpback, and fin whale sightings data in relation to nearshore waters along the east coast of the U.S. This analysis revealed that large whales rarely venture into certain nearshore areas. The alternatives considered in this EIS include modifications to exempted areas that take into account the available data on large whale sightings, amongst other factors.• The fishing industry is concerned that interactions between large whales and Canadian fishing gear are not being adequately addressed and that theU.S. fishing industry is bearing the entire regulatory burden by being held responsible for all large whale entanglements. Although the measures under consideration in this EIS are designed to address entanglement risks posed by fisheries in U.S. waters, NMFS recognizes that large whales face entanglement risks throughout their range. For example, NMFS is  working with representatives from the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) to develop and implement protective measures for right whales in Canadian waters. In anticipation of the implementation of Canada’s new Species at Risk Act, the group was reconstituted in January 2003. The group remains focused on species-specific  conservation, but the charge for the working group has been expanded to include joint assessments, listing criteria, and recovery planning and implementation in a broader sense to include all transboundary marine mammal and protected species stocks (with the exception of Atlantic salmon). The working group’s primary efforts are focused on right whale recovery. The working group published a recovery strategy for the North Atlantic Right Whale in June 2009. DFO is currently working on action plans to addess
the implementation of the recovery strategy. NMFS is continuing to work with the Canadian government to develop and implement protective measures for right whales in Canadian waters. In addition, NMFS is working with Canadian whale biologists and support teams to improve and expand disentanglement efforts in Canadian waters.• Some segments of the commercial fishing industry have expressed concern over the trawling up requirements, stressing safety issues for those that operate in smaller vessels nearshore. The alternatives considered in this EIS offer options for these vessels.• A final area of controversy has been the rate at which new requirements are introduced. In general, conservationists and NMFS have  recommended a more rapid phase-in, while fishing interests have recommended a longer phase-in. The alternatives considered in this EIS seek to balance these recommendations.1.6 REPORT STRUCTUREThe remainder of this EIS is organized as follows:• Chapter 2 reviews the entanglement problem and discusses current ALWTRP requirements.• Chapter 3 describes the proposed alternatives for modifying the ALWTRP.• Chapter 4 examines the affected environment, focusing on the status of Atlantic large whales and the basic features of the regulated fisheries.• Chapter 5 analyzes the biological impacts of the alternatives.• Chapter 6 analyzes the economic impacts of the alternatives.• Chapter 7 analyzes the social impacts of the alternatives.• Chapter 8 reviews and summarizes the findings of the biological, economic, and social impact analyses.• Chapter 9 examines the cumulative impacts of the alternatives.• Chapter 10 provides the Regulatory Impact Review (RIR), as required by Executive Order 12866.

PURPOSE AND NEED FOR ACTION	CHAPTER 2      The purpose of the revisions to the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan (ALWTRP) that are under consideration is to conserve and provide additional protection to Atlantic large whales, including North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis), North Atlantic humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), and fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus). Such revisions would fulfill NMFS' obligations under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA). The need for the revisions under consideration is demonstrated by the continuing risk to Atlantic large whales of serious injury or mortality due to entanglement in commercial fishing gear. This chapter describes in detail the purpose and need for revisions to the existing ALWTRP. It is organized as follows:• Section 2.1 provides an overview of the statutory and regulatory context in which the ALWTRP was created. This section includes descriptions of  the MMPA and the ESA, and discusses how the ALWTRP allows the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to fulfill its obligations under both Acts.• Section 2.2 summarizes the existing ALWTRP.• Section 2.3 presents historical data on large whale entanglements, and demonstrates the need for additional action under the ALWTRP.2.1	STATUTORY AND REGULATORY CONTEXT      Right, humpback, and fin whales are protected by the MMPA and the ESA. The ALWTRP was created in response to provisions of the MMPA, and under its authority. Sections2.1.1 and 2.1.2 describe the protections that the MMPA and ESA provide for Atlantic large whales, and the requirements of the MMPA that led to the creation of the ALWTRP.
2.1.1 The Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) and Atlantic Large Whales      The MMPA of 1972 provides protection for species or stocks that are, or may be, in danger of extinction or depletion as a result of human activities. The MMPA states  that measures should be taken immediately to replenish the population of any marine mammal species or stock that has diminished below its optimum sustainable level. With respect to any stock or species, the “optimum sustainable population” is the number of animals that will result in the maximum productivity of the stock or species, keeping in mind the carrying capacity of  the habitat and the health of the ecosystem of which they form a constituent element.      Under the MMPA, the Secretary of Commerce is responsible for the conservation and management of pinnipeds (other than walruses) and cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises), among other species that spend the majority of their life in marine areas.1 The Secretary of Commerce has delegated MMPA authority to NMFS. Part of the responsibility that NMFS has under the MMPA involves monitoring populations of marine mammals to maintain optimum levels. If a population falls below its optimum level, it is considered "depleted," and a conservation plan may be developed to guide research and management actions to restore the population to healthy levels.      In 1994, Congress amended the MMPA, establishing new provisions to govern the taking of marine mammals incidental to commercial fishing operations.2 These new provisions include the preparation of stock assessments for all marine mammal stocks in waters under U.S. jurisdiction. They also include the development and implementation of take reduction plans for stocks that may be reduced or are being maintained below their optimum sustainable population due to interactions with commercial fisheries.      Take reduction plans are required for all "strategic stocks." Under the MMPA, a "strategic stock" is a stock: (1) for which the level of direct human-caused mortality exceeds the Potential Biological Removal (PBR) level; (2) that is declining and is likely to be listed under the ESA in the foreseeable future; or (3) that is listed as a threatened or endangered species under the ESA or as a depleted species under the MMPA.3 The immediate goal of a take reduction plan is to reduce, within six months of its implementation, the mortality and serious injury of strategic stocks incidentally taken in the course of U.S. commercial fishing operations to below the PBR levels established for such stocks. The long-term goal of a take reduction plan is to reduce, within five years of its implementation, the incidental mortality and serious injury of strategic marine mammals taken in the course of commercial fishing operations to insignificant levels approaching a zero mortality and serious injury rate, taking into account the economics of the           1 The Secretary of the Interior is responsible for walruses, sea and marine otters, polar bears, manatees and dugongs.           2 As defined in the MMPA, the term "take" means to harass, hunt, capture, or kill, or attempt to harass, hunt, capture, or kill any marine mammal.           3 The Potential Biological Removal (PBR) level is defined in the MMPA as the maximum number of animals, not including natural mortalities, that may be removed from a marine mammal stock annually while allowing that stock to reach or maintain its optimum sustainable population. The parameters for calculating the PBR level are described in the MMPA.
fishery, the availability of existing technology, and existing state or regional fishery management plans.4      Right whales, humpback whales, and fin whales are listed as endangered species under the ESA and are thus considered strategic stocks under the MMPA. In response to its obligations under the MMPA, NMFS established the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Team (ALWTRT) in 1996 to develop a plan for reducing the incidental take of large whales in commercial fisheries along the Atlantic Coast to below PBR. The ALWTRT consists of representatives from the fishing industry, state and Federal resource management agencies, the scientific community, and conservation organizations. The purpose of the ALWTRT is to provide guidance to NMFS in developing and amending the ALWTRP to meet the goals of the MMPA with respect to Atlantic large whales. The last meeting of the full ALWTRT was held in January of 2012.2.1.2 The Endangered Species Act (ESA) and Atlantic Large Whales      The ESA provides for the conservation of endangered and threatened species that are at risk of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of their range and the conservation of the ecosystems on which they depend.5 The right whale, humpback whale, and fin whale species are all federally listed as endangered and are therefore subject to protection under the ESA. Section  7 of the ESA directs all Federal agencies to use their existing authorities to conserve threatened and endangered species and to ensure that their actions do not jeopardize listed species or destroy or adversely modify critical habitat. When a proposed Federal action may affect an ESA-listed marine species, Section 7 directs that the "Action agency" consult with the Secretary of Commerce; this is referred to as a Section 7 consultation.6,7 The Secretary of Commerce has delegated this consultation authority to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). During a Section 7 consultation initiated to assess impacts of a NMFS action on an endangered whale species, NOAA acts as the Action agency and represents the Secretary of Commerce, as the consulting agency. The following are examples of actions by NMFS that may result in Section 7 consultations:• Issuance of measures implementing a fishery management plan;           4 Unlike PBR, the MMPA does not define the calculation of "insignificant" mortality and serious injury rates approaching zero. For the purposes of the ALWTRP, NMFS has established a long-term goal of reducing incidental mortality rates to no more than ten percent of the PBR level for each stock. NMFS developed and published a formal regulatory definition of "zero mortality rate goal." See NMFS’ July 20, 2004, final rule (69 FR 43338).           5 "Species," as defined by the Act, includes any subspecies of fish, wildlife, or plant and any distinct population segment of any vertebrate species which interbreeds when mature.           6 The "Action agency" is the Federal agency charged with permitting, conducting or funding the proposed activity serving as the basis for the consultation.           7 Federal agencies must consult with the Secretary of the Interior when a proposed action may affect an ESA-listed species under the Department of Interior’s purview.
• Issuance of exempted fishing permits;• Measures to implement a take reduction plan; and• NMFS’ provision of funds to support research activities.      Section 7 consultations may be formal or informal. Informal consultation provides an opportunity for communication between the consulting agency (e.g., NMFS) and the Action agency in order to identify whether formal consultation is needed and, if so, to identify how the proposed action could be modified to avoid adverse effects. Communication between these parties may occur via letters, phone calls, in-person meetings, or any combination of these.  The duration and complexity of these interactions depends on a number of variables, including the species in question, the effects of the proposed activity, and the available data, among others. These discussions are designed to identify and resolve potential concerns at an early stage in the process, thereby avoiding formal consultation. If the conclusion of the informal consultation is that the proposed action is not likely to adversely affect a listed species, the Section 7 process is concluded. If the consulting agency  concludes that the proposed action may affect a listed species or designated critical habitat and the Action agency cannot modify the proposed action to avoid the likelihood of adverse effects, then a formal consultation must occur.      A formal consultation requires the consulting agency to prepare a Biological Opinion as to whether or not the proposed action is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed species or adversely modify critical habitat.  Under the ESA, if a Biological Opinion finds that a proposed action is likely to jeopardize a listed species or adversely modify critical habitat, the consulting agency must identify "Reasonable and Prudent Alternatives," which the Action agency should assist in developing. Reasonable and Prudent Alternatives (RPAs) are alternative actions identified during formal  consultation  that(1)  can  be  implemented  in  a  manner consistentwith the intended purpose of the action; (2) can be implemented consistent with the scope of the Action agency's legal authority and jurisdiction; (3) are economically and technically feasible; and (4) avoid the likelihood of jeopardizing the continued existence of listed species or resulting
in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat. If adopted by the action agency, the reasonable and prudent alternatives do not undergo subsequent consultation to meet the requirements of section 7(a)(2). The action agency's acceptance in writing of the Services' reasonable and prudent alternative concludes the consultation process. Exhibit 2-1 illustrates the ESA Section 7 decision process.      To assess effects on large whale, sea turtle, and listed fish species protected under the ESA, NMFS has prepared Biological Opinions for the continued authorization of Federal fisheries under the Fishery Management Plans for the multispecies, spiny dogfish, and monkfish fisheries, and under Federal regulations for the lobster fishery, amongst others. Section 7 consultations were first initiated for each of these fisheries either at the time that the Fishery Management Plan was created to manage the fishery or, in the case of lobster, at the time of a significant amendment (Amendment 5) to the Federal Lobster Management Plan. The Northeast multispecies fishery has a long consultation history, including formal and informal Section 7 consultations, beginning with a formal consultation initiated on June 12, 1986. Formal consultation was first initiated for spiny dogfish on August 13, 1999; for monkfish on December 21, 1998; and for lobster on March 23, 1994.8 Subsequent ESA Section 7 consultations on those fisheries incorporated the ALWTRP as a Reasonable and Prudent Alternative to avoid jeopardy to right whales. NMFS reinitiated consultation on May 4, 2000, for the multispecies, spiny dogfish, and monkfish gillnet fisheries, and on June 22, 2000, for the lobster fishery, following(1) new whale entanglements resulting in serious injuries to right whales; (2) at least one right whale mortality in gillnet gear; (3) new information indicating a declining status for western North Atlantic right whales; and (4) revisions to the ALWTRP.      The Biological Opinions from the May/June 2000 reinitiated Section 7 consultations, finalized June 14, 2001, found that NMFS' administration of the four Federal fisheries, as modified by the ALWTRP requirements in effect at that time, was likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the western North Atlantic right whale.9 The Biological Opinions identified a Reasonable and Prudent Alternative with multiple components designed to avoid the likelihood of jeopardy to right whales. The RPA measures included:• Seasonal Area Management (SAM);• Dynamic Area Management (DAM);• An expansion of gillnet gear modification requirements and restrictions to Mid-Atlantic waters and modification of fishing practices in Southeastern waters;           8 The spiny dogfish and monkfish species were subject to Section 7 consultation as part of the multispecies fishery until managed under their own management plans in 1999. The lobster fishery was first considered in a formal consultation on the effects of all fisheries (including the lobster fishery in Federal waters) on threatened and endangered species conducted for the implementation of the Marine Mammal Exemption Program in 1988.           9 The June 14 Biological Opinions also concluded that these fisheries were not likely to destroy or adversely modify habitat critical to right whales or to jeopardize the continued existence of other endangered species.
• Continued gear research and modifications; and• Additional measures that implement and monitor effectiveness of the Reasonable and Prudent Alternative.These measures were intended, in combination, to reduce the risk of serious injury and mortality to large whales from entanglements in commercial fishing gear.      The SAM and DAM programs and revised gear modification requirements and restrictions, as specified in the June 14, 2001, Biological Opinions for the multispecies, spiny dogfish, and monkfish Fishery Management Plans, and Federal regulations for the American lobster fishery, were incorporated into the ALWTRP via a series of final rules, corrections, and technical amendments issued from January 2002 to August 2003. In this way, NMFS implemented the Reasonable and Prudent Alternative specified in the June 14, 2001, Biological Opinions to meet its obligations under Section 7 of the ESA.      An informal consultation under the ESA was concluded for the rule to modify the ALWTRP on December 21, 2004. As a result of the informal consultation, the Regional Administrator determined that the measures to modify the ALWTRP were not likely to adversely affect ESA-listed cetaceans, sea turtles, fish, or critical habitat that occur within the area affected by the rulemaking. Modifications were made to the ALWTRP to more broadly address the incidental entanglement of large whales in fishing gear that result in serious injury and  mortality. Some of these modifications (e.g., regulating additional trap/pot and gillnet fisheries under the ALWTRP, requiring the broad-based use of sinking and/or neutrally buoyant groundline) are expected to have an effect on ESA-listed species. However, depending on the species, all of the effects are expected to be either beneficial or negligible.        In 2002, eight right whales were observed entangled after implementation of the RPA measures. One of the eight, a female right whale born in 2000 (RW 3107), had line with an attached buoy wrapped around and cutting into her tail stock. Several disentanglement attempts were made and she was subsequently freed of the gear. The recovered gear was examined to obtain further information on the entanglement event. NMFS could not positively identify the fishery or owner of the gear. However, based on the examination, NMFS concluded that the gear was consistent with that used in the inshore lobster trap fishery (Whittingham et al., 2003). This conclusion was based on the configuration of the recovered gear, including the presence of a weak link with a breaking strength of no more than 600 lb (272.4 kg). Six weeks after the disentanglement, her carcass washed ashore on Nantucket, MA.        Although the exact cause of death could not be determined, the necropsy of RW 3107 did reveal substantial tissue damage to the tail stock in the area where the entangling gear had been present. A draft necropsy report describes the most likely cause of death (based on the available evidence) as an infection or other debilitating condition caused by the injuries to the  tail stock. NMFS reviewed the necropsy report and considered whether it provided sufficient information to show, based on RPA monitoring criteria, that the RPA was not effective at avoiding the likelihood of jeopardy to right whales. On June 13, 2003, NMFS received confirmation from the Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) that the Atlantic Scientific Review Group (ASRG) concurred with the NEFSC finding that the death of RW 3107 was an entanglement related mortality.
        There is no way to determine exactly when and where RW 3107 became entangled. She was last seen prior to the entanglement in December 2001 off of South Carolina. She was next seen (entangled) in July 2002 in Canadian waters off of Nova Scotia. Although RW 3107 could have become entangled in Canadian waters, NMFS considers this unlikely since Canadian trap fishers (whether for lobster, crab, or fish) are not required to use a 600-lb (272.4-kg) weak link. The more likely scenario is that RW 3107 became entangled in U.S. waters. While it is possible that she became entangled prior to when the RPA measures went into effect, this is somewhat irrelevant since the weak link on the entangling gear was the same breaking strength as that required by the RPA for certain lobster fishing areas.        In summary, while the gear recovered from RW 3107 cannot be identified as originating from the U.S. lobster fishery, NMFS has determined that the gear is consistent with gear approved for use in the lobster fishery that is conducted in portions of the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). In addition, NMFS has been advised that RW 3107 died as a result of injuries caused by the entanglement. Therefore, based on the RPA monitoring criteria from the June 14, 2001, Biological Opinion, NMFS concluded that the entanglement event for RW 3107 provides evidence that the RPA described in the June 14, 2001, Opinion is not effective at avoiding the likelihood of jeopardizing the continued existence of right whales by the lobster trap fishery.2.1.2.1 ALWTRP and Biological Opinions      At the 2003 ALWTRT meeting, the ALWTRT agreed to manage entanglement risk by first reducing the risk associated with groundlines and then reducing the risk associated with vertical lines in commercial trap/pot and gillnet gear. In June 2005, NMFS issued a proposed rule and in October 2007, NMFS issued a final rule which implemented broad-based gear modifications to replace the SAM and DAM programs. This broad-based gear modification strategy includes expanded weak link and sinking groundline requirements; additional gear marking requirements; changes in boundaries; seasonal restrictions for gear modifications; expanded exempted areas; and regulatory language changes for the purposes of clarification and consistency (72 FR 57104, October 5, 2007). The broad-based sinking groundline requirement for trap/pot fishermen became fully effective on April 5, 2009. This final rule also incorporates a recent amendment to the ALWTRP (72 FR 34632, June 25, 2007) that implemented, with revisions, previous ALWTRP regulations by expanding the Southeast U.S. Restricted Area to include waters within 35 nm (64.82 km) of the South Carolina coast, dividing the Southeast U.S. Restricted Area into Southeast U.S. Restricted Areas North and South, and modified regulations pertaining to gillnetting within the Southeast U.S. Restricted Area.      As stated previously, a number of Biological Opinions on fisheries issued in 2001 concluded that continued operation of these fisheries was likely to jeopardize the continued existence of ESA-listed right whales as a result of entanglement in pot/trap gear used in the fishery. The RPA in these Biological Opinions included, in part, implementation of the SAM program and the DAM program to reduce the likelihood that right whale interactions with pot/trap gear used in the American lobster fishery would result in serious injury or mortality. The RPA measures were implemented as part of the ALWTRP. Following implementation of these measures which replaced the DAM and SAM programs with broad-based gear modifications, consultation on these fisheries was reinitiated. These consultations, which concluded in October
2010, evaluated the effect of the proposed action, which included the measures under each of the fishery management plans as well as those under the ALWTRP. Specifically, these Biological Opinions stated that it was anticipated that the final regulations implementing the vertical line strategy would prioritize risk reduction in areas where there is the greatest co-occurrence of vertical lines and large whales. The Biological Opinions stated that a model was being developed and constructed to allow gear configurations to be manipulated and determine what relative co- occurrence reductions (as a proxy for risk) can be achieved by gear configuration changes and/or effort reductions by area. This co-occurrence analysis is an integral component of the vertical line strategy that will further minimize the risk of large whale entanglement and associated serious injury and death. The Opinions identified the steps being taken by the agency to develop, analyze and implement a vertical line reduction rule including stating that the proposed rule would be published in 2013 and the final rule in 2014. After reviewing the current status of right, humpback, fin, and sei whales as well as loggerhead and leatherback sea turtles, the environmental baseline and cumulative effects in the action area, the effects of the continued operation of the American Lobster, bluefish, dogfish, monkfish, multispecies, skate, squid, mackerel and butterfish and summer flounder, scup and Northern black sea bass FMPs, in compliance with the requirements of the ALWTRP, in October 2010 NMFS issued its Biological Opinions that these proposed activities are likely to adversely affect, but not jeopardize the continued existence of these species.      Following implementation of the ground line rule, the NMFS and the ALWTRT turned focus to vertical line risk reduction, consistent with the decision of the ALWTRT in 2003.  At  the 2009 ALWTRT meeting, the Team agreed on a schedule to develop a management approach to reduce the risk of serious injury and mortality due to vertical line. As a result of this schedule, NMFS committed to publishing a final rule to address vertical line entanglement by 2014 as previously presented in the Biological Opinions. The approach for the vertical line rule focuses on reducing the risk of vertical line entanglements in high impact areas versus a wide-broad scale management scheme. Using fishing gear survey data and whale sightings per unit effort (SPUE), a model was developed to determine the co- occurrence of fishing gear density and whale density. The ALWTRT Northeast Subgroup met in November 2010 and the Mid- Atlantic/Southeast Subgroup met in April 2011 to review the co-occurrence model and consider its implications for an overall management strategy to address vertical line entanglements. The Team agreed NMFS should use the model to consider and develop possible options to address fishery interactions with large whales by reducing the potential for entanglements, minimizing adverse effects if entanglements occur, and mitigating the effects of any unavoidable entanglements. In July and August 2011, 15 scoping meetings were held along the coast  to solicit feedback on the vertical line risk reduction strategy. The information provided at the scoping meetings was reviewed at a full ALWTRT meeting in January 2012.2.2 OVERVIEW OF THE ATLANTIC LARGE WHALE TAKE REDUCTION PLAN (ALWTRP)      The ALWTRP seeks to reduce serious injury to and/or mortality of large whales due to incidental entanglement in U.S. commercial fishing gear. Although the plan is focused on right, humpback, and fin whales, its implementation also benefits minke whales. The ALWTRP consists of restrictions on where and how gear can be set; research into whale populations, whale
behavior, and fishing gear; outreach to inform fishermen of the entanglement problem and to seek their help in understanding and solving the problem; and a program to disentangle whales that do get caught in gear.10 Section 2.2.1 summarizes the gear types, fishing areas, and specific fisheries currently regulated under the plan, and Section 2.2.2 discusses the gear modification requirements and restrictions currently in place.2.2.1 Affected Fisheries and Fishing Areas      As required by the MMPA, NMFS maintains a List of Fisheries (LOF) that places each commercial fishery into one of three categories. Fisheries are categorized according to the level of serious injury and mortality of marine mammals that unintentionally results from the fishery. The categorization in the LOF determines whether participants in that fishery are subject to certain provisions of the MMPA such as registration, observer coverage, and take reduction plan requirements. Individuals fishing in Category I or II fisheries must comply with requirements of any applicable take reduction plan.11      Categorization of fisheries is based on a two-tiered, stock-specific approach. Tier 1 considers the impacts of all fisheries on a stock. If the total annual mortality and serious injury rates within a stock resulting from all fisheries are less than or equal to ten percent of the stock’s potential biological removal rate (PBR), all fisheries associated with this stock fall into CategoryIII. If mortality and serious injury rates are greater than ten percent of PBR, a Tier 2 analysis occurs. This analysis compares fishery-specific annual mortality and serious injury rates to a stock’s PBR. If the mortality and serious injury rates associated with a fishery are greater than or equal to 50 percent of PBR, it is classified as Category I. If these rates are greater than one percent but less than 50 percent of PBR, the fishery is classified as Category II. If, under the  Tier 2 analysis, the annual mortality and serious injury rates associated with a fishery are less than or equal to one percent of a stock’s PBR, the fishery is classified as Category III (68 FR 41726).      The LOF indicates which fisheries NMFS may regulate under the ALWTRP.12 Specific fisheries were initially identified for inclusion under the ALWTRP based on documented whale interactions. In 1996, NMFS announced its intention to regulate the following Category I or II fisheries under the ALWTRP, based on the following documented whale interactions (61 FR 40819):           10 For more information on NMFS activities undertaken as part of the ALWTRP, see the plan web site at http://www.nero.noaa.gov/whaletrp/.           11 Once a fishery is elevated to Category I or II status, it may be subject to the ALWTRP; however, NMFS retains discretion regarding which fisheries it covers in the Plan to provide adequate protection to right, humpback, and fin whales.           12 Marine mammal take reduction plans relevant to Category I and II fisheries in the Atlantic Ocean include the Harbor Porpoise Take Reduction Plan (50 CFR 229.34), the ALWTRP (50 CFR 229.32), and the Bottlenose Dolphin Take Reduction Plan (50 CFR 229.35).
• Gulf of Maine, Mid-Atlantic lobster trap/pot fishery:13 One record of a serious injury and/or mortality of a northern right whale, and 11 records of serious injury and/or mortality of humpback whales were reported for this fishery from 1990 to 1994. In addition, NMFS received several reports of right whale entanglements prior to 1990 and after 1994 which are or may be attributable to the lobster fishery.• Mid-Atlantic coastal gillnet fishery:14 Between 1989 and 1992, 31 humpback whales stranded from New Jersey through Virginia. Twenty- five percent of the stranded whales had scars consistent with net entanglement. Between 1990 and 1996, ten humpbacks stranded in Virginia; three animals had rope abrasion injuries consistent with entanglement in gillnets.• New England multispecies sink-gillnet fishery:15 As of 1996, strategic marine mammal species/stocks seriously injured or killed in this fishery included several humpback whales and a northern right whale.• Southeastern U.S. Atlantic shark gillnet fishery: A right whale calf was observed in February 1994, approximately ten miles off Jacksonville, Florida, with severe cuts and other injuries. Researchers believe, based on the observed injuries, that the calf was entangled in gillnet gear, then hauled back into the fishing vessel's propeller as the gear was being retrieved. This method of gear retrieval is consistent with the shark gillnet fishery.      Based on NMFS review of entanglement data by fishery and by the types of gear involved in whale entanglements, the ALWTRP was created to mitigate the use of certain gear types likely to entangle whales in areas where whales are likely to occur. Therefore, the ALWTRP regulates fishing activity by gear and fishing location. Specific restrictions on fishing practices (including gear and seasonal requirements) are defined according to gear types and areas, as specified in Exhibit 2-2 (for a list of currently exempted waters within these areas, see Appendix 2-A). Exhibits 2-3 and 2-4 illustrate the location of the specified areas.1613 Currently the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic American lobster trap/pot fishery in the LOF.14 Currently the Mid-Atlantic gillnet fishery in the LOF.15 Currently the Northeast sink gillnet fishery in the LOF.           16 For the specific coordinates of each area, see 50 CFR part 229.32, the ALWTRP regulations, available  on the ALWTRP web site at http://www.nero.noaa.gov/whaletrp/.

      The LOF is revised annually based on new information regarding marine mammal interactions (some fisheries take marine mammals in ways other than entanglement, such as hooking). Exhibit 2-5 lists Category I and II fisheries in the Atlantic Ocean for 2013 (78 FR 53336, August 29, 2013).Exhibit 2-5LIST OF FISHERIES, CATEGORY I AND II DESIGNATIONS(Atlantic Ocean Fisheries Only)Category I FisheriesGillnet FisheriesMid-Atlantic gillnetNortheast sink gillnetLongline FisheriesAtlantic Ocean large pelagics longlineTrap/Pot FisheriesNortheast/Mid-Atlantic American lobster trap/potCategory II FisheriesGillnet FisheriesChesapeake Bay inshore gillnet North Carolina inshore gillnet Northeast anchored float gillnet Northeast drift gillnet Southeast Atlantic gillnetSoutheastern U.S. Atlantic shark gillnetTrawl FisheriesMid-Atlantic mid-water trawl (including pair trawl) Mid-Atlantic bottom trawlNortheast mid-water trawl (including pair trawl) Northeast bottom trawlTrap/Pot FisheriesAtlantic blue crab trap/potAtlantic mixed species trap/potHaul/Beach Seine FisheriesMid-Atlantic haul/beach seine1North Carolina long haul seineStop Net FisheriesNorth Carolina roe mullet stop netPound Net FisheriesVirginia pound netNotes:1 The Mid-Atlantic haul/beach seine fishery is not regulated under the ALWTRP because a beach seine is not considered a gillnet for the purposes of this regulation (see the gillnet definition in Chapter 15).      The fisheries currently regulated under the ALWTRP are those Category I or II fisheries from the LOF that fish with specified gear in specified areas (see Exhibits 2-3, 2-4, and 2-5). Based on the most recent LOF, the following five fisheries are currently regulated under the ALWTRP:• Northeast/Mid-Atlantic American lobster trap/pot,• Northeast sink gillnet,• Southeast Atlantic gillnet,• Southeastern U.S. Atlantic shark gillnet,17 and• Mid-Atlantic gillnet.18           17 The Southeastern U.S. Atlantic shark gillnet fishery as described in this document includes shark gillnetting with five-inch or greater stretched mesh south of the South Carolina/Georgia border.           18 In North Carolina, fishermen using beach-anchored gillnets or nearshore gillnets may report landings as part of the Mid-Atlantic haul/beach seine fishery, which is not regulated under the ALWTRP. To the extent that fishermen report gillnet landings as part of the haul/beach seine fishery, and do not report gillnet landings as part of the Mid-Atlantic coastal gillnet fishery, costs incurred by those fishermen are not reflected in this analysis.
The ALWTRP includes a variety of gear modification requirements and restrictions.Each regulatory component of the Plan is summarized in section 2.2.2.2.2.2 Gear Modification Requirements and Restrictions      The ALWTRP specifies both universal gear modification requirements and restrictions, which apply to all lobster traps/pots and anchored gillnets, and area- and season-specific gear modification requirements and restrictions.19 The universal gear requirements are as follows:• No floating buoy line at the surface – No person may fish with lobster trap or anchored gillnet gear that has any portion of the buoy line that is directly connected to the gear on the ocean bottom floating at the surface at any time. If more than one buoy is attached to a single buoy line or if a high flyer and a buoy are used together on a single buoy line, floating line may be used between these objects.• No wet storage of gear – Lobster traps and/or anchored gillnet gear must be hauled out of the water at least once every 30 days.• Knots – Fishermen are encouraged, but not required, to maintain knot-free buoy lines. Splices are not considered to be an entanglement threat  and are thus preferable to knots.• Groundlines - All groundlines must be made of sinking line.Additional gear modification requirements and restrictions vary by location and date, as well as by gear type. The Plan currently recognizes seven trap/pot areas: Cape Cod Bay Restricted Area, Great South Channel Restricted Area, Stellwagen Bank/Jeffreys Ledge Restricted Area, Northern Inshore State Trap/Pot Waters, Northern Nearshore Trap/Pot Waters, Southern Nearshore Trap/Pot Waters, and Offshore Trap/Pot Waters.  The Plan currently recognizes nine gillnet areas: Cape Cod Bay Restricted Area, Great South Channel Restricted Gillnet Area, Great South Channel Sliver Restricted Gillnet Area, Stellwagen Bank/Jeffreys Ledge Restricted Area, Other Northeast Gillnet Waters, Mid/South Atlantic Gillnet Waters, Southeast U.S. Restricted Area (North and South), Southeast U.S. Monitoring Area, and Other Southeast Gillnet Waters. These regulations are summarized in Exhibits 2-6 to 2-8 below.However, all fishermen using ALWTRP gear in ALWTRP waters are subject to regulation under the ALWTRP. This includes vessels fishing nearshore gillnets, and does not include vessels fishing beach-anchored gillnets or haul/beach seines (see the gillnet definition in Chapter 15).           19 The requirements specified in the ALWTRP are in addition to existing requirements under the Fishery Management Plans of affected fisheries and any other applicable regulations.

Information on minke whale entanglements is also provided, since the ALWTRP should benefit this species. Finally, the discussion demonstrates the need for action by reviewing recent entanglements within the context of the mandates of the MMPA and the ESA.2.3.1 Nature of Large Whale Entanglements      Atlantic large whales are at risk of becoming entangled in fishing gear because the whales feed, travel and breed in many of the same ocean areas utilized for commercial fishing. Fishermen typically leave fishing gear such as gillnets and traps/pots in the water for a discrete period, after which time the nets/traps/pots are hauled and their catch retrieved. While the gear is in the water, whales may become incidentally entangled in the lines and nets that comprise trap/pot and gillnet fishing gear.      The effects of entanglement can range from no injury to death. "When… [whales] become fouled in gear, normal breathing and movement may be impaired or stopped completely. If the animal does manage to struggle free, portions of gear may remain attached to the body. This trailing gear, often made of durable synthetic material, may create excess drag, snag onto objects in the environment and impede normal behavior like breathing, feeding, movement, or breeding. Other effects include infections and deformations" (Center for Coastal Studies, May 14, 2003).      A scarification analysis conducted by the New England Aquarium (Knowlton et al., 2002) found that juvenile right whales are entangled with greater frequency than adults. Juvenile animals may not have sufficient strength to break free from entangling lines, which can lead to serious injury and infection resulting from the animal "growing into" the lines.      A study of right whale and humpback whale entanglements (Johnson et al., 2005) finds that in cases where the point of gear attachment is known, right whale entanglements frequently (77.4 percent; 24 of 31 entanglement events) involve the mouth, which may indicate that many entanglements occur while whales are feeding.20 The study also finds that humpback whales are more commonly reported with entanglements in the tail region (53.0 percent; 16 of 30 entanglement events) in cases where the point of attachment is known.2120 In some cases, other parts of the body in addition to the mouth may have been entangled.21 In some cases, other parts of the body in addition to the tail may have been entangled.
      From 1997 to 2002, the NMFS Gear Research Team identified various types of trap/pot and gillnet gear involved in entanglements of right, humpback, fin, or minke whales (Kenney  and Hartley, 2001; Hartley et al., 2003; Whittingham et al., 2005a):• Right whales became entangled in inshore and offshore lobster, crab, and other trap/pot-related gear, gillnet and Danish seine gear, as well as aquaculture equipment;• Humpback whales became entangled in inshore lobster, crab, gillnet, slime eel/hagfish, conch/whelk, and other trap/pot-related gear, as well as tuna hand line gear and line associated with vessel anchoring systems;• Fin whales became entangled in crab, slime eel/hagfish, and gillnet gear; and• Minke whales became entangled in inshore lobster, gillnet, and otter trawl gear.      The number of entanglements for which gear type can be identified is too small to detect any trends in the type of gear involved in lethal entanglements. Trap/pot and gillnet gear, however, seem to be the most common, as in 89 percent of the cases the gear was identified as or found to be consistent with trap/pot and gillnet gear (Johnson et al., 2005).22 The study confirms that vertical lines and floating groundlines pose risks for large whales; however, the authors conclude that any type and part of fixed gear is capable of entangling a whale, and several body parts of the whale can be involved.2.3.2 History of Large Whale Entanglements      Entanglements are a known source of serious injury and mortality to Atlantic large whales. Although currently available data cannot yet quantify the relative impact of the ALWTRP on the annual number of entanglements, the data do indicate that entanglements resulting in serious injury or mortality continue to be a threat to large whales. Sections 2.3.2.1 to2.3.2.6 provide an overview of the history of large whale entanglements by species and in summary. These data indicate a need for additional protective measures for large whales.           22 According to Johnson et al. (2005), this analysis focused primarily upon cases in which the gear involved in an entanglement was recovered and examined by NMFS gear specialists, as well as other sources considered reliable, but also included entanglements for which the gear type and/or part was identified (e.g., by a fisherman or biologist) but not recovered. In some cases, recovered gear can definitively be traced back to a particular fishery; in other cases, parts of the recovered gear may be found to be consistent with gear that is used in a particular fishery. For example, the gear recovered from right whale #3107 consisted of line with a 600-pound weak link, which is consistent with gear used in the lobster trap/pot fishery. Thus, Johnson et al. (2005) classified this case as an entanglement in lobster trap/pot gear that was set in an unknown location.
2.3.2.1 Entanglement Data      The entanglement data presented here come primarily from the 2012 U.S. Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico Marine Mammal Stock Assessments report, which covers the years from 2006 through 2010 (Waring et al., 2013). These data pertain only to entanglements that NMFS considers to be the primary cause of serious injury or death to a whale.      Care should be used when interpreting entanglement data. The details of a particular mortality or serious injury record often require a degree of interpretation. The assigned cause is based on NMFS' best judgment of the available data; additional information may result in revisions.23 When reading the following sections on species-specific entanglement data, several factors should be considered: (1) the mortality or injury may involve multiple factors (for example, cases in which whales have been both ship struck and entangled have been discovered);(2) the actual gear type/source is often uncertain; and (3) several types of gear may be involved in a given reported entanglement.      NMFS limits the serious injury designation to only those reports that offer substantiated evidence that the injury is likely to lead to the whale's death.24 Injuries that impede the whale's locomotion or feeding are not considered serious injuries unless they are likely to be fatal in the foreseeable future. NMFS does not forecast how the entanglement or injury may increase the whale's susceptibility to further injury. Due to this approach, the data presented in this report likely underestimate rates of serious injury due to entanglement (Waring et al., 2003).      On January 24, 2012, NMFS solicited public comments on draft revisions to the guidelines for preparing stock assessment reports (SARs). One of the proposed revisions is to specify that SARs include a summary of all human-caused mortality and serious injury including information on all sources of mortality and serious injury. Additionally, the revised guidelines state that a summary of mortality and serious injury incidental to U.S. commercial fisheries should be presented in a table, while mortality and serious injury from other sources should be clearly distinguished from U.S. commercial fishery-related mortality (77 FR 3450).      Another source of uncertainty in entanglement data is the size and variability of the detection effort (i.e., the number of people qualified and willing to report a whale entanglement). The number of people on the water and actively reporting whale entanglements also varies from year to year. Compared to the vastness of the Atlantic Ocean, the number of people on the water at any point in time who are qualified and willing to report a whale entanglement is small. As a result, some percentage of whale entanglements likely go unnoted. The limitations of the detection effort also hinder the development of conclusions regarding changes in the number of entanglements over time.           23 The serious injury determinations are most susceptible to revision. There are instances in which an entangled or partially disentangled whale was re-sighted later free of gear. The reverse may also be true: a whale initially seeming in good condition after being entangled is later re-sighted and found to have been seriously injured by the event.           24 Entanglements of juvenile whales are typically considered serious injuries because the constriction on the animal is likely to become increasingly harmful as the whale grows.
2.3.2.2 Right Whale Entanglements      From 2006 through 2010, an estimated average of 1.8 right whales per year (1.6 in U.S waters; 0.2 in Canadian waters) were seriously injured or killed as a result of entanglement or fishery interactions (Waring et al., 2013). In an analysis of the scarification of right whales, a total of 61.6 percent of the whales bore evidence of entanglements with fishing gear (Hamilton et al., 1998). Further research using the North Atlantic Right Whale Catalogue has indicated that between 10 and 28 percent of right whales are involved in entanglements each year (Knowlton et al., 2002). However, most right whales are eventually able to free themselves, leaving them with scars (Knowlton et al., 2002). Entanglement records maintained by NMFS Northeast Regional Office included at least 85 confirmed right whale entanglements from 1990 through 2009, including right whales in weirs, entangled in gillnets, and trailing line and buoys (Waring et al., 2012). Because whales often free themselves of gear following an entanglement event, scarring may be a better indicator of fisheries interactions than entanglement records. In an analysis of  the scarification of right whales, 519 of 626 (82.9%) whales examined during 1980-2009 were scarred at least once by fishing gear (Knowlton et al. 2012). Further research using the North Atlantic Right Whale Catalogue has indicated that between 8.6% to 33,6% of right whales aquire new scars annually (Knowlton et al. 2012). In six records of right whales that were entangled in groundfish gillnet gear in the Bay of Fundy and Gulf of Maine between 1975 and 1990, the whales were either released or escaped on their own, although several whales were observed carrying net or line fragments. A right whale mother and calf were released alive from a herring weir in the Bay of Fundy in 1976.      Between 1970 and 1999, a total of 45 right whale mortalities were recorded (International Whaling Commission 1999; Knowlton and Kraus 2001; Glass et al. 2009). Of these, 13 (28.9%) were neonates that were believed to have died from perinatal complications or other natural causes. Of the remainder, 16 (35.6%) resulted from ship strikes, 3 (6.7%) were related to entanglement in fishing gear (in two cases lobster gear, and one gillnet gear), and 13 (28.9%) were of unknown cause. Between 2005 and 2009, there were a total of 29 confirmed North Atlantic right whale entanglements along the US east coast and adjacent Canadian maritimes. Of these, there were 20 confirmed mortalities, two of which were attributed to entanglements (Henry et al., 2011). There were an additional three confirmed entanglement serious injuries.      Exhibit 2-9 presents a summary of estimated right whale entanglements from 1997 through 2010. The data only include cases in which entanglement was determined to be the primary source of the injury (Waring et al., 2013). The data demonstrate that right whales are becoming entangled in fishing gear and may be seriously injured or killed as a result of that entanglement. Due to the small sample size and the variability in entanglement reports resulting from annual differences in detection effort, the data do not support conclusions indicating historical trends in right whale entanglements.
Exhibit 2-9 An analysis of the gear involved in right and humpback whale entanglements (Johnson et al., 2005) investigated 31 right whale entanglement events in the U.S. and Canada (involving 29 individuals) during the period from 1993 through 2002. This analysis focused only on entanglement events for which gear was recovered and/or identified by gear specialists or other reliable sources, and events in which the point of gear attachment could be determined. Johnson et al. (2005) documented nine right whale entanglement events in which an animal died or was deemed potentially dead. Gear recovered from these entanglements was identified as or consistent with lobster trap/pot in two cases, sink gillnet in one case, Danish seine in one case, and unidentified or unknown in two cases (in these two cases, only rope was recovered).25 The outcomes of the 29 right whales involved in the 31 entanglement events are summarized in Exhibit 2-10. Three of the four known right whale deaths listed in Exhibit 2-10 are included in Exhibit 2-9.           25 The other three entanglement cases involved right whale #2212, which is considered potentially dead. (Johnson et al., 2005) Because this whale was involved in three separate documented entanglements, its outcome could not be attributed to any one particular event.

In contrast to stock assessment reports before 2007, these averages include humpback mortalities and serious injuries that occurred in the southeastern and Mid-Atlantic states that could not be confirmed as involving members of the Gulf of Maine stock. In past reports, only events involving whales confirmed to be members of the Gulf of Maine stock were counted against PBR. Starting in the 2007 report, it was assumed that whales were from the Gulf of Maine  unless they were identified as members of another stock (Waring et al., 2012). A study of entanglement-related scarring on the caudal peduncle of 134 individual humpback whales from the Gulf of Maine stock suggests that between 48 percent and 65 percent of whales had experienced entanglements (Robbins and Mattila, 2001).      Exhibit 2-11 summarizes western North Atlantic humpback whale entanglements from 1997 to 2010. Due to the small sample size and the variability in entanglement reports (because of variation in detection effort), the data do not support conclusions indicating historical trends in humpback whale entanglements.
Exhibit 2-11       An analysis of the gear involved in right and humpback whale entanglements in the U.S. and Canada (Johnson et al., 2005) investigated 30 humpback whale entanglements during the period from 1997 through 2002. This analysis focused only on entanglement events for which gear was recovered and/or identified by gear specialists or other reliable sources, and events in which the point of gear attachment could be determined. Of the three entangled humpback whales known to have died, two of the necropsies revealed entanglements in anchored gillnet gear. The third animal washed up dead two days after it was disentangled from inshore lobster gear. Exhibit 2-12 summarizes the outcomes of the 30 entanglements.Exhibit 2-12OUTCOME OF HUMPBACK WHALE ENTANGLEMENTS INCLUDED IN GEAR ANALYSIS(1997 THROUGH 2002)Dead3Alive and gear-free20Alive and entangled5Unknown2TOTAL30Note: An outcome of “potentially dead” was not used for humpback whales because a health assessment technique similar to the one for right whales (Pettis et al., 2004) does not exist.Source: Johnson et al.

2.3.2.4 Fin Whale Entanglements      A review of NMFS records from 2006 through 2010 yielded an average of 2 reported fin whale serious injuries or mortalities per year (1.8 in U.S. waters; 0.2 in Canadian waters) resulting from fishery interactions or entanglements (Waring et al., 2013).      Exhibit 2-13 summarizes fin whale entanglements from 1997 through 2010. No confirmed fishery-related mortalities or serious injuries of fin whales have been reported in the NMFS Sea Sampling database. A review of records of stranded, floating or injured fin whales  for the period 2006 through 2010 on file at NMFS found two records with substantial evidence of fishery interactions causing mortality and two records resulting in serious injury, which results in an annual rate of serious injury and mortality of 2 fin whales from fishery interactions (Waring et al., 2013). 	Exhibit 2-13	      Exhibit 2-13 demonstrates that fin whales are becoming entangled in fishing gear, and may be seriously injured or killed as a result of that entanglement. Due to the small sample size and the variability in entanglement reports (because of differences in detection effort), the data do not support conclusions indicating historical trends in fin whale entanglements.
2.3.2.5 Minke Whale Entanglements      It is difficult to associate minke whale entanglements with specific fisheries. Over the period 2006 through 2010, there was an average of 2.6 mortalities and serious injuries from observed in fisheries, 1 per year from U.S. fisheries using stranding and entanglement data and 2 from Canadian fisheries using stranding and entanglement data (Waring et al., 2013). The strandings and entanglement database, maintained by the Northeast Regional Office/NMFS, include 36 records of minke whales within U.S. waters from 1975-1992. The gear includes unspecified fishing nets, unspecified cables or lines, fish traps, weirs, seines, gillnets and lobster gear. The strandings and entanglement database reported 7 minke whale mortalities and serious injuries that were attributed to the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic Lobster Trap Pot fishery during 1990 to 1994.      Exhibit 2-14 summarizes minke whale entanglements from 1997 to 2010. The graph demonstrates that minke whales are becoming entangled in fishing gear, and may be seriously injured or killed as a result of that entanglement. Due to the small sample size and the variability in entanglement reports (because of variation in detection effort), the data do not support conclusions indicating historical trends in minke whale entanglements.Exhibit 2-14Minke Whale Entanglements65432101997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010Serious Injury	Mortality

Humpback whales account for the greatest number of serious injury entanglements (35), followed by right whales (11); minke whales account for five, and fin whales account for four. 	Exhibit 2-15	      Exhibit 2-16 presents available data on fatal entanglements of Atlantic large whales from 1997 through 2010, the most recent year that data is available for all species.

Exhibit 2-16      Exhibit 2-17 presents average annual rates of human-caused serious injury and mortality to Atlantic large whales for the period 2006 through 2010 (Waring et al., 2013). For Atlantic large whales, approximately 62 percent (right whales) to 100 percent (humpback whales) of human-caused serious injury and mortality was first reported in U.S. waters. Interactions with fishing gear accounted for about 25 percent (right whales) to 92 percent (minke whales) of the human-caused serious injury and mortality reported in U.S. waters.

Entanglements first observed after January 1, 2010, may have occurred after most of the recent revisions to the ALWTRP went into effect.26 Exhibit 2-19 summarizes the data on large whale entanglements observed between January 1, 2010, through December 31, 2011 (the extent of finalized reports as of December 31, 2013). Serious injury and mortality determinations have not been made for these entanglements as of this time.           26 The whales for which sighting history data are available were not observed free of gear between January 1 and the date that they were reported to be entangled; therefore, these data cannot confirm that the entanglements occurred after the implementation of current ALWTRP requirements. Entanglements first observed after January 1, 2010, may have occurred prior to that date, and thus prior to implementation of the new provisions.

Entanglements first observed after January 1, 2010, may have occurred prior to that date, and thus prior to implementation of the new provisions.      Due to the continuing risk of serious injury and mortality of large whales since the most recent revisions of the ALWTRP have gone into effect, NMFS believes additional modifications to the ALWTRP are needed to meet the goals of the MMPA and the ESA. In addition, as stated previously, the ALWTRP acknowledged in 2003 that there remained risk from both the vertical and groundline components of gear.      The purpose of this action is to further reduce the risk of large whale entanglement in fishing gear and to develop better management programs to aid in this reduction. The most  recent rulemaking focused on the groundline, leaving the need, which is to be addressed by this action, to take additional action to further reduce risk from vertical line and to support a better understanding about the nature of entanglements. In accordance with the MMPA, NMFS’ goal for each of the three strategic large whale species (right, humpback, and fin) is to reduce incidental mortalities and serious injuries attributable to interactions with commercial fisheries to levels that do not exceed the Potential Biological Removal (PBR) and Zero Mortality Rate Goal (ZMRG) level for each stock. On the basis of the data presented above, NMFS is proposing further modification of the ALWTRP.      In developing proposed changes to the ALWTRP, NMFS has evaluated a number of alternatives. These alternatives seek to reduce the risk of large whale entanglement by measures such as prohibiting the use of vertical lines in certain areas at certain times of the year, reducing or capping the number of vertical lines in certain areas at certain times of the year, mandating certain gear configurations, and requiring gear marking. These changes are designed to address ongoing entanglement issues, especially those involving vertical line. NMFS believes that addressing the risk associated with vertical line by reducing the number of vertical lines,
particularly in areas of higher whale density, will reduce serious injury and mortality of large whales due to incidental entanglement in commercial fishing gear.      An analysis of fishing gear involved in right and humpback whale entanglements confirms that any line rising into the water column presents an entanglement risk to large whales (Johnson et al., 2005). The study includes 45 right and humpback whale entanglement events, reported in both U.S. and Canadian waters, from which gear was recovered and/or identified.      The Johnson et al. (2005) analysis identified four parts of fixed fishing gear that were involved in entanglements: buoy line, groundline, floatline, and surface system lines.27 Where  the part of the gear could be identified for both species combined, 56 percent (14 out of 25) of the animals were entangled in buoy line (seven of each species), 28 percent (seven out of 25) were entangled in groundline (four right and three humpback whales), 16 percent (four out of 25) were entangled in gillnet floatline (all humpback whales), and four percent (one out of 25) were entangled in surface system line (a right whale) (source Johnson et al., 2005).28 Note that the  sum of these percentages exceeds 100 percent because two animals (one of each species) were entangled in both buoy line and groundline, making it difficult to determine which part of the gear the whales encountered first.29 It is important to note that when considering the above analysis, although portions of the gear (e.g., buoy line and groundline) were identified, without documentation of the events leading up to the entanglement, it is difficult to compare the relative risks associated with different parts of the gear. The reasons for this are elaborated below.      A large whale entanglement that is reported by an observer may not fully reflect the history of the entanglement (i.e., the exact point of contact and where the gear was located on the animal immediately after it became entangled, what part of the gear was involved, and whether any gear was shed by the whale prior to reporting). Scarring data for both right and humpback whales indicate that in many cases, these animals become briefly entangled in line or another part of the gear, which leaves minor scars. When a large whale encounters gear, it is often           27 Buoy line connects the gear at the bottom to the surface system. Groundline in trap/pot gear connects traps/pots to each other to form trawls; in gillnet gear, groundline connects a gillnet or gillnet bridle to an anchor or buoy line. Floatline is the portion of gillnet gear from which the mesh portion of the net is hung.  The surface  system includes buoys and high-flyers, as well as the lines that connect these components to the buoy line.           28 NMFS gear experts rely on a variety of factors to help them identify the components of gear involved in an entanglement, including the presence of traps/pots, nets, buoys, and gangions (i.e., rope that attaches traps/pots to the groundline), as well as occasional interviews with gear owners. Interviews provide important information about where, when, and how the gear was set and possibly when the gear was lost. NMFS gear experts may also rely on high-quality photographic documentation of the entanglement.           29 The trap/pot gear that entangled the humpback whale consisted of floating groundline as well as buoy line made of both floating and sinking line spliced together. The NMFS gear research team reports that the majority of lobster trap/pot and gillnet fishermen use buoy line that consists of two-thirds sinking line and one-third floating line; the floating line is located at the lower end of the buoy line to prevent chafing on the seafloor. This humpback whale’s entanglement involved gear originating from the mouth, and the whale may have encountered either the buoy line or the groundline first. Without documentation of the events that led to the entanglement, it is impossible to determine where the whale encountered the gear and whether other body parts may have been involved before the entanglement was reported. The composition of the buoy line and groundline involved in the entanglement of the right whale was not determined; however, the gear involved was identified as crab trap/pot gear. This whale’s entanglement involved the tail. As two gear components were involved, it is difficult to determine which part of the gear the whale encountered first or whether other body parts were involved before the entanglement was reported.
powerful enough to carry large amounts of the gear away with it (Clapham et al., 2001) and any gear that trails from a whale has the potential to become caught on other gear. If this occurs before the whale is reported entangled, it is extremely difficult to determine which part of the gear the whale encountered first. Entangling gear can also shift positions on a whale, further complicating an effective analysis of the nature of the entanglement. In some cases, not all entangling gear can be removed from an animal during disentanglement. In others, large whales may shed some of the gear involved before the entanglement is reported.      Based on the above information, NMFS believes that all parts of fixed gear create entanglement risk because all have been identified as entangling large whales. However, at this time, determining which part of fixed gear creates the most entanglement risk for large whales is difficult due to the uncertainties associated with entanglements, as well as unknown biases associated with reporting effort and the lack of information about the types and amounts of gear being used (Johnson et al., 2005). For example, buoy line may be reported more frequently at  sea than groundline, since it is easier to recognize when a buoy or high-flyer is present. Groundline, on the other hand, does not have a distinguishing characteristic that would allow it  to be identified without removing it from an entangled animal and analyzing it (Johnson et al., 2005). Therefore, vertical line (buoy and surface system line) may only seem to create more of an entanglement risk than ground line, when in fact it is difficult to quantify and compare the risks associated with each part of the gear. In some cases, it is still impossible to determine the gear part even when the gear is recovered and/or identified.30 Despite gear recovery and/or identification, 44 percent (20 out of the total 45) of the right and humpback whale entanglement events analyzed involved an unknown part of the gear (source Johnson et al., 2005). Currently, the only definitive way to assess the nature of entanglements is through gear removal, as it is difficult to identify a line’s origin through photographs alone (Johnson et al., 2005). However,  all of the caveats noted above must be considered when gear has been recovered and an assessment is in progress.      A better scientific understanding about the nature of entanglements, specifically the gear components involved (e.g., buoy line), would help NMFS to develop better management programs and reduce the risk of serious injury and mortality of large whales due to incidental interactions with commercial fisheries. Therefore, NMFS is also proposing to expand gear marking requirements for fisheries that are subject to ALWTRP regulations. This information may provide valuable insight concerning where, when, and how the entangling gear was set.           30 The NMFS gear research team usually identifies groundline based on the presence of a trap/pot and/or other factors, such as the presence of gangions that are spaced at intervals that would suggest that the line is groundline.

REGULATORY ALTERNATIVES	CHAPTER 3      The Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan (ALWTRP) includes a combination of fishing gear modifications and time/area closures to reduce the risk that whales will be killed or seriously injured as a result of entanglement in commercial fishing gear. The nature of the gear modification requirements varies by location and time of year, maximizing reduction in entanglement risk based on whale movements. NMFS complements these gear modification requirements with prohibitions on fishing at times and in places where whale aggregations are greatest, and therefore entanglement risk may be particularly high.      NMFS is considering various alternatives for modifying existing ALWTRP requirements. The alternatives under consideration seek to reduce large whale entanglement by increased traps per trawl, requiring gear marking and the use of weak links and/or vertical lines of lower breaking strength. These changes are designed to address ongoing right, humpback, and fin whale entanglements resulting in serious injury or mortality. The measures under consideration are designed to address entanglement risk posed by fisheries in U.S. waters; however, NMFS recognizes that entanglement risks occur throughout the range of these species. NMFS will continue to work with the Government of Canada toward the development of similar protective measures for large whales in Canadian waters.      NMFS has identified a preferred alternative (Alternative 6 Preferred) from those considered. Below, we describe the regulatory alternatives under consideration (Section 3.1).  We then discuss the alternatives that NMFS has considered but rejected (Section 3.2).3.1 ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED      NMFS has identified six regulatory alternatives for consideration and has identified a preferred alternative (Alternative 6 Preferred) from those considered. The requirements under these alternatives supplement existing ALWTRP requirements, unless otherwise noted. The alternatives introduce new gear restrictions for fisheries already included under the ALWTRP. NMFS also proposes adding new gear marking requirements and making regulatory language changes that would apply across all the alternatives, with the exception of the No Action Alternative (Alternative 1).
      The alternatives examined in this FEIS are the product of extensive outreach conducted by NMFS. In response to the continued risk of serious injury or mortality of large whales from entanglement in commercial fishing gear, NMFS determined that additional modifications to the ALWTRP were warranted. Therefore, the ALWTRT was asked by NMFS to consider and develop additional options for addressing incidental interactions between commercial fisheries and large whales. Particular emphasis was placed on those options designed to reduce the potential for entanglements and minimize adverse impacts if entanglements occur.      In 2009, the ALWTRT agreed on a schedule to develop conservation measures for reducing the risk of serious injury and mortality of large whales that become entangled in vertical lines. As provided in the schedule, NMFS committed to publishing a final rule to address vertical line entanglement by 2014. Unlike the broad-scale management approach taken to address entanglement risks associated with groundlines, the approach for the vertical line rulemaking will focus on reducing the risk of vertical line entanglements in finer-scale high impact areas. Using fishing gear characterization data and whale sightings per unit effort (SPUE) data, NMFS developed a model to determine the co-occurrence of fishing gear density and whale density to serve as a guide in the identification of these high risk areas.      NMFS convened a meeting of the ALWTRT’s Northeast Subgroup and the Mid- Atlantic/Southeast Subgroup in November 2010 and April 2011, respectively. The subgroups reviewed the co-occurrence model and discussed its implications toward the overall vertical line management strategy. The ALWTRT agreed that NMFS should use the model to develop suites of conservation measures that would ultimately serve as options for the ALWTRT to consider when identifying management alternatives for the EIS. The conservation measures would address vertical line fishery interactions with large whales by reducing the potential for entanglements and minimizing adverse effects if entanglements occur. The results of the model showed that the trap/pot industry accounts for a larger number of vertical line in the water column than the gillnet industry. Therefore the proposed gear modifications and setting requirements target just the trap/pot industry; although, the proposed gear marking scheme would affect both industries.      On June 14, 2011, NMFS published a Notice of Intent (NOI) in the Federal Register to announce the agency’s intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) (76 FR 34654). In the NOI, NMFS requested comments and announced multiple public scoping meetings along the east coast to solicit comments on the range of issues to be considered during the preparation of the EIS. In addition to public scoping meetings NMFS solicited proposals from stakeholder groups on where, when, and how to achieve vertical line risk reduction based on the output of the co-occurrence model.      These stakeholder proposals were then presented to the ALWTRT at a January 2012 Full Team meeting. Each proposal was analyzed to determine the level of vertical line and co- occurrence reduction that would be achieved as a result of the proposed measures. The Alternatives are based upon information gathered during public scoping meetings, TRT meetings, and through our state partners. Stakeholders also submitted Vertical Line Risk Reduction Proposals, and the alternatives incorporated some portions of these proposals.
      During the rulemaking process, NMFS received numerous comments from diverse interested parties. The comments included both formal written comments as well as oral comments offered at public hearings. Volume II of this EIA summarizes the comments received on the DEIS and proposed rule. Volume II also summarizes the comments received during the initial stages of rulemaking at the public scoping meetings.      Exhibit 3-1 summarizes the key gear components of the proposed alternatives, arranging the requirements by lobster management area and geographic region (where appropriate). The discussion below describes each alternative in greater detail, highlighting the differences among alternatives as well as their similarities.Exhibit 3-1PROPOSED ALWTRP MANAGEMENT ALTERNATIVES 2-6(Requirements in addition to current ALWTRP requirements (i.e., No Action alternative))LocationComponentAlternative 2***Alternative 3Alternative 4Alternative 5Alternative 6 (Draft)Alternative 6(Preferred)Northeast Region (Proposed Management measures include increasing the number of traps/trawl and/or closures and gear marking)Maine State waters2 to 42= Alt. 2= Alt. 3= Alt. 3= Alt. 3,and ¼ mile buffer around islandsMaine (3-12 mile)5 or 10-----= Alt. 2= Alt. 3= Alt. 3= Alt. 3Maine(12+ mile)10 or 2015= Alt. 2= Alt. 3= Alt. 3= Alt. 3Maine (3-6 mile)------3= Alt. 2= Alt. 3= Alt. 3= Alt. 3Maine (6-12 mile)------5 or 10= Alt. 2= Alt. 3= Alt. 3= Alt. 3MA StateWaters3= Alt. 2= Alt. 2= Alt. 222Rhode IslandState Waters3= Alt. 2= Alt. 2= Alt. 2=Alt. 22NH StateWaters3Exempt= Alt. 2= Alt. 3= Alt. 3= Alt. 3LMA 1 (0-3 mile)3= Alt. 2= Alt. 2= Alt. 2= Alt. 2= Alt. 2LMA 1 (3-12 mile)10= Alt. 2= Alt. 2= Alt. 2= Alt. 2= Alt. 2LMA	1(12+ mile)20= Alt. 2= Alt. 2= Alt. 2= Alt. 2= Alt. 2LMA1/OCoverlap (0-3 mile)2= Alt. 2= Alt. 2= Alt. 2= Alt. 2= Alt. 2OC	(0-3mile)2= Alt. 2= Alt. 2= Alt. 2= Alt. 2= Alt. 2

3.1.1 Non-Regulatory Components      NMFS will pursue a number of non-regulatory actions outside of the proposed rulemaking described here. Continued outreach and enforcement efforts are necessary to ensure that fishermen understand the regulations and to improve compliance. In addition to continued and enhanced outreach and enforcement, NMFS will continue to request that their state partners provide gear characterization reports on an annual basis. This will allow NMFS to continue to monitor the amount, location, and type of gear in the water. This will be important so that NMFS can monitor what effects, if any, the action has on fishing effort.3.1.2 Alternative 1: No Action Alternative      Under Alternative 1, NMFS would continue with the status quo, i.e., the baseline set of ALWTRP requirements currently in place. A description of the current requirements can be found in Chapter 2.Exhibit 3-2 summarizes the current and proposed gear marking scheme.      Exhibits 3-3 and 3-4 present the current management areas for trap/pot and gillnet fisheries.3.1.3 Alternative 2Alternative 2 would modify the ALWTRP in a number of ways varying by region.Northeast Region:• Increase the number of traps per trawl based on area fished and miles fished from shore [(0-3), (3-12), and (12+)] within current lobster management areas (Exhibit 3-4).o Maine waters are managed based on zone and the proposed number of traps per trawl differ based on Maine zone.Southeast Region:• Propose to use the Southeast U.S. Restricted Area N, a current gillnet area, as a new trap/pot management area (Exhibit 3-5).• Throughout the Southeast U.S. Restricted Area N, require the following for trap/pot gear:o Traps must be set with one buoy line and not multiple-trap trawls.
o The whole buoy/vertical line (from trap/pot to buoy) should be the same diameter and free of objects (e.g., weights, floats, etc.) and the buoy/vertical line must be made of sinking line.• The breaking strength of the weak link between the buoy and vertical line does not exceed 600 lbs (Georgia/South Carolina state waters and Federal waters) and 200 lbs (Florida state waters). The breaking strength of the vertical line would not exceed 2,200 lbs (Georgia/South Carolina state waters and Federal waters) and 1,500 lbs (Florida state waters).• In Federal waters, trap/pot gear must be brought back to shore at the conclusion of each trip.Coastwide:• Robust gear marking. See Section 3.1.7 for description of the proposed gear marking scheme.• Regulatory language changes to better define and clarify previously implemented requirements. See Exhibit 3-6 for description of language changes.
3.1.4 Alternative 3Northeast Region:• A combination of NMFS proposed traps per trawl (Exhibit 3-5) and ideas from our State partners.o Maine Department of Marine Resources provided a proposal for traps per trawl based on Maine zones and distance from shore that differ from NMFS [(0-3), (3-6), (6-12), and (12+)] (Exhibit 3-7).o Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries proposed a closure in the Cape Cod Bay Critical Habitat area for all trap/pot fisheries from February 1 through April 30th.o Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management requested a minimum 15 trap per trawl requirement in LMA 2 (12+) as opposed to NMFS’ 20 trap per trawl limit.o New Hampshire Department of Fish and Game requested that New Hampshire state waters be exempt from the proposed trap per trawl limits (Exhibit 3-8) and all current requirements under the Plan.o NMFS proposal (Alternative 2) is in effect in all waters and times of year that are not covered by the State proposals.Southeast Region: Alternative 2 measures apply.Coastwide: Alternative 2 gear marking scheme and regulatory language changes apply.3.1.5 Alternative 4Northeast Region:• The same as Alternative 2 with the addition of closures in certain areas as proposed by the Conservation/Scientist stakeholder group.• Three closures for all trap/pot fisheries are included in this proposal (Exhibit 3-9):o Jordan Basin (Nov 1 to Jan 31)o Jeffreys Ledge (Oct 1 to Jan 31)o Massachusetts Restricted Area #1: Area of Cape Cod Bay and Outer Cape to Great South Channel (Jan 1 to April 30)• NMFS proposal (Alternative 2) is in effect in all waters and times of year that are not covered by the closures.Southeast Region: Alternative 2 measures apply.Coastwide: Alternative 2 gear marking scheme and regulatory language changes apply.
3.1.6 Alternative 5Northeast Region:• Alternative 5 is a combination of Alternatives 3 and 4. Where the proposed Cape Cod Bay Critical Habitat and Massachusetts Restricted Area #1 closures overlap, the larger closure (Massachusetts Restricted Area #1) in time and area is proposed.• NMFS proposal (Alternative 2) is in effect in all waters and times of year that are not covered by the state proposals or closures.Southeast Region: Alternative 2 measures apply.Coastwide: Alternative 2 gear marking scheme and regulatory language changes apply.3.1.7 Alternative 6 (Draft)Northeast Region:• Alternative 6 is similar to Alternative 5 but only includes one of the three trap/pot closures proposed in Alternative 5 and it is a smaller area than proposed in previous Alternatives (i.e., Massachusetts Restricted Area #2: Cape Cod Bay and Outer Cape Area instead of Cape Cod Critical Habitat or Massachusetts Restricted Area #1).• NMFS proposal (Alternative 2) is in effect in all waters and times of year that are not covered by the closures.• NMFS proposal is modified in all Massachusetts state waters to include trawling up to 2 traps per trawl.Southeast Region: Alternative 2 measures apply.Coastwide: Alternative 2 gear marking scheme and regulatory language changes apply.3.1.8 Alternative 6 (Preferred)     In response to comments received on the DEIS and proposed rule, NMFS developed a final preferred alternative that builds on Alternative 6 (Draft). The rationale for the preferred alternative is presented in Chapter 1. The main difference in the Alternatives is attributable to the difference in minimum number of traps per trawl required based on area fished. NMFS considers Alternative 6 (Draft) and Alternative 6 (Preferred) to be similar in reducing entanglement risk despite the differences in Alternatives. As discussed in Chapter 5, the impacts are not substantially different from the range of alternatives discussed in the DEIS. NMFS believes the addition of the Alternative 6 (Preferred) is appropriate in light of the comments on the proposed rule and DEIS. The discussion below highlights changes relative to Alternative 6 (Draft).
In the Northeast Region changes relative to Alternative 6 (Draft) include the following:• Rhode Island state waters include trawling up to two traps per trawl.• New Hampshire state waters are only exempt from the minimum number of traps per trawl requirement. All other portions of the ALWTRP would remain in effect.• Portions of pocket waters in Maine are outside the traditional 3-mile line, in accordance with Federal definition of pocket waters (Exhibit 3-10), NMFS identified as these waters as state waters and as such those fishing in these waters would abide by the state minimum of two traps per trawl as opposed to following the minimum trawl numbers for waters 3-6 miles from shore.• Three inhabited islands in Maine (Monhegan, Rugged, and Matinicus) would have a¼ mile buffer delineated around them (Exhibit 3-11). Those fishing in these buffer waters would be able to continue fish using singles.In the Southeast Region there are no changes relative to Alternative 6 (Draft). The gear marking scheme proposed coastwide would remain the same with the exception that Maine exempt waters would not be required to mark gear as originally proposed.3.1.9 Gear Marking Scheme      The current gear marking strategy (implemented in 1997) is inadequate and should be improved. From 1997-2011 there were 499 large whale entanglement events.  Gear was retrieved in 170 of these cases; of the cases where gear was retrieved, gear marking lead to 51 cases where fishery, location, and date were known. A stronger gear marking strategy would help answer questions such as when and where entanglements occur. Current regulations require one 4” colored mark midway along the buoy line and surface buoys to identify the vessel or fishery. Colors correspond to specific ALWTRP management areas.      The proposed gear marking scheme would maintain the current color combinations but increase the size and frequency of the mark. The new mark must equal 12” in length and buoy lines must be marked three times (top, middle, bottom). A mark for the new Southeast US Restricted Area North would be required for both state and Federal water. This proposal would continue to allow multiple methods for marking line (paint, tape, rope, etc).      The table below outlines the proposed gear marking colors. The line must be marked three times and each mark must total 12” in length. If the mark consists of two colors then each color mark can be 6” for a total mark of 12”.

Scoping discussions included the meeting of the full Take Reduction Team as well as a series of public meetings held at key locations on the Atlantic coast.      While NMFS solicited and considered all input from stakeholders, a number of approaches were rejected in the formulation of alternatives. Exhibit 3-11 summarizes these approaches and briefly explains why NMFS chose not to integrate the approach into the regulatory alternatives under consideration. The rejected approaches are organized by fishery  and region. Stakeholders identified many approaches that would apply to more than one fishery or region; hence, many of the concepts are repeated in the table. The alternatives described are
not mutually exclusive; i.e., some were recommended in combination, despite the fact that they are listed and addressed separately in the table.      The rejected alternatives are wide-ranging in content. Concepts that recur frequently in the alternatives include the following:• Requiring increased traps per trawl on a seasonal basis• Suggesting reductions in traps equal reductions in number of end lines• One endline on trawls with more than five traps• Maintain status quo until see if current requirements are working• Managing gillnets under this vertical line rule
Exhibit 3-12ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED BUT REJECTEDTopicAlternative Considered but RejectedRational for RejectionSeasonal measuresAdopt seasonal increase in traps per trawl as opposed to year round measures.During our scoping meetings we heard that the public favored year round measures with the exception of the Southeast.Measures in the Southeast would be on a seasonal basis due to theseasonal shift in distribution of right whales.Gear markingMaintain status quoThe current marking scheme is ineffective and therefore needs to be modified. Status Quo is not anoption.Mark by State and by fisheryThis scheme would be too complex and create undue hardship on those vessels fishingin multiple states.Mark groundline and endline differentlyGroundline is required to be sinking groundline and therefore the risk of entanglement from groundline has decreased. This rule focuses on decreasing the risk of vertical line and as such the proposed gear marking should be focused on verticalline only.Reduction in trap allocationsMaintaining status quo and relying on proposed reductions in trap allocations to account for reductions in vertical lines.A reduction in traps does not necessarily equate to a reduction in vertical line and therefore would not meet our goal ofreducing the risk of vertical lines.Vertical lineRequire one endline for all trawls with greater than five traps.During our scoping meetings we heard that fishing for longer trawls with one endline wasextremely dangerous.ClosuresImplement closure for gillnet in Great South Channel Sliver AreaThere is little fishing effort in this area so the benefit would not outweigh the potential economicburden on industry.GillnetsIncluding management measuresfor gillnets under this ruleSee Appendix 3-A
Appendix 3-ARATIONALE FOR REJECTING PROPOSED GILLNET MEASURES
      Following implementation of the ground line rule, the NMFS and the ALWTRT turned focus to vertical line risk reduction, consistent with the decision of the ALWTRT in 2003.  At  the 2009 ALWTRT meeting, the Team agreed on a schedule to develop a management approach to reduce the risk of serious injury and mortality due to vertical line. The approach for the vertical line rule focuses on reducing the risk of vertical line entanglements in high impact areas versus a wide-broad scale management scheme. Using fishing gear survey data and whale sightings per unit effort (SPUE), a model was developed to determine the co- occurrence of fishing gear density and whale density. The ALWTRT Northeast Subgroup met in November 2010 and the Mid-Atlantic/Southeast Subgroup met in April 2011 to review the co-occurrence model and consider its implications for an overall management strategy to address vertical line entanglements. The Team agreed NMFS should use the model to consider and develop possible options to address fishery interactions with large whales by reducing the potential for entanglements, minimizing adverse effects if entanglements occur, and mitigating the effects of any unavoidable entanglements.      The gear characterization information in the model shows the majority of the vertical lines coastwide are from lobster trap/pot and other trap/pot fisheries (Exhibit 3A-1). For this reason, NMFS decided to focus this rule making on trap/pot gear only.     Exhibit 3A-1 Trap/Pot vs Gillnet GearAnnual Average Number of FTE Active Vessels1 (2011 Baseline)CoastwideNortheastLobster Trap/Pot2,0441,995Other Trap/Pot9167Gillnet213931 FTE Active Vessels stands for Full Term Equivalent vessel. Using Federal and state data sources, the model estimates the number of commercial fishing vessels that participate in each fishery.

This result leads to a high economic impact on individual gillnet vessels but low overall conservation impacts or reduction in co-occurrence. Therefore, NMFS proposes the closures for only trap/pot gear and not gillnet gear. The current gillnet gear closures would remain in place.

AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT	CHAPTER 4      Consistent with Section 1502.15 of the CEQ NEPA regulations (40 CFR Part 1500), this chapter describes key components of the environment affected by the ALWTRP regulatory alternatives. Four major components are examined in detail:• Section 4.1 discusses the status of Atlantic large whale species;• Section 4.2 considers the economic and social aspects of the fisheries affected by the ALWTRP rules;• Section 4.3 describes other protected species that may be affected by elements of the ALWTRP; and• Section 4.4 provides information about habitat for affected commercial fish species.4.1 STATUS OF ATLANTIC LARGE WHALE SPECIES      The discussion below examines the status of four key large whale species: the North Atlantic right whale, the humpback whale, the fin whale, and the minke whale. The discussion describes the range, life history, and abundance of each species, as well as factors that may affect their survival (including entanglement).4.1.1 North Atlantic Right Whale      Two populations of the North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis), an eastern and a western, are typically recognized (IWC, 1986). However, animals are sighted so infrequently in the eastern Atlantic, it is unclear whether a viable population still exists (NMFS, 1991a). This analysis focuses on the western North Atlantic population of right whales, which occurs in the proposed action area.
      North Atlantic right whales are one of the most intensely studied cetacean species. The following six major habitats or high use regions for western North Atlantic right whales have been identified: the coastal waters of the southeastern United States; the Great South Channel; Georges Bank/Gulf of Maine; Cape Cod and Massachusetts Bays; the Bay of Fundy; and the Scotian Shelf (Waring et al., 2013). The minimum stock size for the western North  Atlantic  right whale is based on a census of individual whales identified using photo-identification techniques. A review of the database as it existed on October 21, 2011, indicated that 444 individually recognized whales in the catalog were known to be alive during 2009 (Waring et al., 2013). This value is minimum and also does not include some calves known to be born during 2009, or any other individual whale seen during 2009 but not yet entered into the catalog (Waring et al., 2013).      Examination of the minimum number alive population index calculated from the individual sightings database, as it existed on 21 October 2011, for the years 1990 -2010 reveals a positive and slowly accelerating trend in population size. Mean growth rate for the period was 2.6% (Waring et al., 2013). NMFS believes that the western population of North Atlantic right whales is well below the optimum sustainable population (OSP). Potential biological removal (PBR) is the product of minimum population size, one-half the maximum net productivity rate and a “recovery” factor for endangered, depleted, threatened stocks or stocks of unknown status relative to OSP. The recovery factor for right whales is 0.10 because this species is listed as endangered under the ESA. The minimum population size is 444 and the maximum productivity rate is 0.04, thus PBR for the Western Atlantic stock of North Atlantic right whale is 0.9.      The North Atlantic right whale is also listed as endangered under the ESA. Pursuant to the ESA, a Recovery Plan was published in 1991 and revised in 2005. The most recent 5-year status review was completed in September 2012.      In 1994, NMFS published a final rule designating critical habitat for right whales (59 FR 28793, June 3, 1994). The designated critical habitat included portions of Cape Cod Bay and Stellwagen Bank, the Great South Channel (each off the coast of Massachusetts), and the waters adjacent to the coast of Georgia and the east coast of Florida. These areas were determined to be essential to the conservation of right whales because of their importance as foraging, calving, and nursing habitats. For example, Cape Cod Bay and the Great South Channel represent two of the four known principal feeding grounds for adult right whales in the Western North Atlantic and the only two within U.S. waters. In addition, the waters off Georgia and Northern Florida have been identified as the only known calving ground for right whales. However, the designations were based primarily on right whale sightings data as opposed to an analysis of the physical and biological habitat features essential to the conservation of the species.      In July 2002, NMFS received a petition requesting revision of the current critical habitat designation for right whales, by combining and expanding the current Cape Cod Bay and Great South Channel critical habitats in the Northeast and by expanding the current critical habitat in the Southeast. In August 2003, NMFS determined that the requested revision, as specified by the petitioner, was not warranted at that time. However, NMFS indicated that it would continue to analyze the physical and biological habitat features essential to the conservation of right whales. Specifically, in the waters off the Northeast U.S., NMFS plans to continue its own work and collaborate with others working in the Gulf of Maine ecosystem to characterize the spatial and
temporal distribution of zooplankton. Furthermore, in the waters off the Southeast U.S., NMFS will continue to analyze right whale distribution data in relation to bathymetry and sea surface temperature derived from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) imagery (68 FR 51758).      On March 8, 2008, NMFS published a final rule listing North Atlantic and North Pacific right whales as separate species under the ESA (73 FR 12024). This listing followed the completion of a status review of right whales in the North Pacific and North Atlantic oceans in December 2006. The status review indicated that separating the northern right whale into two different species was warranted in light of the compelling evidence provided by recent scientific studies on right whale taxonomy and classification. Genetic data now provide unequivocal support to distinguish three right whale lineages (including the southern right whale) as separate phylogenetic species: (1) the North Atlantic right whale (E. glacialis), ranging in the North Atlantic Ocean; (2) the North Pacific right whale (E. japonica), ranging in the North Pacific Ocean; and (3) the southern right whale (E. australis), historically ranging throughout the southern hemisphere’s oceans (Rosenbaum et al., 2000).      On October 1, 2009, NMFS received a petition from the Center for Biological Diversity (CBD), Defenders of Wildlife, Humane Society of the United States, Ocean Conservancy, and the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society (the Petitioners) to revise the designated critical habitat of the North Atlantic right whale. On October 27, 2009, NMFS sent a letter to the petitioners acknowledging receipt of the petition. On October 6, 2010, NMFS announced the 90- day finding and 12-month determination on how to proceed with a petition to revise critical habitat for the North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) pursuant to the ESA (75 FR 61690). The petition seeks to revise the existing critical habitat designation by expanding the areas designated as critical feeding and calving habitat areas for the North Atlantic right whale. Additionally, the petition seeks to include a migratory corridor as part of the critical habitat designation for the North Atlantic right whale. The 90-day finding is that the petition, in conjunction with the information readily available in the files, presents substantial scientific information indicating that the requested revision may be warranted. The 12-month determination on how to proceed with the petition is that NMFS intends to continue the ongoing rulemaking process which is expected to culminate with the publication of a proposed critical habitat rule for the North Atlantic right whale in the Federal Register.      Based on an analysis of the best scientific and commercial data available and after taking into consideration current population trends and abundance, demographic risk factors affecting the continued survival of the species, and ongoing conservation efforts, we determined that the North Atlantic right whale is in danger of extinction throughout its range because of: (1) overutilization for commercial, recreational scientific, or educational purposes; (2) the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms; and (3) other natural and manmade factors affecting its continued existence. The listing of the endangered northern right whale (Eubalaena spp.) as two separate, endangered species, North Pacific right whale (E. japonica) and North Atlantic right whale (E. glacialis), was effective on April 7, 2008.
4.1.1.1 Range      North Atlantic right whales have a wide distribution that overlaps with U.S. and  Canadian commercial fishing grounds in the western Atlantic as well as shipping traffic to and from numerous ports. Coastal areas frequented by right whales are heavily developed. North Atlantic right whales generally occur west of the Gulf Stream, from the southeast U.S. to Canada (e.g., Bay of Fundy and Scotian Shelf) (Kenney, 2002; Waring et al., 2003). They are not found in the Caribbean and have been recorded only rarely in the Gulf of Mexico. North Atlantic right whales are abundant in Cape Cod Bay between February and April (Hamilton and Mayo, 1990; Schevill et al., 1986; Watkins and Schevill, 1982) and in the Great South Channel in May and June (Kenney et al., 1986; Payne et al., 1990). North Atlantic right whales also frequent Stellwagen Bank and Jeffreys Ledge, as well as Canadian waters including the Bay of Fundy and Browns and Baccaro Banks, in the spring through fall. NMFS and Provincetown Center for Coastal Studies aerial surveys during springs of 1999-2006 found right whales along the Northern Edge of Georges Bank, in the Great South Channel, in Georges Basin, and in various locations in the Gulf of Maine including Cashes Ledge, Platts Bank and Wilkinson Basin (Waring et al., 2012). The distribution of right whales in summer and fall seems linked to the distribution of their principal zooplankton prey (Winn et al., 1986). Calving occurs in the winter months in coastal waters off of Georgia and Florida (Kraus et al., 1988). Mid-Atlantic waters are used as a migratory pathway from the spring and summer feeding/nursery areas to the winter calving grounds off the coast of Georgia and Florida.      North Atlantic right whales, like other baleen whales, winter in the lower latitudes where calving takes place, then migrate to higher latitudes for the spring, summer and fall. However, there is much about right whale movements and habitat that is still not fully understood. Telemetry data have shown lengthy and somewhat distant excursions into deep water off the continental shelf (Mate et al., 1997). Photo-ID data have also indicated excursions of animals as far as Newfoundland, the Labrador Basin, southeast of Greenland, and Norway (Knowlton et al., 1992). In the winter, only a minority of the known right whale population appears on the calving grounds. The winter distribution of the remaining right whales remains uncertain (Waring et al., 2006). Results from winter surveys and passive acoustic studies suggest that animals are dispersed among several areas, including Cape Cod Bay (Brown et al., 2002). During the winter of 1999/2000, significant numbers of right whales were recorded in the Charleston, SC area. Because survey efforts in the Mid-Atlantic have been limited, it is unknown whether this is typical or whether it represents a northern expansion of the normal winter range, perhaps due to unseasonably warm waters.      Other uncertainties also exist. For example, some female right whales have never been observed on the Georgia/Florida calving grounds but have been observed with a calf on the foraging grounds the following spring/summer, although this is becoming rarer (Best et al., 2001, Kraus et al., 2007). It is unknown whether these females are calving in an unidentified calving area or have been missed during surveys off of Florida and Georgia (Best et al., 2001). To a greater degree, some mature females that are observed in the Southeast U.S. calving grounds are not re-sighted in the Bay of Fundy. In fact, analysis based on both genetics and sighting histories of photographically identified individuals suggests that approximately one-third of the known population utilizes summer nursery areas other than the Bay of Fundy (Waring et al., 2006). This, along with the absence of some photo-identified whales from known habitats for months or
years at a time, suggests the presence of an unknown, offshore feeding ground (Kenney, 2002). Cole et al. (2013) identified a likely candidate mating are within the Gulf of Maine. Finally, the location of the North Atlantic right whale’s mating area(s) is largely unknown. While behavior suggestive of mating is frequently observed on the foraging grounds, given the known length of gestation in other baleen whales, it is more likely that mating and conception occur in the winter (Kenney, 2002). However, as mentioned above, many of the mature whales in this population  are not sighted on the known calving grounds off the southeastern U.S. during these months. Evaluation of this information, along with genetics data, suggests that two mating areas may exist with a somewhat different population composition (Best et al., 2001).      One emerging result of the genetic studies is the importance of obtaining biopsy samples from calves on the calving grounds. Only 60% of all known calves are seen with their mothers  in summering areas, when their callosity patterns are stable enough to reliably make a photo-ID match later in life. The remaining 40% are not seen on a known summering ground. From 1980 to 2001, there were 64 calves born that were not sighted later with their mothers and thus, unavailable to provide age-specific mortality information (Frasier et al., 2007). An additional interpretation of paternity analyses is that the population size may be larger than previously thought. Fathers for only 45% of known calves have been genetically determined. However, genetic profiles were available for 69% of all photo-identified males (Frasier 2005). The conclusion was that the majority of these calves must have different fathers that cannot be accounted for by the unsampled males and the population of males must be larger (Frasier 2005); although this inference of additional animals that have never been photographed.4.1.1.2 Life History and Reproductive Success      Kraus et al. (2001) have estimated the mean age at first calving for female right whales to be 9.53 (+/- 2.32) years (Reeves et al., 2001).1 Calving interval rates, which averaged 3.7 years between 1980 and 1992, seemed to be increasing over time, although the trend was not statistically significant (p=0.083) (Knowlton et al., 1994). Mean calf production from 1993 to 2009 was 17.2. An updated analysis of calving intervals through the 1997/1998 season  suggested that the mean calving interval had increased since 1992 from 3.67 years to more than 5 years, which is a significant trend (Kraus et al., 2001). An IWC workshop on status and trends  of the North Atlantic right whale agreed that calving intervals had increased and that the reproduction rate was approximately half that reported from studied populations of southern right whales (Reeves et al., 2001). Analysis completed since that workshop found that in the most recent years, calving intervals were closer to three years (Kraus et al., 2007).      Between 1980 and 2000, a total of 222 right whale births were documented in the western North Atlantic. Seven of these 222 whales are known to have died.  Due to low calf production in 1999 (four calves) and 2000 (one calf), in April 2000, the Northeast Fisheries Science Center brought together 35 scientists from a broad range of disciplines to identify factors potentially affecting reproduction dysfunction in North Atlantic right whales. At this workshop, five factors were considered as potential contributors to the declining reproductive success of North Atlantic right whales: (1) environmental contaminants/endocrine disrupters; (2) body1 The longevity of right whales is unknown.
condition/nutritional stress; (3) genetics; (4) infectious diseases; and (5) marine biotoxins. The workshop concluded that none of the five factors could be eliminated as possible contributors to the observed reproductive dysfunction. Furthermore, the workshop concluded that if calf production and recruitment do not recover from the low levels observed in recent years, the population of North Atlantic right whales is unlikely to recover, even if known anthropogenic causes of mortality are reduced to zero (Reeves et al., 2001).      Since 2000, there have been at least 240 right whale births through the 2010/2011 calving season (Waring et al., 2013). During the 2004 and 2005 calving seasons, three adult females were found dead with near-term fetuses (Waring et al., 2012).4.1.1.3 Abundance      As is the case with most wild animals, an exact count of right whales in the Western North Atlantic cannot be obtained. However, abundance can be reasonably estimated as a result of extensive study of this population. The western North Atlantic minimum stock size is based on a census of individual whales identified using photo-identification techniques. The western North Atlantic population size was estimated to be at least 444 individuals in 2009 based on a census of individual whales identified using photo identification techniques. This value is a minimum and does not include animals that were alive prior to 2008, but not recorded in the individual sightings database as seen during 1 December 2008 to 21 October 2011. This number does include the 19 calves born in 2009 but not yet catalogued (Waring et al, 2013).       Previous estimates using the same method with the added assumption that whales seen within the previous seven years were still alive resulted in counts of 295 animals in 1992 (Knowlton et al., 1994) and 299 animals in 1998 (Kraus et al., 2001). An IWC workshop on status and trends of western North Atlantic right whales gave a minimum direct-count estimate of 263 whales alive in 1996 and noted that the true population was unlikely to be substantially greater than this (Best et al., 2001).      As is the case with other mammalian species, there is an interest in monitoring the number of females in the western North Atlantic right whale population since their numbers will affect the overall population trend. Participants at the 1999 IWC workshop reviewed the sex composition of this right whale population based on sighting and genetics data (Best et al., 2001). Of the 385 right whales presumed alive at the end of 1998, 157 were males, 153 were females, and 75 were of unknown sex (Best et al., 2001). Sightings data were also used to determine the number of presumably mature females (females known to be at least nine years old) in the population and the number of females observed with at least one calf. For the period 1980 to 1998, there were at least 90 (presumed living) females nine years old or older. Of these, 75 had produced a calf during that same period (Best et al., 2001; Kraus et al., 2001). As described above, the 2000/2001 and 2002/2003 calving seasons had relatively high calf production and included additional first time mothers. These potential gains have been offset, however, by continued losses to the population, including the deaths of mature females.      The 1999 IWC workshop participants also reviewed photo-ID data and modeling of right whale survival (Best et al., 2001). Despite differences in approach, all of the models indicated a
decline in right whale survival in the 1990s relative to the 1980s, with female survival, in particular, apparently affected (Best et al., 2001; Waring et al., 2006). In 2002, the NMFS Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) hosted a workshop to review right whale population models and examine potential bias in the models and changes in the population trend based on new information collected in the late 1990s (Clapham et al., 2002). Three different models were used to explore right whale survivability and to address potential sources of bias. Although biases were identified that could negatively affect the results, all three modeling techniques resulted in the same conclusion: survival has continued to decline and the decline appears to be focused on females (Clapham et al., 2002).      An increase in mortality in 2004 and 2005 was cause for serious concern (Kraus et al., 2005). Calculations based on demographic data through 1999 (Fujiwara and Caswell 2001) indicated that this mortality rate increase would reduce population growth by approximately 10% per year (Kraus et al, 2005). Of these mortalities, six were adult females, three of which were carrying near-term fetuses. Furthermore, four of these females were just starting to bear calves, losing their complete lifetime reproductive potential (Waring et al., 2013).      Despite the preceding, examination of the minimum number alive population index calculated from the individual sightings database, as it existed on July 6, 2010, for the years 1990 through 2007, suggests a positive trend in population size. These data reveal a significant increase in the number of catalogued whales alive during this period, but with significant variation due to apparent losses exceeding gains during 1998-1999. Mean growth rate for the period was 2.4% (Waring et al., 2013).      PBR is the product of minimum population size, one-half the maximum productivity rate, and a “recovery” factor for endangered, depleted, threatened stocks, or stock of unknown status relative to OSP (MMPA Sec. 3. 16 U.S.C. 1362) (Wade and Angliss, 1997). The recovery factor for right whales is 0.10 because this species is listed as endangered under the ESA. The minimum population size is 444 and the maximum net productivity is 0.04; thus, PBR for the Western Atlantic stock of North Atlantic right whale is 0.9 (Waring et al., 2013).4.1.1.4 Factors Affecting Survival      Some researchers have suggested that the population is affected by a decreased reproductive rate (Best et al., 2001; Kraus et al., 2001). As of 1999, only 70 percent of mature females (aged nine years or older) were known to have given birth (Best et al., 2001). An analysis of the age structure of this population suggests that it contains a smaller proportion of juvenile whales than expected (Hamilton et al., 1998; Best et al., 2001), which may reflect lowered recruitment and/or higher juvenile mortality. In addition, it is possible that the apparently low reproductive rate is due in part to an unstable age structure or to reproductive senescence on the part of some females. However, few data are available on either factor, and senescence has not been documented for any baleen whale (Waring et al., 2013). Several factors-- reduced genetic diversity, pollution, and nutritional stress -- have been considered to help explain an apparent decline in reproductive success (Best et al., 2001; Kraus et al., 2001):• Reduced Genetic Diversity: Historically, the North Atlantic right whale was driven to near-extinction by 800 years of commercial hunting. The
size of the western North Atlantic population of right whales at the termination of whaling is unknown, but is generally believed to have been very small. Such an event may have resulted in a loss of genetic diversity which could affect the ability of the current population to successfully reproduce (i.e., decreased conceptions, increased abortions, and increased neonate mortality). Studies by Schaeff et al. (1997) and Malik et  al. (2000) indicate that western North Atlantic right whales are less genetically diverse than southern right whales (Schaeff et al., 1997; Malik et al., 2000). However, several apparently healthy populations of cetaceans, such as sperm whales and pilot whales, have even lower genetic diversity than observed for western North Atlantic right whales (Best et al., 2001).• Pollution: While contaminant studies have confirmed that right whales are exposed to and accumulate contaminants, researchers could not conclude that these contaminant loads were negatively affecting right whales since concentrations were lower than those found in marine mammals proven to be affected by PCBs and DDT (Weisbrod et al., 2000).• Nutritional Stress: Although North Atlantic right whales have thinner blubber than right whales from the South Atlantic, there is no evidence at present to demonstrate that the decline in birth rate and increase in calving interval is related to a food shortage (Kenney, 2000). Experts at the 1999 IWC workshop pointed out that since Calanus sp. is the most common zooplankton in the North Atlantic and current right whale abundance is greatly below historical levels, food limitations do not seem to be a significant factor (Best et al., 2001). Nevertheless, a connection between right whale reproduction and environmental factors may yet be found. Modeling work by Caswell and Fujiwara suggests that the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), a naturally occurring climactic event, does affect the survival of mothers, the reproductive rate of mature females, and calf survival (Clapham et al., 2002). Further work is needed to assess the magnitude and manner in which the NAO may affect right whale reproductive success.      The small population size and low annual reproductive rate suggest that human sources  of mortality may have a greater impact on right whale population growth rates than is the case for other whales (Waring et al., 2006). Ship strikes and fishing gear entanglements are the principal factors believed to be retarding growth and recovery of western North Atlantic right whales. Data collected from 1970 through 1999 indicate that anthropogenic interactions in the form of ship strikes and gear entanglements are responsible for a minimum of two-thirds of the confirmed and possible mortality of non-neonate right whales. Of the 45 right whale mortalities documented during this period, 16 were due to ship collisions and three were due to entanglement in fishing gear (there were also 13 neonate deaths and 13 deaths of non-calf animals from unknown causes). Based on the criteria developed by Knowlton and Kraus (2001), 56 additional serious injuries and mortalities from entanglement or ship strikes are believed to have occurred between 1970 and 1999: 25 from ship strikes and 31 from entanglement. Nineteen
were considered to be fatal interactions (16 ship strikes, three entanglements); ten were possibly fatal (two ship strikes, eight entanglements); and 27 were non-fatal (seven ship strikes, 20 entanglements) (Knowlton and Kraus, 2001). The population has continued to suffer losses that are attributed to ship strikes and fishing gear entanglements (Waring et al., 2003; Waring et al., 2006). From 2006 through 2010, 9 of 15 records of mortality or serious injury (including records from both U.S. and Canadian waters) involved entanglement or fishery interactions (Waring et al. 2013).      Scarification analysis also provides information on the number of right whales that have survived ship strikes and fishing gear entanglements. Based on photographs of catalogued animals from 1959 and 1989, Kraus (1990) estimated that 57 percent of right whales exhibited scars from entanglement and seven percent from ship strikes (propeller injuries) (Kraus, 1990). This work was updated by Hamilton et al. (1998) using data from 1935 through 1995 to estimate that 61.6 percent of right whales exhibit injuries caused by entanglement, and 6.4 percent exhibit signs of injury from vessel strikes. In an analysis of the scarification of right whales, 338 of 447 (75.6%) whales examined during 1980 to 2002 were scarred at least once by fishing gear (Knowlton et al., 2005). Further research using the North Atlantic Right Whale Catalog has indicated that annually between 14% and 51% of right whales are involved in entanglements (Knowlton et al., 2005). In addition, several whales have apparently been entangled on more  than one occasion and some right whales that have been entangled were subsequently involved in ship strikes. Knowlton et al. (2003) found that 543 separate entanglement interactions documented between 1980 and 2000 involved 413 individual right whales. The number of entanglements per individual ranged from zero to five. Of the 413 right whales, 71.9 percent (297 right whales) showed signs of having been entangled. Nearly 35 percent (144 of 413) were entangled at least once and 0.9 percent (four animals) were entangled at least five  times. Because some animals may drown or be killed immediately, the actual number of interactions is expected to be higher. Recent work from Knowlton et al. (2012) increased the time series from 1980 to 2009 and found that 82.9% of right whales have had at least one previous entanglement in gear. Fifty-nine percent of right whales had been entangled more than once. It would appear that there is a higher rate of entanglement among calves and juveniles. Of the 86 serious injury events that occurred from 1980-2009, 74 of these were whales of a known age. Fifty-one percent of these events occurred with calves and juveniles Decomposed and/or unexamined animals (e.g., carcasses reported but not retrieved or necropsied) represent “lost data,” some of which may relate to human impacts (Waring et al., 2006).4.1.1.5 Behavior and Susceptibility to Entanglement      As mentioned previously, right whales are susceptible to entanglement in fishing gear. Johnson et al. (2005) noted that any part of the gear (buoy line, groundline, floatline, and surface system line) creates a risk for entanglement. Several aspects of right whale behavior may contribute to this high entanglement frequency.      Of 31 recorded right whale entanglement events examined between 1993 and 2002, 24 (77.4 percent) involved animals with gear in the mouth (some included other points of gear attachment on the body as well) and 16 (51.6 percent) were entangled only at the  mouth (Johnson et al., 2005). This suggests that a large number of entanglements occur while right
whales feed, since open mouth behavior is generally associated with feeding only. Although the sample size was small for cases in which the point of gear attachment and the associated gear part could be examined, Johnson et al. (2005) reported that two out of three right whale floating groundline entanglements and six out of eight vertical line entanglements (buoy line and surface system lines) involved the mouth (note that some of these cases may have involved other body parts as well).2 In addition, three buoy line entanglement events involved the tail; the entanglement of one of these animals additionally involved groundline.      Right whales feed by swimming continuously with their mouths open, filtering large amounts of water through their baleen and capturing zooplankton on the baleen’s inner surface. A study of right whale foraging behavior in Cape Cod Bay conducted by Mayo and Marx (1990) revealed that right whales feeding at the surface had their mouths open for approximately 58 minutes of each hour. Also, feeding right whales exhibited increased turning behavior and a convoluted path once they had found a sufficiently dense patch of zooplankton on which to feed. This behavior differed significantly from that of traveling whales, that swam in relatively straight paths with their mouths closed. In addition, socializing whales (two or more whales at the  surface occasionally making physical contact) exhibited even more twisted paths than feeding whales. Socializing was often associated with rolling and lifting the flippers above the water’s surface, behaviors that may add to entanglement risk, especially from buoy line and surface system lines.      Goodyear (1996) studied well-known right whale feeding areas (Cape Cod/Massachusetts Bay, Great South Channel, and the Bay of Fundy) and reported that feeding behavior varies based on the location of prey. Right whales spend a substantial amount of time feeding below  the surface in the Bay of Fundy, where no surface feeding activities were observed. In order to meet their metabolic needs, right whales must feed on dense aggregations of copepods. Right whales received most of their food energy (approximately 91.1 percent) during deep dives (average depth of 134 meters), with the remainder (approximately 9.9 percent) occurring through surface feeding. Right whales spend about one-third of their time surface feeding in the Cape Cod/Massachusetts Bay and Gulf of Maine areas, which may increase entanglement risk from buoy line and surface system lines during the times they visit these areas (December to May). While in the Great South Channel (April to June), right whales spend approximately 10 percent of the time feeding at the surface and 90 percent of the time feeding at lower depths.4.1.2 Humpback Whale      The North Atlantic humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) is listed as an endangered species under the ESA. A Recovery Plan has been published and is in  effect (NMFS, 1991b).

4.1.2.1 Range      In the western North Atlantic, humpback whales calve and mate in the West Indies  during the winter and migrate to northern feeding areas during the summer months. Calves are recruited to the feeding grounds of their mothers in a practice referred to as maternal philopatry (Clapham and Mayo, 1987; Katona and Beard, 1990). In the Gulf of Maine, sightings are most frequent from mid-March through November between 41 degrees north and 43 degrees north, from the Great South Channel north along the outside of Cape Cod to Stellwagen Bank and Jeffreys Ledge, and peak in May and August (CETAP, 1982). Studies have matched 27 percent of the individuals on the Canadian Scotian Shelf to the Gulf of Maine population (Clapham et al., 2003) and one study identified a Gulf of Maine whale as far away as west Greenland (Katona and Beard, 1990). Small numbers of individuals may be present in New England waters year- round, including the waters of Stellwagen Bank (Clapham et al, 1993). They feed on a number  of species of small schooling fishes, particularly sand lance, mackerel, and Atlantic herring, by targeting fish schools and filtering large amounts of water for their associated prey. Humpback whales have also been observed feeding on krill (Wynne and Schwartz, 1999).      In winter, humpback whales from different feeding areas mate and calve primarily in the West Indies, where spatial and genetic mixing among these groups occurs (Clapham et al., 1993; Katona and Beard, 1990; Palsboll et al., 1997; Stevick et al., 1998). Various papers have summarized information gathered from a catalogue of photographs of individuals from the western North Atlantic population of humpback whales (Clapham, 1992; Clapham and Mayo, 1990; Clapham et al., 1999; Barlow and Clapham, 1997). These photographs identified western North Atlantic humpbacks wintering in tropical breeding grounds in the Antilles, primarily on Silver and Navidad Banks, north of the Dominican Republic. The primary winter range also includes the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.      Humpback whales are assumed to use the Mid-Atlantic as a migratory pathway to and from the calving/mating grounds. The Mid-Atlantic may also be an important winter feeding  area for juveniles. Since 1989, observations of juvenile humpbacks in the Mid-Atlantic have been increasing during the winter months, peaking from January through March (Swingle et al., 1993). Biologists theorize that non-reproductive animals may be establishing a winter feeding range in the Mid-Atlantic since they are not participating in reproductive behavior in the Caribbean (Barco et al., 2002). Swingle et al. (1993) identified a shift in distribution of juvenile humpback whales in the nearshore waters of Virginia, primarily in winter months. Identified whales using the Mid-Atlantic area were found to be residents of the Gulf of Maine and Atlantic Canada (Gulf of St. Lawrence and Newfoundland) feeding groups, suggesting a mixing of different feeding populations in the Mid-Atlantic region (Barco et al., 2002). Strandings of humpback whales have increased between New Jersey and Florida since 1985, consistent with the increase in Mid-Atlantic whale sightings. Strandings were most frequent from September through April in North Carolina and Virginia waters, and involved primarily juvenile humpback whales of no more than 11 meters in length (Wiley et al., 1995).      In early 1992, a major research program known as the Years of the North Atlantic Humpback (YoNAH)(Smith et al., 1999) was initiated. This was a large-scale, intensive study of humpback whales throughout almost their entire North Atlantic range, from the West Indies to
the Arctic. During two primary years of field work, photographs for individual identification and biopsy samples for genetic analysis were collected from summer feeding areas and from the breeding grounds in the West Indies. Additional samples were collected from certain areas in other years.4.1.2.2 Life History and Reproductive Success      It is generally believed that copulation and calving take place on the winter range in the Greater and Lesser Antilles. The gestation period in humpback whales is 12 months and females give birth every two to three years, usually between December and May (Clapham and Mayo, 1987).4.1.2.3 Abundance      Photographic mark-recapture analyses from the Years of the North Atlantic Humpback (YONAH) project gave an ocean-basin-wide population estimate of 11,570 for 1992/1993 (CV = 0.069, Stevick et al., 2001), and an additional genotype-based analysis yielded a similar but less precise estimate of 10,400 whales (CV=0.138)(Smith et al., 1999). This estimate is regarded as the best available estimate for the North Atlantic population, though the figure is considered negatively biased because YONAH sampling was not spatially representative in the feeding grounds (Waring et al., 2006). Researchers have used three approaches in their attempt to estimate the abundance for the Gulf of Maine stock: mark-recapture estimates, minimum population size, and line-transect estimates (Clapham et al., 2003). An abundance estimate of 847 animals (CV=0.55) was derived from a line-transect sighting survey conducted during August 2006 which covered 10,676 km of trackline from the 2000m depth contour on the southern edge of Georges Bank to the upper Bay of Fundy and to the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The most recent line-transect survey in 2011, which did not include the Scotian Shelf portion of the stock, produced an estimate of abundance for Gulf of Maine humpback whales of 331 animals (CV=0.48) with a resultant minimum population estimate for this stock of 228 animals. The line- transect based Nmin is unrealistic because at least 500 uniquely identifiable individual whales from the GOM stock were seen during the calendar year of that survey and the actual population would have been larger because re-sighting rates of GOM humpbacks have historically been<1.Using the minimum count from at least 2 years prior to the year of a stock assessment report allows time to resight whales known to be alive prior to and after the focal year. Thus the minimum population estimate is set to the 2008 mark-recapture based count of 823.      Modeling using data obtained from photographic mark-recapture studies estimates the growth rate of the Gulf of Maine feeding population at 6.5 percent (Barlow and Clapham, 1997). More recent studies have found lower growth rates of 0.0 percent to 4.0 percent, although these results may be a product of shifts in humpback distribution (Clapham et al., 2003). Current data suggest that the Gulf of Maine humpback whale stock is steadily increasing in size (Waring et al., 2012). With respect to the North Atlantic population overall, there are indications of increasing abundance. One study estimated a growth rate of 3.1 percent for the period from 1979 to 1993 (Stevick et al., 2001).
      As noted, PBR is the product of minimum population size, one-half the maximum productivity rate, and a “recovery” factor (MMPA Sec. 3. 16 U.S.C. 1362) (Wade and Angliss, 1997). The minimum population size for the Gulf of Maine stock is 823 whales. The maximum productivity rate is 0.065. The “recovery” factor, which accounts for endangered, depleted, or threatened stocks, or stocks of unknown status relative to optimum sustainable population (OSP), is assumed to be 0.10 because the humpback whale is listed as endangered under the ESA. Thus, PBR for the Gulf of Maine humpback whale stock is 2.7 whales per year.4.1.2.4 Factors Affecting Survival      Humpback whales, like other baleen whales, may be adversely affected by habitat degradation, habitat exclusion, acoustic trauma, harassment, or reduction in prey resources attributable to commercial fishing, coastal development, vessel traffic, and other influences. However, explicit evidence of these influences is limited. Changes in humpback distribution in the Gulf of Maine have been found to be associated with changes in herring, mackerel, and sand lance abundance associated with local fishing pressures (Payne et al., 1986). Likewise, there are strong indications that a mass mortality of humpback whales in the southern Gulf of Maine in 1987/1988 was the result of the consumption of mackerel whose livers contained high levels of a red-tide toxin (Geraci et al., 1989). It has been suggested that red tides are related to increased freshwater runoff from coastal development, but there are insufficient data to link these effects directly with humpback whale mortality (Clapham et al., 1999).      As is the case with other large whales, the major known sources of anthropogenic mortality and injury of humpback whales are commercial fishing gear entanglements and ship strikes. Sixty percent of Mid-Atlantic humpback whale mortalities that were closely investigated showed signs of entanglement or vessel collision (Wiley et al., 1995). From 2006 through 2010, there were at least 10 reports of mortalities as a result of collision with a vessel and 29 serious injuries and mortalities attributed to entanglement. Many carcasses also washed ashore or were spotted floating at sea for which the cause of death could not be determined. Based on photographs of the caudal peduncle of humpback whales, Robbins and Mattila (1999) estimated that at least 48 percent -- and possibly as many as 78 percent -- of the Gulf of Maine stock of humpback whales exhibit scarring caused by entanglement. Robbins (2009) later found that 64.9% of the North Atlantic population had entanglement scarring when first assessed in 2003, encountering new scarring at an annual rate of 12.1%. These estimates are based on sightings of free-swimming animals that initially survive the encounter. Because some whales may drown immediately, the actual number of interactions may be higher. Decomposed and/or unexamined animals (e.g., carcasses reported but not retrieved or necropsied) represent “lost data”, some of which may relate to human impacts (Waring et al., 2006).4.1.2.5 Behavior and Susceptibility to Entanglement      As mentioned previously, humpback whales are, like right whales, susceptible to entanglement in fishing gear. Johnson et al. (2005) noted that any part of the gear (buoy line, groundline, floatline, and surface system line) creates a risk for entanglement. Johnson et al. (2005) also reported that of the 30 humpback whale entanglements examined in the study, 16 (53
percent) involved entanglements in the tail region and 13 (43 percent) involved entanglements in the mouth (note that in both cases, some entanglements included other points of gear attachment on the body). Although the sample size was small for cases in which the point of  gear attachment and the associated gear part could be examined, two out of two floating groundline entanglements and four out of seven buoy line entanglements involved the mouth.3 In addition, five out of seven buoy line entanglements and three out of four gillnet floatline entanglements involved the tail (Johnson et al., 2005).4      Based on studies of humpback whale caudal peduncle scars, Robbins and Mattila (2000) reported that calves had a lower entanglement risk than yearlings, juveniles, and mature whales; the latter three maturational classes exhibited comparable levels of high probability scarring. Based on these data as well as evidence that animals acquire new injuries when mature, the authors concluded that actively feeding whales may be at greater risk of entanglement. In any case, juveniles seemed to be at the most risk, possibly due to their relative inexperience.      Humpback whales employ a variety of foraging techniques, which differ from right  whale foraging behavior, but which may create entanglement risk (Hain et al., 1982 and Weinrich et al., 1992). One such technique is lunge feeding, in which the whale swims toward a patch of krill or small fish, then lunges into the patch with its mouth agape. The flippers may aid in concentrating the prey or in maneuvering. Another feeding method, called “flick-feeding,” involves flexing the tail forward when the whale is just below the surface, which propels water over the whale’s head, temporarily disorienting its prey. The whale then swims with its mouth open, through the wave it created. A third foraging strategy is bubble feeding, in which whales swim upwards, while blowing nets or clouds of bubbles, in a spiral under a concentration of  prey. This creates a barrier through which the disoriented fish cannot escape. The whales then swim up through the bubble formation, engulfing their prey. These techniques demonstrate that humpback whales commonly use their mouths, flippers, and tails to aid in feeding. Thus, while foraging, all body parts are at risk of entanglement.4.1.3 Fin Whale      In 1976, the IWC’s Scientific Committee proposed seven stocks for North Atlantic fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus): (1) North Norway, (2) West Norway-Faroe Islands, (3) British Isles-Spain and Portugal, (4) East Greenland-Iceland, (5) West Greenland, (6) Newfoundland- Labrador, and (7) Nova Scotia (Perry et al., 1999). However, it is uncertain whether these boundaries define biologically isolated units (Waring et al., 2006).      The present IWC scheme defines the North Atlantic fin whale stock off the eastern coast of the U.S., north to Nova Scotia, and east to the southeastern coast of Newfoundland as a single stock (Donovan, 1991). However, information suggests some degree of separation within this           3 Note that one humpback whale was entangled in both buoy line and groundline and was placed in both categories.           4 Note that the entanglements in buoy line exceed the total of seven because some animals were entangled in multiple locations on their body (e.g., both the mouth and the tail).
population. A number of researchers have suggested the existence of fin  whale subpopulations in the North Atlantic based on local depletions resulting from commercial whaling or genetics data (Mizroch and York, 1984; Bérubé et al., 1998). Photo identification studies in western  North Atlantic feeding areas, particularly in Massachusetts Bay, have shown a high rate of annual return by fin whales, both within years and between years, suggesting some level of site fidelity (Seipt et al., 1990).      This particular stock is considered strategic because the fin whale is listed as endangered under the ESA. A final Recovery Plan for fin whales was published in July 2010.4.1.3.1 Range      Fin whales inhabit a wide range of latitudes between 20 to 75 degrees north and 20 to 75 degrees south (Perry et al., 1999). Like right and humpback whales, fin whales are believed to use high latitude waters primarily for feeding, and low latitude waters for calving. However, evidence regarding where the majority of fin whales winter, calve, and mate is still scarce. Clark (1995) reported a general pattern of fin whale movements in the fall from the Labrador/Newfoundland region, south past Bermuda and into the West Indies, but neonate strandings along the U.S. Mid-Atlantic coast from October through January suggest the possibility of an offshore calving area (Clark, 1995; Hain et al., 1992).      Fin whales are common in waters of the U.S. EEZ principally from Cape Hatteras northward. Fin whales accounted for 46% of the large whales and 24% of all cetaceans sighted over the continental shelf during aerial surveys (CETAP 1982) between Cape Hatteras and Nova Scotia during 1978 to 1982. In this region, fin whales are probably the dominant large cetacean species during all seasons, having the largest standing stock, the largest food requirements, and therefore the largest impact on the ecosystem of any large cetacean species (Hain et al., 1992; Kenney et al. 1997). New England waters represent a major feeding ground for fin whales.  There is site fidelity by females and perhaps some segregation by sexual, maturational or reproductive class in the feeding area (Agler et al., 1993).      The predominant prey of fin whales varies greatly in different areas depending on what is locally available (IWC, 1992). In the western North Atlantic, fin whales feed on a variety of small schooling fish (e.g., herring, capelin, and sand lance) as well as squid and planktonic crustaceans (Wynne and Schwartz, 1999). Results from the Navy’s SOSUS program (Clark 1995) indicate a substantial deep-ocean distribution of fin whales. It is likely that fin whales occurring in the U.S. Atlantic EEZ undergo migrations into Canadian waters, open-ocean areas, and perhaps even subtropical or tropical regions (Waring et al., 2012).4.1.3.2 Life History and Reproductive Success       Compared to humpback and right whales, relatively little is known about the life history of fin whales. Both males and females reach sexual maturity between five and fifteen years of age (Perry et al., 1999). Conception is believed to occur during a five-month period in the  winter; following a 12-month gestation period, females give birth to a single calf.
      The mean calving interval for fin whales is 2.7 years, with a range of between two and three years. Agler et al. (1993) found the gross annual reproductive rate (i.e., calves as a percentage of total population) of fin whales in the Gulf of Maine to be about eight percent during the 1980s. Sigurjonsson (1995) reported the range of pregnancy rates (i.e., percent of adult females pregnant in a given year) for the species as 36 percent to 47 percent.4.1.3.3 Abundance      Various estimates have been provided to describe the current status of fin whales in western North Atlantic waters. An abundance estimate of 1,925 (CV=0.55) fin whales was derived from a line-transect sighting survey conducted between June 12 and August 4, 2004, by  a ship and plane that surveyed 10,761 km of trackline in waters north of Maryland (Palka 2006). An abundance estimate of 2,269 (CV=0.37) fin whales was estimated from an aerial survey conducted in August 2006 which covered 10,676 km of trackline in the region from the southern edge of Georges Bank to the upper Bay of Fundy and to the entrance of the Gulf of  St. Lawrence. An abundance estimate of 1,716 (CV=0.26) fin whales was generated from the Canadian trans North Atlantic Sighting Survey in July and August 2007. Finally, an abundance estimate of 2,235 (CV=0.36) fin whales was generated from a shipboard and aerial survey conducted during June - August 2011. The aerial portioned covered 6850 km of tracklines that were over waters from Massachusetts to New Brunswick, Canada (waters north of New Jersey and shallower than the 100-m depth contour, through the US and Canadian Gulf of Maine and up to and including the lower Bay of Fundy). The shipboard portioned covered 3811 km of tracklines that were in water offshore of North Carolina to Massachusetts (waters that were deeper than the 100-m depth contour out to beyond the US EEZ) (Waring et al., 2013). The best estimate of abundance for fin whales is 3,522 (CV=0.27), and the minimum population estimate for the western North Atlantic fin whale is 2,817 (Waring et al., 2013).      Information on the abundance and population structure of fin whales worldwide is limited. NMFS recognizes three fin whale stocks in the Pacific for the purposes of managing  this species under the MMPA: Alaska (Northeast Pacific), California/Washington/Oregon, and Hawaii. Reliable estimates of current abundance for the entire Northeast Pacific fin whale stock are not available. Stock structure for fin whales in the southern hemisphere is unknown and  there are no current estimates of abundance for southern hemisphere fin whales. Therefore,  given the best available information, changes in the status of the North Atlantic fin whale population are considered likely to affect the overall survival and recovery of the species.      As noted, PBR is the product of minimum population size, one-half the maximum productivity rate, and a “recovery” factor (MMPA Sec. 3. 16 U.S.C. 1362). The minimum population size is 2,817, and the maximum productivity rate is 0.04, the default value for cetaceans. The “recovery” factor is assumed to be 0.10 because the fin whale is listed as endangered under the ESA. Thus, PBR for the western North Atlantic fin whale is 5.6 (Waring  et al, 2013).
4.1.3.4 Factors Affecting Survival      Hunting of fin whales continued well into the 20th century. Fin whales were given total protection in the North Atlantic in 1987, with the exception of a subsistence whaling hunt for Greenland (Gambell, 1993; Caulfield, 1993). However, Iceland reported a catch of 136 whales  in the 1988/89 and 1989/90 seasons, and has since ceased reporting fin whale kills to the IWC (Perry et al., 1999). In total, there have been 239 reported kills of fin whales from the North Atlantic from 1988 to 1995.      Like right whales and humpback whales, anthropogenic mortality of fin whales includes entanglement in commercial fishing gear and ship strikes. A review of the records of stranded, floating or injured fin whales for the period 2005 through 2009 on file at NMFS found two records with substantial evidenc of fishery interactions causing mortality, and two records resulting in serious injury (Henry et al., 2011). Within that same time period, nine records were found that had sufficient information to confirm the cause of death as collisions with vessels (Henry et al, 2011) Experts believe that fin whales are struck by large vessels more frequently than any other cetacean (Laist et al., 2001).4.1.3.5 Behavior and Susceptibility to Entanglement      As discussed, fishing gear entanglements are a source of anthropogenic mortality to fin whales. Feeding behavior may be an important factor that contributes to the risk of  entanglement.      Fin whales exhibit lunge feeding techniques near the ocean surface, similar to humpback whales. Fin whales typically approach a prey patch horizontally, sometimes rapidly turning or rolling on their side inside a prey patch (Watkins and Schevill, 1979). Fin whales have also been observed feeding below the surface and fairly close to the bottom in about 15 to 20 meters of water. Entanglement data from 1997 through 2003 indicate few records of fin whale entanglement events (Kenney and Hartley, 2001; Hartley et al., 2003; Whittigham et al., 2005a; Whittingham et al., 2005b) Based on this information, fin whales seem to encounter gear less often than right and humpback whales. This statement is also supported by fin whale catalogs curated by College of the Atlantic and the Center for Coastal Studies, both of which contain records identifying fin whales that lack entanglement-related scarring.4.1.4 Minke Whale      The minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) is not listed as endangered or threatened under the ESA, although the species is protected under the MMPA. The total fishery-related mortality and serious injury for this stock does not exceed PBR (see below). Therefore, this is not considered a strategic stock.
4.1.4.1 Range      Minke whales off the eastern coast of the United States are considered to be part of the Canadian east coast population, which inhabits the area from the eastern half of Davis Strait south to the Gulf of Mexico. Spring and summer are times of relatively widespread and common occurrence, and during this time minke whales are most abundant in New England waters. During fall, there are fewer minke whales in New England waters, while during winter, the species seems to be largely absent (Waring et al., 2012). Records hint at a possible winter distribution in the West Indies and in mid-ocean south and east of Bermuda (Mitchell, 1991). As with several other cetacean species, the possibility of a deep-ocean component to distribution exists but remains unconfirmed.4.1.4.2 Life History and Reproductive Success      Female minke whales reach sexual maturity between six and eight years of age (Waring et al., 2012). The calving interval is between 1 and 2 years, and calves are probably born during October to March after 10 to 11 months gestation and nursing lasts for less than six months (Waring et al., 2012).4.1.4.3 Abundance      An abundance estimate of 2,591 (CV=0.81) minke whales was generated from a shipboard and aerial survey conducted during June-August 2011 (Palka 2012). The aerial portion that contributed to the abundance estimate covered 5,313 km of tracklines that were over waters waters north of New Jersey and shallower than the 100-m depth contour through the U.S. and Canadian Gulf of Maine, and up to and including the lower Bay of Fundy. The shipboard portion covered 3,107 km of tracklines that were in water offshore of North Carolina to Massachusetts (waters that were deeper than the 100-m depth contour out to beyond the U.S. EEZ). Both sighting platforms used a two-simultaneous team data collection procedure, which allows estimation of abundance corrected for perception bias of the detected species (Laake and Borchers, 2004). Estimation of the abundance was based on the independent observer approach assuming point independence (Laake and Borchers 2004) and calculated using the multiple covariate distance sampling (MCDS) option in the computer program Distance (version 6.0, release 2, Thomas et al. 2009). An abundance survey was conducted concurrently in the southernU.S. waters (from North Carolina to Florida). The abundance estimates from this southern  survey are being calculated and are not available at this time. The best estimate of the population of Canadian east coast minke whales is 20,741 (CV=0.30).   The minimum population estimate  is 16,199 (Waring et al., 2013).      PBR is the product of minimum population size, one-half the maximum productivity rate, and a “recovery” factor. The minimum population size is 16,199 and the maximum productivity rate is 0.04, the default value for cetaceans. The recovery factor is assumed to be 0.5 because the stock is of unknown status. The PBR for this stock of minke whales is 162 (Waring et al., 2013). Data are insufficient for determining a population trend for this species.
4.1.4.4 Factors Affecting Survival      Human-caused mortality in minke whales is relatively low in comparison to PBR for the species (69). However, fishing-related entanglements do occur. The strandings  and entanglement database, maintained by the New England Aquarium and NER NMFS include 36 records of minke whales within U.S. waters from 1975 to 1992. The gear includes unspecified fishing nets, unspecified cables or lines, fish traps, weirs, seines, gillnets, and lobster gear. The existing data can be summarized as follows:• U.S. Lobster Trap/Pot Fishery: Annual mortalities attributed to the Gulf of Maine and Mid-Atlantic lobster trap/pot fishery, as determined from strandings and entanglement records that have been audited, were one in 1991, two in 1992, one in 1994, one in 1995, zero in 1996, one in 1997, zero from 1998 to 2001, 1 in 2002, and 0 in 2003 through 2009.• Northeast Bottom Trawl Fishery: Fisheries observer data from the years 2005 through 2009 were pooled and bycatch rates for minke whales were estimated using a stratified ratio-estimator. Estimated bycatch rates from the pooled fisheries observer data were expanded by annual (2005-2009) fisheries data collected from mandatory vessel trip reports. The estimated annual mortality (CV in parentheses) attributed to this fishery was 4.78 (0.75) for 2005, 3.71 (0.73) for 2006, 3.28 (0.72) for 2007, 2.86 (0.73) for 2008, and 2.86 (0.75) for 2009. Annual average estimated minke whale mortality and serious injury from the Northeast bottom trawl fishery during 2005 to 2009 was 3.5 (CV=0.34) (Waring et al., 2012).• Other Fisheries: The audited NER entanglement/strandings database contains records of minke whales seriously injured or killed as a result of entanglement. Mortalities and serious injuries that were likely a result of aU.S. fishery interaction with an unknown fishery include 3 in 1997, 3 in 1999, 1 in 2000, 2 in 2001, 1 in 2002, 5 in 2003, 2 in 2004, 0 in 2005 and 2006, 1 in 2007, 1 in 2008 and 0 in 2009. During 2005 to 2009, as determined from stranding and entanglement records, the minimum detected annual average mortality and serious injury is 0.8 minke whales in unknown U.S. fisheries (Waring et al., 2012).      From 1999 to 2003, no minke whales were reported to be involved in ship strike incidents. During 2004 and 2005, one minke whale mortality was attributed to ship strike in  each year. During 2006 to 2008, no minke whale was confirmed struck by a ship. During 2009, one minke whale was confirmed dead due to a ship strike off New Jersey. Thus, during 2005 to 2009, as determined from stranding and entanglement records, the minimum detected annual average was 0.4 minke whales per year struck by ships (Waring et al., 2012)      In October 2003, an Unusual Mortality Event was declared involving minke whales and harbor seals along the coast of Maine; since then, the number of minke whale stranding reports has returned to normal. On October 11, 2009, the NOAA research vessel FSV Delaware II captured a minke whale during mid-water trawling operations associated with the 2009 Atlantic
Herring Acoustic survey. Although brought on deck, the animal was released alive and seemed to exhibit healthy behavior upon release (Waring et al., 2012).4.1.4.5 Behavior and Susceptibility to Entanglement      Based on Waring et al. (2012), fishing gear entanglements account for the majority of the human-caused mortalities of minke whales. Like the other large whale species  discussed, feeding behavior may be an important factor that contributes to entanglement risk.      Minke whales in the Northwest Atlantic typically feed on small schooling fish, such as sand lance, herring, cod, and mackerel (Ward, 1995). The whales may follow the movements of their prey and subsequently swim closer to shore and to heavy concentrations of fishing gear, making them more susceptible to entanglements. Studies conducted in the Bay of Fundy and Gulf of St. Lawrence indicated that minke whales feed by displaying surface lunges and rolling (Sears et al., 1981; Haycock and Mercer, 1984). In contrast, a study conducted on minke whales in Cape Cod Bay and Massachusetts Bay showed a lack of surface feeding behavior (Murphy, 1995). It is likely, however, that large whales may encounter gear in any part of the water column.4.2 OVERVIEW OF AFFECTED FISHERIES      The environment affected by the ALWTRP regulations includes human communities, particularly communities whose social and economic fabric depends in part upon commercial fishing operations that must comply with ALWTRP requirements. The affected fisheries include the following:• American lobster;• multispecies gillnet fisheries;• monkfish;• spiny dogfish;• shark;• coastal migratory pelagic species fisheries;• black sea bass;• hagfish;• red crab;• scup;• Jonah crab; and• conch/whelk.      The sections below provide a baseline socioeconomic characterization of these fisheries, discussing fishery regulations, landings, revenue, numbers of permitted vessels, and key ports.
The final section briefly reviews several additional fisheries that are either very small, occur primarily in waters exempted from the ALWTRP, or for which only a minor segment of the vessels fish gear that is regulated under the ALWTRP.      The analyses presented in this section are based primarily on data collected and maintained by NMFS’ Northeast Regional Office, Northeast Fisheries Science Center, and Southeast Regional Office. The data represent the best available information on east coast  fishing activity. Below, we describe the databases used and highlight key sources of uncertainty in the analyses.Northeast Dealer Data      In the Northeast, all seafood dealers handling the catch of federally-permitted vessels are required to hold dealer permits. While there is no fee for the permit, NMFS requires that dealers submit reports on the catch that they purchase. Specifically, a dealer must submit a report to NMFS for each fishing trip from which it purchased catch. Each dealer report includes information on:• date of purchase;• dealer name and address;• dealer number;• vessel name and permit number;• pounds of each species, by market category, if applicable;• value of each species, by market category, if applicable; and• port landed.Field office staff enter data into a coded form and send the data to the Northeast Fisheries Science Center to be incorporated into NMFS’ larger Oracle database.Analyses based on the dealer data warrant the following caveats:• The purchase reports that seafood dealers submit to NMFS are not required to provide information on the gear used to land the catch reported. This information is deduced by each individual NMFS Field Office based on personal knowledge of the vessel's primary gear, the predominant species caught on the trip, or firsthand information from the fisherman. Therefore, breakouts of catch by gear type are subject to uncertainty.• NMFS records only one gear type per dealer report. Thus, if two or more types of gear were used to catch the different species listed on the same dealer report, only the primary gear used on the trip will be noted and gear used to catch secondary species may be mischaracterized. This creates further uncertainty regarding gear types.
• Only dealers that hold Federal permits for handling certain species are required to submit dealer reports. Most notably, dealers who are only permitted to handle lobsters are exempt from any Federal reporting requirements. Thus, a considerable amount of lobster landings are  reported through state data collection programs.Southeast Logbook Data      NMFS requires all fishermen holding permits for Gulf of Mexico reef fish, South Atlantic snapper-grouper, King and Spanish mackerel, and shark to submit an individual report for every fishing trip made. Required information includes vessel data (such as vessel and crew characteristics), gear information, and catch information, including area fished and pounds landed. The characterization of affected fisheries relies on the logbook data to estimate the quantity of key southeast species caught with gear affected by ALWTRP regulations.5The logbook data are subject to the following caveats:• The logbook provides for the designation of only one type of gear per species for any one trip. If more than one type of gear is used for an individual species, some portion of the catch may be misattributed to the primary (recorded) gear used.• The Southeast logbook program does not require fishermen to provide information on the value of their landings. Thus, this information is not available for southeast fisheries.Permit Data      Fishermen are required to hold permits to fish for all federally managed species.6 Permit requirements are included as part of the Fishery Management Plans developed by the Regional Fishery Management Councils and/or the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC) and implemented by NMFS. Permit data are collected when fishermen apply to renew their fishing permits. NMFS’ Northeast and Southeast Regional offices maintain separate permit databases.      The characterization of affected fisheries relies on permit data to identify the number of vessels that may target a particular species. The analysis distinguishes between commercial and           5 This analysis refers to various types of gear as "affected by ALWTRP regulations."  It is important to  note, however, that not all of this gear is currently regulated under the ALWTRP. References to gear "affected by ALWTRP regulations" also include those types of gear potentially subject to the requirements of the ALWTRP, as specified by the regulatory alternatives discussed in Chapter 3.6 Fisheries may be managed by NMFS or by cooperative agreement between NMFS and the individualstates.
charter/party permits using permit category data. Because fishermen may not actually target all species for which they hold permits, this approach may lead to an overestimate of the number of vessels actively involved in a fishery.      The analysis also relies on permit data to identify the number of vessels likely to fish with gear regulated under the ALWTRP. When applying for permits in the Northeast, fishermen are required to indicate what gear they are likely to use, although they are not restricted to the use of this gear (unless stipulated in the FMP). As a result, the permit database indicates the gear the permit holder intended to use when the permit application was filed, not necessarily the gear currently used. The degree of inaccuracy that stems from this data limitation is unknown, but is likely minor. In addition to the caveat above, it is important to note that permit applications can designate multiple types of gear (ranked by likelihood of use). For the purpose of characterizing affected fisheries, the analysis examines the distribution of permits by both primary gear (i.e., the gear that the permit holder is most likely to use) and all gear noted on the permit application. This approach provides a more accurate indication of the number of vessels that may be affected by ALWTRP requirements.      Permit records provided by the Southeast Regional Office do not itemize the types of gear permitted in the case of general species/fishery specific commercial permits; gear-specific permits are only required to fish for certain species with specific types of gear (e.g., to fish for king mackerel with a gillnet, one must hold a "Gillnet Endorsement for King Mackerel" permit). Thus, we are not able to estimate the number of fishermen permitted to fish with specific types of gear for fisheries that are primarily based in the Southeast.4.2.1 American Lobster      The American lobster, Homarus americanus, is a bottom-dwelling, marine crustacean characterized by a shrimp-like body and ten legs, two of which are enlarged to serve as crushing and gripping appendages. American lobster are widely distributed over the continental shelf of North America. Inshore, they are most abundant from Maine through New Jersey, with abundance declining from northern to southern areas. Offshore, lobsters occur in U.S. waters from Maine through North Carolina (Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, August 19, 2003). The inshore fishery dominates the industry, accounting for the highest percentage of lobster harvest (Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, 2009).      Lobster growth and reproduction are linked to the molting cycle. Lobsters are encased in a hard external skeleton that provides body support and protection. Periodically, this skeleton is cast off to allow body size to increase and mating to take place. Eggs (7,000 to 80,000) are extruded and carried under the female's abdomen during a 9 to 11 month incubation period. The eggs hatch during late spring or early summer and the pelagic larvae undergo four molts before attaining adult characteristics and settling to the bottom. Lobsters typically reach legal, commercial size after five to seven growing seasons, or approximately 20 molting cycles.      Several types of gear are used in the American lobster fishery, but the majority of landings are associated with traps/pots. Between 1981 and 2007 traps/pots accounted for 98% of landings (Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, 2009). Traps/pots may be set singly,
each having its own surface line and buoy, or in multiple-trap/pot "trawls" where the traps/pots are linked together by groundlines, with surface lines and buoys (or high flyers) at the first  and/or last trap/pot. Traps/pots are further divided into general categories: inshore traps/pots and offshore traps/pots. Inshore trapping/potting typically involves smaller vessels fishing in coastal waters of depths up to 50 fathoms. In contrast, offshore, or deep-sea trapping/potting, usually involves much larger vessels using much heavier traps/pots and stronger line (Sainsbury, 1971).      Harvest levels of American lobster first prompted concern in the 1970s, resulting in the first Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the American lobster, adopted in 1983. This first FMP called for fishing effort limits, minimum carapace size requirements, a prohibition on the possession of egg-bearing (or "berried") lobsters, and a prohibition on landing lobster parts. Since that time, a number of plan amendments have been developed for both state and Federal waters. In December 1999, NMFS issued a Final Rule (64 FR 68228) transferring the Federal lobster fishery regulations created under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act) (50 CFR Part 649) to the state-oriented Atlantic Coastal Fisheries Cooperative Management Act (Atlantic Coastal Act) (50 CFR Part 697). This decision recognized that the Federal FMP, which covered only Federal waters, was insufficient to address overfishing.      Currently, the inshore American lobster fishery is managed under Amendment 3 of the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission's American Lobster Management Plan, as well as Addenda I through XVI to the plan. Adopted in December 1997, primary regulatory measures under Amendment 3 include carapace size limits, protection of ovigerous females, gear restrictions, and nominal effort control measures. In addition, Amendment 3 created seven lobster management areas (see Exhibit 4-1). These include the Inshore Gulf of Maine (Area 1), Inshore Southern New England (Area 2), Offshore Waters (Area 3), Inshore Northern Mid- Atlantic (Area 4), Inshore Southern Mid-Atlantic (Area 5), New York and Connecticut State Waters (Area 6), and Outer Cape Cod. Lobster Conservation Management Teams (LCMTs), composed of industry representatives, were formed for each management area. They advise the American Lobster Management Board and recommend changes to the management plan within their area.      Under Federal regulations for the American lobster fishery, Federal permits are limited access meaning that no new entrants are allowed, although permits may be bought, sold, and transferred to another vessel. In 2011, there were approximately 2,800 Federal lobster permits issued to vessels using trap/pot gear. The number of commercial trap/pot vessels that hold Federal permits for each lobster management area is presented in Exhibit 4-2.

State- permitted operators who wish to fish in Federal waters must also hold a Federal permit and abide by the more restrictive of the two (Federal or state) regulations.      Lobster has consistently ranked among the Atlantic coast's most commercially important species. In 2011, total revenue totaled more than $420 million up from approximately $400 million the year before. Additional detail on annual lobster landings and ex-vessel revenue is presented in Exhibit 4-3.Exhibit 4-3LANDINGS AND REVENUE FOR THE AMERICAN LOBSTER FISHERY: 2006 - 2011Fishing Year Landings (million lbs) Revenue ($ millions)200692.61395.15200778.37354.99200888.09326.75200998.22303.322010116.25399.482011126.46423.79Source: Dealer data provided by NMFS Northeast Region.

Maine consistently accounts for the greatest share of the lobster catch, with landings in 2011 of approximately 105 million pounds. Massachusetts, the second leading producer, had landings in 2011 of nearly 13 million pounds. Together, Maine and Massachusetts
accounted for about 94 percent of total national landings.

These species, which are listed in Exhibit 4-6, are grouped together under one FMP  because the fish share common habitats and are often caught at the same time. They are present
in shallow coastal areas, deep waters, and ocean banks such as Georges and Stellwagen Banks. The majority of the commercial fishing activity targeting these species occurs in the Northeast, where cooler waters support a greater abundance of groundfish. For more information on each species regulated under the Multispecies FMP, including common and scientific names, a brief summary of key biological facts relevant to each species, commercial uses, and a drawing of a representative member of each species, see Appendix 4-B.Exhibit 4-6         SPECIES/STOCKS MANAGED UNDER THE NORTHEAST MULTISPECIES FISHERY MANAGEMENT PLANSpeciesAssociated StocksAmerican plaiceOne stock: distributed primarily in the Gulf of Maine.Atlantic codTwo stocks: Gulf of Maine cod and Georges Bank cod.Atlantic halibutOne stock: distributed primarily in the Gulf of Maine and on Georges Bank.HaddockTwo stocks: Gulf of Maine haddock and Georges Bank haddock.Ocean poutOne stock: distributed throughout the region.Offshore hakeOne stock: distributed primarily offshore in southern New England and the Mid-Atlantic.PollockOne stock: distributed in the Gulf of Maine, Georges Bank, and southern NewEngland regions.Red hake (ling)Two stocks: Gulf of Maine/northern Georges Bank red and southern GeorgesBank/southern New England red.RedfishOne stock: distributed primarily in the Gulf of Maine and southern GeorgesBank.Silver hake (whiting)Two stocks: Gulf of Maine/northern Georges Bank whiting and southernGeorges Bank/southern New England whiting.White hakeOne stock: distributed primarily in the Gulf of Maine and southern GeorgesBank.Windowpane flounderTwo stocks: Gulf of Maine/Georges Bank windowpane and southern NewEngland/Mid-Atlantic windowpane.Winter flounderThree stocks: Gulf of Maine winter, Georges Bank winter, and southern New England/Mid-Atlantic winter.Witch flounderOne stock: distributed primarily in the Gulf of Maine and on Georges Bank.Yellowtail flounderThree stocks: Georges Bank yellowtail, Cape Cod yellowtail, and southern NewEngland/Middle Atlantic yellowtail.Source: NEFMC, 2003a.      The Northeast Multispecies FMP was adopted in 1986 and has been modified by numerous amendments and framework adjustments. Management measures currently include a limited access permit system, gear restrictions, seasonal and full-time area closures, days-at-sea allocations, trip limits, minimum fish sizes, and reporting requirements. Framework Adjustment 46 went into effect September 14, 2011 (76 FR 56985), and Amendment 17 was proposedDecember 12, 2011 (76 FR 77200).      In 2011, 3,044 multispecies permits were issued. This includes active and inactive permits, as well as limited and open access permits. Open access permits include handgear, party/charter, scallop, multispecies 300-pound possession limit, and non-regulated multispecies (small mesh multispecies and halibut) permits. Most full-time commercial groundfish vessels hold limited access permits.
      In 2011, 3,044 vessels possessed Northeast multispecies permits.  Exhibit 4-7 presents  the total number of permitted vessels, by type of gear and primary gear type, for all permit categories. The most prevalent primary gear type is "other gear" – which includes hand lines,  rod and reel, harpoons, diving gear, and other unspecified types of gear – followed by bottom trawls. Only 204 vessels (6.7 percent) holding Northeast multispecies permits in 2011 indicated ALWTRP regulated gear (gillnets, traps/pots) as the primary gear (see shading).Exhibit 4-7PERMITTED NORTHEAST MULTISPECIES VESSELS, FY2011 1Gear NameBy All GearBy Primary GearNumber% of TotalNumber% of TotalPurse Seine1474.8%100.3%Beach Seine1394.6%00.0%Boat Seine1444.7%20.1%Bottom Trawls119139.1%133043.8%Mid-Water Trawls49016.1%90.3%Other Trawls44114.5%260.9%Dredge35711.7%39913.1%Gill/Entangling Nets274924.6%2739.0%Pots and Traps21254.1%381.3%Longlines and Setlines60820.0%1073.5%Other Gear 3217671.5%255581.1%ALL GEAR TYPES 4,53044100.0%3038100.0%Notes:1	Permits are issued by fishing year.

4.2.3 Monkfish      Monkfish (also called goosefish or anglerfish), Lophius americanus, occur from the southern and eastern Grand Banks (Newfoundland) and the northern Gulf of St. Lawrence to the east coast of Florida (to about 29°00′ N latitude), but are common only north of Cape Hatteras. Monkfish have been found in depths ranging from the tide line to 840 meters, although the greatest concentrations occur between 70 and 100 meters, and in deeper water at about 190 meters. Females live approximately 12 years and reach an average size of just over 100 centimeters, while males have rarely been found older than six years and reach lengths of approximately 90 centimeters.      The New England Fishery Management Council (NEFMC) and the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council (MAFMC) work together to develop measures for management of the monkfish fishery in Federal waters under the Magnuson-Stevens Act. Regulations to implement the Monkfish FMP became effective, in part, in November 1999 (the remainder on May 1, 2000) and include separation of the management unit into two management areas (the Northern Fishery Management Area and the Southern Fishery Management Area), limited access vessel permits, dealer and operator permits, trip limits, days-at-sea (DAS) allocations, reporting requirements, and gear restrictions (including a limit on the number and length of gillnets fished, a gillnet tagging requirement, and a minimum mesh size for gillnets). The principal types of gear used in the commercial monkfish fishery are trawl and sink gillnet gear (see below); scallop dredge gear also contributes to landings.      In addition to measures promulgated under the FMP, operation of the gillnet sector of the monkfish fishery is further modified by management measures developed under the ALWTRP, the Harbor Porpoise Take Reduction Plan, and the ESA Final Rule for Large-Mesh Gillnet Fisheries. Cumulatively, these measures provide for additional gear restrictions and seasonal  area closures to reduce interactions between monkfish (and other gillnet fisheries) and large whales, sea turtles, and harbor porpoise.      The management unit (over which permits are granted) for monkfish extends throughout the portion of its principal range in U.S. waters, from Maine to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. The limited access program restricts participation in the monkfish fishery to those boats with sufficient landings during a qualification period. During 2011, 720 vessels qualified for  monkfish limited access permits, and 1,824 vessels received incidental catch permits. Exhibit 4- 10 presents the number of vessels permitted to fish monkfish, by gear type and primary gear type. The prevalent primary gear type among permitted vessels is the bottom trawl, followed by "other gear" and gill/entangling nets. A total of 479 vessels (approximately 18.9 percent)  holding monkfish permits indicated an ALWTRP affected gear as their primary gear.

Gillnets and trawls were used to catch the greatest percentage of monkfish, and they landed 62 percent and 19 percent of the annual yield, respectively (see Exhibit 4-11). Of the total landings, about 6.7 million pounds (about 62 percent) were caught using ALWTRP regulated gear (fixed and drift gillnets and trap/pots).

4.2.4 Spiny Dogfish      Spiny dogfish, Squalus acanthias, is a shark belonging to the class Chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fishes). They can be found on both sides of the Atlantic. In the  Northwest Atlantic, they range from Florida to Labrador, but are most abundant from Nova Scotia to Cape Hatteras. The Northwest Atlantic stock tends to spend summer months in waters from Massachusetts to Canada and the remainder of the year entirely in U.S. waters.  Spiny dogfish are landed in every state from Maine to North Carolina and in all months of the year. During the fall and winter months, spiny dogfish are taken principally in Mid-Atlantic waters and southward from New Jersey to North Carolina. During the spring and summer months, spiny dogfish are landed mainly in northern waters from New York to Maine (Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, 2002).      The New England Fishery Management Council (NEFMC) and the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council (MAFMC) work together to develop measures for management of the spiny dogfish fishery in Federal waters under the Magnuson-Stevens Act. Regulations to implement the Spiny Dogfish Fishery Management Plan (FMP) became effective February 2000, and include permitting requirements for vessels (open access permit), dealers, and vessel operators. The regulations implementing the FMP also require establishment of an annual commercial quota subdivided into two semi-annual periods. The FMP was modified in 2006 (Framework 1) to allow for annual specifications to remain in effect for up to 5 years. All spiny dogfish landed for a commercial purpose from Maine through Florida must be applied against the commercial quota, regardless of where the spiny dogfish were caught. The fishery is closed for the remainder of the quota period once the quota available for that period has been harvested. Since spiny dogfish are also commercially fished in state waters where the ASMFC has primary oversight, the ASMFC has developed an Interstate Fishery Management Plan (ISFMP) for spiny dogfish. That plan was approved in late 2002 and implemented by each state beginning May 1, 2003 (consistent with the start of the 2003 spiny dogfish fishing year under the Federal FMP).      Because of mortality rates, the Spiny Dogfish FMP initially contained a restrictive rebuilding schedule, limiting the harvest of dogfish until the stock is rebuilt. For the period from May 1, 2000, through April 30, 2002, the annual quota was set at 4 million pounds, with trip limits of 600 pounds and 300 pounds for quota periods I and II, respectively. In July 2005, however, ASMFC published a draft addendum to the spiny dogfish FMP. The addendum calls for a system under which quotas can be specified in any given year for up to 5 years, based on expectations of future stocks projected by the best information (ASMFC, 2005). This  amendment was adopted in November 2005, and is now in effect.      Exhibit 4-13 presents the number of permitted vessels by gear type and primary gear. Approximately 2,743 vessels were permitted to fish for spiny dogfish in 2011. The most common primary gear type among permitted vessels is the bottom trawl, followed by "other gear" and gill/entangling nets. A total of 584 vessels (21.3 percent) holding spiny  dogfish permits in 2011 indicated an ALWTRP affected gear (predominantly gillnets) as the primary gear (see shading).

4.2.5 The Directed Shark Gillnet Fishery      Sharks belong to the class Chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fishes), which also includes rays, skates, and deepwater chimaeras (ratfishes). There is great diversity in size, feeding habits, behavior, and reproduction among the 350 species of sharks. Shark habitat can be described in four broad categories: (1) coastal, (2) pelagic, (3) coastal-pelagic, and (4)  deep-dwelling. Coastal species inhabit estuaries, the nearshore and waters of the continental shelves, e.g., blacktip, finetooth, bull, lemon, and sharpnose sharks (which are thought to enter wetland tidal creeks). Pelagic species, on the other hand, range widely in the upper zones of the oceans, often traveling over entire ocean basins. Examples include mako, blue, and oceanic whitetip sharks. Coastal-pelagic species are intermediate in that they occur both inshore and beyond the continental shelf, but have demonstrated mid-ocean or transoceanic movements. Sandbar, scalloped hammerhead, and dusky sharks are examples of this group. Deep-dwelling sharks,  e.g., most cat sharks and gulper sharks, inhabit the dark, cold waters of the continental slopes and deeper waters of the ocean basins. For additional information on the life history and essential  fish habitat of each shark species, see Chapters 5 and 6 of the Highly Migratory Species (HMS) FMP, and Chapter 10 of Amendment 1 to the HMS FMP.      There is extreme diversity in the more than 350 species of sharks found in the world’s oceans. In the western Atlantic, 39 species are managed under the HMS FMP; the spiny dogfish is managed under the authority of the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission as well as the New England and mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Councils. Based on a combination of ecology and fishery dynamics, the sharks included under the HMS FMP have been divided into four species groups for management purposes: (1) large coastal species, (2) small coastal  species, (3) pelagic species, and (4) prohibited species. Exhibit 4-16 lists the shark species in each management group. Data on other species collectively categorized as ‘deepwater and other sharks’ (such as smooth dogfish and the catsharks) are collected, but those species are not actively managed at this time.

This 1993 FMP was replaced in 1999 when NMFS published the final FMP for Atlantic Tunas, Swordfish and Sharks (also called the Highly Migratory Species (HMS) FMP). All Federal fisheries for Atlantic sharks, except spiny dogfish, are managed under the HMS FMP. The HMS FMP contains numerous measures to rebuild or prevent overfishing of Atlantic sharks in commercial and recreational fisheries, including permitting and reporting
requirements, quotas for commercial landings, recreational bag limits, fishery closures, minimum size requirements, limited access, and a list of prohibited shark species. NMFS recently  amended the HMS FMP, and published a final rule for Amendment I to the FMP in the Federal Register on December 24, 2003 (68 FR 74746). On April 15, 2004, NMFS published a notice in the Federal Register that identified NOAA-approved Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) devices for use by vessels participating in all of the Atlantic HMS fisheries and vessels participating in the Southeast shark gillnet fishery (69 FR 19979). A proposed rule to identify an effective date for the VMS requirement was published on May 18, 2004 (69 FR 28106). For more information about recent management actions to the HMS FMP see Chapter 9.4.3.5.      In the Atlantic Ocean, the directed shark fishery is most active in southern waters. As of October 2011, 412 vessels in southern waters possessed permits to fish for shark. Of these vessels, 199 had incidental shark permits, and 210 had directed shark permits. However, few permit holders have been known to use gillnet gear to target sharks in recent years.4.2.6 Coastal Migratory Pelagic Species      Coastal migratory pelagic species are characterized as coastal, fast swimming, fast- growing, schooling fishes (Hoese, H.D. and Moore, R.H., 1977). Coastal migratory pelagic (CMP) fishes inhabiting waters off the southeastern United States include Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus maculatus), king mackerel (Scomberomorus cavalla), cobia (Rachycentron canadum). These species range in coastal and continental shelf waters from the Northeastern United States to Brazil. King and Spanish mackerel are major target species of important commercial fisheries in Florida and North Carolina, as well as major target species for the private boat and charter boat recreational fishery in the South Atlantic region. Small amounts of king and Spanish mackerel are caught as an incidental catch or supplemental commercial target species off Georgia and South Carolina. Spanish mackerel is landed primarily by run-around gillnets, other gillnets, and to a lesser extent, hook and line. Most king mackerel landed in the South Atlantic region are taken by hook and line gear. Of the coastal pelagic species, only Spanish mackerel are caught in significant quantities by gillnets. Gillnet effort in the Southeast  is typically between April and November with peaks in May and October. Exhibit 4-17 includes a gradation of gillnet effort in the Southeast Atlantic. Gillnet effort for coastal migratory pelagic species in the South Atlantic from 2009 -2011. Effort is calculated as a function of gillnet depth, length, and soak hours and displayed as standard deviations to protect data confidentiality. Orange coloration represents average effort whereas red is above average and yellow is below average. These data were compiled from the 2012 SEFSC Commercial Logbook and provided by the NMFS SERO LAPP/DM Branch.
Exhibit 4-17      The Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for Coastal Migratory Pelagic Resources of the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic is jointly managed by the South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Councils (GMFMC and SAFMC, 1983). The plan was approved in 1982
and implemented by regulations effective in February of 1983. Current regulations implemented under the FMP address king and Spanish mackerel, and cobia. The present management regime for CMP species recognizes two migratory groups each of king mackerel, Spanish mackerel, and cobia: the Gulf Migratory Group and the Atlantic Migratory Group. King mackerel from these two groups seasonally mix on the East Coast of Florida.      Fishing season for CMP species is open year-round until the annual landings quota is filled. The Atlantic landings quotas are 3.88 million pounds for king mackerel; 3.13 million pounds for Spanish mackerel; and 125,712 for Cobia. An annual permit is required to fish under the commercial quota for king and Spanish mackerel. In 2005, NMFS adopted Amendment 15  to the FMP for Coastal Migratory Pelagic Resources. The amendment defined the limited access system and made permanent a previously adopted temporary moratorium on king mackerel permits. Amendment 17, adopted in 2006, established a limited access system on for-hire CMP permits in the Gulf. CMP for-hire permits in the South Atlantic and Spanish mackerel commercial permits are open access. A cobia commercial permit is currently under consideration. In 2011, Amendment 18, established annual catch limits, annual catch targets and accountability measures for all coastal pelagic species.      During the 2012 calendar year, 4,742 vessels possessed permits to fish for coastal migratory pelagic species. The breakdown of vessels by permit type is presented in Exhibit 4-18.  Vessels may have multiple permits.	Exhibit 4-18VESSELS POSSESSING ATLANTIC COASTAL MIGRATORY PELAGIC PERMITS IN 2012, BY PERMIT TYPEPermit Type1Number of VesselsCharter Vessels1,525King Mackerel (commercial)1,403King Mackerel (gillnet endorsement)22Spanish Mackerel (commercial)1,792Notes:1	Permit data provided by the Southeast Regional Office does not itemize "gear types permitted" in the case of general species/fisheryspecific commercial permits.

Two distinct populations (northern and southern Atlantic) are thought to exist, with overlapping ranges; hence, they are managed separately (NMFS, 2003c). However, current genetic research
indicates that there is mixing between the two populations and they may indeed be one stock (South Atlantic Fishery Management Council, 2003).      Most black sea bass begin life as females and later transform into males, and most individuals (both sexes) attain sexual maturity by age three. Transformation from female to male generally occurs between ages two and five. Females are rarely found older than eight years  (>35 cm), while males may live up to 15 years (>60 cm.) Black sea bass are omnivorous and generally feed on crustaceans, mollusks, echinoderms, fish, and plants.7      The discussion below provides a brief overview of the northern and southern black sea bass fisheries.4.2.7.1 Northern Fishery      The northern portion of the black sea bass fishery, which extends from Cape Hatteras to the U.S./Canada border, is managed under the Summer Flounder, Scup, and Black Sea Bass FMP. Because the fishery occurs in both state and Federal waters, the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council (MAFMC) and the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC) jointly developed the FMP.8 Amendment 13 to this FMP provided the most recent management changes for the black sea bass fishery. Amendment 13 established an annual (calendar year) coast-wide catch quota for the commercial black sea bass fishery to replace the quarterly quota allocation system, and allows vessels to retain their Northeast Region Black Sea Bass Permit during a Federal fishery closure. Framework Adjustment 5 to the FMP, adopted in 2004, allows for annual specifications to remain in effect for up to 3 years (69 FR 62818).      Current management measures under the FMP include mandatory vessel trip reporting and gear restrictions. The owner of a vessel issued a black sea bass moratorium permit must mark all traps/pots with the vessel's USCG number or state registration number. Traps/pots must also have an escape vent compliant with the options listed in 50 CFR 648.144 (b)(2), as well as a ghost panel affixed to the trap/pot with degradable fasteners and hinges (50 CFR  648.144(b)(3)).9 There is no tagging program for this gear and no trap/pot limit.      The commercial fishery has limited-access restrictions. In the 2011 fishing year, 1,554 vessels held permits for this fishery (799 vessels held commercial moratorium permits; 819 vessels held charter party permits). Exhibit 4-19 presents the number of vessels permitted to fish for black sea bass in the Northeast in 2011, organized by intended gear. The most prevalent primary gear type is “other gear” – which includes hand lines, rod and reel, harpoons, diving gear, and other unspecified types of gear – followed by bottom trawls and traps/pots.

182 vessels (about 12 percent) holding black sea bass permits in the Northeast in 2011 indicated an ALWTRP affected gear type as their primary gear.Exhibit 4-19PERMITTED NORTHERN BLACK SEA BASS VESSELS, FY2011 1Gear NameBy All GearBy Primary GearNumber% of TotalNumber% of TotalPurse Seine613.9%70.5%Beach Seine583.7%00.0%Boat Seine593.8%00.0%Bottom Trawls55135.5%46029.7%Mid-Water Trawls26917.3%70.5%Other Trawls22714.6%70.5%Dredge16310.5%261.7%Gill/Entangling Nets227417.6%483.1%Pots and Traps227117.4%1348.6%Longlines and Setlines18311.8%70.5%Other Gear 3116074.6%86555.8%ALL GEAR TYPES 4,51,554100.0%1,551100.0%Notes:1	Permits are issued by fishing year.

4.2.7.2 Southern Fishery10      The southern portion of the black sea bass fishery, which extends from Cape Hatteras, NC to Cape Canaveral, FL, is managed under the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council's (SAFMC) Snapper-Grouper Fishery Management Plan (FMP). Amendment 8 of this FMP established a limited-entry system for the snapper-grouper fishery. Under this system, individuals who wish to obtain a snapper-grouper permit must buy two transferable vessel permits, one of which is then retired, thus reducing participation in the fishery and pressure on the resource.  These regulations were implemented July 16, 1998.11  In 2012, Amendment 18A to the Snapper-Grouper FMP further limited participation and effort in the black sea bass fishery by limiting permits to only those fishers with relatively strong landings history and limiting pots to only 35 per vessel annually. Furthermore, pots must now be brought back to shore at the conclusion of each trip, which are typically 24 hours or less. SAFMC published a proposed rule (Amendment 19) on July 2, 2013 (78 FR 39700) which, among other things, proposed a closure of the commercial black sea bass fishery in the South Atlantic from approximately Cape Hatteras, North Carolina to Cape Canaveral, Florida from November 1 through April 30. That closure became effective when the final rule was published on September 23, 2013 (78 FR 58249).While black sea bass pots are allowed throughout the EEZ north of Cape Canaveral, Florida (except in special management zones), the majority of the pot fishery is concentrated off North Carolina and northern South Carolina and North Florida. Pots must include a panel or door with an opening equal to or larger than the interior end of the pot's funnel, and the hinges and fasteners of each panel or door must be made of a degradable material.  The fishing year is June 1 through May 31 each year; however, commercial black sea bass pot fishing has not occurred during the November through April time period since December 2009. In those years, the annual catch limit was reached and fishing by the commercial sector was prohibited.      The southern black sea bass pot fishery, which is managed under the Snapper-Grouper FMP, is a limited access fishery with only 32 endorsements (see Exhibit 4-22).           10 The information in this section is taken from the SAFMC Summary of the Trap/Pot Fisheries Currently Managed by the SAFMC, distributed at the ALWTRT Meeting held April 28-30, 2003, in Warwick, Rhode Island.11 M.

Hagfish generally inhabit areas of soft bottom mud and prefer the cool temperatures found in deep water. They have a long eel-like form and can reach a maximum size of between one and a half and two feet. Hagfish are commonly referred to as "slime eels" or "slime hags" because of their ability to secrete copious amounts of slime from a series of mucous sacs on either side of their abdomen (NMFS, 1996).      The hagfish fishery developed out of a need to find other marketable species in areas where traditional commercial stocks have declined. A 1996 report submitted to NMFS examined the potential for establishing a hagfish fishery in the Northeastern U.S. and concluded that
adequate demand exists. This demand comes largely from Korea, where the eelskin is tanned into leather and the meat is used as a food source. Traditionally, the fish are exported whole and all processing takes place in Korea.      Currently, the Atlantic hagfish fishery is not regulated, but NMFS and the New England Fishery Management Council are moving toward developing a management scheme for the fishery. In April 2002, the Northeast Region Coordinating Council placed the review of  a hagfish assessment on the agenda for the 37th Stock Assessment Review Committee (SARC) workshop.12 On August 28, 2002 NMFS issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that established a control date for potential future use in determining historical or traditional participation in the fishery.13 In this notice, NMFS also stated its intent to encourage the New England Fishery Management Council to develop an FMP for the fishery, preventing overcapitalization and increased pressure on the stock due to a movement of vessels into the fishery. This action was motivated, in part, because scientific studies suggest that Atlantic hagfish are likely vulnerable to overfishing due to the low reproductive capacity of the species (67 FR 55191). As a result of these findings, NMFS and the Council are currently developing a hagfish FMP (NMFS, 2005).      Landings of hagfish in the Northeastern U.S. totaled 4.9 million pounds in 2010. 14 Nearly all hagfish were caught with fish pots, gear that may be affected by revisions to the ALWTRP. Exhibit 4-24 summarizes landings by the type of gear used.Exhibit 4-24NORTHERN HAGFISH LANDINGS BY GEAR TYPE, 2011Gear TypeTotal Pounds LandedPercent of Total Pounds LandedPots and Traps1,350,80189.08%Gill Nets75,1784.96%Other Nets74,9614.94%Dredge15,5321.02%TOTAL1,516,472100.00%Note:1	Source: Dealer data provided by NMFS, Northeast Region, FisheriesStatistics Office.      The ex-vessel value of hagfish landings in the Northeast totaled approximately $1.1 million in 2011. Revenues were recorded in the ports of Portland, Maine and Gloucester, Massachusetts (see Exhibit 4-25).           12 The SARC was tasked with determining stock size and abundance and estimating biological reference points. It met on June 4, 2003, and developed a set of research needs for the future; the final report on this meeting  is forthcoming.           13 The notice also served to deny the rulemaking requested in a Petition for Rulemaking asking NMFS to implement emergency measures to limit entry into the fishery, as emergency action was deemed unnecessary.           14 Because hagfish is not traditionally considered a target species, reporting of hagfish landings is not required. Thus, landings reported are likely an underestimate of actual landings.

They are typically found at depths of 200 to 1,800 meters (700-5,900 feet), reach a maximum carapace width of 180 mm, and may live 15 years or more (Serchuk and Wigley, 1982).15 Scientific research suggests that red crabs are most likely opportunistic omnivores due to the limited availability of food at the depths common for this species. The red crab fishery was previously limited by the high catch-related mortality of the crabs (and rapid degradation of the meat) and a lack of economical processing. Technological advances have made fishing for this species feasible and fresh and frozen meat from the crab is now sold commercially (NEFMC, 2002).      Vessels operating in the red crab fishery typically make 28 to 35 trips per year, with each trip lasting seven to ten days. Trips are limited in duration primarily by the hold capacity of the vessel and the need to keep the product fresh and alive. Vessels fish 500 to 600 traps/pots using 90 to 120 traps/pots per trawl. Traps/pots are allowed to soak 18 to 36 hours, with an average soaking time of 22.5 hours. The reported average trap/pot loss is just over 10 pots/traps per trip (NEFMC, 2002).      Management of the red crab fishery under the Magnuson-Stevens Act occurred relatively recently. Following a request from the New England Fishery Management Council (NEFMC), the Secretary of Commerce issued an emergency rule effective May 18, 2001 for management of the red crab fishery in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) from 35°15.3' North Latitude (the latitude of Cape Hatteras Light, NC) northward to the U.S./Canada border. An FMP was subsequently developed by the NEFMC, approved by NMFS and implemented by regulations effective October 20, 2002 (NEFMC, 2002). The regulations include measures to limit and
lacking.
15 Serchuk and Wigley (1982) suggest that precise information on life-span and growth rate for red crabs is
control effort in the fishery, including a limited-access permit system. Specifically, access to the fishery is limited to those fishermen who met specific criteria during a qualifying period; no additional entrants are allowed, but permits may be sold or otherwise transferred to a new owner. The regulations include gear restrictions and days-at-sea (DAS) allocations. Other measures include gear marking requirements, mandatory vessel trip reports, and a requirement for operator permits and dealer permits (NMFS, 2002a). Amendment 3 to the Red Crab FMP was published in 2011. This amendment established an annual catch limit and accountability measures, as well as removing the DAS system and implementing a hard total allowable landings limit.      Of the 1,539 vessels permitted to fish for red crab in 2011, 1,534 vessels had incidental bycatch permits and five had controlled access permits. Exhibit 4-26 presents a count of vessels permitted to fish for red crab by all intended gear types, and by primary gear type, within the red crab management unit. Traps/pots are the most prevalent primary gear, followed closely by bottom trawls, then dredges. In all, 852 vessels (55.1 percent) holding red crab permits in 2011 indicated an ALWTRP affected gear type as the primary gear. It is noteworthy that virtually all of the red crab sold commercially since 2011 was landed by the five vessels with controlled access permits; these vessels use trap/pot gear potentially subject to ALWTRP regulations.Exhibit 4-26NORTHEAST PERMITTED RED CRAB VESSELS, 20111Gear NameBy All GearBy Primary GearNumber% of TotalNumber% of TotalPurse Seine100.4%20.1%Beach Seine70.3%00.0%Boat Seine80.3%00.0%Bottom Trawls58623.5%44128.7%Mid-Water Trawls1365.5%50.3%Other Trawls1094.4%161.0%Dredge26810.8%1217.9%Gill/Entangling Nets21937.0%654.2%Pots and Traps291736.8%78751.2%Longlines and Setlines562.2%10.1%Other Gear 32018.1%986.4%ALL GEAR TYPES 4,52,491100.0%1,536100.0%Notes:1	Permits are issued by fishing year.

      About 3.6 million pounds of red crab were landed in the Northeastern U.S. in fishing year 2011.

Seasonal migrations occur during spring and autumn. In summer, scup are common in inshore waters from Massachusetts to Virginia, while in winter, scup are found in offshore waters between Hudson Canyon and Cape Hatteras at depths ranging from 70 to 180 meters (38 to 98 fathoms). Sexual maturity is essentially complete by age three at a total length of 21 centimeters (8.3 inches), and spawning occurs during summer months. Scup attain a maximum fork length of about 40 centimeters (16 inches), and ages of up to 20 years have been reported. Tagging studies have indicated the possibility of two stocks, one in southern New
England waters and the other extending south from New Jersey. However, because the separation of stocks is not well-defined spatially, they are not considered distinct (NMFS, 2003b).      The fishery is now managed under the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council's Summer Flounder, Scup, and Black Sea Bass FMP. Management within the commercial fishery includes a moratorium on commercial permits. Under this moratorium, only a limited number of permits are granted each year. Additional regulations include annually adjustable commercial trawl mesh and minimum size restrictions, and commercial catch quotas for the fishing year (January 1-December 31) (Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council, 2003). The scup season  is divided into three periods: Winter I, Summer, and Winter II. The fishery is closed each period once the quota for the season has been reached. Also, Framework Adjustment 5 to the FMP, adopted in 2004, allows for annual specifications to remain in effect for up to 3 years (69 FR 62818).      In 2011, NMFS issued commercial moratorium permits for scup to 761 vessels and charter/party permits to 761 vessels. Both the commercial moratorium and charter/party permits have mandatory reporting requirements and are included in the Vessel Trip Reporting system. Exhibit 4-29 presents the number of vessels permitted to fish for scup in the Northeast under the authority of the Summer Flounder, Scup, and Black Sea Bass FMP, by intended gear type and intended primary gear type. The most prevalent primary gear type is "other gear" – which includes hand lines, rod and reel, harpoons, diving gear, and other unspecified types of gear – followed by bottom trawls. A total of 114 vessels (about 8 percent) holding scup permits in 2011 indicated an ALWTRP affected gear type as their primary gear.      Scup landings in the Northeastern U.S. totaled approximately 15 million pounds in 2011. Trawls and other or non-coded types of fishing gear were used to catch the greatest percentage of scup, with about 59 percent and 26 percent, respectively (see Exhibit 4-30).      The ex-vessel value of scup landings in the Northeast totaled $8.2 million in 2011. Exhibit 4-31 summarizes the top grossing ports for scup in 2011. As shown, Point Judith, Rhode Island is the leading port, although significant quantities of scup are also landed at other locations.

Little is known about the species’ biology, distribution, and relative abundance. Also known as the Rock crab and the Bull crab, Jonah crabs are found from Florida to Nova Scotia, mainly in offshore, rocky habitats. Females obtain a carapace width of 100 mm after about eight years,
and males reach 130 mm in six to seven years. Individuals larger than 190 mm have not been observed, and it is believed that a terminal molt size might exist (NMFS, 2002b).      Jonah crab is a traditional by-catch of the Maine lobster fishery. Jonah crab landings  have traditionally been used by lobstermen as a supplement to cover operating expenses. However, due to a recent increase in crab abundance and market demand, it has become profitable for lobstermen to target Jonah crab with lobster traps/pots during times of low lobster landings (generally in the spring). This in turn has led to interest in targeting Jonah crabs year round.      The State of Maine Department of Marine Resources (DMR) applied for an Exempted Fishing Permit that would allow lobstermen to fish experimental Jonah crab traps/pots in addition to their allotment of lobster traps/pots. This request triggered a Section 7 consultation that found that the proposed exemption would result in jeopardy to right whales. As a result, the action and consulting agencies developed a Reasonable and Prudent Alternative (RPA) and in September 2003, DMR was granted a one-year Exempted Fishing Permit. This permit allowed 100 participating fishermen to fish their permitted allotment of lobster traps/pots (in state and/or Federal waters) plus 200 experimental Jonah crab traps/pots in Federal waters of Federal Lobster Management Area 1.16 Through this process, DMR hopes to demonstrate that the experimental Jonah crab trap/pot targets crabs, rather than lobster. If proven, DMR hopes to encourage NMFS and the ASMFC to revise the lobster regulations such that these modified traps/pots would not be considered lobster traps/pots and, consequently, would not be counted toward the fishermen's total allotment of traps/pots under the lobster regulations. The DMR expects that this study  could lead to further examination of the potential sustainability and practicality of a directed Jonah crab fishery in the area.17      Landings of Jonah crab in the Northeastern U.S. totaled 11.4 million pounds in 2011.18 Pots and traps were used to catch the 96 percent of Jonah crab landings during that year (see Exhibit 4-32).16 This permit was also granted for the previous fishing year.17 C. Wilson, pers. comm., 2003.           18 Data on Jonah crab landings may be inaccurate due to frequent misidentification at the docks as well as substantial cash transactions that are never documented.

4.2.12 Conch and Whelk19      The Atlantic Coast whelk fishery targets two principal species, the knobbed whelk (Busycon carica) and the channeled whelk (Busycon canaliculatum).20 Both species are found in temperate waters from Massachusetts to Florida. They range from seven to ten inches in length.      The commercial whelk pot fishery along the Atlantic coast runs from Massachusetts to the Carolinas. Whelk meat is sold for consumption in both the domestic and international (primarily Asian) markets; however, recent data suggest that the majority of whelk meat is used as bait in the horseshoe crab fishery.      Approximately 2.3 million pounds of whelk were landed in the Northeast U.S. in 2011. Whelk is primarily caught by potting or dredging, and these methods accounted for approximately 78 percent and 16 percent of the landings, respectively.  Exhibit 4-34 illustrates the distribution of landings by gear type.Exhibit 4-34CONCH/WHELK LANDINGS BY GEAR TYPE, 2011Gear TypeTotal Pounds LandedPercent of Total Pounds LandedPots and Traps1,773,80777.87%Dredge361,62715.87%Other56,7862.49%Trawls50,2082.20%Long lines19,3860.85%Gillnets7,7930.34%Rakes5,1220.22%Hand Line1,0160.04%Troll Line8880.04%By Hand6870.03%Other Nets3180.01%Tongs2710.01%Rakes650.00%TOTAL2,277,974100.00%Source: Dealer data provided by NMFS, Northeast Region, Fisheries Statistics Office.19 Information in this section is taken from U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2000.           20 The knobbed and channeled whelk caught along the Atlantic coast are commonly referred to as "conch" in industry transactions.

4.2.13 Other Affected Fisheries      The gear modifications required by the ALWTRP will affect all fisheries that use gillnets or traps/pots. The previous sections discuss fisheries that rely heavily on such gear and thus are most likely to be affected by changes in ALWTRP requirements. Other trap/pot fisheries that may be affected to a lesser extent by changes in ALWTRP regulations include the fisheries for Northern shrimp (Maine), blue crab, rock crab, catfish, tautog, cod, haddock, pollock, redfish, white hake, and American eel. Some of these trap/pot fisheries are small and primarily recreational (e.g., tautog). Others are commercially significant, but either make limited use of affected trap/pot gear (e.g., Northern shrimp, cod) or occur primarily in coastal or estuarine waters not covered by the ALWTRP (e.g., blue crab, American eel). As noted, Appendix 4-A provides a complete listing of the species landed using trap/pot gear.      Other potentially affected gillnet fisheries include Atlantic croaker, Atlantic mackerel, black drum, bluefish, bonito, herring, jack crevalle, menhaden, pompano, shad, skate, spot, striped bass, sturgeon, weakfish, white perch, Southern Kingfish (whiting), and yellow perch. Catch of these species by ALWTRP affected gear types is relatively small. However, to the extent that these species are caught with ALWTRP affected gear in ALWTRP regulated areas, and are part of a Category I or II fishery as designated by the List of Fisheries, fishermen may be affected by the ALWTRP.      The total ex-vessel revenue associated with ALWTRP gear used in all the affected fisheries is approximately $462 million.4.3 OTHER AFFECTED SPECIES      The ALWTRP may also benefit other protected species that inhabit the same waters as Atlantic large whales. Evidence suggests that some of these species can become entangled in fishing gear; therefore, this risk may be affected by changes in ALWTRP requirements. This section discusses the life cycle and abundance of each species and briefly reviews threats to each species’ survival, including interaction with commercial fishing gear. Chapter 5 provides more detailed information on the entanglement risk these species face, and the potential risk reduction offered by the regulatory alternatives under consideration.      The discussion below is divided into two categories: (1) species not likely to be affected by changes in ALWTRP requirements; and (2) species potentially affected by changes in ALWTRP requirements. Exhibit 4-36 summarizes the species of interest and their current status under the ESA or MMPA.

These species are discussed briefly below.
4.3.1.1 Atlantic Salmon      At one time, Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) distinct population segments (DPSs) probably existed in Long Island Sound and Central New England.21 Today, the only remaining U.S. Atlantic salmon DPS is in the Gulf of Maine. The Gulf of Maine DPS is comprised of all anadromous Atlantic salmon whose freshwater range occurs in watersheds from the Androscoggin northward to the Dennys (Fay et al., 2006). The Gulf of Maine (GOM) Distinct Population Segment (DPS) of anadromous Atlantic salmon was initially listed by the USFWS and NMFS (collectively, the Services) as an endangered species on November 17, 2000 (65 FR 69459). A subsequent listing as an endangered species by the Services (74 FR 29344; June 19, 2009) included an expanded range for the GOM DPS of Atlantic salmon.      Atlantic salmon spawn in fresh water in the early autumn. The fertilized eggs remain in gravel on the stream bottom until spring, when they hatch and small fish called “fry” emerge.  Fry quickly develop into “parr,” a two- to three-inch-long fish that remains in freshwater. In  New England rivers, it takes parr two to three years to grow large enough to develop into “smolts.” In the smolt stage (approximately six inches long), the young salmon migrate downstream to the ocean. Less is known about the animal’s saltwater life, but tagging studies have shown that young salmon migrate as far north as the Labrador Sea during their first summer in the ocean. After their first winter at sea, some of the salmon become sexually mature and return to their natal rivers to spawn. These are referred to as “one seawinter salmon” or “grilse,” and are much more common among Canadian stocks than among the salmon in Maine rivers. Salmon that remain at sea for a second winter to feed in the coastal waters of Canada and Greenland grow to approximately 30 inches in length and eight to 15 pounds. These salmon can return from the ocean anytime from spring through fall, but the peak “run” is in June. Spawning takes place from late October through November. Some salmon return to sea immediately after spawning, but most (80 percent) spend the winter in the stream and migrate back to the ocean in the spring.      Historically, two seawinter fish were caught in commercial gillnet fisheries off Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, Labrador, and West Greenland. These fisheries have  recently been closed or vastly reduced to protect the remaining stocks. There has also been recreational fishing for salmon in rivers and estuaries as they return to spawn. In recent years, this activity was limited to catch-and-release fishing; in 2000, recreational fishing was closed altogether (except for an angling fishery on stocked fish farther south in the Merrimack River) (NMFS and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2000).      Adult returns to the GOM DPS have been very low for many years and remain extremely low in terms of adult abundance in the wild. Further, the majority of all adults in the GOM DPS return to a single river, the Penobscot, which accounted for 91 percent of all adult returns to the GOM DPS in 2007. Of the 1044 adult returns to the Penobscot in 2006, 996 of these were the result of smolt stocking and only the remaining 48 were naturally-reared. A total of 916 and           21 The ESA extends protection to a distinct population segment (DPS) in part to preserve genetic diversity important to the species’ survival. A DPS is a population segment that is: (1) “discrete” (to some extent separated from the remainder of the species or subspecies), and (2) “significant” (biologically and ecologically).
2,117 adult salmon returned to the Penobscot River in 2007 and 2008, respectively. Most of these returns were also of hatchery origin (USASAC 2008). The term naturally-reared includes fish originating from natural spawning and from hatchery fry (USASAC 2008). Hatchery fry are included as naturally-reared because hatchery fry are not marked; therefore, they cannot be distinguished from fish produced through natural spawning. Because of the extensive amount of fry stocking that takes place in an effort to recover the GOM DPS, it is possible that a substantial number of fish counted as naturally-reared were actually stocked as fry. The abundance of Atlantic salmon in the GOM DPS has been low and either stable or declining over the past several decades. The proportion of fish that are of natural origin is very small (approximately 10%) and is continuing to decline. The conservation hatchery program has assisted in slowing the decline and helping to stabilize populations at low levels, but has not contributed to an increase in the overall abundance of salmon and has not been able to halt the decline of the naturally-reared component of the GOM DPS. No harvest of Atlantic salmon is allowed in the EEZ under the New England Fishery Management Council’s Atlantic Salmon FMP (64 FR 40521).      No data exist to demonstrate that Atlantic salmon interact with ALWTRP regulated gear. Any ALWTRP changes to numbers of vertical lines, gear configuration and/or marking will likely have no impact on the survival of Atlantic salmon in the Gulf of Maine.4.3.1.2 Shortnose Sturgeon      The sturgeon family is among the most primitive of the bony fishes. The shortnose sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum) shares the same general external morphology of all sturgeon. Its elongated fusiform body is moderately depressed and the body surface contains five rows of bony plates or scutes. Its subterminal mouth has barbels and is well suited for bottom feeding (mollusks and crustaceans are the primary food of adults) and a generally benthic existence.      The shortnose sturgeon is an anadromous fish that spawns in the coastal rivers along the east coast of North America from the St. John River in Canada to the St. Johns River in Florida. It prefers the nearshore marine, estuarine, and riverine habitat of large river systems. Unlike other anadromous species in the region such as shad or salmon, shortnose sturgeon do not appear to frequently make long-distance offshore migrations. Hence, the impact of the ALWTRP on the species is likely to be minor.22      Male and female shortnose sturgeons mature at the same length (45 to 55 cm fork length) throughout their range. However, age of maturation varies from north to south due to a slower growth rate in the north. Males may mature at two to three years of age in Georgia, at age three to five from South Carolina to New York, and at age 10 to 11 in the St. John River, Canada. Females exhibit a similar trend and mature at age six or younger in Georgia, at age six to seven from South Carolina to New York, and at age 13 in the St. John River. Age of first spawning in males occurs one to two years after maturity, but among females is delayed for up to five years. Generally, females spawn every three years, although males may spawn every year.           22 Unless otherwise indicated, the information provided in this section is based on material provided at the NMFS Protected Resources website: http://www.nero.noaa.gov/prot_res/sturgeon/.
      While the shortnose sturgeon was rarely the target of a commercial fishery, it often was taken incidentally in the commercial fishery for Atlantic sturgeon. In the 1950s, sturgeon fisheries declined on the east coast and systematic data on shortnose sturgeon landings became scarce. This led the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) to conclude that the fish had been eliminated from the rivers in its historic range (except the Hudson River) and was in danger of extinction. FWS believed the population level of the shortnose sturgeon had declined because of pollution and overfishing, both directly and incidentally in shad gillnets.      The shortnose sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum) was listed as endangered in its entire range on March 11, 1967 (32 FR 4001). Shortnose sturgeon remained on the endangered species list with enactment of the ESA in 1973. Populations occur in New Brunswick, Canada (1),  Maine (2), Massachusetts (1), Connecticut (1), New York (1), New Jersey/Delaware (1),Maryland/Virginia (1), North Carolina (1), South Carolina (4), Georgia (4) and Florida (2).      No data exist to demonstrate that shortnose sturgeon interact with ALWTRP regulated gear; therefore, trap/pot and gillnet gear managed under the ALWTRP pose little or no threat to this species.4.3.1.3 Roseate Tern and Piping Plover      The roseate tern (Sterna dougallii dougallii) and piping plover (Charadrius melodus) inhabit coastal waters and nest on coastal beaches within the Northeast Region. Terns prey on small schooling fishes, while plovers prey on shoreline invertebrates and other small fauna. Foraging activity for these species occurs either along the shoreline (plovers) or within the top several meters of the water column (terns). Trap/pot and gillnet gear managed under the ALWTRP are expected to pose little or no threat to these species or their forage species.4.3.2 Species Potentially Affected      A variety of endangered, threatened, or protected species would potentially be affected by changes in ALWTRP requirements. The sections below examine protected whale, porpoise, dolphin, seal, fish and turtle species whose survival may be affected by interactions with commercial fishing gear.4.3.2.1 WhalesBlue Whale      Like the fin whale, blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) occur worldwide and are believed to follow a similar migration pattern from northern summering grounds to more southern wintering areas (Perry et al., 1999). Three subspecies have been identified: Balaenoptera musculus musculus, B.m. intermedia, and B.m. brevicauda (NMFS, 1998b).   OnlyB.m. musculus occurs in the northern hemisphere.  Blue whales range in the North Atlantic from
the subtropics to Baffin Bay and the Greenland Sea. The IWC currently recognizes these whales as one stock (Perry et al., 1999).      Blue whales were hunted intensively from the turn of the century, when development of steam-powered vessels and deck-mounted harpoon guns made it possible to exploit them on an industrial scale, to the mid-1960s (NMFS, 1998b). Blue whale populations declined worldwide as the new technology spread and became widely used (Perry et al., 1999). Subsequently, the whaling industry shifted effort away from declining blue whale stocks and targeted other large species, such as fin whales, and then resumed hunting for blue whales when the species seemed to be more abundant (Perry et al., 1999). The result was a cyclical rise and fall, leading to severe depletion of blue whale stocks worldwide (Perry et al., 1999). In all, at least 11,000 blue whales were taken in the North Atlantic from the late 19th century through the mid-20th century. Blue whales were given complete protection in the North Atlantic in 1955 under the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling. There are no good estimates of the pre-exploitation size of the western North Atlantic blue whale stock, but it is widely believed that this stock was severely depleted by the time legal protection was introduced in 1955 (Perry et al., 1999). Mitchell (1974) suggested that the stock numbered in the very low hundreds during the late 1960s through early 1970s (Perry et al., 1999). Photo-identification studies of blue whales in the Gulf of St. Lawrence from 1979 to 1995 identified 320 individual whales (NMFS, 1998b). NMFS recognizes a minimum population estimate of 308 blue whales within the Northeast Region (Waring et al., 2002).      Blue whales are only occasional visitors to east coast U.S. waters. They are more commonly found in Canadian waters, particularly the Gulf of St. Lawrence, where they are present for most of the year, and in other areas of the North Atlantic. It is assumed that blue whale distribution is governed largely by food requirements (NMFS, 1998b). In the Gulf of St. Lawrence, blue whales seem to predominantly feed on a variety of copepod species (NMFS, 1998b).      Compared to the other species of large whales, relatively little is known about this species. Sexual maturity is believed to occur in both sexes between five and 15 years of age. Gestation lasts ten to 12 months and calves nurse for six to seven months. The average calving interval is estimated to be two to three years. Birth and mating both take place in the winter season (NMFS, 1998b), but the location of wintering areas is speculative (Perry et al., 1999). In 1992, the U.S. Navy and contractors conducted an extensive blue whale acoustic survey of the North Atlantic and found concentrations of blue whales on the Grand Banks and west of the British Isles. One whale was tracked for 43 days, during which it traveled 1,400 nautical miles around the general area of Bermuda (Perry et al., 1999).      There is limited information on the factors affecting natural mortality of blue whales in the North Atlantic. Ice entrapment is known to kill and seriously injure some blue whales during late winter and early spring, particularly along the southwest coast of Newfoundland. Habitat degradation has been suggested as possibly affecting blue whales in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, where habitat has been degraded by acoustic and chemical pollution. However, there are no data to confirm that blue whales have been affected by such habitat changes (Perry et al., 1999).
      Ship strikes and entanglements in commercial fishing gear are believed to be the major sources of anthropogenic mortality and injury of blue whales. However, confirmed deaths or serious injuries are few. In 1987, concurrent with an unusual influx of blue whales into the Gulf of Maine, one report was received from a whale watch boat that spotted a blue whale in the southern Gulf of Maine entangled in gear described as probable lobster pot gear. A second animal found in the Gulf of St. Lawrence apparently died from the effects of an entanglement.   In March 1998, a juvenile male blue whale was carried into Rhode Island waters on the bow of a tanker. The cause of death was determined to be due to a ship strike that may have occurred outside the U.S. EEZ (Waring et al., 2002).Sei Whale      The range of sei whales (Balaenoptera borealis) extends from subpolar to subtropical and even tropical marine waters; however, the species is most commonly found in temperate waters (Perry et al., 1999). Based on past whaling operations, the IWC recognized three stocks in the North Atlantic: (1) Nova Scotia; (2) Iceland-Denmark Strait; and (3) Northeast Atlantic (Donovan, 1991 in Perry et al., 1999). Mitchell and Chapman (1977) suggested that the sei  whale population in the western North Atlantic consists of two stocks, a Nova Scotian Shelf stock and a Labrador Sea stock. The Nova Scotian Shelf stock includes the continental shelf waters of the Northeast Region, and extends northeastward to south of Newfoundland. The IWC boundaries for this stock are from the U.S. east coast to Cape Breton, Nova Scotia and east to 42°00’W longitude (Waring et al., 2003). This is the only sei whale stock within ALWTRP boundaries.      Sei whales became the target of modern commercial whalers in the late 19th and early 20th century after stocks of other whales, including right, humpback, fin, and blues, had already been depleted. Sei whales were taken in large numbers by Norway and Scotland from the beginning of modern whaling (NMFS, 1998a). Small numbers were also taken off of Spain, Portugal, and West Greenland from the 1920s to 1950s (Perry et al., 1999). In the western North Atlantic, a total of 825 sei whales were taken on the Scotian Shelf between 1966 and 1972, and an additional 16 were taken by a shore-based Newfoundland whaling station (Perry et al., 1999). The species continued to be exploited in Iceland until 1986 even though measures to stop whaling of sei whales in other areas had been put into place in the 1970s (Perry et al., 1999). There is no estimate for the abundance of sei whales prior to commercial whaling. Based on whaling records, approximately 14,295 sei whales were taken in the entire North Atlantic from 1885 to 1984 (Perry et al., 1999).      Sei whales winter in warm temperate or subtropical waters and summer in more northern latitudes. In the North Atlantic, most births occur in November and December, when the whales are on their wintering grounds. Conception is believed to occur in December and January. Gestation lasts for 12 months, and calves are weaned at between six and nine months, when the whales are on the summer feeding grounds (NMFS, 1998a). Sei whales reach sexual maturity between five and 15 years of age. The calving interval is believed to be two to three years (Perry et al., 1999).
      Sei whales occur in deep water throughout their range, typically over the continental slope or in basins situated between banks (NMFS, 1998a). In the northwest Atlantic, the whales travel along the eastern Canadian coast in autumn on their way to the Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank, where they occur in winter and spring. Within the Northeast Region, the sei whale is most common on Georges Bank, including the Great South Channel, and into the Gulf of Maine/Bay of Fundy region during spring and summer. Individuals may range as far south as North Carolina. It is important to note that sei whales are known for inhabiting an area for weeks at a time, then disappearing for years or even decades. This has been observed in many areas, including in the southwestern Gulf of Maine in 1986, but the basis for this phenomenon is not clear.      Although sei whales may prey upon small schooling fish and squid in the Northeast Region, available information suggests that calanoid copepods are the primary prey of this species. There are occasional influxes of sei whales farther into Gulf of Maine waters, presumably in conjunction with years of high copepod abundance inshore. Sei whales are occasionally seen feeding in association with right whales in the southern Gulf of Maine and in the Bay of Fundy, although there is no evidence of interspecific competition for food resources. There is very little information on natural mortality factors for sei whales. Possible causes of natural mortality, particularly for young, old, or otherwise compromised individuals, are shark attacks, killer whale attacks, and endoparasitic helminthes (Perry et al., 1999).      There are insufficient data to determine trends of the sei whale population. The total number of sei whales in the U.S. Atlantic EEZ is unknown. However, five abundance estimates are available for portions of the sei whale habitat: from Nova Scotia during the 1970s, in the U.S. Atlantic EEZ during the springs of 1979-1981, and in the U.S. and Canadian Atlantic EEZ during the summers of 2002, 2004, and 2006. The August 2004 abundance estimate (386) is considered the best available for the Nova Scotia stock of sei whales. The minimum population estimate is 208 (Waring et al., 2012).      Few instances of injury or mortality of sei whales due to entanglement or vessel strikes have been recorded in U.S. waters. For the period 2005 through 2009, the minimum annual rate of human-caused mortality and serious injury to sei whales was 1.02. This value includes incidental fishery interaction records, 0.6, and records of vessel collisions, 0.6 (Henry et al.2011). Annual rates calculated from detected mortalities should not be considered an unbiased representation estimate of human-caused mortality. Detections are haphazard, incomplete and not the result of a designed sampling scheme. As such, they represent a minimum estimate of human-caused mortality which is almost certainly biased low (Waring et al., 2012).Sperm Whale      Sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) inhabit all ocean basins, from equatorial waters to the polar regions (Perry et al., 1999). In the western North Atlantic they range from  Greenland to the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean. The sperm whales that occur in the western North Atlantic are believed to represent only a portion of the total stock (Blaylock et al., 1995). Total numbers of sperm whales off the U.S. or Canadian Atlantic coast are unknown, although eight estimates from selected regions of the habitat do exist for select time periods. The best
recent abundance estimate for sperm whales is the sum of the estimates from the two 2004 U.S. Atlantic surveys, 4,804 (CV=0.38), where the estimate from the northern U.S. Atlantic is 2,607 (CV=0.57), and from the southern U.S. Atlantic is 2,197 (CV=0.47). This joint estimate is considered best because together these two surveys have the most complete coverage of the species’ habitat (Waring et al., 2007). The IWC recognizes one stock for the entire North Atlantic (Waring et al., 2002).      The IWC estimates that nearly a quarter-million sperm whales were killed worldwide in whaling activities between 1800 and 1900 (IWC, 1971). With the advent of modern whaling the larger rorqual whales were targeted; however, as their numbers decreased, whaling pressure again focused on smaller rorquals and sperm whales. From 1910 to 1982, there were nearly 700,000 sperm whales killed worldwide from whaling activities (Clarke, 1954; Committee for Whaling Statistics, 1959-1983). Some sperm whales were also taken off the U.S. Mid-Atlantic coast (Reeves and Mitchell, 1988; Perry et al., 1999) and in the northern Gulf of Mexico (Perry et al., 1999). Recorded North Atlantic sperm whale catch numbers for Canada and Norway from 1904 to 1972 total 1,995. All killing of sperm whales was banned by the IWC in 1988.      Sperm whales generally occur in waters greater than 180 meters in depth, with a preference for continental margins, seamounts, and areas of upwelling, where food is abundant (Leatherwood and Reeves, 1983). Sperm whales in both hemispheres migrate to higher latitudes in the summer to feed, and return to lower latitudes in the winter, where mating and calving occur. Mature males typically range to greater latitudes than mature females and immature animals, but return to the lesser latitudes in the winter to breed (Perry et al., 1999). Waring et al. (1993) suggest sperm whale distribution is closely correlated with the Gulf Stream edge, with a migration to higher latitudes during summer months resulting in concentrations of whales east and northeast of Cape Hatteras. This distribution extends farther northward to areas north of Georges Bank and the Northeast Channel region in summer, then shifts south of New England in fall, back to the Mid-Atlantic Bight (Waring et al., 2002).      Mature females in the northern hemisphere ovulate from April through August. A single calf is born after a 15-month gestation. A mature female will produce a calf every four to six years. Females attain sexual maturity at a mean age of nine years, while males have a prolonged puberty and attain sexual maturity at a mean age of 19 years (Waring et al., 2002). Male sperm whales may not reach physical maturity until they are 45 years old (Waring et al., 2002). The sperm whale's prey consists of larger mid-water squid and fish species (Perry et al., 1999).  Sperm whales, especially mature males in greater latitudinal waters, have been observed to take significant quantities of large demersal and deep water sharks, multispecies, and bony fishes.      Few instances of injury or mortality of sperm whales due to human impacts have been recorded in U.S. waters. Between August 1993 and May 1998, three sperm whale entanglements were documented, one each in longline gear (dead floating whale), fine mesh gillnet (disentangled), and net gear (status unknown). The NEFSC bycatch database contains two records of sperm whale entanglement, both involving injured whales that were released from pelagic drift gillnet gear (Waring et al., 2002). No mortalities or serious injuries have been directly observed in the pelagic longline, pelagic pair trawl, Northeast multispecies sink gillnet,
Mid-Atlantic coastal gillnet, or North Atlantic bottom trawl fisheries (Waring et al., 2002).23 During 2001-2005, human caused mortality was 0.2 sperm whales per year (CV=unknown). This is derived from two components: 0 sperm whales per year (CV=unknown) from U.S. fisheries using observer data and 0.2 sperm whales per year from ship strikes (Waring et al., 2007). Ships can also strike sperm whales, but due to the offshore distribution of this species, interactions (both ship strikes and entanglements) that do occur are less likely to be reported than those involving right, humpback, and fin whales, which are more often found in nearshore areas.  Other impacts noted above for baleen whales may also occur.      As a result of their offshore distribution, sperm whales tend to strand less often than, for example, right and humpback whales. Preliminary data for 2000 indicate that out of ten sperm whales reported to the stranding network (nine dead and one injured), there was one possible fishery interaction, one ship strike (wounded with bleeding gash on side), and eight animals for which no signs of entanglement or injury were sighted or reported.      It has been suggested that another potential human-caused source of mortality for sperm whales may be the accumulation of stable pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), chlorinated pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and heavy metals. Though not conclusively caused by contaminant burden, tissue samples from 21 sperm whales that mass stranded in the North Sea in 1994/95 showed cadmium levels twice as high as those found in North Pacific sperm whales, possibly affecting the stranded animals’ health and behavior (Holsbeek, et al. 1999).4.3.2.2 Harbor Porpoise      The harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) is found in temperate and subpolar waters in the Northern Hemisphere.  The species frequents nearshore waters such as bays and estuaries, but also travels in deeper offshore waters. The Gulf of Maine/Bay of Fundy stock includes all harbor porpoise found in the waters of eastern North America south of (and including) Nova Scotia and the Bay of Fundy. To estimate the population size of harbor porpoises in the Gulf of Maine/Bay of Fundy region, eight line transect sighting surveys were conducted during the summers of 1991, 1992, 1995, 1999, 2002, 2004, 2006, and 2007. The best current abundance estimate of the Gulf of Maine/Bay of Fundy harbor porpoise stock is 79,883 (Waring et al 2013).      Harbor porpoise prey on small schooling fish, including some fish that are sought by gillnet fishermen. As a result, harbor porpoise can become entangled in gillnets and drown. Gillnets typically used in Northeast and Mid-Atlantic U.S. waters to catch groundfish, such as cod and flounder, have been one source of harbor porpoise mortality and serious injury.24 In 1993, NMFS proposed to list the Gulf of Maine/Bay of Fundy stock of harbor porpoise under the ESA as threatened. At the time of the proposal, the listing was considered necessary based on analyses of the porpoise bycatch rate in commercial gillnet fisheries.           23 It is important to note that the pelagic drift gillnet fishery no longer exists; therefore, this type of gear no longer poses an entanglement threat to this species.           24 In addition to incidental takes in U.S. waters, the harbor porpoise is also vulnerable to takes in the Canadian Bay of Fundy groundfish sink gillnet and herring weir fisheries.
      Following this proposal, NMFS solicited public comment and scientific review to assess questions on the sufficiency and accuracy of bycatch data used in making the "threatened" determination. Average annual estimated harbor porpoise mortality and serious injury in the Northeast sink gillnet fishery from 1994 to 1998 was 1,163. A Take Reduction Team was  formed in 1996 to address incidental take of harbor porpoise in the Northeast groundfish sink gillnet and Mid-Atlantic coastal gillnet fisheries. Regulations (63 FR 66464) implementing the Harbor Porpoise Take Reduction Plan (HPTRP) to reduce harbor porpoise bycatch in U.S. Atlantic gillnets were published on December 1, 1998 and became effective January 1, 1999 (63 FR 66464). The Gulf of Maine portion of the HPTRP pertains to all fishing with sink gillnets  and other gillnets capable of catching multispecies in New England waters, from Maine through Rhode Island, and includes time and area closures, some of which are complete closures. Other fisheries are closed to multispecies gillnet fishing unless pingers (sound-making devices) are used in the prescribed manner. The Mid-Atlantic portion of the HPTRP pertains to the Mid- Atlantic shore line from New York to North Carolina, and also includes time and area closures.      The total annual estimated average human-caused mortality is 927 harbor porpoises per year. This is derived from two components: 883 harbor porpoise per year from U.S. fisheries using observer and MMAP data, and 44 per year (unknown CV) from Canadian fisheries using observer data (Waring et al., 2012). Average estimated harbor porpoise mortality and serious injury in the Northeast sink gillnet fishery during 1994-1998, before the Take Reduction Plan, was 1,163 (0.11). The average annual harbor porpoise mortality and serious injury in the Northeast sink gillnet fishery from 2005 to 2009 was 559 (0.16) (Waring et al., 2012). Annual average estimated harbor porpoise mortality and serious injury from the Mid-Atlantic gillnet fishery during 1995 to 1998, before the Take Reduction Plan, was 358 (CV=0.20). The average annual harbor porpoise mortality and serious injury in the Mid-Atlantic gillnet fishery from 2005 to 2009 was 318 (0.26)(Waring et al., 2012). Annual average estimated harbor porpoise mortality and serious injury from the northeast bottom trawl fishery from 2005 to 2009 was 6.0 (0.22)(Waring et al., 2012).A ruling to reduce harbor porpoise bycatch in U.S. Atlantic gillnets was published in the Federal Register (63 FR 66464) on December 2, 1998, and became effective January 1, 1999. The Gulf of Maine portion of the Harbor Porpoise Take Reduction Plan (HPTRP) pertains to all fishing with sink gillnets and other gillnets capable of catching regulated groundfish in New England waters, from Maine through Rhode Island. This portion of the rule includes time and area closures, some of which are complete closures; others are closed to gillnet fishing unless pingers are used in the prescribed manner. Also, the rule requires those who intend to fish to attend training and certification sessions on the use of the technology. The Mid-Atlantic portion of the plan pertains to waters west of 72º30'W longitude to the Mid-Atlantic shoreline from New York to North Carolina. This portion of the rule includes time and area closures, some of which are complete closures; others are closed to gillnet fishing unless the gear meets certain restrictions. The MMPA mandates that the take reduction teams that developed the above take reduction measures periodically meet to evaluate the effectiveness of the plan and modify it as necessary. The Harbor Porpoise Take Reduction Team was reconvened in December 2007 to discuss updated harbor porpoise abundance and bycatch information. The Team recommended modifications to the plan to further reduce harbor porpoise bycatch in commercial fisheries. As a result, the HPTRP was amended on February 19, 2010 (75 FR 7383), to expand management
areas and seasons in which pingers are required, as well as to increase efforts to monitor and enforce the plan. In addition, the New England portion of the HPTRP included consequence closure areas as a management measure strategy. These areas with historically high bycatch rates will close seasonally only if bycatch rates over two consecutive management seasons exceed a specified bycatch rate. This management strategy is intended to reduce harbor porpoise bycatch and to increase compliance with HPTRP regulations. Once triggered, these areas would remain in effect until bycatch levels achieve zero mortality rate goal (ZMRG) or until new management measures are implemented in these areas (Waring et al., 2012). On October 4, 2013 NMFS published a final rule (78 FR 61821) removing the consequence closure strategy from the HPTRP. This action was necessary to prevent the improper triggering of consequence closure areas based on target harbor porpoise bycatch rates that no longer accurately reflect actual bycatch in New England sink gillnets due to fisherywide changes in fishing practices. NMFS will continue working the the Team to consider what additional management measures may be necessary to ensure compliance with the pinger requirements.4.3.2.3 Dolphins      Pilot whales, and bottlenose, Atlantic white-sided, Risso’s, striped, spotted, and common dolphins are protected dolphin species under the MMPA. This section provides further information on the range, abundance, and average annual fishery-related mortality associated with specific stocks of these species that are potentially affected by the ALWTRP.Western North Atlantic Coastal Bottlenose Dolphin      Initially, a single stock of coastal morphotype bottlenose dolphins was thought to migrate seasonally between New Jersey (summer months) and central Florida based on seasonal patterns in strandings during a large scale mortality event occurring during 1987-1988 (Scott et al. 1988). However, re-analysis of stranding data (McLellan et al. 2003) and extensive analysis of genetic (Rosel et al. 2009), photo-ID (Zolman 2002), and satellite telemetry (Southeast Fisheries Science Center, unpublished data) data demonstrate a complex mosaic of coastal bottlenose dolphin stocks. Integrated analysis of these multiple lines of evidence suggests that there are five coastal stocks of bottlenose dolphins: the Northern Migratory and Southern Migratory stocks, a South Carolina/Georgia Coastal stock, a Northern Florida Coastal stock and a Central Florida Coastal stock (Waring et al., 2011).      One of the first abundance estimates for WNA coastal bottlenose dolphins was conducted in 1995. This 1995 abundance estimate was based upon results from the analyses of a combination of surveys. A new aerial survey to estimate abundance of WNA coastal bottlenose dolphins was conducted in 2002. The resulting estimates are summarized in Exhibit 4-37.      Bottlenose dolphins are known to interact with commercial fisheries and occasionally are taken in various kinds of fishing gear, including gillnets, seines, longlines, shrimp trawls, and crab traps/pots (Waring et al., 2002). Interactions are especially common in near-shore areas where dolphin densities and fishery efforts are greatest. The coastal bottlenose stocks  are  known to interact with the following commercial fisheries, according to the 2013 MMPA List of
Fisheries (LOF): the Mid-Atlantic gillnet, North Carolina inshore gillnet, Southeast Atlantic gillnet, Southeast Atlantic U.S. shark gillnet, Southeast Atlantic Gulf of Mexico shrimp trawl, Southeast U.S. Atlantic Gulf of Mexico stone crab trap/pot, Atlantic blue crab trap/pot, Mid- Atlantic menhaden purse seine, Mid-Atlantic haul/beach seine, and Virginia pound net.Exhibit 4-37ABUNDANCE ESTIMATES FOR THE WESTERN NORTH ATLANTIC COASTAL BOTTLENOSE DOLPHIN BY MANAGEMENT UNITUnit  Best EstimateCoefficient of VarianceMinimum EstimateNorthern Migratory9,6040.367,147Central FloridaCoastal6,3180.265,094Northern Florida Coastal3,0640.242,511South Carolina-Georgia Coastal7,7380.236,399Atlantic Southern MigratoryCoastal12,4820.329,591Source: Waring et al., 2010.      Of the fisheries listed previously, the Mid-Atlantic coastal gillnet, Southeast Atlantic gillnet, Atlantic coastal blue crab trap/pot, and Southeastern U.S. Atlantic shark gillnet fisheries may be affected by potential revisions to the ALWTRP. The Mid-Atlantic coastal gillnet fishery accounts for the highest documented level of mortality or serious injury of coastal morphotype bottlenose dolphins.      In addition to interactions with gillnets, interactions with trap/pot gear may threaten bottlenose dolphins. Southeast Regional Marine Mammal Stranding Network data from 2004 through 2008 include 13 reports of interactions between bottlenose dolphins and confirmed blue crab pot gear with the majority of these occurring in waters from Florida to South Carolina. In addition, there were 4 interactions documented with pot gear where the fishery could not be confirmed. In these cases, the gear was confirmed to be associated with a pot or trap, but may have been from a fishery other than blue crab (e.g., whelk fisheries in Virginia) (Waring et al., 2010).      From 1995 to 2001, NMFS recognized only a single migratory stock of coastal bottlenose dolphins in the WNA, and the entire stock was listed as depleted. This stock structure was revised in 2002 to recognize both multiple stocks and seasonal management units and again in 2008 and 2009 to recognize resident estuarine stocks and migratory and resident coastal stocks. The total U.S. fishery-related mortality and serious injury for the Northern Migratory stock cannot be directly estimated because of the spatial overlap among the stocks of bottlenose dolphins that occupy waters of North Carolina. In addition, several fisheries are unobserved, and the reported mortalities are minimum estimates. The total mortality is therefore unlikely to be less than 10% of the calculated PBR, and thus cannot be considered to be insignificant and
approaching zero mortality and serious injury rate. This stock retains the depleted designation as a result of its origins from the coastal migratory stock. The species is not listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act, but these are strategic stocks due to the depleted listing under the MMPA (Waring et al., 2010). The PBR levels and estimated 2004-2008 fisheries-related mortality for the five stocks are summarized in Exhibit 4-38.Exhibit 4-38ESTIMATED AVERAGE ANNUAL FISHERY MORTALITY (2004-2008) AND CURRENT PBR ESTIMATES FOR WESTERN NORTH ATLANTIC COASTAL BOTTLENOSE DOLPHINSStockEstimated MortalityCurrent PBR EstimatesNorthern Migratory6-871Central Florida Coastal1Unknown51Northern Florida Coastal1Unknown25South Carolina-Georgia Coastal1Unknown64Southern Migratory Coastal24-5596Notes:1.	Three category II fisheries have the potential to interact with this stock, and observer coverage of these fisheries is limited.Sources: Waring et al., 2010.      Other anthropogenic sources of mortality for bottlenose dolphins include pollution and habitat degradation. The nearshore habitat occupied by bottlenose dolphins is adjacent to human populations and, in the northern portion of its range, is highly industrialized. The blubber of stranded dolphins examined during a 1987-88 multiple mortality event along the Atlantic coast contained anthropogenic contaminants in levels among the highest ever recorded (Geraci, 1989).On October 24, 2001, NMFS announced the creation of a Bottlenose Dolphin Take Reduction Team (BDTRT) and its first meeting (66 FR 53782). The BDTRT met five times before delivering consensus recommendations to NMFS on May 7, 2002.  Additionally, the BDTRT met in April 2003 to review updated bottlenose dolphin abundance information and to augment original recommendations that failed to meet the statutory requirements of the MMPA. NMFS issued a final rule to implement the Bottlenose Dolphin Take Reduction Plan (BDTRP) on April 26, 2006 (71 FR 24776). The management measures implemented under the BDTRP are designed to address incidental mortality and serious injury of bottlenose dolphins in the Mid- Atlantic gillnet fishery and eight other coastal fisheries operating within the dolphin's distributional range. The BDTRP contains both regulatory and non-regulatory management measures to reduce serious injury and mortality of the Western North Atlantic coastal bottlenose dolphin stock (dolphin) (Tursiops truncatus), a strategic stock, in nine Category I and II commercial fisheries operating within the dolphin’s distributional range. The Western North Atlantic coastal bottlenose dolphin stock is split into seven spatial and temporal management units because of its biological complexity, and management measures in the BDTRP are applied by management unit. Both the regulatory and non-regulatory management measures are designed to meet the BDTRP’s short-term goal and provide a framework for meeting the long-term goal.
The regulatory management measures in the BDTRP include seasonal gillnet restrictions, gear proximity requirements, and gear length restrictions. The nighttime medium mesh (greater than 5–inch (12.7 cm) to less than 7–inch (17.8 cm) stretch) gillnet fishing prohibition in North Carolina state waters from November 1 through April 30, annually, was set to expire on May 26, 2009. This was extended an additional three years by a final rule issued December 19, 2008 (73 FR 77531). NMFS published a final rule on July 31, 2012 to permanently continue nighttime fishing restrictions of medium mesh gillnets operating in North Carolina coastal state waters from November 1 through April 30. NMFS also amended the BDTRP with updates, including updates recommended by the Team for non-regulatory conservation measures.Atlantic White-Sided Dolphin      Atlantic white-sided dolphins (Lagenorhynchus acutus) are found in temperate and sub- polar waters of the North Atlantic, primarily on continental shelf waters out to the 100-meter depth contour. The species is distributed from central western Greenland to North Carolina, and possibly as far east as 43°00’ W. There are possibly three stock units of this species: a Gulf of Maine stock, a Gulf of St. Lawrence stock, and a Labrador Sea stock (Palka et al., 1997). The Gulf of Maine stock is commonly found in continental shelf waters from Hudson Canyon to Georges Bank and into the Gulf of Maine to the Bay of Fundy. The best estimate of abundance for the western North Atlantic stock of Atlantic white-sided dolphin stock is 23,390, and the minimum estimate is 19,019 (Waring et al., 2012). The PBR for this stock is approximately 190 (Waring et al., 2012).      Atlantic white-sided dolphins have become entangled in Northeast sink gillnet, Mid- Atlantic coastal gillnet, pelagic drift gillnet, North Atlantic bottom trawl, and Atlantic squid, mackerel, and butterfish trawl fisheries. Total annual estimated average fishery-related mortality or serious injury to this stock during 2005-2009 was 245 (CV=0.12) white-sided dolphins (Waring et al., 2012). Approximately 36 of these mortalities are attributable to the Northeast sink gillnet fishery, 160 are attributed to the Northeast bottom trawl fishery; 1.9 to the Northeast mid water trawl fishery; 24 to the Mid-Atlantic mid water trawl fishery; and 23 to the Mid- Atlantic bottom trawl fishery (Waring et al., 2012).	The Northeast sink gillnet fishery is currently regulated under the ALWTRP.Risso’s Dolphin      The Risso’s dolphin (Grampus griseus) is found worldwide in tropical and temperate waters. The western North Atlantic stock occurs along the continental shelf from Cape Hatteras to Georges Bank. The best abundance estimate for Risso’s dolphins is the sum of the estimates from the two 2004 U.S. Atlantic surveys, 20,479 (CV=0.59), where the estimate from the northern U.S. Atlantic is 15,053 (CV=0.78), and from the southern U.S. Atlantic is 5,426 (CV=0.54). This joint estimate is considered best because these two surveys together have the most complete coverage of the population’s habitat (Waring et al., 2012). The minimum estimate is 12,920 (Waring et al., 2012). Based on these data, the PBR for the western North Atlantic stock of Risso’s dolphins is approximately 124 dolphins per year.
      The total annual estimated average fishery-related mortality or serious injury to this stock during 2005-2009 was 18 Risso’s dolphins (CV=0.37). The annual average combined mortality and serious injury for 2005- 2009 by fishery is as follows: 8 in the pelagic longline fishery; 3 in the Northeast sink gillnet fishery; and 7 in the Mid-Atlantic gillnet fishery (Waring et al., 2012). The Northeast sink gillnet fishery is currently regulated under the ALWTRP.Pelagic Delphinids (Spotted Dolphin, Striped Dolphin, Pilot Whale, Offshore Bottlenose Dolphin, Common Dolphin)      The pelagic delphinid complex is made up of small odontocete species that are broadly distributed along the continental shelf edge where depths range from 200 - 400 meters. These species include the western North Atlantic stock of spotted dolphins, western North Atlantic stock of striped dolphins, western North Atlantic stock of pilot whales, the western North Atlantic offshore stock of bottlenose dolphins, and the western North Atlantic stock of common dolphins.Spotted Dolphin      The Atlantic spotted dolphin, Stenella frontalis, is distributed from southern New England south through the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean to Venezuela (Waring et al., 2013). These dolphins are commonly found in large groups that feed on schools of fish. Spotted dolphins are known to feed on a variety of prey, including small-to-large epipelagic and mesopelagic fishes and squids, and benthic invertebrates (Perrin et al., 2002).      An abundance estimate of 26,798 (CV=0.66) Atlantic spotted dolphins was generated from a shipboard and aerial survey conducted during June–August 2011. The minimum population estimate based on the 2011 abundance estimate for the Atlantic spotted dolphin stock is 16,151 (Waring et al. 2013). Based on these data, the PBR for the Western North Atlantic stock of spotted dolphin is 162 (Waring et al., 2013).Total annual estimated average fishery- related mortality or serious injury to this stock during 2006-2010 was 0.2 (Waring et al., 2013).Striped DolphinStriped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba) are found in the western North Atlantic from Nova Scotia south to at least Jamaica, in the Gulf of Mexico, and in general prefer continental slope waters offshore to the Gulf Stream (Waring et al., 2000). These dolphins, like spotted dolphins, are commonly found in large groups that feed on schools of fish. Striped dolphins feed on a variety of pelagic or benthopelagic fish and squid, and in the Northeast Atlantic primarily feed on cod (Perrin et al., 2002). The best abundance estimate for striped dolphins is the result of the 2011 survey— 46,882 (CV=0.33). The minimum population estimate for this stock is 35,763. Based on these data, the PBR for the western North Atlantic striped dolphin is 358 (Waring et al., 2013).      Bycatch has previously been observed by the NMFS Fisheries Observer Program in the pelagic drift gillnet and North Atlantic bottom trawl fisheries, but no mortalities or serious injuries have recently been documented in any U.S. fishery. Total annual estimated average
fishery-related mortality to this stock during 2006-2010 was zero striped dolphins (Waring et al., 2013).Pilot Whale      Pilot whales (Globicephala melas and Globicephala macrorhynchus) are found in the Gulf Stream and continental shelf and slope waters. Combined abundance estimates for the two pilot whale species – the long-finned and short-finned species have previously been derived from line-transect surveys. The best available abundance estimates are from surveys conducted during the summer of 2004. These survey data have been combined with an analysis of the spatial distribution of the two species based on genetic analyses of biopsy samples to derive separate abundance estimates (Garrison et al., in prep.). The resulting abundance estimate is 12,619 (CV=0.37) for long-finned pilot whales in U.S. waters and 24,674 (CV=0.45) for short-finned pilot whales in U.S. waters (Waring et al., 2012). The minimum population estimate is 9,333 for long-finned pilot whales and 1,790 for short-finned pilot whales (Waring et al., 2012). PBR for long-finned pilot whales is 93 and for short-finned pilot whales is 172 (Waring et al., 2012).      Pilot whale bycatch has been observed by NMFS Sea Samplers in the pelagic drift gillnet, pelagic longline, pelagic pair trawl, bluefin tuna purse seine, North Atlantic bottom trawl, Atlantic squid, mackerel, butterfish trawl, and Mid-Atlantic coastal gillnet fisheries, but no mortalities or serious injuries have been documented in the Northeast multispecies sink gillnet fishery.25 It is not possible to partition mortality estimates between the two pilot whale species because there are very few available genetic samples from the area of overlap and season where most mortality occurs. Mortality and serious injury estimates are thus presented only for the two species combined. Total annual estimated average fishery-related mortality or serious injury during 2005-2009 was 162 pilot whales (CV=0.15) (Waring et al., 2012). The fisheries responsible for these interactions are as follows: 30 in Mid-Atlantic bottom trawl fishery; 12 in the Northeast bottom trawl fishery; 2.4 in the Mid-Atlantic mid water trawl fishery; 3 in the Northeast mid water trawl fishery; 114 in the pelagic longline fishery; and 1 in the 2005 pelagic longline experimental fishery (Waring et al., 2012).      During 2005-2009, several human and/or fishery interactions were documented in stranded pilot whales. During a UME in Dare, North Carolina, in January 2005, 6 of the 33short-finned pilot whales which mass stranded had fishery interaction marks (specifics not given) which were healed and determined not to be the cause of death. A short-finned pilot whale stranded in May 2005 in North Carolina had net marks around the leading edge of the dorsal fin from the top to bottom, and had net marks on both fluke lobes. Two long-finned pilot whales stranded in Virginia in April 2005, 1 with a line on its fluke and another with human interactions noted but specifics not given. Of the 2006 stranding mortalities, 2 were reported as exhibiting signs of human interaction, 1 in Massachusetts and 1 in Virginia. In 2008, 1 Massachusetts stranding mortality was deemed a fishery interaction due to line markings and cut flukes. The 2 New York strandings of long-finned pilot whales were classified as human interactions. One25 Waring et al. (2003) note that the pelagic drift gillnet and the pelagic pair trawl fisheries no longer exist.
long-finned pilot whale that stranded in Massachusetts in 2009 was classified as a human interaction because it had a piece of monofilament line in its stomach.      An additional potential human-caused source of mortality for pilot whales is from polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and chlorinated pesticides, moderate levels of which have been found in pilot whale blubber (Taruski, 1975; Muir et al., 1988; Weisbrod et al., 2000b). In addition, high levels of toxic metals, selenium, and PCBs were measured in pilot whales killed in the Faroe Islands (Nielsen et al., 2000; Dam and Bloch, 2000). The population effect of the observed levels of such contaminants is currently unknown (Waring et al., 2003).Offshore Bottlenose Dolphin      The western North Atlantic offshore stock of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) ranges from Florida to Georges Bank along the continental slope. The best available estimate for offshore morphotype bottlenose dolphins is the sum of the estimates from the June-July 2002 aerial survey covering the continental shelf, the summer 2004 vessel survey south of Maryland, and the summer 2004 vessel and aircraft surveys north of Maryland. This joint estimate provides complete coverage of the offshore habitat from central Florida to Canada during summer months. The combined abundance estimate from these surveys is 81,588 (CV=0.17) and the minimum population estimate is 70,775 (Waring et al., 2009).  Based on these data, the PBR for the stock is 566 dolphins (Waring et al., 2009). Bottlenose dolphins are among the most frequently stranded small cetaceans along the Atlantic coast. Many of these stranded animals show signs of human interaction, such as net marks and mutilation (Waring et al., 2003).26      Offshore bottlenose dolphin bycatch has been observed by NMFS Sea Samplers in the pelagic drift gillnet, pelagic longline, pelagic pair trawl, North Atlantic bottom trawl, Northeast multispecies sink gillnet, and Mid-Atlantic coastal gillnet fisheries.27 Total estimated mean annual fishery-related mortality for this stock during 2001-2006 is unknown; however, mortalities of offshore bottlenose dolphins were observed during this period in the Northeast Sink Gillnet and Mid-Atlantic Gillnet commercial fisheries (Waring et al., 2009).Common Dolphin      Common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) may be among the most widely distributed cetacean species; they range worldwide in temperate, sub-tropical, and tropical waters. The western North Atlantic stock occurs most frequently north of Cape Hatteras along the continental shelf. The best abundance estimate for common dolphins is 67,191 animals (CV=0.29). The minimum estimate is 52,893(Waring et al., 2013). Based on these data, the PBR is 529 common dolphins (Waring et al., 2013).26 Average annual fishery-related mortality estimates are based on observer data between 1990 and 2001.27 Waring et al. (2003) note that the pelagic drift gillnet and the pelagic pair trawl fisheries no longer exist.
      Common dolphin bycatch has been observed by NMFS Sea Samplers in the pelagic drift gillnet, pelagic longline, pelagic pair trawl, North Atlantic bottom trawl, Atlantic squid, mackerel, butterfish trawl, Northeast multispecies sink gillnet, and Mid-Atlantic coastal gillnet fisheries.28 Total annual estimated average fishery-related mortality or serious injury to this stock during 2006-2010 was 164 (CV=0.12) common dolphins.      Of these deaths, 30 are associated with the Northeast sink gillnet fishery; 8.4 with the Mid-Atlantic gillnet fishery; 0.6 with the Mid-Atlantic mid water trawl fishery; 20 with the Northeast bottom trawl fishery; 103 with the Mid-Atlantic bottom trawl fishery; and 1.7 with the pelagic longline fishery (Waring et al., 2013). The Northeast multispecies sink gillnet and the Mid-Atlantic coastal gillnet fisheries are currently regulated under the ALWTRP.4.3.2.4 SealsHarbor Seal      The harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) is found in all nearshore waters of the Atlantic Ocean above 30 degrees latitude (Waring et al., 2003). In the western North Atlantic they are  distributed from the eastern Canadian Arctic and Greenland south to southern New England and New York, and occasionally the Carolinas (Boulva and McLaren, 1979; Gilbert and Guldager, 1998). It is believed that the harbor seals found along the U.S. and Canadian east  coasts represent one population (Waring et al., 2003). Harbor seals are year-round inhabitants of the coastal waters of eastern Canada and Maine, and occur seasonally along the southern New England and New York coasts from September through late May. However, breeding and pupping normally occur only in waters north of the New Hampshire/Maine border.      Since passage of the MMPA in 1972, the observed count of seals along the New England coast has been increasing. Coast-wide aerial surveys along the Maine coast were conducted in May/June 1981, 1986, 1993, 1997, and 2001 during pupping (Gilbert and Stein 1981; Gilbert andWynne 1983,; 1984; Kenney 1994; Gilbert and Guldager 1998; Gilbert et al. 2005). However, estimates older than eight years are deemed unreliable (Wade and Angliss 1997) and should not be used for PBR determinations. Therefore, there is no current abundance estimate for harbor seals. The 2001 survey, conducted in May/June, included replicate surveys and radio tagged seals to obtain a correction factor for animals not hauled out. The corrected estimate (pups in parenthesis) for 2001 was 99,340 (23,722). The 2001 observed count of 38,014 is 28.7% greater than the 1997 count. Increased abundance of seals in the Northeast region has also been documented during aerial and boat surveys of overwintering haul-out sites from the Maine/New Hampshire border to eastern Long Island and New Jersey (Payne and Selzer 1989; Rough 1995; Barlas 1999; Schroeder 2000; deHart 2002). The maximum productivity rate is assumed to be 0.12, and the recovery factor for this stock is 0.5, which is the value for stocks of unknown status. PBR for U.S. waters is undetermined (Waring et al., 2013).      For the period 2006-2010, the total human caused mortality and serious injury to harbor seals is estimated to be 337 per year. The average was derived from two components: 1) 332 (CV=0.15) from the 2006-2010 observed fishery; and 2) 5 from average 2006-2010 non-fishery- related, human interaction stranding mortalities (NMFS unpublished data) (Waring et al., 2013).28 Waring et al. (2003) note that the pelagic drift gillnet and the pelagic pair trawl fisheries no longer exist.
The fishery-related mortalities and serious injuries are attributed as follows: 280 to the Northeast sink gillnet fishery; 50 to the Mid-Atlantic gillnet fishery; an unknown number to the Northeast bottom trawl fishery; and 0.7 to the Northeast mid water trawl fishery (Waring et al., 2013).      Researchers and fishery observers have documented incidental mortality in several fisheries, particularly within the Gulf of Maine (see below). An unknown level of mortality also occurred in the mariculture industry (i.e., salmon farming), and by deliberate shooting (NMFS unpublished data). Between 2006 and 2010, there are 5 records of harbors seals and 3 of unidentified seals with evidence of gunshot wounds in the Northeast Regional Office Marine Mammal Stranding Network database.      Additional sources of mortality for harbor seals include boat strikes, entrainment in power plant intakes (12-20 per year; NMFS unpublished data), oil contamination, shooting (around salmon aquaculture sites and fixed fishing gear), storms, abandonment by the mother, and disease (Katona et al. 1993; NMFS unpublished data).Gray Seal      Current estimates of the total western Atlantic gray seal population are not available; although estimates of portions of the stock are available for select time periods. The size of the Canadian population from 1993 to 2004 has been estimated from three surveys. A 1993 survey estimated the population at 144,000 animals (Mohn and Bowen 1996; DFO 2003), a 1997 survey estimated 195,000 (DFO 2003), and a 2004 survey obtained estimates ranging between 208,720 (SE=29,730) and 223,220 (SE=17,376) depending upon the model used (Trzcinski et al. 2005). The population at Sable Island had been increasing by approximately 13% per year for nearly 40 years (Bowen et al. 2003), but the most recent (2004) survey results indicated that this rate of population increase has declined to 7% (Trzcinski et al. 2005; Bowen et al. 2007). The non- Sable Island (Gulf of St Lawrence and Eastern Shore) abundance has increased from 20,900 (SE=200) in 1970 to 52,500 (SE=7,800) in 2004 (Hammill 2005).      In U.S. waters, gray seals currently pup at three established colonies: Muskeget Island, Massachusetts; Green Island, Maine; and Seal Island, Maine; as well as, more recently, at Matinicus Rock in Maine. They have been observed using the historic pupping site on Muskeget Island in Massachusetts since 1990. Pupping has taken place on Seal and Green Islands in Maine since at least the mid-1990s. Aerial survey data from these sites indicate that pup production is increasing.      Gray seals are also observed in New England outside of the pupping season. In April- May 1994, a maximum count of 2,010 was obtained for Muskeget Island and Monomoy combined (Rough 1995). Maine coast-wide surveys conducted during summer revealed 597 and 1,731 gray seals in 1993 and 2001, respectively (Gilbert et al. 2005). In March 1999, a maximum count of 5,611 was obtained in the region south of Maine (between Isles of Shoals, Maine and Woods Hole, Massachusetts) (Barlas 1999). No gray seals were recorded at haul-out sites between Newport, Rhode Island and Montauk Pt., New York (Barlas 1999), although, more recently several hundred gray seals have been recorded in surveys conducted off eastern Long
Island (R. DiGiovanni, pers. comm., The Riverhead Foundation, Riverhead, NY). Depending on the model used, the minimum population estimate for the Canadian gray seal population was estimated to range between 125,541 and 169,064 (Trzcinski et al. 2005). Present data are insufficient to calculate the minimum population estimate for U.S. waters (Waring et al., 2012). PBR for U.S. waters is also unknown (Waring et al., 2012).      Gray seals, like harbor seals, were hunted for bounty in New England waters until the late 1960s. This hunt may have severely depleted the stock in U.S. waters (Rough,  1995).  In Canada, gray seals were hunted for several centuries by indigenous people and European settlers in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and along the Nova Scotia eastern shore, and were locally extirpated (Lavigueru and Hammill, 1993). By the mid-1900s, gray seals were considered to be rare, and in the mid-1960s, the population in eastern Canada was estimated to be 5,600 (Mansfield, 1966). Since the mid-1960s the population has been increasing. During a bounty program (1976-1983) and a culling program (1967-1983), the average annual removals were 720 and 1,000 seals, respectively (Fisheries and Oceans Canada, 2001). From 1993 through 2000, the annual kill of gray seals by hunters was: 1993 (0), 1994 (40), 1995 (364), 1996 (132), 1997 (72), 1998 (275),1999 (98), and 2000 (342) (Waring et al., 2003). The traditional hunt continued in 2002 and 2003, with 76 and 126 gray seals taken, respectively, off the Magdalen Islands and in other areas, except Sable Island, where commercial hunting is not permitted (Fisheries and Oceans Canada, 2003).      An unknown level of mortality also occurs in the mariculture industry (i.e., salmon farming) and by deliberate shooting (NMFS, unpublished data). In addition, the Cape Cod stranding network has documented several animals with netting or plastic debris around their necks in the Cape Cod/Nantucket area. Between 1997 and 2001, 197 gray seal strandings were recorded, extending from Maine (25) to North Carolina (1). Most of the strandings occurred in Massachusetts (72), followed by New York (55), and Maine (25). Twenty-three animals showed signs of human interactions: fishery (8), power plant (3), oil spill (6), shot (1), mutilated (1), boat strike (1), and other (3) (Waring et al., 2003). Stranding data probably underestimate the extent of fishery-related mortality and serious injury because not all of the marine mammals that die or are seriously injured wash ashore, nor will all of those that do wash ashore necessarily show signs of entanglement or other fishery interaction.      For the period 2006-2010, the total estimated human caused mortality and serious injury to gray seals was 5,253 per year. The average was derived from five components: 1) 853 from the 2006-2010 U.S. observed fishery; 2) 6 from average 2006-2010 non-fishery related, human interaction stranding mortalities (NMFS unpublished data); 3) 1079 from average 2006-2010 kill in the Canadian hunt; 4) 23 from DFO scientific collections; and 5) 3,292 removals of nuisance animals in Canada. The 794 annual average mortalities or serious injuries in U.S. fisheries are attributed to the Northeast sink gillnet fishery (Waring et al., 2013).Harp Seal      The harp seal (Phoca groenlandica) occurs throughout much of the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans and has been increasing off the East Coast of the United States from Maine to New Jersey. Harp seals are usually found off the U.S. from January to May, when the western
stock of harp seals is at its most southern point of migration (Waring et al., 2003). Harp seals congregate on the edge of the pack ice from February through April, when breeding and pupping take place. The harp seal is highly migratory, moving north and south with the edge of the pack ice. Non-breeding juveniles will migrate the farthest south in the winter, but the entire population moves north toward the Arctic in the summer. The best estimate of abundance for western North Atlantic harp seals is 8.3 million (95% CI 7.5-8.9 million; DFO 2011, in review). Data are insufficient to calculate the minimum population estimate for U.S. waters (Waring et al., 2013). The maximum productivity rate is assumed to be 0.12, the default value for pinnipeds. The recovery factor, which accounts for endangered, depleted, threatened stocks, or stocks of unknown status relative to OSP is set at 1.0 because the population is increasing. PBR for the western North Atlantic harp seal in U.S. waters is unknown. PBR for the stock in US waters is unknown (Waring et al., 2013).A large number of harp seals are killed in Canada, Greenland, and the Arctic.In 2008 the Canadian TAC was increased to 275,000 (268,050 commercial hunt, 4,950 for aboriginal, and 2,000 for personal use). In 2009, the TAC was 280,000, and in 2010 it was 330,000 (Waring et al., 2012).      For the period 2006- 2010, the total estimated annual human caused mortality and serious injury to harp seals was 379,672. This is derived from three components: 1) an average catch of 379,387 seals from 2006-2010 by Canada and Greenland, including bycatch in the lumpfish fishery; 2) 281 harp seals (CV=0.19) from the observed U.S. fisheries; and 3) average of 4 stranded seals from 2006-2010 with signs of non-fishery human interactions (Waring et al., 2013). The 281 mortalities or serious injuries in U.S. fisheries are distributed as follows: 218 in the Northeast sink gillnet fishery and 63 in the Mid-Atlantic gillnet fishery (Waring et al., 2013). There are 0.2 seals killed in the Northeast bottom trawl fishery.4.3.2.5 Sea Turtles      Kemp’s ridley, loggerhead, leatherback, green, and hawksbill sea turtles spend all or part of the year in the waters potentially affected by new ALWTRP regulations. Sea turtles continue to be affected by many of the original threats that prompted their ESA listing, including interactions with fishing gear, degradation of nesting beach sites, poaching, nesting predation, vessel strikes, channel dredging, and marine pollution (including ingestion of marine debris29) (Lutcavage et al., 1997). Few of these impacts, however, have been quantified with any degree  of confidence. Observer programs implemented for dredging and some commercial fisheries have begun to measure the effects of these activities on sea turtle populations.           29 Marine turtles have been found to ingest a wide variety of ocean debris such as plastic bags, raw plastic pellets, plastic and Styrofoam pieces, and tar ball sand balloons. Effects of debris ingestion can include direct obstruction of the gut, absorption of toxic byproducts, and reduced absorption of nutrients across the gut wall.
Kemp's Ridley Sea Turtle      Less than fifty years ago, the Kemp’s ridley (Lepidochelys kempii) was an abundant sea turtle in the Gulf of Mexico. Since then, the Kemp's ridley has experienced one of the most dramatic population declines recorded for any animal. The Kemp's ridley was listed as endangered under the ESA on December 2, 1970. Internationally, the Kemp's ridley is considered to be the most endangered sea turtle and is protected from international trade.      The majority of Kemp’s ridleys nest along a single stretch of beach near Rancho Nuevo, Tamaulipas, Mexico (Carr 1963; NMFS and USFWS 2007c; NMFS et al. 2011). The number of nesting females in the Kemp’s ridley population declined dramatically from the late 1940s through the mid-1980s, with an estimated 40,000 nesting females in a single arribada in 1947 and fewer than 300 nesting females in the entire 1985 nesting season (TEWG 2000; NMFS et al. 2011). Conservation efforts by Mexican and U.S. agencies have aided this species by  eliminating egg harvest, protecting eggs and hatchlings, and reducing at-sea mortality through fishing regulations (TEWG 2000). Since the mid-1980s, the number of nests observed at Rancho Nuevo and nearby beaches has increased 14-16% per year (Heppell et al. 2005), allowing cautious optimism that the population is on its way to recovery. An estimated 5,500 females nested in the State of Tamaulipas over a three-day period in May 2007 and more than 4,000 of those nested at Rancho Nuevo (NMFS and USFWS 2007c). However, events such as the Deepwater Horizon oil release, and stranding events associated increased skimmer trawl use and poor TED compliance in the northern Gulf of Mexico which may dampen recent population growth.      A revised bi-national recovery plan was published for public comment in 2010, and in September 2011, NMFS, USFWS, and the Secretary of Environment and Natural Resources, Mexico (SEMARNAT) released the second revision to the Kemp’s ridley recovery plan.  As with the other sea turtle species, fishery mortality accounts for a large proportion of annual human-caused mortality outside the nesting beaches, while other significant threats facing Kemp's ridleys include degradation of nesting beach habitat from human development; marine pollution30 and floating debris; channel dredging, and offshore oil and gas exploration operations.31 An estimated 500 to 5,000 benthic immature and adult Kemp’s ridley mortalities were attributed to shrimp trawling prior to the implementation of TED regulations (NRC, 1990).32 Although modifications to shrimp trawls have helped to reduce mortality of Kemp’s ridleys, a recent assessment by Finkbeiner et al. (2011) found that the Southeast/Gulf of Mexico shrimp trawl fishery remained responsible for the vast majority of U.S. fishery interactions (up to           30 The impact of heavy metals and pesticides on the physiology and behavior of sea turtles is not documented. Because Kemp’s ridley is a carnivore, however, the species is vulnerable to the bio-accumulation of chemicals. In addition, intensive industrial and agricultural development along the northern Gulf coast raises the potential for increased levels of chemical exposure for the species.           31 The Gulf of Mexico is an area of high-density offshore oil extraction with chronic, low-level spills and occasional massive spills (such as the April 2010 BP Deepwater Horizon explosion). The two primary feeding grounds for adult Kemp's ridleys in the northern and southern Gulf of Mexico are both near major areas of near- shore and off-shore oil exploration and production.32 This compares to 75 to 750 estimated mortalities due to all other known human causes.
98%) and mortalities (more than 80%; all species combined). Kemp's ridleys are known to have been incidentally taken in other types of fishing gear as well, such as hook and line gear, gill nets, trawls, dip nets, beach and purse seines, pound nets, cast nets, butterfly nets, and crab traps/pots (Manzella et al. 1988, Marquez et al. 1989, NMFS, 2006). Stranding reports indicate that from 2008-2011, an average of approximately 430 Kemp’s ridley turtles stranded annually along the Eastern U.S. coast from a variety of causes, most of which are unknown (NMFS STSSN database). For more detailed information on interactions between Kemp’s ridley turtles and ALWTRP-related gear, see Chapter 9, section 9.4.2.5.Loggerhead Sea Turtle      The loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) is the most abundant sea turtle in U.S. waters. The loggerhead sea turtle was listed as threatened under the ESA on July 28, 1978, but is considered endangered by the International World Conservation Union (IUCN). In 2009, a  status review team identified the following nine DPSs as being discrete from other conspecific population segments and significant to the species: (1) North Pacific Ocean, (2) South Pacific Ocean, (3) North Indian Ocean, (4) Southeast Indo-Pacific Ocean, (5) Southwest Indian Ocean,(6) Northwest Atlantic Ocean, (7) Northeast Atlantic Ocean, (8) Mediterranean Sea, and (9) South Atlantic Ocean (Conant et al. 2009). On September 22, 2011, NMFS and USFWS issued  a final rule (76 FR 58868), determining that the loggerhead sea turtle is composed of nine DPSs (as defined in Conant et al., 2009) that constitute the species that may be listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA. Five DPSs were listed as endangered (North Pacific Ocean, South Pacific Ocean, North Indian Ocean, Northeast Atlantic Ocean, and Mediterranean Sea), and four DPSs were listed as threatened (Northwest Atlantic Ocean, South Atlantic Ocean, Southeast Indo-Pacific Ocean, and Southwest Indian Ocean). The DPS found within this action area is the Northwest Atlantic Ocean DPS. NMFS is participating in a comprehensive research program (Atlantic Marine Assessment Program for Protected Species (AMAPPS)) to assess the distribution of marine mammals, sea turtles, and sea birds in U.S. waters of the western North Atlantic. Four species of sea turtles were documented during the 2011 surveys, including two loggerhead sea turtles in the central Gulf of Maine during the winter surveys, which is a rare sighting for the wintertime (NMFS 2011).      Loggerheads are circumglobal, inhabiting continental shelves, bays, estuaries, and lagoons in temperate, subtropical, and tropical waters. They commonly occur throughout the inner continental shelf from Florida through Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Loggerhead sea turtles are found in Virginia foraging areas as early as April, but are not usually found on the most northern foraging grounds in the Gulf of Maine until June. The large majority leave the Gulf of Maine by mid-September, but some may remain in Mid-Atlantic and northeast waters until late fall. During November and December, loggerheads seem to concentrate in nearshore and southerly areas influenced by warmer Gulf Stream waters off North Carolina. Summer nesting usually occurs in the lower latitudes. Primary Atlantic nesting sites are along the east coast of Florida, with additional sites in Georgia, the Carolinas, and the Gulf Coast of Florida. In the 2008 recovery plan, the Loggerhead Recovery Team designated five recovery units for the Northwest Atlantic population of loggerhead sea turtles based on nesting assemblages: (1) the Northern Recovery Unit (NRU: Florida/Georgia border through southern Virginia), (2) the Peninsular Florida Recovery Unit (PFRU: Florida/Georgia border through Pinellas County, Florida), (3) the Dry Tortugas Recovery Unit (DTRU: islands located west of Key West,
Florida), (4) the Northern Gulf of Mexico Recovery Unit (NGMRU: Franklin County, Florida through Texas), and (5) the Greater Caribbean Recovery Unit (GCRU: Mexico through French Guiana, Bahamas, Lesser Antilles, and Greater Antilles).      From the beginning of Florida standardized index surveys in 1989 until 1998, the PFRU, the largest nesting assemblage in the Northwest Atlantic by an order of magnitude, had a significant increase in the number of nests. However, from 1998 through 2008, there was a 41% decrease in annual nest counts from index beaches, which represent an average of 70% of the statewide nesting activity (NMFS and USFWS 2008). From 1989-2008, the PFRU had an overall declining nesting trend of 26% (95% CI: -42% to -5%; NMFS and USFWS 2008). With the addition of nesting data through 2010, the nesting trend for the PFRU does not show a nesting decline statistically different from zero (76 FR 58868, September 22, 2011). The NRU, the second largest nesting assemblage of loggerheads in the United States, has been declining at a rate of 1.3% annually since 1983 (NMFS and USFWS 2008). The NRU dataset included 11 beaches with an uninterrupted time series of coverage of at least 20 years; these beaches represent approximately 27% of NRU nesting (in 2008). Through 2008, there was strong statistical data to suggest the NRU has experienced a long-term decline, but with the inclusion of nesting data through 2010, nesting for the NRU is showing possible signs of stabilizing (76 FR 58868, September 22, 2011). Evaluation of long-term nesting trends for the NGMRU is difficult because of changed and expanded beach coverage. However, the NGMRU has shown a significant declining trend of 4.7% annually since index nesting beach surveys were initiated in 1997 (NMFS and USFWS 2008). No statistical trends in nesting abundance can be determined for the DTRU because of the lack of long-term data. Similarly, statistically valid analyses of long-term nesting trends for the entire GCRU are not available because there are few long-term standardized nesting surveys representative of the region.  Additionally, changing survey effort at monitored beaches and scattered and low-level nesting by loggerheads at many locations currently precludes comprehensive analyses (NMFS and USFWS 2008).      Significant threats to loggerhead populations in the Atlantic include commercial fisheries, coastal development and erosion of nesting beaches, pollution (including ingestion of marine debris), marine habitat degradation and vessel strikes. Specifically, loggerhead turtles are captured and injured or killed in interactions with a variety of fishing gear, including pots, gillnets, pelagic longlines, trawls, pound nets, and scallop dredges (NMFS and USFWS 2008). Stranding reports indicate that from 2008-2011, an average of approximately 1,100 loggerhead turtles stranded annually along the Eastern U.S. coast from a variety of causes, most of which are unknown (NMFS STSSN database). See Chapter 9, section 9.4.2.5 for detailed information on these interactions.Leatherback Sea Turtle      The leatherback sea turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) is the largest living turtle and is distinct from other sea turtle species because of its rubber-like, flexible carapace. Like the loggerhead, the leatherback is circumglobal. In the northwestern Atlantic, the leatherback turtle's range extends from Nova Scotia, south to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Nesting occurs from February through July at sites located from Georgia to the U.S. Virgin Islands.
During the summer, leatherbacks tend to be found along the east coast of the U.S. from the Gulf of Maine south to Florida.      Listed as endangered on June 2, 1970, the leatherback population was estimated at approximately 115,000 adult females globally in 1980 (Pritchard 1982). By 1995, this global population of adult females was estimated to have declined to 34,500 (Spotila et al. 1996). The most recent population size estimate for the North Atlantic alone is a range of 34,000-94,000 adult leatherbacks (TEWG 2007). Thus, there is substantial uncertainty with respect to global population estimates of leatherback sea turtles. In 1979, the waters adjacent to Sandy Point, St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands were designated as critical habitat for the leatherback sea turtle.       The TEWG reports an increasing or stable nesting trend for five of the seven populations or groups of populations that were identified as occurring within the Atlantic, with the  exceptions of the Western Caribbean and West Africa groups. The leatherback  rookery along  the northern coast of South America in French Guiana and Suriname supports the majority of leatherback nesting in the western Atlantic (TEWG 2007), and represents more than half of total nesting by leatherback sea turtles worldwide (Hilterman and Goverse 2004). The TEWG (2007) report indicates that a positive population growth rate was found for French Guinea and Suriname using nest numbers from 1967-2005, a 39-year period, and that there was a 95% probability that the population was growing. An analysis of Florida’s index nesting beach sites from 1989-2006 shows a substantial increase in leatherback nesting in Florida during this time, with an annual growth rate of approximately 1.17 (TEWG 2007).As with the other sea turtle species, mortality due to fisheries interactions (including trawl, gillnet, pelagic longline, and trap/pot gear) accounts for a large proportion of annual human- caused mortality outside the nesting beaches, while other activities like pollution (including ingesting marine debris), habitat destruction, and vessel strikes account for an unknown level of other anthropogenic mortality. Stranding reports indicate that from 2008-2011, an average of approximately 50 leatherback turtles stranded annually along the Eastern U.S. coast from a variety of causes, most of which are unknown (NMFS STSSN database). The effect of climate change may also effect leatherbacks in yet unknown ways. This may include changes in the distribution of prey species like jellyfish (Purcell, 2012). The long-term recovery potential of  this species may be further threatened by observed low genetic diversity, even in the largest nesting groups (NMFS and USFWS 2007b). For detailed information on fishing gear interactions, see Chapter 9, section 9.4.2.5.Green Sea Turtle      Green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas) are distributed circumglobally. In the western Atlantic they range from Massachusetts to Argentina, including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean, but are considered rare north of Cape Hatteras (Wynne and Schwartz, 1999). Green turtles were traditionally highly prized for their flesh, fat, eggs, and shell, and directed fisheries in the U.S. and throughout the Caribbean are largely to blame for the decline of the species. In the Gulf of Mexico, green turtles were once abundant enough in the shallow bays and lagoons to support a commercial fishery. However, declines in the turtle fishery throughout the Gulf of Mexico were evident by 1902 (Doughty, 1984).
      In 1978, the Atlantic population of green sea turtles was listed as threatened under the ESA, except for the breeding populations in Florida and on the Pacific coast of Mexico, which were listed as endangered. As it is difficult to differentiate between breeding populations away from the nesting beaches, all green sea turtles in the water are considered endangered.  The waters surrounding the island of Culebra, Puerto Rico, and its outlying keys are designated critical habitat for the green sea turtle.      By far, the most important nesting concentration for green sea turtles in the western Atlantic is in Tortuguero, Costa Rica (NMFS and USFWS 2007d). Nesting in the area has increased considerably since the 1970s, and nest count data from 1999-2003 suggest nesting by 17,402-37,290 females per year (NMFS and USFWS 2007d). In the continental United States, green turtle nesting occurs on the Atlantic coast of Florida (Ehrhart, 1979). Occasional nesting has been documented along the Gulf coast of Florida, at southwest Florida beaches, and at beaches on the Florida panhandle (Meylan et al., 1995). The pattern of green turtle nesting  shows biennial peaks in abundance, with a generally positive trend since establishment of the Florida index beach surveys in 1989, perhaps due to increased protective legislation throughout the Caribbean (Meylan et al., 1995) as well as protections in Florida and throughout the United States (NMFS and USFWS 2007d). Recent population estimates for the western Atlantic area  are not available.      As is the case for loggerhead and Kemp's ridley sea turtles, green sea turtles use Mid- Atlantic and northern areas of the western Atlantic coast as important summer developmental habitat. Like other marine turtle species, green turtle hatchlings initially enter the pelagic environment. After reaching a certain size, juveniles enter benthic foraging areas where they consume a primarily herbivorous diet. Along the U.S. western Atlantic coast, green turtles are found in estuarine and coastal waters as far north as Long Island Sound, Chesapeake Bay, and North Carolina (Musick and Limpus, 1997). Like loggerheads and Kemp's ridleys, green sea turtles that use northern waters during the summer must return to warmer waters when water temperatures drop, or face the risk of cold stunning.33 Cold stunning of green turtles may occur in southern areas as well (i.e., Indian River, Florida), as these natural mortality events are dependent on water temperatures and not solely geographical location.      Green turtles face many of the same natural threats as loggerhead and Kemp’s ridley sea turtles. In addition, green turtles appear to be susceptible to fibropapillomatosis, an epizootic disease producing lobe-shaped tumors on the soft portion of a turtle’s body. Juveniles are most commonly affected. The occurrence of fibropapilloma tumors may result in impaired foraging, breathing, or swimming ability, leading potentially to death. Stranding reports indicate that from 2008-2011, an average of approximately 900 green turtles stranded annually along the EasternU.S. coast from a variety of causes, most of which are unknown (NMFS STSSN database).      As with the other sea turtle species, fishery mortality accounts for a large proportion of annual human-caused mortality outside the nesting beaches, while other activities like dredging, pollution, and habitat destruction account for an unknown level of other mortality. Sea sampling           33 Cold stunning refers to the condition observed in sea turtles that have been exposed to very sudden decreases in water temperature. Affected animals generally become lethargic and float to the surface. In extreme cases, death may occur.
coverage in the pelagic driftnet, pelagic longline, southeast shrimp trawl, and summer flounder bottom trawl fisheries has recorded takes of green turtles.Hawksbill Sea Turtle      The hawksbill sea turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) is relatively uncommon in the waters of the Northeast or Mid-Atlantic. Hawksbills prefer coral reefs, such as those found in the Caribbean and Central America, where they feed primarily on a wide variety of sponges and mollusks. There are accounts of small hawksbills stranded as far north as Cape Cod, Massachusetts; however, many of these strandings were observed after hurricanes or offshore storms. Stranding reports indicate that from 2008-2011, an average of approximately 20 hawksbill turtles stranded annually along the Eastern U.S. coast from a variety of causes, most of which are unknown (NMFS STSSN database). No fisheries-related takes of hawksbill sea turtles have been observed in the Northeast or Mid-Atlantic (NMFS, 2003a).4.3.2.6 Atlantic Sturgeon      The Atlantic sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus oxyrinchus) is a subspecies of sturgeon distributed along the eastern coast of North America from Hamilton Inlet, Labrador, Canada to Cape Canaveral, Florida, U.S. (Scott and Scott, 1988; ASSRT, 2007; T. Savoy, CT DEP, pers. comm.). NMFS has delineated U.S. populations of Atlantic sturgeon into five DPSs34 ( 77 FR 5880 and 77 FR 5914). These are: the Gulf of Maine, New York Bight, Chesapeake Bay, Carolina, and South Atlantic DPSs. The results of genetic studies suggest that natal origin influences the distribution of Atlantic sturgeon in the marine environment (Wirgin and King, 2011). However, genetic data as well as tracking and tagging data demonstrate sturgeon from each DPS and Canada occur throughout the full range of the subspecies. Therefore, sturgeon originating from any of the 5 DPSs can be affected by threats in the marine, estuarine and riverine environment that occur far from natal spawning rivers.      On February 6, 2012, a notice in the Federal Register was published that the New York Bight, Chesapeake Bay, Carolina, and South Atlantic DPSs were being listed as “endangered,” and the Gulf of Maine DPS was being listed as “threatened” (77 FR 5880 and 77 FR 5914). The effective date of the listings is April 6, 2012. The DPSs do not include Atlantic sturgeon that are spawned in Canadian rivers. Therefore, Canadian spawned fish are not included in the listings.      Atlantic sturgeon are long lived (approximately 60 years), late maturing, estuarine dependent, anadromous35 fish (Bigelow and Schroeder, 1953; Vladykov and Greeley 1963; Mangin, 1964; Pikitch et al., 2005; Dadswell, 2006; ASSRT, 2007). After emigration from the natal estuary, subadults and adults travel within the marine environment, typically in waters less34 To be considered for listing under the ESA, a group of organisms must constitute a “species.” A “species” is defined in section 3 of the ESA to include “any subspecies of fish or wildlife or plants, and any distinct population segment of any species of vertebrate fish or wildlife which interbreeds when mature.”35 Anadromous refers to a fish that is born in freshwater, spends most of its life in the sea, and returns to freshwater to spawn (NEFSC FAQ’s, available at http://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/faq/fishfaq1a.html, modified June 16, 2011).
than 50 m in depth, using coastal bays, sounds, and ocean waters (Vladykov and Greeley, 1963; Murawski and Pacheco, 1977; Dovel and Berggren, 1983; Smith, 1985; Collins and Smith, 1997; Welsh et al., 2002; Savoy and Pacileo, 2003; Stein et al., 2004; Laney et al., 2007; Dunton et al., 2010; Erickson et al., 2011; Wirgin and King, 2011).      Atlantic sturgeon underwent significant range-wide declines from historical abundance levels due to overfishing in the mid to late 19th century when a caviar market was established (Scott and Crossman, 1973; Taub, 1990; Kennebec River Resource Management Plan, 1993; Smith and Clugston, 1997; Dadswell, 2006; ASSRT, 2007). Abundance of spawning-aged females prior to this period of exploitation was predicted to be greater than 100,000 for the Delaware River, and at least 10,000 females for other spawning stocks (Secor and Waldman, 1999; Secor, 2002). Historical records suggest that Atlantic sturgeon spawned in at least 35 rivers prior to this period. Currently, only 16 U.S. rivers are known to support spawning based on available evidence (i.e., presence of young-of-year or gravid Atlantic sturgeon documented within the past 15 years) (ASSRT, 2007). While there may be other rivers supporting spawning for which definitive evidence has not been obtained (e.g., in the Penobscot and York rivers), the number of rivers supporting spawning of Atlantic sturgeon are approximately half of what they were historically. In addition, only four rivers (Kennebec, Hudson, Delaware, James) are known to currently support spawning from Maine through Virginia where historical records support there used to be fifteen spawning rivers (ASSRT, 2007). Thus, there are substantial gaps in the range between Atlantic sturgeon spawning rivers amongst northern and Mid-Atlantic states which could make recolonization of extirpated populations more difficult.      Based on the best available information, NMFS has concluded that unintended catch of Atlantic sturgeon in fisheries, vessel strikes, poor water quality, water availability, dams, lack of regulatory mechanisms for protecting the fish, and dredging are the most significant threats to Atlantic sturgeon (77 FR 5880 and 77 FR 5914; February 6, 2012). While all of the threats are not necessarily present in the same area at the same time, given that Atlantic sturgeon subadults and adults use ocean waters from Labrador, Canada to Cape Canaveral, FL, as well as estuaries of large rivers along the U.S. East Coast, activities affecting these water bodies are likely to impact more than one Atlantic sturgeon DPS.  In addition, given that Atlantic sturgeon depend on a variety of habitats, every life stage is likely affected by one or more of the identified threats.      Bycatch in U.S. waters is the primary threat faced by all 5 DPSs. At this time, there is an estimate of the number of Atlantic sturgeon captured and killed in sink gillnet and otter trawl fisheries authorized by Federal FMPs (NMFS 2011) in the Northeast Region but there is not a similar estimate for Southeast fisheries. Also, there is not an estimate of the number of Atlantic sturgeon captured or killed in state fisheries. At this time, the effects of other significant threats (e.g., vessel strikes, poor water quality, water availability, dams, and dredging) cannot be quantified in terms of habitat impacts or loss of individuals. While there is some information on the number of mortalities that have occurred in the past in association with certain activities (e.g., mortalities in the Delaware and James rivers that are thought to be due to vessel strikes), those numbers cannot be used to extrapolate effects throughout one or more DPSs. This is because of:(1) the small number of data points and (2) lack of information on the percent of incidences that the observed mortalities represent.
      As noted above, the NEFSC prepared an estimate of the number of encounters of Atlantic sturgeon in fisheries authorized by Northeast FMPs (NEFSC 2011).  The analysis prepared by the NEFSC estimates that from 2006 through 2010 there were 2,250 to 3,862 encounters per year in observed gillnet and trawl fisheries, with an average of 3,118 encounters. Mortality rates in gillnet gear are approximately 20%, with the exception of monkfish gear which has a higher mortality rate of approximately 27%. Mortality rates in otter trawl gear are believed to be lower at approximately 5%.4.4 HABITAT      Modification of the ALWTRP may also affect essential fish habitat (EFH). Under the Magnuson-Stevens Act (MSA) (16 U.S.C. 1801), EFH is defined as “those waters and substrate necessary to fish for spawning, breeding, feeding or growth to maturity” (16 U.S.C. 1802(10)). To help guide regional Fisheries Management Councils (Councils) in the implementation of EFH provisions, regulations developed by the National Marine Fisheries Service encourage Councils to identify Habitat Areas of Particular Concern (HAPCs) (50 CFR 600 Subpart J; 62 FR 66531; 67 FR 2343). HAPCs are subsets of EFH which are rare, particularly susceptible to human- induced degradation, especially ecologically important, or located in an environmentally stressed area. Designated HAPCs are not afforded any additional regulatory protection under the MSA; however, Federal projects with potential adverse impacts to HAPCs must be more carefully scrutinized.This section has three basic objectives:• First, it defines the EFH and HAPCs associated with the Atlantic trap/pot and anchored gillnet fisheries regulated by the ALWTRP.• Second, it describes key components of lobster habitat in detail.• Finally, it discusses how the ALWTRP can influence habitat, with a particular focus on potential disturbances to benthic habitat.4.4.1 Identification of EFH      The 1996 re-authorization of the MSA requires that NMFS and the regional Fisheries Management Councils (Councils) specifically describe and identify EFH. In addition, the MSA requires that FMPs minimize, to the extent practicable, adverse effects on EFH caused by fishing activities. According to the EFH regulations found at 50 CFR 600, information necessary to identify EFH for each managed species includes its geographic range and habitat requirements by life stage; the distribution and characteristics of those habitats; and current and historic stock size as it affects occurrence in available habitats (50 CFR 600.815(a)(1)(ii)(A)). Information on the temporal and spatial distribution of each life history stage is needed to understand each species’ relationship to, or dependence on, its various habitats.
      Atlantic trap/pot and anchored gillnet fisheries are geographically widespread on the Atlantic coast and target a diverse array of fish and shellfish species. In the context of this EIS, EFH includes the habitat for all target species, non-target species, prohibited species, other species, and their prey. Therefore, when viewed in the aggregate, across all species, EFH is all pelagic and benthic habitat in the Atlantic EEZ. It is important to note that corals are currently not listed as EFH in the Northeast. However, they have been included as a component of EFH  for managed species in the region that rely on complex hard bottom habitats where corals and other types of structure-forming organisms are found. Currently, the only deep-water  reef system recognized specifically as EFH in Atlantic waters is the Oculina Banks ivory tree coral reef, located near the 80m depth contour approximately 15 miles off the east-central coast of Florida. The special significance of this area as spawning habitat  for snapper-grouper species has been recognized and resulted in this EFH designation.4.4.2 Identification of HAPCs      The EFH regulations developed by NMFS encourage regional Fisheries Management Councils to identify Habitat Areas of Particular Concern (HAPCs) within areas designated as EFH. The intent of this action is to help focus conservation priorities on specific habitat areas that play a particularly important role in the life cycles of federally managed fish species (Dobrzynski and Johnson, 2001).HAPCs are defined based on the following criteria:• the importance of the ecological function provided by the habitat;• the	extent	to	which	the	habitat	is	sensitive	to	human-induced environmental degradation;• whether and to what extent development activities are or will be stressing the habitat; and• the rarity of the habitat type.      As the implementation of EFH regulations is subject to the discretion of the Councils, the designation of HAPCs has been approached in various ways. The following sections summarize the HAPCs designated by the Councils for EFH in the Atlantic EEZ, as described in “Regional Council Approaches to the Identification and Protection of Habitat Areas of Particular Concern” (Dobrzynski and Johnson, 2001).
4.4.2.1 New England Fishery Management Council (NEFMC) HAPCs      The NEFMC has designated discrete geographic areas as HAPCs for two of its managed species (NEFMC Amendments, 1998): Atlantic cod and Atlantic salmon. These areas are discussed below.Atlantic Cod      For juvenile Atlantic cod, the NEFMC has designated a gravel/cobble bottom area on the northern edge of Georges Bank as an HAPC. This area meets the first criterion for an HAPC of providing an important ecological function, in that the gravel/cobble substrate provides a place for newly settled juvenile cod to find shelter from predation, helping to decrease typically high mortality rates associated with the juvenile life stage. In  addition, these areas are typically rich  in important prey items. This habitat also meets the second HAPC criterion of sensitivity to human-induced environmental degradation, in that it is vulnerable to fishing practices that use mobile fishing gear.Atlantic Salmon      The NEFMC has designated eleven rivers in Maine as HAPCs for juvenile Atlantic salmon: the Dennys, Machias, East Machias, Pleasant, Narraguagus, Ducktrap, Kennebec, Penobscot. St. Croix, Tunk Stream, and Sheepscot Rivers provide habitat for the distinct population segment of Atlantic salmon. These rivers are also extremely vulnerable to anthropogenic threats, thus fulfilling the first two criteria for designation of an HAPC: provision of an important ecological function and sensitivity to human-induced environmental degradation.4.4.2.2 Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council (MAFMC) HAPCs      The MAFMC has designated HAPCs for summer flounder and tilefish. HAPCs have not been designated for other species under the MAFMC's jurisdiction due to a lack of information linking habitat type with recruitment success.Summer Flounder      Aggregations of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), defined as rooted, vascular, flowering plants that, except for some flowering structures, live and grow beneath the surface, have been identified as HAPCs for summer flounder. More specifically, this designation includes all native species of macroalgae, seagrasses, and freshwater and tidal macrophytes in any size bed, as well as loose aggregations used by adults and juveniles. These HAPCs meet the first criterion of an important ecological function, in that they provide both shelter from predators and sources of prey for the juvenile and larval stages of summer flounder (MAFMC 1998).
Tilefish      Clay outcrop (or “pueblo village”) habitats in four submarine canyons on the outer continental shelf at depths between 100 and 300 meters (MAFMC 2008). (This habitat type is also referred to as a “pueblo village” – see Offshore Lobster Habitat, section 4.4.3.2). The four canyons are Norfolk, Veatch, Lydonia, and Oceanographer canyons.  These HAPCs meet three of the criteria required for designation: 1) they provide shelters for tilefish, which live in burrows that they dig in the clay; 2) this habitat type is rare, occurring only in areas on the outer continental shelf like the canyons where Pleistocene clay deposits are exposed; and 3) they are highly susceptible to damage and loss from any type of disturbance, such as that caused by mobile, bottom-tending fishing gear. In addition, these four canyons have been added to the National System of Marine Protected Areas (see Section 12.13).4.4.2.3 	Atlantic Highly Migratory Species (HMS) HAPCs Sandbar Sharks      HAPCs for Atlantic highly migratory species have been identified only for sandbar sharks. A general lack of information detailing HMS-habitat associations has prohibited the designation of HAPCs for other species in this management group. The Fishery Management Plan for Atlantic Tunas, Swordfish, and Sharks (NMFS 1999) has identified HAPCs for sandbar sharks in important nursery and pupping grounds found in shallow areas and the mouth of the Great Bay, NJ; lower and middle Delaware Bay; lower Chesapeake Bay; and near the Outer Banks, NC in areas of Pamlico Sound adjacent to and offshore of Hatteras and Ocracoke Islands. This habitat fulfills the first HAPC criterion of providing an important ecological function.4.4.2.4 South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (SAFMC) HAPCs      Unlike other Councils, the SAFMC has designated HAPCs for all of the species covered under a given fishery management plan (FMP), rather than for individual species. HAPCs have been designated broadly under SAFMC's EFH Comprehensive Amendment (SAFMC, 1998), including both general habitat types and specific areas of ecological importance identified in the appropriate FMP. HAPC criteria are not specified for individual habitats, but the designations  are justified as enabling the Council to effectively protect EFH and take timely action to manage fisheries in HAPCs, when needed. HAPCs have been designated by the SAFMC for species under a number of FMPs, as discussed below.Penaeid Shrimp      HAPCs for penaeid shrimp include all coastal inlets; all state-designated nursery habitats of particular importance to shrimp; and state-identified overwintering areas.
Red Drum      HAPCs identified for red drum include all state-designated nursery habitats of particular importance to red drum; documented sites of spawning aggregations in NC, SC, GA, and FL described in the Habitat Plan; other spawning areas identified in the future; and SAV-identified areas.Snapper-Grouper Management Unit      For the fish species in the snapper-grouper management unit, the SAFMC has identified the following HAPCs: medium to high profile offshore hard bottoms where spawning normally occurs; areas of known or likely spawning aggregations; nearshore hard bottom area; the Point; the Ten Fathom Ledge; Big Rock; the Charleston Bump; mangrove habitat; seagrass habitat; oyster/shell habitat; all coastal inlets; all state-designated nursery habitats of particular importance to snapper/grouper; pelagic and benthic Sargassum; Hoyt Hills for wreckfish; the Oculina Bank Habitat Area of Particular Concern; all hermatypic (involved in reef formation) coral habitats and reefs; Manganese outcroppings on the Blake Plateau; and Council-designated Artificial Reef Special Management Zones (SMZs).Coastal Migratory Pelagic Species      HAPCs for Southeast coastal migratory pelagic species include the sandy shoals of Cape Lookout, Cape Fear, and Cape Hatteras from the shore to the ends of the respective shoals; the Point; the Ten-Fathom Ledge; Big Rock; the Charleston Bump; Hurl Rocks; the Point off Jupiter Inlet; Worm reefs off the central east coast of Florida; nearshore hard bottom south of Cape Canaveral; the Hump off Islamorada, FL,; the Marathon Hump off Marathon, FL; The Wall off the Florida Keys; pelagic Sargassum; and Atlantic coast estuaries with abundant Spanish mackerel and cobia, including Bogue Sound, New River, and Broad River.Spiny Lobster      For spiny lobster, the SAFMC has identified the following HAPCs: Florida Bay; Biscayne Bay; Card Sound; and all coral/hard bottom habitat from Jupiter Inlet, FL through the Dry Tortugas, FL.      The HAPCs designated by the SAFMC include a wide and varying range of habitats. Therefore, more detailed descriptions of some of the prominent HAPCs found in the Southeast region are provided below:
Charleston Bump and Gyre      The coastal region southeast of Charleston, South Carolina is known as the Charleston Bump. In this productive area, the depth of the seafloor rises abruptly from 700 to 300 meters within the short distance of about 20 kilometers. In the same area, the cyclonic Charleston Gyre is a permanent oceanographic feature of the South Atlantic Bight induced by the reflection of rapidly moving Gulf Stream waters. The Charleston Gyre is considered essential nursery habitat for some offshore reef fishes. It produces a large area of upwelling nutrients that contributes significantly to primary and secondary production, and is consequently important to some ichthyoplankton.Ten Fathom Ledge and Big Rock      The Ten Fathom Ledge and Big Rock areas are located south of Cape Lookout, North Carolina. The Ten Fathom Ledge is located at 34o 11’ N and 76o 07’ W in 95 to 120 meter depth on the Continental Shelf in Onslow Bay, North Carolina. This area encompasses numerous  patch reefs of coral-algal-sponge growth on rock outcroppings distributed over 136 square miles of ocean floor. The substrate consists of oolithic calcarenites and coquina forming a thin veneer over the underlying Yorktown formation of silty sands, clays, and calcareous quartz sandstones.      The Big Rock area encompasses 36 square miles of deep drowned reef around the 50 to 100 meter isobath on the outer shelf and upper slope approximately 36 miles south of Cape Lookout. Hard substrates at the Big Rock area are predominately algal limestone and calcareous sandstone.      Unique bottom topography at both sites produces oases of productive bottom relief with diverse and productive epifaunal and algal communities surrounded by a generally monotonous and relatively unproductive sand bottom. Approximately 150 reef-associated species have been documented at the two sites.Shelf Break Area from North Carolina to Florida      The bottom area between 100 and 300 meters deep from Cape Hatteras to Cape Canaveral constitutes essential deep reef fish habitat. Series of troughs and terraces are composed of bioeroded limestone and carconate sandstone (Newton et al., 1971), and exhibit vertical relief ranging from less than half a meter to more than 10 meters. Ledge systems formed by rock outcrops and piles of irregularly sized boulders are common.      Overall, the deep reef fish community probably consists of fewer than 50 species. Parker and Ross (1986) observed 34 species of deepwater reef fishes (representing 17 families) from submersible operations off North Carolina in waters 98 to 152 meters deep.
Gray’s Reef National Marine Sanctuary      Gray's Reef National Marine Sanctuary is located 17.5 nautical miles east of Sapelo Island, Georgia, and 35 nautical miles Northeast of Brunswick, Georgia. Gray's Reef encompasses nearly 32 square kilometers at a depth of about 22 meters (Parker et al., 1994). The Sanctuary contains extensive but patchy hardbottoms of moderate relief (up to two meters).  Rock outcrops, in the form of ledges, are often separated by wide expanses of sand, and are subject to weathering, shifting sediments, and slumping, which create a complex habitat including caves, burrows, troughs, and overhangs (Hunt, 1974). Parker et  al. (1994) described the habitat preference of 66 species of reef fish distributed over five different habitat types. Numbers of species and fish densities were highest on the ledge habitat, intermediate on live bottom, and lowest over sand.Nearshore Hard Bottom of Southeast Florida      The nearshore hard bottom areas extending semi-continuously from Cape Canaveral, FL (28o30' N) to at least Boca Raton, FL (26o 20' N) also meet the HAPC criteria. In terms of ecological function, several studies suggest that nearshore hard bottom reefs may serve as nursery habitat. Many species utilize these habitats during both newly settled and older juvenile life stages, suggesting that nearshore hard bottom can facilitate both inshore and offshore migrations during differing ontogenetic stages of some species. In southeast Florida waters, natural hard bottom areas with substantial three-dimensional structure are lacking. Absence of nursery structure can result in increased predation and lowered growth.Corals and Coral Reefs      Coral is a living substrate that has been defined as a type of HAPC. Coral is a common name for a number of diverse invertebrate species within the phylum Coelenterata. The Alcyonarian soft corals are of interest because they can provide additional structure for habitat and have a potentially long life span. Soft corals can be bush or treelike in shape. Species found in this form attach to hard substrates such as rock outcrops or gravel. These species can range in size from a few millimeters to several meters, and the trunk diameter of large specimens can exceed 10 centimeters. Other Alcyonarians found in this region include sea pens and sea pansies (Order Pennatulacea), which are found in a wider range of substrate types. In their survey of Northeastern U.S. shelf macrobenthic invertebrates, Theroux and Wigley (1998) found Alcyonarians (including soft corals Alcyonium sp., Acanella sp., Paragorgia arborea, Primnoa reseda and sea pens) in limited numbers in waters deeper than 50 meters, and mostly at depths from 200 to 500 meters. Alcyonarians were present in each of the geographic areas identified in the study (Nova Scotia, Gulf of Maine, Southern New England Shelf, Georges Slope, Southern New England Slope) except Georges Bank. However, Paragorgia and Primnoa have been reported in the Northeast Peak region of Georges Bank (Theroux and Grosslein, 1987). Alcyonarians were most abundant by weight in the Gulf of Maine, and by number on the Southern New England Slope (Theroux and Wigley, 1998). Theroux and Wigley (1998) also found stony corals (Astrangia danae and Flabellum sp.) in the Northeast region, but they were uncommon. In similar work on the Mid-Atlantic shelf, the only Alcyonarians encountered were
sea pens (Wigley and Theroux, 1981). The stony coral Astrangia danae was also found, but its distribution and abundance were not discussed, and are assumed to be minimal.      Gorgonian corals are upright, hard coral species. They are colonies of animals composed of individual polyps, which deposit a tree or fanlike skeleton that supports the colony. In the Atlantic EEZ, gorgonian corals, particularly members of the genera Paragoria and Primnoa (red tree coral), may be especially valuable as fish habitat due to their longevity and large size (they can grow up to three meters high and seven meters wide). Some species of gorgonians may live to be over 100 years old (Risk et al., 2001; Andrews et al., 2002). Large Primnoa colonies may be hundreds of years old; a recent study using isotope dating concluded that a five-centimeter specimen of Primnoa reseda from Nova Scotia, Canada, was approximately 500 years old (Risk et al., 1998). The habitat created by these gorgonians may be occupied by communities with  high biodiversity and may provide shelter for fish (Risk et al., 1998; Fossa et al., 1999). Given their size and longevity, gorgonian corals may be especially vulnerable to fishing impacts and may take over 100 years to recover (Andrews et al., 2002). Although scientists have limited understanding of its importance as fish habitat, deep water coral clearly provides vertical structure for fish to use for protection and cover.4.4.3 American Lobster Habitats      The American lobster fishery accounts for the majority of affected vessels and gear regulated by the ALWTRP. Because lobster habitat may be influenced by the proposed ALWTRP modifications, this section examines the unique aspects of lobster habitat in greater detail.      The American lobster (Homarus americanus) is distributed throughout the Northwest Atlantic Ocean from Newfoundland to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. Juvenile and adult American lobsters occupy a wide variety of benthic habitats from the intertidal zone to depths of 700 meters. They are most abundant in relatively shallow coastal waters.      The following description of lobster habitats in the Northeast region of the U.S. (Maine to North Carolina) is based primarily on a report prepared by Lincoln (1998) from a variety of primary source documents. This information has been supplemented by the addition of some more recent research results. Exhibit 4-39 summarizes information on lobster densities  by habitat type.4.4.3.1 Inshore Lobster Habitats      Estuaries represent one key component of inshore lobster habitat, and encompass the following environments:• Mud Base with Burrows: These habitats occur primarily in harbors and quiet estuaries with low currents. Lobster shelters are formed from excavations in soft substrate. This is an important habitat for  juveniles  and densities can be very high, reaching 20 animals per square meter.
• Rock, Cobble and Gravel: Juveniles and adolescents have been reported on shallow bottom with gravel and gravely sand substrates in the Great Bay Estuary, NH; on gravel/cobble substrates in outer Penobscot Bay, ME (Steneck and Wilson, 1998); and in rocky habitats in Narragansett Bay, RI (Lawton and Lavalli, 1985). Densities in Penobscot Bay exceeded 0.5 juveniles and 0.75 adolescents/m2. According to unpublished information cited by Lincoln (1998), juvenile lobsters in Great Bay prefer shallow bottoms with gravely sand substrates.• Rock/Shell: Adult lobsters in the Great Bay Estuary utilize sand and gravel habitats in the channels, but appear to prefer a rock/shell habitat more characteristic of the high temperature, low salinity regimes of the central bay.

      Inshore rock areas make up another important category of lobster habitat. These include the following:• Sand Base with Rock: This is the most common inshore rock type in depths greater than 40 meters. It consists of sandy substrate overlain by flattened rocks, cobbles, and boulders. Lobsters are associated with abundant sponges, Jonah crabs, and rock crabs. Shelters are formed by excavating sand under a rock to form U-shaped, shallow tunnels.  Densities of sub-adult lobsters are fairly high in these areas.• Boulders Overlaying Sand: This habitat type is relatively rare in inshore New England waters. Compared to other inshore rocky habitats, lobster densities are low.• Cobbles: Lobsters occupy shelters of varying size in the spaces between rocks, pebbles, and boulders. Densities as high as 16 lobsters/m2 have been observed, making this the most densely populated inshore rock habitat for lobsters in New England.• Bedrock Base with Rock and Boulder Overlay: This rock type is relatively common inshore, from low tide to depths of 15 to 45 meters. Shelters are formed by rock overhangs or crevices. Encrusting coralline algae and attached organisms such as anemones, sponges, and mollusks cover exposed surfaces. Green sea urchins and starfish are common. Cunner, tautog, sculpin, sea raven, and redfish are the most abundant fish. Lobster densities generally are low.• Mud-Shell/Rock Substrate: This habitat type is usually found where sediment discharge is low and shells make up the majority of the bottom. It is best described off the Rhode Island coast. Lobster densities generally are low.      Other lobster habitat types are significant. For example, kelp beds represent another form of lobster habitat. Kelp beds in New England consist primarily of Laminaria longicruris and L. saccharina. Lobsters were attracted to transplanted kelp beds at a nearshore study site in the mid-coast region of Maine, reaching densities almost ten times higher than in nearby control areas (Bologna and Steneck, 1993). Lobsters did not burrow into the sediment, but sought  shelter beneath the kelp. Only large kelp (greater than 50 cm in length) was observed sheltering lobsters and was used in the transplant experiments.      Lobster shelters also are formed from excavations cut into peat. Reefs form from blocks of salt marsh peat that break and fall into adjacent marsh creeks and channels and appear to provide moderate protection for small lobsters from predators (Barshaw and Lavalli, 1988). Densities are high (up to 5.7/m2) in these areas.      Lobsters have been associated with eelgrass beds in the lower portion of the Great Bay Estuary in New Hampshire (Short et al., 2001). Eighty percent of the lobsters collected from
eelgrass beds were adolescents. Average density was 0.1/m2, higher than reported by Barshaw and Lavalli (1988). In mesocosm experiments, Short et al. reported that lobsters showed a clear preference for eelgrass over bare mud. This research showed that adolescent lobsters burrow in eelgrass beds, utilize eelgrass as an overwintering habitat, and prefer eelgrass to bare mud.      Finally, research in Maine has demonstrated the presence of early settlement, postlarval, and juvenile lobsters in the lower intertidal zone (Cowan, 1999). Two distinct size classes were consistently present: three to 15 mm and 16 to 40 mm. Monthly mean densities during a five- year period ranged from zero to 8.6 individuals/m2 at 0.4 meters below mean low water. Preliminary results indicate that areas of the lower intertidal zone serve as nursery grounds for juvenile lobster.4.4.3.2 Offshore Lobster Habitats      Offshore areas supply several types of lobster habitat. First, more than 15 submarine canyons cut into the shelf edge on the south side of Georges Bank. These canyons were first surveyed in the 1930s, but were not fully explored until manned submersibles were used extensively in the 1980s. Detailed information on canyon habitats for American lobster are available primarily for Oceanographer Canyon, but this information is generally applicable to other major canyons on Georges Bank. Concentrations of adolescents and adult lobsters are substantially greater in submarine canyons than in nearby areas that are occupied mostly by adults (Cooper et al., 1987; Cooper and Uzmann, 1980). These canyons present a diverse group of habitat types:• Canyon Rim and Walls: Sediments consist of sand or semi-consolidated silt with less than five percent overlay of gravel. The bottom is relatively featureless. Burrowing mud anemones are common but lobster densities are low.• Canyon Walls: Sediments consist of gravely sand, sand, or semi- consolidated silt with more than five percent gravel. The bottom is relatively featureless. Burrowing mud anemones are common, as are Jonah crabs, ocean pout, starfish, rosefish, and squirrel hake. Lobster densities are somewhat higher than in substrates that contain less gravel (see above).• Rim and Head of Canyons at Base of Walls: Sand or semi-consolidated silt substrate is overlain by siltstone outcrops and talus up to boulder size. The bottom is very rough and is eroded by animals and current scouring. Lobsters are associated with rock anemones, Jonah crabs, ocean pout, tilefish, starfish, conger eels, and white hake. Densities are highly  variable, but reach as high as 0.13 lobsters/m2.• Pueblo Villages: This habitat type exists in the clay canyon walls and extends from the heads of canyons to middle canyon walls. It is heavily burrowed and excavated. Slopes range from five to 70 degrees, but are
generally between 20 and 50 degrees. Juvenile and adult lobsters and associated fauna create borings up to 1.5 meters in width, one meter in height, and two meters or more in depth. Lobsters are associated with Jonah crabs, tilefish, hermit crabs, ocean pout, starfish, and conger eels. This habitat may well contain the highest densities of lobsters found offshore.      In addition to canyons, lobster are associated with several other offshore habitat types, including the following:• Sand Base with Rocks: Although common inshore (see above), this habitat is rather restricted in the offshore region except along the north flank of Georges Bank.• Clay Base with Burrows and Depressions: This habitat is common on the outer continental shelf and slope. Lobsters excavate burrows up to 1.5 meters long. There are also large, bowl-like depressions that range in size from one to five meters in diameter and may shelter several lobsters at a time. Minimum densities of 0.001 lobsters/m2 have been observed in summer.• Mud-Clay Base with Anemones: This is a common habitat for lobsters on the outer shelf or upper slope. Forests of mud anemones (Cerianthus borealis) may reach densities of three or four per square meter. Depressions serve as shelter for relatively small lobsters at minimum densities of 0.001/m2.• Mud Base with Burrows: This habitat occurs offshore mainly in the deep basins, in depths up to 250 meters. This environment is extremely common offshore. Lobsters occupy this habitat, but no density estimates are available.4.4.4 Impact of Fishing on EFH      The environmental impact analysis presented later in this EIS includes a discussion of how the ALWTRP may affect fishing gear and fishing practices, and subsequently influence marine habitat. Experts believe that fixed fishing gear (pots/traps and anchored gillnets) has a more direct impact on benthic habitat than on non-benthic (water column) habitat because it generally comes in contact with the sea floor. Therefore, the sections below review how fixed- gear fishing can affect habitat, with a primary focus on benthic habitat. The potential effects examined include:• Alteration of physical structure;• Mortality of benthic organisms;• Changes to the benthic community and ecosystem;
• Sediment suspension; and• Chemical modifications.4.4.4.1 Alteration of Physical Structure      Any type of fishing gear that is towed, dragged, or dropped on the seabed will disturb the sediment and the resident community to varying degrees. The intensity of disturbance is dependent on the type of gear, how long the gear is in contact with the bottom, sediment type, sensitivity of habitat features in contact with the gear, and frequency of disturbance. Physical effects of fishing gear, such as ploughing, smoothing of sand ripples, removal of stones, and turning of boulders, can act to reduce the heterogeneity of the sediment surface. For example, boulder piles, crevices, and sand ripples can provide fish and invertebrates hiding areas and a respite from currents and tides. Removal of taxa, such as worm tubes, corals, and gorgonians  that provide relief, and the removal or shredding of submerged vegetation, can also occur, thereby reducing the number of structures available to biota as habitat.      Most studies on habitat damage due to fishing gear focus on the effects of bottom trawls and dredges. It has been noted by Rogers et al. (1998) that the reason there are few accounts of static gear (e.g. traps/pots) having measurable effects on benthic biota may be because the area  of seabed affected by such gear is almost insignificant when compared to the widespread effects of mobile gear. Although there has been relatively little research conducted to document the impacts to physical structure from trap/pot gear, it is possible that benthic structures (both living and non-living) could be affected as traps/pots are dropped or dragged along the bottom. For example, Eno et al. (2001) observed and evaluated the effects of crab and lobster pots/traps on attached epibenthic megafauna (sponges, bryozoans, ascidians, soft corals, and tube worms) at three locations in Great Britain, and conducted three experiments to assess sea pen recovery and survival following dragging, uprooting, and smothering by lobster pots/traps. Sea pens underneath traps/pots were bent over and some were even uprooted when traps/pots were dragged over mud sediments, but they fully recovered within 72 to 144 hours after pots/traps were removed. When traps/pots were dragged over the bottom, they left tracks, but four weeks  of simulated commercial trap/pot fishing had no negative effects on the abundance of attached benthic epifauna. In fact, sponges increased in abundance in the experimental plots. Therefore, the study concluded that the use of pots/traps had no lasting effects on the three different habitat types observed.      Chuenpagdee et al. (2003) compared the effects of different gear types on benthic habitat and also found the physical habitat impacts of traps/pots and bottom gill nets to be moderate.  The biological habitat impacts of these gears were found to be low. Habitat impacts caused by bottom trawls and dredges were considered to be much higher. A similar conclusion  was reached by a panel of experts that evaluated the habitat impacts of commercial fishing gears used in the Northeast region of the U.S. (Maine to North Carolina). Bottom-tending static gear (e.g. traps/pots) was found to have a minimal effect on benthic habitats when compared to the physical and biological impacts caused by bottom trawls and dredges (NMFS 2002f). Furthermore, the vulnerability of benthic EFH for all managed species in the region to the impacts of pots/traps and bottom gill nets is considered to be low (NMFS 2004c).
4.4.4.2 Mortality of Benthic Organisms      In addition to effects on physical habitat, fishing gear can cause direct mortality to emergent epifauna. In particular, erect, foliose fauna or fauna that build reef-like structures have the potential to be destroyed by towed gear, longlines, or traps/pots (Hall, 1999). Physical structure of the biota sometimes determines their ability to withstand and recover from the physical impacts of fishing gear. For example, thinner shelled bi-valves and seastars often suffer higher damage than solid shelled bi-valves (Rumohr and Krost, 1991). Animals that can retract below the penetration depth of the fishing gear and those that are more elastic and can bend upon contact with the gear also fare much better than those that are hard and inflexible (Eno et al., 2001).4.4.4.3 Changes to Benthic Communities and Ecosystems      The mortality of benthic organisms as a result of interaction with fishing gear can alter the structure of the benthic community, potentially causing a shift in the community from low- productive long-lived species (k-selected species) to highly-productive, short-lived, rapidly- colonizing species (r-selected species). For example, motile species that exhibit high fecundity and rapid generation times will recover more quickly from fishery-induced disturbances than non-mobile, slow-growing organisms, which may lead to a community shift in chronically fished areas (Levin, 1984).      Increased fishing pressure in a certain area may also lead to changes in species distribution. Changes (e.g., localized depletion) could be evident in benthic, demersal, and even pelagic species. Scientists have also speculated that mobile fishing may lead to increased populations of opportunistic feeders in chronically fished areas.4.4.4.4 Sediment Suspension      Resuspension of sediment can occur as fishing gear is pulled or dragged along or immediately above the seafloor (NMFS, 2002c). Although resuspension of sediment is typically associated with mobile fishing gear, it also can occur with gear such as traps/pots.      Chronic suspension of sediments and resulting turbidity can affect aquatic habitat by reducing available light for photosynthesis, burying benthic biota, smothering spawning areas, and causing negative effects on feeding and metabolic rates. If it occurs over large areas, resuspension can redistribute sediments, which has implications for nutrient budgets (Messieh et al., 1991; Black and Parry, 1994; Mayer et al., 1991; and Pilskaln et al., 1998).      Species’ reaction to turbidity depends on the particular life history characteristics of the organism. Effects are likely to be more significant in waters that are normally clear as compared to areas that typically experience high naturally induced turbidity (Kaiser, 2000). Mobile organisms can move out of the affected area and quickly return once the turbidity dissipates (Coen, 1995). Even if species experience high mortality within the affected area, those with high levels of recruitment or high mobility can re-populate the affected area rapidly. However, sessile
or slow-moving species would likely be buried and could experience high mortality. Furthermore, if effects are protracted and occur over a large area, recovery through recruitment or immigration will be hampered. Additionally, chronic resuspension of sediments may lead to shifts in species composition by favoring those species that are better suited to recover or those that can take advantage of the additional nutrient supply as the nutrients are released from the seafloor to the euphotic zone (Churchill, 1989).4.4.4.5 Chemical Modifications      Disturbances associated with fishing gear also can cause changes in the chemical composition of the water column overlying affected sediments. In shallow water, the impacts may not be noticeable relative to the mixing effects caused by tidal surges, storm surges, and wave action. However, in deeper, calmer areas with more stable waters, the changes in  chemistry may be more evident (NMFS, 2002c). Increases in ammonia content, decreases in oxygen, and pulses of phosphate have been observed in North Sea waters, although it is not clear how these changes affect fish populations. Increased incidence of phytoplankton blooms could occur during seasons when nutrients are typically low. The increase in primary productivity could have a positive effect on zooplankton communities and on organisms up the food chain.      Eutrophication, often considered a negative effect, could also occur. However, it is important to note that these releases of nutrients to the water act to recycle existing nutrients and, thereby, make them available to benthic organisms rather than add new nutrients to the system (ICES, 1992). This recycling is thought to be less influential in the eutrophication process than the input of new nutrients from rivers and land runoff.

BIOLOGICAL IMPACTS	CHAPTER 5      The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires that an environmental impact statement for a proposed Federal action evaluate the impacts of the action with respect to the human environment, including its biological, economic, and social components. This chapter addresses the first of these dimensions, evaluating the impact of potential modifications to the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan (ALWTRP) on the biological environment.1 Of foremost concern to this evaluation is the direct effect of the potential regulations on the likelihood that North Atlantic right whales, humpback whales, and fin whales − all of which are federally listed endangered species − will be killed or seriously injured as a result of entanglement in commercial fishing gear. It is also necessary, however, to consider whether new regulations could indirectly affect these species by exposing them to different risks or by altering the habitat upon which they depend. In addition, it is important to consider the potential effect that changes in ALWTRP regulations might have on other aspects of the marine environment.      The discussion that follows presents an evaluation of these impacts. It focuses first on  the use of NMFS’ co-occurrence model to help characterize baseline conditions and the impact of alternative management measures (Section 5.1). It then evaluates the direct and indirect  effects of revised ALWTRP regulations on Atlantic large whales, comparing the potential impacts of each of the regulatory alternatives under consideration, including NMFS' preferred alternative (Section 5.2). Finally, the chapter discusses other potential impacts on marine resources − including impacts on other protected species, directed catch, bycatch, and essential fish habitat − and compares the alternatives with respect to these impacts (Section 5.3).2 The chapter is organized as follows:• Section 5.1.1 gives a brief overview of the co-occurrence model;• Section 5.1.2 highlights the key limitations of the model;• Section 5.1.3 describes the results of a recent peer review of the model;1 Chapters 6 and 7 evaluate impacts on the economic and social environment, respectively.           2 In this context, directed catch refers to the catch of species that are the target of commercial fishing effort. Bycatch refers to fish that are harvested but not sold or kept for personal use, including fish that are released because they are not profitable to sell (economic discards) and fish that are released due to catch limits (regulatory discards).
• Section 5.2.1 describes the potential direct and indirect effects of new gear modification and setting requirements on Atlantic large whales;• Section 5.2.2 discusses the potential direct and indirect effects of changes to restricted times and areas on Atlantic large whales;• Section 5.2.3 summarizes and compares the regulatory alternatives' potential impacts on Atlantic large whales;• Section 5.3.1 discusses the potential impacts of the regulatory alternatives on other protected species;• Section 5.3.2 describes the potential impacts of the regulatory alternatives on essential fish habitat;• Section 5.3.3 discusses the potential impacts of the regulatory alternatives on directed catch and bycatch; and• Section 5.3.4 summarizes and compares the potential effects of the regulatory alternatives on marine resources other than Atlantic large whales.5.1 Evaluating Impacts Through the Use of NMFS’ Co-Occurrence Model5.1.1 Overview      NMFS’ evaluation of the impact of potential regulatory changes on whale entanglement risks is largely qualitative. This approach is necessary because models that would enable NMFS to conduct a rigorous quantitative assessment of such risks are currently unavailable; however, efforts to gain a better understanding of the factors that contribute to entanglement risks are underway. In particular, NMFS has invested for a number of years in the development of a model designed to address the following types of questions:• Where and how do the fisheries that are subject to the requirements of the ALWTRP operate?• Where are concentrations of fishing line the greatest?• Do whales frequent areas with high concentrations of fishing line?Through the integration of information on fishing activity and gear configurations, this model characterizes geographic and temporal variations in fishing effort and the distribution of fishing line in waters subject to the ALWTRP. The model also incorporates information on whale sightings per unit of survey effort (SPUE) and identifies areas and times at which whales and commercial fishing gear are likely to co-occur. The model’s final product is a set of indicators that provide information on factors that contribute to the risk of entanglement at various
locations and at different points in time. These indicators, in particular the number of vertical lines in an area and the area’s co-occurrence score, assume to be related to the relative risk of entanglement in different locations. They also provide a basis for comparing the impact of alternative management measures on the potential for entanglements to occur.  Readers interested in additional information on the model’s structure, data, assumptions, and methods should consult its documentation, which is available for review on the ALWTRP website (http://www.nero.noaa.gov/Protected/whaletrp/index.html).      Exhibits 5-1 through 5-3 present maps illustrating the co-occurrence model’s estimate of baseline co-occurrence scores for waters in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and Southeast regions; the areas with the highest scores are those for which the data indicate more frequent sightings of whales and relatively high concentrations of vertical line. The scores shown represent the average for the period specified, based upon monthly data for activity in all fisheries subject to the ALWTRP and sightings of the two species at greatest risk due to interactions with commercial fishing gear: right and humpback whales. Appendix 5-A provides more detailed information, presenting maps of co-occurrence scores on a monthly basis; the ALWTRT used these maps to identify times and locations of high co-occurrence and to guide the development of proposals to reduce the risk of entanglement in particular areas. Implementing the measures specified under Alternatives 2 through 6 (Draft and Preferred) would result in a reduction in the co-occurrence score in these areas.Exhibit 5-1CO-OCCURRENCE OF VERTICAL LINES AND RIGHT/HUMPBACK WHALE SPUE: NORTHEAST REGION – BASELINE ANNUAL AVERAGE

5.1.2 Limitations and Uncertainties      It is important to emphasize that the co-occurrence model does not directly measure entanglement risks. It neither provides a basis for estimating the frequency with which entanglements may occur nor does it provide a basis for estimating the probability that an entanglement will result in a serious injury or death. The risk of serious injury or mortality due  to entanglements is likely to be a function of many factors. For example, the probability that an entanglement will occur may depend on the amount of gear deployed in a particular area, the number of whales that are present, whether the gear is actively tended, the behavior in which a whale is engaged when gear is encountered (e.g., whether the whale is feeding), or other factors. Similarly, the risk of injury or death in the event of an entanglement may depend on the characteristics of the whale involved (species, size, age, health, etc.), the nature of the gear (e.g., whether the gear incorporates weak links designed to help a whale free itself), human intervention (e.g., the feasibility or success of disentanglement efforts), or other variables. The interrelationships among these factors are not fully understood, and the data needed to provide a more complete characterization of risk are not available. If we make the reasonable assumption that the co-occurrence of many whales and many vertical lines produces a greater likelihood of an entanglement then, the co-occurrence model provides relative indicators of the potential for entanglements to occur in different areas and relative indicators of the effect that new regulatory requirements may have on the potential for an entanglement to occur. These indicators do not measure entanglement risks or changes in entanglement risks; however, they provide a relative sense of risks in different areas, as well as insight to the potential impact of alternative regulatory requirements on those risks.      In addition to the limitations noted above, the quality of the information the co- occurrence model provides is constrained by limitations in the data it employs. Because the data that drive the model were derived from disparate sources, including fishing reports, survey data, and expert judgment, it is not possible to quantify the uncertainty in the model’s output. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize several key sources of uncertainty. These include:• Data on fishing activity and gear configurations in state waters vary in specificity and quality. NMFS worked directly with state marine resource officials to develop defensible modeling assumptions for vessels fishing exclusively in state waters. For some states, key activity and gear configuration parameters are estimated based on reporting data (e.g., logbook data) furnished by fishermen in accordance with state requirements. For others, surveys are the primary source of this information. In some cases, these surveys are one-time efforts, while others are administered annually (e.g., recall surveys). Finally, for some states, the characterization of fishing activity is based upon the professional judgment of state fisheries experts. In several cases, the data are taken from a mix of sources (e.g., surveys and best professional judgment).• Federal lobster permits currently impose no trip reporting requirements. Unlike Federal permits for other commercial fisheries, Federal lobster permits do not require their holders to report the location
of fishing activity; as a result, information on the location of trips taken by vessels that hold Federal lobster permits is limited to those that also hold permits for other fisheries (these vessels must report the location of all fishing activity). In the absence of better data, the model assumes that the activity of lobster vessels that are not required to file trip reports is distributed evenly throughout the Lobster Management Areas (LMAs) in which they are permitted to fish. This approach, which is detailed in the model’s formal documentation, is a source of uncertainty, particularly in LMA 1, where the majority of non-reporting vessels operate.• SPUE data provide a limited basis for characterizing the distribution of whales. The model relies on effort normalized (or adjusted) sightings data to characterize the recent historic (past 20 years) distribution of whales within the waters that are subject to the ALWTRP. Effort adjustments did not take into account that sightings data were from many platforms with differing levels of detectability. The dataset is not comprehensive coastwide, adding uncertainty to the analysis of both baseline co-occurrence scores and the impact of alternative management measures. In particular, uncertainty arises from the inclusion of SPUE values in areas with very low survey effort, and the absence of SPUE values (and therefore, co-occurrence values) in areas where effort-adjusted survey data are unavailable. In addition, other sources of  information (e.g., acoustic data) indicate that both right whales and humpback whales may be present in places and at times at which no sightings have been recorded. Thus, the SPUE data are both an incomplete and imprecise indicator of the distribution of whales.• The geographic precision of the model’s presentation of co-occurrence scores may be overstated. Co-occurrence scores were generated from effort adjusted whale sightings information and estimates of vertical line in the water. The co-occurrence scores are assigned on a discrete basis to individual grid cells; this may imply a higher degree of geographic precision in characterizing the potential for an entanglement than the underlying data warrant.The model’s documentation (http://www.nero.noaa.gov/protected/whaletrp/eis2013/index.html) provides additional information on these issues. In light of the limitations noted above, NMFS relies on a qualitative assessment of the impact of alternative management measures on entanglement risks. Evaluation of the impact of different regulatory alternatives on the scores provided by the co-occurrence model is provided as a supplement to this assessment.5.1.3 Peer Review      Before employing the co-occurrence model to assist in evaluating the impact of alternative management measures, NMFS sought a review of the model from the Center for Independent Experts (CIE). Three CIE reviewers with expertise in spatial analysis, scenario
modeling, marine mammal behavior, and fisheries management conducted an independent and impartial review of the model’s documentation. Their findings are available on the ALWTRP website (http://www.nero.noaa.gov/Protected/whaletrp/index.html).      Although each of the peer reviewers noted the need to clarify some aspects of  the model’s documentation, the findings of the review overall were favorable. The reviewers indicated that the treatment of the data currently incorporated into the model was reasonable. They also provided ideas for improving the model as more information becomes available. In particular, the reviewers encouraged NMFS to continue to work with its state partners to improve the quality of the information available on gear use in fisheries subject to the ALWTRP. They also encouraged a more rigorous attempt to evaluate the sensitivity of the model’s findings to the limitations in the SPUE data. In response to the latter concern, NMFS developed an analysis that examines the sensitivity of baseline co-occurrence scores to alternative assumptions about the presence of whales in areas for which SPUE data are not available or may be too limited to be reliable. Appendix 5-B presents the results of this analysis.      In addition to these findings, one reviewer suggested that the co-occurrence model be compared to other approaches or models as a way to attempt to validate the results. The only such model of which NMFS is aware is one being developed by Keene State College, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, New England Aquarium, and the Maine Lobstermen’s Association (MLA). Although the MLA model was not fully vetted through the ALWTRT, its developers have shared information on it with NMFS. The model attempts to estimate the risk of whale encounters (as opposed to co-occurrence) as a function of fishing effort, whale activity, and bathymetry. While this model may be useful in the future, it currently focuses upon conditions in Maine waters and does not provide sufficient geographic coverage to evaluate baseline conditions or the impact of management measures in other areas subject to the ALWTRP. In contrast, NMFS’ co-occurrence model is coastwide in scope and has been vetted through the ALWTRT on numerous occasions; its development has been heavily influenced by Team member’s knowledge.3 In light of these considerations, NMFS did not make use of the MLA model when developing the regulatory alternatives considered in this EIS. It is possible, however, that other stakeholders used their knowledge of this model when submitting management proposals.           3 Since its development began in 2005, the co-occurrence model has undergone numerous updates and revisions, many of which reflect the guidance and assistance of the ALWTRT. The Team’s input on the  methods and data the model employs was sought during a series of presentations provided to the TRT. These presentations also served to provide the Team with regular progress reports on the model’s development. Members of the TRT provided the information the model employs on fishing activity and gear configurations within state waters and also provided updated information on sightings of endangered whales. For a timeline detailing the model development process, including presentations to the TRT, see the model’s formal documentation, which is available for review on the ALWTRP website (http://www.nero.noaa.gov/Protected/whaletrp/index.html).
5.2 Impacts to Atlantic Large Whales      The primary threat that commercial fishing poses to Atlantic large whales is the risk of incidental entanglement in commercial fishing gear. As noted in Chapter 2, such entanglement can cause serious injury or death. The regulatory changes under consideration are designed to reduce harm to large whales by reducing the likelihood of entanglement and/or reducing the severity of an entanglement should one occur. NMFS seeks to achieve these objectives through  a combination of two general measures:• gear modification and setting requirements; and• restrictions on fishing activity at specified locations and times.The discussion below examines the impact of these measures on whale entanglement risks, beginning with an evaluation of specific gear modification requirements and then turning to an assessment of other restrictions.4 It is important to note that the No Action Alternative (Alternative 1) would not achieve the objectives listed above. If Alternative 1 were chosen, there would likely be additional incidents of serious injury and mortality to large whales due to entanglement in commercial fishing gear, rather than a reduction in these interactions. With no action, we would continue to have similar numbers of lethal and non-lethal takes of right and humpback whales in violation of both the MMPA and ESA.5.2.1 Impacts of Gear Modification Requirements      The gear modification requirements under consideration fall generally into four categories: buoy line requirements, weak link and breaking strength requirements, set  restrictions and gear marking requirements. The discussion below examines the impact of each of these measures on whale entanglement risks.55.2.1.1 Buoy Line Requirements      Like groundline, buoy line (i.e., line that is directly connected from a flotation device to gillnet or trap/pot gear) has been identified as a potential entanglement threat to Atlantic large whales.6 Exhibit 5-4 provides an estimate of the average number of buoy lines deployed by fisheries subject to the ALWTRP in any given month. The majority of the lines are found in the           4 The ALWTRP is designed to reduce the risk of serious injury and mortality of strategic stocks of North Atlantic right, humpback, and fin whales as a result of interactions with commercial fishing gear. Although it is not listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act, the minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) is protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. Due to similarities in distribution, feeding behavior, and other characteristics, minke whales are believed to benefit from ALWTRP measures in much the same manner as  the species the plan is designed to protect. Thus, the discussion of impacts to Atlantic large whales applies to minke whales as well as to North Atlantic right whales, humpback whales, and fin whales.           5 For additional detail on which gear requirements apply to which vessels under existing regulations (i.e., Alternative 1, No Action), see Chapter 2. For similar details regarding Alternatives 2 through 6(Draft and Preferred), see Chapter 3.6 "Endline" and “vertical line” are alternative terms for buoy line.
Northeast, specifically within the lobster trap/pot industry. The buoy line requirements only impact trap/pot gear. The decision to focus on trap/pot gear is explained in Chapter 3.Exhibit 5-4NUMBER OF VERTICAL LINES DEPLOYED BY FISHERIES SUBJECT TO THE ALWTRP: MONTHLY AVERAGEGEAR TYPECOASTWIDENORTHEASTLobster Trap/Pot224,457220,330Other Trap/Pot7,9055,630Gillnet1,501615      Alternatives 2 through 6 (Draft and Preferred) incorporate several provisions pertaining to buoy lines that may reduce the frequency or severity of whale entanglements relative to Alternative 1. These provisions restrict the number of trap/pot buoy lines that fishermen can employ, based on the area in which they fish and the distance to shore. Under Alternative 1, the amount of vertical line in the water would remain unchanged, and the potential for  entanglements would not be reduced. Alternatives 2 through 6 (Draft and Preferred) require some minimum number of traps per trawl and prohibit the use of singles in the Northeast region; these provisions would result in a decrease in the number of vertical lines in the water. Alternative 6 (Preferred) requirements differ slightly from Alternative 6 (Draft). As a result of public comment in some waters those fishing closer to shore or around islands can continue to fish using traditional practices. Alternatives 2 through 6 (Draft and Preferred) also propose to require a maximum breaking strength of vertical line in the Southeast region as well as keeping this vertical line free from objects. The following discussion examines the potential direct and indirect effects of these provisions.Direct effects:      As an additional measure of protection, the alternatives analyzed would in several cases institute restrictions designed to reduce the number of buoy lines that fishermen employ. For example, Alternatives 2 through 6 (Draft and Preferred) would limit the number of lines in the Northeast by prohibiting single traps/pots and requiring fishermen to increase the number of traps per trawl set based on area and distance to shore. In some areas (mainly inshore and nearshore waters), this may represent a change from how they currently fish. In Federal waters and offshore, larger trawls are currently fished so this requirement may not affect these vessels to the same extent as smaller inshore vessels. The current requirement of one endline for trawls less than or equal to five traps remains in place. Due to safety concerns and the potential to increase the risk of gear loss, larger trawls would not be required to have one endline.      In an average month, roughly 227,000 total trap/pot vertical lines are deployed in the Northeast. The restrictions on the number of buoy lines in the Northeast region when combined with other restrictions (closures) would result in estimated reductions of 30 to 38% of endlines depending on the Alternative (Exhibit 5-5). The difference in the requirements in Alternative 6 (Preferred) does not result in a substantial change from what was previously analyzed in Alternative 6 (Draft) as evident in Exhibit 5-5. This reduction in vertical lines results in a
reduction of the potential risk of entanglement through reducing the likelihood that whales and gear would co-occur in the same area at the same time. This reduction is depicted in the reduction of co-occurrence score of roughly 36 to 42% depending on the Alternative (Exhibit 5- 6). All measures combined would result in a 29 to 36% reduction coastwide and a 36 to 42% reduction in co-occurrence coastwide. NMFS believes the requirement to ‘trawl up’ would result in a decrease in the risk of entanglement to large whales.Exhibit 5-5ANNUAL REDUCTION IN NUMBER OF VERTICAL LINES COMPARED TO NO ACTIONALTERNATIVECOASTWIDE*COASTWIDE**NORTHEAST*NORTHEAST**235.3%--36.7%--329.7%29.6%30.9%30.8%436.5%35.4%38%36.8%531%29.7%32.1%30.9%6 (Draft)29.1%28.5%30.3%29.6%6 (Preferred)29%28.3%30.1%29.5%* Assumes 100% suspension of fishing in closure areas** Assumes displacement from closure areasExhibit 5-6ANNUAL REDUCTION IN CO-OCCURRENCE COMPARED TO NO ACTIONALTERNATIVECOASTWIDE*COASTWIDE**NORTHEAST*NORTHEAST**235.8%--36.1%--337.4%37.2%37.7%37.4%440.5%38.7%40.8%39%541.7%39.7%42%40%6 (Draft)38%37.4%38.2%37.7%6 (Preferred)37.9%37.4%38.2%37.7%* Assumes 100% suspension of fishing in closure areas** Assumes displacement from closure areas      In the Southeast, Alternatives 2-6 (Draft and Preferred) would require a restriction on the breaking strength of buoylines depending on where you fish. In Florida state waters, the breaking strength of line may be no more than 1,500 lbs. In Georgia and South Carolina, the breaking strength of line may be no more than 2,200 lbs.      Knowlton et al. (2011) reported that age plays a role in a right whale’s ability to break free of rope and that adults may be better able to break free from ropes of lower breaking strength than ropes of greater breaking strength. ALWTRT members broadly supported a maximum rope breaking strength of 1,500 pounds in the Florida blue crab fishery provided the rope currently used by the fishery in Northeast Florida (No. 8 Osprey line) is tested and does not
exceed a 1,500 pound breaking strength. NMFS tested No. 8 Osprey line and found it to have less than 1,500 pound breaking strength7.      Through scoping meetings and state fishery representatives, NMFS learned that most fishermen in Georgia and South Carolina use No. 8 or No. 10 Osprey line as vertical lines in their blue crab trap/pot gear configurations. NMFS tested No. 10 Osprey line and found it to have less than 2,200 pound breaking strength. Although the ALWTRT did not consider a maximum breaking strength for vertical lines off GA or SC, NMFS believes that the combination of limited right whale occurrence in GA and SC state waters and the proposed 2,200 pound breaking strength requirement will sufficiently protect right whales because there is a low probability of interaction between whales and gear and this measure prevents the use of vertical lines with greater breaking strength. Therefore, requiring 1,500 lbs and 2,200 lbs of breaking strength line off Northeast Florida and Georgia/South Carolina, respectively, will likely protect right whales while not impacting blue crab fishermen who have traditionally fished in these areas.      Also in the Southeast, all buoy lines must be made from sinking line, free of objects, and single trap/pots would be required. This differs from what is proposed in the Northeast to account for differences in right whale life history stage and environmental factors between the two regions.      The core right whale calving area located within the Southeast U.S. is of particular conservation concern due to the presence of neophyte calves and reproducing females. Small neonate calves are weak swimmers and lack physical and behavioral developments that increase buoyancy (Thomas and Taber 1984) – all traits that likely contribute to a whale’s ability to survive an interaction with fishery gear. Reproducing females are the most valuable  demographic unit of the right whale population. Right whale mother/calf pairs meander about in the Southeast U.S. for several weeks, resulting in increased exposure to potential fishing gear. These observations are supported by FWC/FWRI aerial survey data (FWC/FWRI 2012). In contrast, NMFS’ understanding is that most right whales use the Mid-Atlantic as a migratory corridor. That is, whales travel through the area, but likely do not linger for weeks or months at  a time like they do in other habitats. For example, models developed by Schick et al. (2009) suggest an average time of 21-24 days for right whales to travel from Jacksonville, Florida to Long Island, New York (approximate linear distance of 900 miles). Trawls are heavier, and gear configurations are more complex than single traps. Consequently, neophyte calves would be more likely to survive an interaction with a single trap than with a trawl which is made up of multiple traps.      An increase in blue crab fishing efforts was observed in Northeast Florida state waters during the 2011/2012 calving season (FWC unpub. data). Gear was inspected and found to be rigged in various and unusual ways including: weights placed mid-line, floats placed mid-line (likely to comply with line marking requirements), and other various configurations (knots, splices, various lengths tied together, etc.) of polypropylene line. Many of the rigging configurations had not been observed or anticipated previously. Line through the mouth of a baleen whale is thought to be one of the more frequent forms of entanglement (Knowlton &7 Personal Communication, John Kenney, NOAA Fisheries, NERO, May-July 2012.
Kraus 2001). Gear that is splice-free, knot-free, and/or free of attachments may be more likely to slide through the whale’s baleen freeing the animal rather than become lodged in the mouth or elsewhere creating a serious injury or mortality risk. In contrast, line that is knotted or has attachments can more easily entangle as well as increase the complexity of the entanglement, and thus, decreasing the likelihood that the whale can free itself. NMFS believes the proposed requirement of fishing with one continuous piece of line will reduce risk to right whales by eliminating configurations that clutter the vertical line with objects that may impede the line from sliding through small spaces between a whale’s baleen.Indirect effects:      The indirect effects of the requirements described above depend upon whether they would result in an increase in gear loss, with a resulting increase in the risk that whales may become entangled in ghost gear. In 2012, Maine DMR developed and implemented a project designed, in part, to assess the impacts of longer trawls on catch in the lobster fishery. Maine DMR asked participants to record whether they lost gear while hauling. Overall, the sample of gear loss incidents in the project is too small to draw reliable conclusions about how trawling influences gear loss. In 2010 and 2011, the Massachusetts DMF completed a comprehensive study of gear loss and “ghost” fishing (i.e., impacts from lost or derelict gear). Overall, these  data indicate that rather than exacerbating gear loss, trawling requirements may reduce the amount of gear lost and thereby yield an economic benefit to affected fishermen. It is unclear whether the buoy line restrictions described above would lead to an overall increase in gear loss. Available data assessing how trawling requirements could affect gear loss are inconclusive. These changes could help to reduce the potential for whales to become entangled in lost gear.5.2.1.2 Weak Link Requirements      The ALWTRP requires the use of weak links with breaking strengths of 600 to 1,500 lbs depending on management area. Compared to Alternative 1 (No Action), Alternatives 2-6 (Draft and Preferred) propose to decrease the required breaking strength of weak links in Florida state waters. This would reduce the likelihood that interactions between whales and commercial fishing gear will result in entanglements that cause serious injury or mortality. Alternative 1 would maintain the status quo, and the potential for entanglements to result in serious injury and mortality would not be decreased. There is no difference in requirements from Alternative 6 (Draft) and Alternative 6 (Preferred). The following discussion further explores the potential direct and indirect effects of these standards.Direct effects:      Weak link requirements are designed to reduce the number of interactions between whales  and  commercial  fishing  gear  that  result  in  a  serious  entanglement.8    Currently, the           8 NMFS has worked with several gear manufacturers to develop weak links for the lobster trap/pot and gillnet fisheries (NMFS, 2002). The specifications of breaking strengths incorporated in Alternatives 2 through 6 (Draft  and  Preferred)  are  based  upon data  collected  by the  NMFA Gear  Research Team that  measured  the loads
breaking strength of weak links in Florida state waters is 600 lbs. Alternatives 2-6 (Draft and Preferred) propose to reduce this breaking strength requirement to 200 lbs.      As previously noted, buoy lines have been identified as a source of entanglement risk. The requirement to weaken the strength of weak links in buoy lines is specifically designed to reduce entanglements and serious injury due to entanglements in and around the mouth as a result of interactions with buoy lines and surface systems. In such a case, the theory of operation is that the forward motion of the whale will pull the buoy line through the whale's mouth until the buoy and weak link impinge against the baleen. At this point, the combination of the whale's momentum and the weight of the gear on the lower end of the buoy line or drag created by towing gear will cause the load to increase until the weak link parts, allowing the buoy and weak link to detach from the line and remain outside the whale's mouth. The bitter end of the buoy  line would then continue to be pulled through the baleen until it exits the whale's  mouth.  Adding a weak link on all devices attached to the buoy line increases the likelihood that a line sliding through a whale's mouth will break away quickly at the buoy before the whale begins to thrash and become more entangled.9      Right whale mother/calf pairs in the calving area are most often sighted in water depths of 10 to 20 m (Keller et al. 2012). The greatest co-occurrence of trap/pot gear and right whales occurs off the Northeast Florida shoreline. Florida state waters are deeper and can be greater  than 10 m deep within 1/3 of a mile off the beach, whereas Georgia and South Carolina state oceanic waters are generally less than 10 m deep (please reference NOAA nautical charts). Therefore, neophyte calf and reproducing female interactions with trap pot gear are a greater risk in Florida state waters than in Georgia or South Carolina state waters.      Requiring weak links in Florida state waters of the Southeast U.S. Restricted Area North is a measure designed to help mitigate the risk in an area where there is a high co-occurrence of right whales and blue crab trap/pot gear. The blue crab fishery is the primary commercial trap/pot fishery active in Florida state waters of the Southeast U.S. Restricted Area North. Weak links with less than 600 lb breaking strength are already used by Northeast Florida blue crab fishermen (August 23, 2011 Scoping Meeting Comments, Jacksonville, FL). The ALWTRT broadly supported 100 pound weak link breaking strength for the blue crab fishery off Florida, pending results of breaking strength tests of weak links currently used by the fishery (2012 ALWTRT Meeting Key Outcomes Memorandum). Breaking strength tests of weak link rigs that could be used in North Florida revealed breaking strength to be between 131.5 lbs to 167.6 lbs.10 Based on these tests, NMFS is proposing weak links with 200 lb breaking strength for Florida state waters. Although this measure primarily affects blue crab fishermen, it will be applied to  all affected ALWTRT trap/pot fisheries in the Florida state waters of the Southeast U.S.exerted on buoy systems. This data was collected over the course of several years of at-sea testing from Maine to North Carolina in both inshore and offshore fisheries.           9 There have been three documented entanglement cases in which the gear recovered included weak links attached to buoys. This includes two events (one in 2002, the other in 2003) in which weak links were recovered  that had not released. In both of these cases the buoy line wrapped around the whale's tail stock, a situation that the weak link in the line was not designed to address. A third event involved a weak link placed directly under the surface system. In this case, the weak link did release, allowing the whale to swim free of the anchoring gear. A disentanglement team later removed the gear that remained with the whale.10 Personal Communication, John Kenney, NOAA Fisheries, NERO, August 2012.
Restricted Area North. This allows for enforceability ease because it eliminates potential confusion of differentiating between blue crab trap/pot gear and Atlantic mixed species trap/pot gear.Indirect effects:      Gear research indicates that the installation of weak links is unlikely to increase the rate of gear loss, and thus, is unlikely to increase the risk that whales could become entangled in ghost gear. Several weak link requirements have been implemented under previous ALWTRP initiatives, and the NMFS Gear Research Team reports that they have received few comments regarding problems with the failure of any of these devices. The NMFS Gear Research Team  has conducted a series of research projects that measured the loads exerted on buoy systems when used in typical conditions at different locations (NMFS, 2002; NMFS, 2003). 115.2.1.3 Set Restrictions Requirements      The potential regulatory changes resulting from Alternatives 2 through 6 (Draft and Preferred) include the requirement to haul trap/pot gear at the end of every trip in Federal waters within the Southeast Restricted Area North management area. Currently, the requirement is to haul gear once every 30 days. Under Alternative 1 (No Action), this 30 day requirement would remain in place, and there would not be a reduction of soak time that may result in a reduced risk of entanglement.Direct effects:      The provisions noted above would contribute directly to the protection of Atlantic large whales. The restrictions are designed to reduce the risk of entanglement of large whales via reduced soak time for long soaking gear.      In Federal waters, the current status quo for black sea bass fishermen is to drop single pots near underground relief habitat and then retrieve them by the trips’ end (typically within less than 24 hours)12. Furthermore, Southern black sea bass fishermen have not fished during the November through April time period since December 2009.           11 In addition to the information provided above, the NMFS Gear Research Team notes the possibility that the use of weak links could reduce the amount of gear that is lost due to gear conflicts. For example, if snagged gear parts at a weak link, it is less likely to be dragged away from where it was originally set; this increases the chance that the gear will be recovered. This observation is supported by the experience of several Maine fishermen, who have reported that weak links on buoy systems allowed buoys to pop off when trawlers towed through their gear. Although weak links were not designed for such purposes, the fishermen involved believe that their presence in this case prevented their gear from being towed away and permanently lost. In these situations, the fishermen were able to recover all of their gear and avoid the creation of additional ghost gear.12 As defined in SAFMC South Atlantic Snapper Grouper Amendment 18A.
      These changes would in large part codify current fishing practices. Nonetheless, this requirement could help to reduce entanglement risks, both by ensuring that current practices are adhered to and by guaranteeing that these practices do not change.Indirect effects:      Any indirect effects associated with the above-noted restrictions are likely to be positive. In particular, because the restrictions prohibit affected fishermen from leaving their gear unattended while their vessels return to port, the restrictions may reduce gear loss, and thus, benefit large whales by reducing the risk of entanglement in ghost gear.5.2.1.4 Gear Marking      With the exception of Alternative 1 (No Action), all of the regulatory alternatives under consideration would establish new gear marking requirements. Alternatives 2 through 6 (Draft) include a common gear marking scheme that would result in the incorporation of approximately1.1 million new marks into the gear subject to ALWTRP regulations. Alternative 6 (Preferred) would require approximately 393,000 new marks.      The gear marking provisions are designed to improve NMFS' ability to identify the gear involved in an entanglement. As discussed below, these provisions would have no immediate direct impact on entanglement risks. In the long run, however, they may help NMFS to target  and improve its efforts to protect large whales.Direct effects:      When compared to Alternative 1 (No Action), Alternatives 2 through 6 (Draft and Preferred) would strengthen most of the ALWTRP's current gear marking requirements. Currently the marking system only requires one mark. In place of the current standards, gillnet, lobster trap/pot, and other trap/pot vessels would be required to identify buoy lines with a mark equal to 12” in length and buoy lines must be marked three times (top, middle, bottom). This would result in larger and more frequent marks when compared to the No Action alternative. The No Action alternative would continue a gear marking system that is currently insufficient for identifying the origins of gear. A mark distinguishing state from Federal waters within the Southeast Restricted Area North would be also required. The remainder of the color schemes for the gear marking strategy would remain the same.      The regulatory provisions described above would have neither direct impact on the probability of whales becoming entangled in commercial fishing gear nor would they affect the severity of an entanglement should one occur. As noted below, however, potential changes in gear marking requirements could have an indirect effect on whale entanglement risks.
Indirect effects:      A critical issue in understanding the nature of large whale entanglements is obtaining information about the gear involved. Currently, gear removal from entangled animals provides the only reliable information about the nature of entanglements (Johnson et al., 2005). However, it is often difficult to connect the gear in which a whale is entangled with a particular fishery, because entangled whales often carry only a portion of the gear they have encountered and disentanglement efforts sometimes recover only some of the remaining gear. The gear marking requirements under consideration would help to generate information on the nature of the gear involved in an entanglement. In addition, these provisions would in some cases allow NMFS to identify the owner of the gear, and thus, allow the agency to gather additional information on where, when, and how the gear was set. By increasing scientific understanding of the nature of large whale entanglements, gear marking measures would allow NMFS, over time, to improve the effectiveness of the ALWTRP. Thus, these measures are expected to contribute indirectly to the preservation and restoration of whale stocks.      The ALWTRP's current gear marking requirements provide for a single four-inch mark on buoy lines midway in the water column. The bigger, more frequent marks would increase the chances of identifying fragments of line that may be visible on or recovered from an entangled whale.5.2.2 Impacts from Changes to Restricted Times and Areas      In addition to gear modification requirements, the potential changes to the ALWTRP include a range of restrictions on the location and timing of fishing activity. The discussion below addresses the direct and indirect effects of the following provisions:• Seasonal closures• Addition of exempted waters in New Hampshire and buffers in Maine5.2.2.1 Seasonal Closures      Alternative 1 (No Action) and Alternative 2 do not propose additional closures and would instead maintain the status quo. Currently, two areas are closed to gillnet fishing, and one area is closed to trap/pot fishing. Maintaining the status quo would not result in a reduced risk of entanglement as the number of vertical lines in the water would remain the same. Alternatives 3- 6 (Draft and Preferred) propose anywhere from 1 to 3 new closures. The proposed closures would affect all trap/pot gear. Alternative 3 proposes a closure in the Cape Cod Bay Restricted Area. Currently, this area is closed to gillnet fishing from January 1 to May 15. The proposed closure would include trap/pots from February 1 to April 30. Alternatives 4 and 5 replace the CCB closure proposed in Alternative 3 with a larger closure area that encompasses the Outer Cape and extends to the Great South Channel (Massachusetts Restricted Area #1). This closure would be in place from January 1 to April 30. Alternatives 4 and 5 close Massachusetts Restricted Area #1 and also include a seasonal closure of both Jeffreys Ledge and Jordan Basin.
Alternative 6 (Draft and Preferred) both propose a closure of Cape Cod Bay and the Outer Cape (Massachusetts Restricted Area #2) from January 1 to April 30.Direct effects:      The effects of each closure vary, yet all would benefit whales. In some cases, however, the impacts of a closure are likely minor. The level of fishing effort varies as does the number of vessels affected by the closure. Closures were analyzed two ways. First, it was assumed that 100% of the vessels would suspend fishing (Exhibit 5-7). Second, it was assumed that some of the vessels would continue to fish (Exhibit 5-8). The true effect of these closures is most likely within the range of these two options.Exhibit 5-7EFFECTS OF SEASONAL CLOSURES COMPARED TO NO ACTION(Presuming 100% Suspend Fishing)ALTERNATIVECLOSURETIME PERIOD   AVG # OFAFFECTED FTE VESSELSAVG # OF LINES REMOVED3CCB Restricted AreaFeb. 1 - April 30168414 and 5Jeffreys LedgeOct. 1 - Jan. 316915,262Jordan BasinNov.1 - Jan.315MassachusettsRestricted Area #1Jan. 1 - April 301106 (Draft)MassachusettsRestricted Area #2Jan. 1 - April 301096,3296 (Preferred)  Massachusetts Restricted Area #2Jan. 1 - April 301096,329Exhibit 5-8EFFECTS OF SEASONAL CLOSURES COMPARED TO NO ACTION(Presuming Some Relocation)ALTERNATIVECLOSURETIME PERIOD% OF VESSELSTHAT WOULD RELOCATEAVG # OF LINES REMOVED3CCB Restricted AreaFeb. 1 - April 3089.61344 and 5Jeffreys LedgeOct. 1 - Jan. 311006,627 – 7,107Jordan BasinNov.1 - Jan.31100MassachusettsRestricted Area #1Jan. 1 - April 3084.26 (Draft)MassachusettsRestricted Area #2Jan. 1 - April 3084.11,9106 (Preferred)  Massachusetts Restricted Area #2Jan. 1 - April 3084.11,910
      The multiple closures proposed in the Alternative 4 and 5 result in the biggest conservation benefit to large whales. The percent change in co-occurrence (Exhibit 5-9 and 5-10) varies by alternative based on the number of closures in the alternative and if you assume displacement or suspension of fishing. In both cases, the closures and the proposed management measures under Alternative 5 result in the highest reduction in co-occurrence or risk of entanglement.Exhibit 5-9ANNUAL REDUCTION IN CO-OCCURRENCE COMPARED TO NO ACTION(Presuming 100% Suspension)ALTERNATIVECOASTWIDENORTHEAST337.4%37.7%440.5%40.8%541.7%42%6 (Draft)38%38.2%6 (Preferred)37.9%38.2%Exhibit 5-10ANNUAL REDUCTION IN CO-OCCURRENCE COMPARED TO NO ACTION(Presuming Some Relocation)ALTERNATIVECOASTWIDENORTHEAST337.2%37.4%438.7%39%539.7%40%6 (Draft)37.4%37.7%6 (Preferred)37.4%37.7%Indirect effects:      The provisions noted above could have indirect beneficial effects on large whales by tempering the possible expansion of trap/pot fisheries. Any vessels entering into these fisheries would be subject to the seasonal closure of the restricted areas. The closures could have negative indirect benefits if effort is relocated just outside the closure area. This relocated effort may result in a wall of fishing gear, which would increase risk of entanglement in the area directly adjacent to the closed areas.
5.2.2.2 Addition of Exempted Waters and Buffers      The ALWTRP currently exempts certain bays, harbors, inlets, and other coastal waters from the provisions of the plan (see Chapter 2). Alternative 6 (Preferred) would expand these areas to include an exemption from the minimum number of traps per trawl in New Hampshire state waters this differs from what was proposed under Alternative 6 (Draft). Alternative 6 (Draft) proposed to exempt New Hampshire state waters from all requirements in the ALWTRP. Alternative 6 (Preferred) would not relax current requirements. NMFS would continue to monitor all exempted areas and encourage New Hampshire to develop contingency plans in the event a large whale is sighted in state waters. New Hampshire has a coastline of eleven nautical miles which, because of state seaward boundaries narrows to less than eight nautical miles at its narrowest point. Located approximately seven miles off the New Hampshire seacoast are the Isles of Shoals. The majority of these islands are located in Maine state waters. New Hampshire has four harbors, one being a deep water port shared with Maine, which are all currently exempted waters. This potential change has been developed in response to a request from the New Hampshire state fishery management agency and is designed to ensure that the ALWTRP does not unnecessarily extend commercial fishing regulations to waters in which endangered or protected whales are at low risk from impacts due to entanglement (e.g. areas where large whales are not present). Those fishing in New Hampshire state waters would still be required to abide by all current requirements.      Alternative 6 (Preferred) would also establish quarter-mile buffer areas around three Maine islands: Matinicus Island, Ragged Island (located adjacent to Matinicus), and Monhegan Island. Vessels fishing in these areas would not be subject to minimum trawl length requirements. The rationale for the buffers, described further in Chapter 3, focuses on the likely absence of whales in close proximity to these islands and bottom conditions that favor the use of single traps. There is no buffer are proposed in any of the other Alternatives.Direct effects:      The co-occurrence model does not indicate any monthly co-occurrence concerns with the exception of November within nearshore state waters. Other studies on right whale distribution (see Asaro, 2012) show right whales sightings near the shoreline, albeit not spatially or temporally co-occurring with fishing gear. During the month of November, effort within state waters is already being reduced due to part-time and limited commercial harvesters seasonally removing gear from state waters and Federal/state commercial and limited commercial  harvesters are moving to Federal waters. The State of New Hampshire has already been very active in reducing the gear entanglement risk of large whales through current and past regulations and current fishing practices. The majority of the commercial fishing industry  already practices multiple trap trawls with an average of 10 traps per trawl for commercial licensees, 6 trap trawls for limited commercial licensees, and 3 trap trawls for part time commercial licensees. The seasonality of the lobster fishery, which accounts for the largest number of vertical lines in state waters, is such that when large whales are present in state waters (according to the co-occurrence model) the number of vertical lines are diminishing as recreational, part-time commercial and limited commercial lobster harvesters are pulling gear out of the water for the winter season.
      Those familiar with the Maine islands note that the quantity of gear likely to be set within the buffer areas is small. Experts at the Island Institute, a non-profit organization devoted to protecting Maine’s remote island and coastal communities, indicate that only five to 10 lobstermen work the waters around Monhegan.13 Likewise, only about 10 to 15 lobstermen fish the waters surrounding Matinicus and Ragged Islands.  Those fishing closest to the islands  (many of whom are nearing retirement or are young entrants learning the trade) tend to use smaller vessels and fewer traps, further reducing the quantity of gear in the water.14      These areas that would not be required to abide by the minimum number of traps per trawl requirement is an area in which whales are unlikely to be found, as suggested both by NMFS' review of the data and its current understanding of whale behavior, as well an area where whales are at low risk from impacts due to entanglement. Therefore, exempting this area from the minimum number of traps per trawl regulations is believed to be unlikely to have significant direct effects on endangered or protected whales.Indirect effects:      Exempting certain areas from the minimum number of traps per trawl requirement may encourage some fishermen to shift their activity to those areas. If this were to result  in a  decrease in fishing activity in areas that whales are more likely to frequent, it would help to reduce entanglement risks.15      Improved targeting of ALWTRP regulations might also increase support for their implementation within the commercial fishing community. Fishermen are more likely to comply with restrictions on their operations when they understand that those restrictions serve a beneficial purpose. Requiring fishermen to comply with ALWTRP requirements where whales are unlikely to be encountered, can undermine belief in the need for the requirements and may ultimately undermine compliance with the plan in other areas. To the extent that the designation of exempted areas makes clear that ALWTRP regulations are designed to apply where entanglement risks are low, it may foster improved compliance, and thus indirectly assist in preserving and restoring endangered or protected whale species.5.2.3 Comparison of Biological Impacts Across Regulatory Alternatives      The biological impacts described in the previous section vary across the regulatory alternatives. This section compares the direct and indirect biological impacts of each alternative. Where sufficient information is available, the alternatives are compared using quantitative criteria. The discussion is divided into two parts:13 Personal communication with Nick Battista, Marine Programs Director, Island Institute, November 25, 2013. 14 The waters around Monhegan Island are governed by a conservation agreement established by the Maine Department of Marine Resources and the Maine Legislature. The agreement limits fishing to 250 days from October to June and allows a maximum of 400 traps per vessel. Personal communication with Erin Summers, Maine Department of Marine Resources, January 13, 2014.           15 It is also possible that fishermen who modify their gear to comply with ALWTRP requirements would use the same gear in exempted areas. To the extent this occurred, whales would experience a greater degree ofprotection than the regulations require.
• First, it describes the criteria used to compare the direct and indirect impacts of each regulatory provision;• Second, it compares the direct and indirect impacts across regulatory alternatives.5.2.3.1 Comparison Criteria      As previously noted, the discussion of the biological impacts of new ALWTRP requirements on whale entanglement risks is largely qualitative. This approach is necessary because models that would enable NMFS to conduct a rigorous quantitative assessment of such risks are currently unavailable. In some instances, however, it is possible to develop quantitative indicators of the impact of alternative regulations by using change in vertical lines and co- occurrence as proxies as indicators of risk of entanglement.      Exhibit 5-11 summarizes the quantitative indicators developed to compare the biological impacts of the regulatory alternatives under consideration. As the exhibit shows, most of the indicators reflect changes in the number of vessels subject to ALWTRP requirements, changes in the number of vertical lines in the water or changes in co-occurrence score. These indicators do not measure biological changes in entanglement risks, but offer useful information on factors that likely, based on expert opinion, correlate with such risks.      The list of quantitative indicators does not address the impacts of the following provisions:• changes to exempted watersAs previously noted, the impacts of these provisions under Alternatives 2 through 6 (Draft and Preferred) compared to Alternative 1 are expected to be similar. Because differences among the alternatives with respect to the impact of these provisions should be negligible, they are excluded from the analysis.

5.2.3.2 	Comparison of Regulatory Alternatives Quantitative Risk Reduction Indicators      Exhibits 5-12 and 5-13 compare the impacts of Alternatives 2 through 6 (Draft and Preferred) using a variety of indicators that are likely to correlate with reduced entanglement risk to Atlantic large whales. The analysis evaluates the impact of new ALWTRP requirements relative to the status quo  i.e., a baseline scenario that assumes no change in existing ALWTRP requirements. This baseline scenario is equivalent to Alternative 1 (No Action). As previously stated, it is important to note that the No Action Alternative (Alternative 1) would not achieve the objective of reducing harm to large whales by reducing the likelihood of entanglement and/or reducing the severity of an entanglement should one occur. If Alternative 1 were chosen, the current unacceptable rate of serious injury and mortality to large whales due to entanglement in commercial fishing gear would continue (or increase due to increasing whale populations), rather than be reduced. The Alternatives are similar in geographic range and requirements. The main difference among the Alternatives is the number of closures and minimum traps per trawl requirements; as such the impacts of each Alternative are quite similar.      The DEIS analyzed the impacts of Alternatives 2 through Alternative 6 (Draft). In response to public comment Alternative 6 (Draft) was modified as previously described and Alternative 6 (Preferred) was created. These modifications are within the range of previously analyzed effects and do not constitute a substantial changes from the DEIS. Alternative 6 (Preferred) results in a lower number of vessels affected by the proposed measures but the total percent reduction in number of vertical lines and co-occurrence remains similar.      Alternatives 3 through 6 (Draft and Preferred) proposed closures so the analysis was conducted two ways to account for the potential for two fishing industry responses to the closures—relocation or suspension of fishing. The responses have different implications for each Alternative, but for the most part the impact of each response is similar.      Depending on the size of these closures, up to 110 vessels may be impacted. The extent of the impact varies. In some cases, it is assumed that 100% of the vessels would relocate to fish in areas outside the closure areas. In other cases it is assumed that up to 84% of the boats would relocate. In all cases, there would be a change in the number of vertical lines in the area and thus, a change in co-occurrence and potential for risk reduction as a result of the closures.      The highest degree of protection in both scenarios results from Alternative 5 due to the combination of the strictest measures proposed in each of the alternatives as well as the most proposed closures. Alternative 6 (Preferred) is in the middle of the range of protection. Alternatively, the lowest degree of protection results from Alternative 2. Alternative 2 is the only Alternative that does not propose a closure; therefore, you would expect the impacts resulting from this Alternative to be less than the others. The least number of vessels are affected by implementing Alternative 6 (Preferred).

5.3 OTHER IMPACTS      In addition to impacts on large whale species, changes to ALWTRP regulations may affect other aspects of the marine environment, including other protected species, essential fish habitat, and directed catch and bycatch in affected fisheries. The remainder of this chapter discusses these potential effects, which are summarized in Exhibit 5-14. As the exhibit indicates, there is no significant difference among Alternatives 2 through 6 (Draft and Preferred) compared to No Action with respect to impacts on essential fish habitat, directed catch, or bycatch; in each case, the impacts are expected to be minor. The alternatives differ, however, with respect to the ancillary benefits they would afford other protected species. As the following discussion explains, these differences stem from differences in the extent to which the alternatives would mandate gear modification requirements that could prove beneficial to potentially affected species of whales, porpoises, dolphins, seals, and sea turtles.

5.3.1 Impacts to Other Protected Species      In addition to the large whales discussed in Section 5.1, other protected species in the waters subject to regulation under the ALWTRP can become entangled in commercial fishing gear. Some other protected species, such as the shortnose sturgeon, the Gulf of Maine distinct population segment of Atlantic salmon, roseate terns, and piping plovers, which are listed under the Endangered Species Act, also utilize waters potentially subject to ALWTRP requirements. These species, however, are minimally affected by the commercial fishing operations that are regulated under the ALWTRP. Hence, the biological impacts analysis does not address these species.      This section assesses the potential impact of modifications to the ALWTRP on other ESA listed species, and non-ESA listed marine mammals. The ESA listed species include Kemp’s ridley, loggerhead, leatherback, green, and hawksbill sea turtles, as well as sperm, blue, and sei whales. Leatherback, Kemp’s ridley, green (Florida and Pacific coast of Mexico breeding populations), and hawksbill turtles are listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act, while loggerhead turtles are listed as threatened. Non-ESA listed marine mammals include harbor porpoises, coastal bottlenose dolphins, Atlantic white-sided dolphins, Risso’s dolphins, pelagic delphinids (spotted dolphins, striped dolphins, pilot whales, offshore bottlenose dolphins, and common dolphins), and harbor, gray, and harp seals. Bottlenose dolphins (coastal stock), pilot whales, and common dolphins are considered neither endangered nor threatened but are afforded protection as strategic stocks under the Marine Mammal Protection Act.      NMFS believes that some of the other protected species whose ranges overlap with the fisheries managed by the ALWTRP may be potentially affected by the proposed changes outlined in this EIS. For Atlantic white-sided, spotted, striped, offshore bottlenose, and Risso’s dolphins, and harbor, gray, and harp seals, the total fishery-related mortality and serious injury for potentially affected stocks are considered to be insignificant and approaching a zero mortality and serious injury rate.16 However, as a precautionary approach, NMFS considers these species potentially affected due to the possible overlap between the fisheries regulated under the ALWTRP and the range of these species.      The Nova Scotian stock of sei whales occurs only in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic (Waring et al., 2012); therefore, the potential ALWTRP effects related to these species are only discussed for these areas. Hawksbill sea turtles have a southerly distribution; therefore, the potential ALWTRP effects related to this species are only discussed for measures pertaining to the Southeast.           16 As documented in the following U.S. Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico Marine Mammal Stock Assessment Reports for the Western North Atlantic (WNA) stock of each species: for striped and Atlantic spotted dolphins, Waring et al. (2000); for pantropical spotted and Risso’s dolphins, Waring et al. (2002); for Atlantic white-sided and offshore bottlenose dolphins, harbor, gray, and harp seals (Gulf of Maine/Bay of Fundy stock), Waring et al. (2003).
5.3.1.1 Buoy Line Requirements      In addition to the large whales discussed in Section 5.1, other protected species in the waters subject to regulation under the ALWTRP are known to become entangled in lobster, other trap/pot, and gillnet buoy lines (NMFS, 2001a; NMFS, 2001b; NMFS, 2001c; NMFS, 2001d).17 In particular, NMFS receives several reports of leatherback entanglements in lobster trap/pot buoy lines every year. From 2002-2011, there were 133 reports of entangled leatherbacks from Maine to Virginia. Data collected by the Sea Turtle Stranding and Salvage Network (STSSN) and NMFS also indicate that whelk trap/pot gear has been involved in a number of reported leatherback entanglements in Massachusetts and New Jersey waters (NMFS unpublished data, 2001). Research suggests that leatherbacks may be attracted to buoys because they resemble jellyfish, which is one of the turtles’ prey. Leatherbacks and loggerheads may also attempt to feed on the bivalves, algae, and gelatinous organisms that colonize buoys and ropes (NMFS, 2001a). Once a sea turtle becomes entangled, its mobility is impaired and its ability to feed may be hampered. Entangled turtles may eventually drown under the weight of the gear or if the trailing gear becomes lodged on rocks or ledges below the surface.      Alternative 1 (No Action) would not result in additional conservation gain for other protected species. As described previously, the regulatory changes proposed under Alternatives  2 through 6 (Preferred) include several provisions pertaining to buoy lines which are designed to reduce large whale entanglement risks. For example, while it is currently recommended that fishermen keep lines as knot free as possible, Alternatives 2 through 6 (Draft and Preferred) would require this in the Southeast. This could benefit other protected species, such as sea turtles, by reducing the likelihood that line would become lodged around appendages.      The Alternatives analyzed would also impose restrictions on the number of buoy lines that fishermen employ in the Northeast. Singles would be prohibited, and fishermen would be required to use trawls for 2 to 20 trap/pots. By helping to reduce the amount of buoy line in the water column, these measures would help to reduce the entanglement risks faced by other protected species, as well as large whales.      Although the commercial fisheries regulated under the ALWTRP may affect blue and sperm whales, there seems to be significant separation between the known feeding range of these species and primary fishing areas. In addition, Waring et al. (2012) indicate that the level of fishery interaction is insignificant and approaching a zero mortality and serious injury rate. Therefore, the gear used in the commercial fisheries regulated under the ALWTRP is not likely to adversely affect blue or sperm whales.      Due to similarities in distribution, feeding behavior, and other characteristics, sei whales are believed to benefit from ALWTRP measures in much the same manner as the large whale species the plan is designed to protect.      Bottlenose dolphins, harbor porpoises, Atlantic white-sided dolphins, pelagic delphinids (pilot whales, and spotted, striped, and common dolphins), and harbor, gray, and harp seals more           17 With respect to other trap/pot fisheries, NMFS has documented the entanglement of sea turtles in buoy lines associated with whelk, crab, and black sea bass trap/pot gear.
commonly become ensnared in nets rather than lines; however, marine mammals could become entangled in buoy line, and any reduction in the amount of line in the water column should decrease the risk of entanglement for these species.5.3.1.2 Weak Link Requirements      Alternative 1 (No Action) would maintain status quo of weak link requirements and not reduce the potential for a serious injury or mortality to occur after an entanglement. As described previously, provisions in Alternatives 2 through 6 (Draft and Preferred) require the incorporation of weaker weak links on trap/pot gear in the Southeast Region. This requirement is designed to reduce the likelihood that interactions between whales and commercial fishing gear will result in entanglements that cause serious injury or death.      These provisions, which are specifically designed to reduce the risk of serious injury or mortality to large whales, are likely to have a beneficial effect for other protected species of similar size and strength. For example, in the unlikely event of an entanglement, blue, sei, and sperm whales may benefit from the weak link requirements, because they would possess the size and strength necessary for the weak links to function properly. Decreasing the strength of the current weak links will benefit smaller animals, including bottlenose dolphins, harbor porpoises, Atlantic white-sided dolphins, pelagic delphinids (pilot whales, and spotted, striped, and common dolphins), harbor, gray and harp seals, and sea turtles, that otherwise may have lacked the strength to break weak links as strong as those that are currently required under the ALWTRP.5.3.1.3 Set Restrictions Requirements      The No Action Alternative would maintain the status quo. Fishermen are currently required to bring their gear back to shore every 30 days. The potential regulatory changes under analysis in Alternatives 2 through 6 (Draft and Preferred) include requiring trap/pot fishermen fishing in the Federal waters of Southeast US Restricted Area North to bring their gear back to shore at the conclusion of each trip.      The provisions proposed under Alternatives 2 through 6 (Draft and Preferred) could help to reduce entanglement risks for other protected species. This requirement may help to reduce instances in which failure to tend gear contributes to the entanglement of other protected species. The No Action alternative would not reduce the risk of entanglement of other protected species.      As previously stated, the implementation of this requirement would offer ancillary benefits of varying degree to other protected species, depending on their presence in the affected area and the alternative implemented.
5.3.1.4 Gear Marking Requirements      With the exception of Alternative 1 (No Action), all of the regulatory alternatives under consideration would impose new gear marking requirements. Alternative 1 would maintain the current gear marking scheme that is currently inadequate for identifying the gear related to entanglements. Alternatives 2 through 6 (Draft) include a common gear marking scheme that would result in the incorporation of approximately 1.1 million new marks into the gear subject to ALWTRP regulations. Alternative 6 (Preferred) would incorporate approximately 393,295 new marks. As with whales, these requirements would have neither direct impact on the probability  of other protected species becoming entangled in commercial fishing gear nor would they affect the severity of an entanglement should one occur. Nonetheless, the gear marking requirements under consideration would help to generate information on the nature of the gear involved in an entanglement of any protected species. In addition, these provisions would in some cases allow NMFS to identify the owner of the gear, and thus, allow the agency to gather additional information on where, when, and how the gear was set.  By increasing scientific understanding of the nature of entanglements, the gear marking measures would allow NMFS, over time, to improve the effectiveness of programs designed to reduce the entanglement risks faced by other protected species. Thus, these measures could contribute indirectly to the preservation and restoration of the other potentially-affected protected species.5.3.1.5 Seasonal Closures      Under the No Action Alternative and Alternative 2, the number of closures currently in place would remain the same. There would be no additional conservation benefit to other protected species as a result of Alternatives 1 or 2. Under Alternatives 3 through 6 (Draft and Preferred) a number of trap/pot fishery closures are under consideration. The closure of Jordan Basin would be from November 1-January 31. Jeffreys Ledge would be closed from October 1- January 31. Three different potential closures of Cape Cod Bay Restricted Area and surrounding areas were analyzed. Under Alternative 3, the area would be closed from February 1-April 30. Under Alternatives 4 and 5, the area would be expanded to include the Outer Cape and abuts the Great South Channel (Massachusetts Restricted Area #1). This closure would be in place from January 1-April 30. Under Alternative 6 (Draft and Preferred), the Cape Cod Bay closure would include the Outer Cape and would be in effect from January 1-April 30 (Massachusetts Restricted Area #2).      The closures described above could have a beneficial impact on sea turtles, but such benefits are likely to be limited. Leatherback, loggerhead, and Kemp’s ridley sea turtles generally do not appear in the Cape Cod Bay Restricted Area or Gulf of Maine until June, when the closures are no longer in effect. Green sea turtles use the Gulf of Maine as a summer habitat so the closures would have minimal impact on them as well. As a result, the benefits of prohibiting such activity are likely to be minor, except to the extent that the prohibition prevents the possible future expansion of driftnet, anchored float gillnet, or other trap/pot fisheries into this area.      The closures described above could have a beneficial impact on blue, sei, and sperm whales, but such benefits are likely to be limited. Blue and sperm whales are typically not
reported in either the Cape Cod Bay Restricted Area or the Massachusetts Restricted Areas.  Blue whales are most frequently sighted in the waters off eastern Canada, with the majority of recent records from the Gulf of St. Lawrence (Sears et al., 1987). At most, the blue whale is considered an occasional visitor in the U.S. Atlantic EEZ, which may represent the southern  limit of its feeding range. The waters in which it has been sighted, however, are still well north  of the Restricted Areas identified by the ALWTRP (CETAP, 1982; Wenzel et al., 1988). Similarly, the distribution of sperm whales in the U.S. Atlantic EEZ occurs on the edge of the continental shelf, over the continental slope, and into mid-ocean (Waring et al., 2007). Given the distinct offshore distribution of this species, sperm whales are unlikely to benefit from fishery closures in Cape Cod Bay or the area connecting to the Great South Channel.      In contrast, sei whales may benefit from the fishery closures described above. Although sei whales are often found in the deeper waters that characterize the edge of the continental shelf (Hain et al., 1985), NMFS aerial surveys found substantial numbers of sei whales south of Nantucket in the spring of 2001. The general offshore pattern of sei whale distribution is sometimes disrupted during episodic incursions into more shallow and inshore waters (Waring et al., 2003). In addition, sei whales (like right whales) are largely planktivorous, primarily feeding on euphausiids and copepods; this has resulted in reports of sei whales in more inshore locations, such as the Great South Channel (in 1987 and 1989) and Stellwagen Bank (in 1986) (Waring et al., 2003). Therefore, sei whales may benefit from the fishery closures in Cape Cod Bay and the area connecting to the Great South Channel during their periodic incursions into these waters.      For reasons similar to those discussed for blue and sperm whales, the closures described above are likely to offer limited benefits to harbor porpoises, Atlantic white-sided dolphins, pelagic delphinids, bottlenose dolphins, and harbor, gray, and harp seals. The western North Atlantic coastal migratory stock of bottlenose dolphins is generally distributed south of Long Island; thus, fishery closures are unlikely to have a significant impact on entanglement risks for this species. Harbor porpoises, Atlantic white-sided dolphins, and pelagic delphinids, however, are more common in New England waters. To the extent that fishery closures help to reduce overall fishing effort (rather than simply divert it to other areas where these species may also be present), entanglement risks to these species may be reduced.5.3.1.6 Addition of Exempted Waters        As previously noted, the ALWTRP currently exempts certain bays, harbors, inlets, and other coastal waters from the provisions of the plan (see Chapter 2).      Expanding exempted areas as described above under Alternatives 3, 4, and 6 (Draft and Preferred) would primarily affect lobster trap/pot vessels that are currently subject to the ALWTRP requirements for Northern Inshore State Trap/Pot Waters. Under Alternative 6 (Draft) fishing in New Hampshire state waters would be exempted from the all the ALWTRP requirements. Under the preferred alternative (Alternative 6 Preferred) those fishing in New Hampshire state waters and in the buffer waters surrounding certain Maine Islands would be not be required to fish with a minimum number of traps per trawl. They would not be exempted from the gear marking requirements or current requirements. The requirements currently in place in these areas are as follows:
• Compliance with the Universal Requirements- No buoy line floating at the surface.- No wet storage of gear- Fishermen are encouraged, but not required, to maintain knot-free buoy lines.• Trap/pot surface buoys to be marked to identify the vessel or fishery.• Buoy lines to be marked with one 4-inch red mark midway along the buoy line.• All buoys, floatation devices and/or weights must be attached to the buoy line with a weak link having a breaking strength of no greater than 600  lbs.• All groundlines must be made of sinking line.      Blue, sei, and sperm whales are not expected to be affected by the change in exempted waters these species are not known to occur in these areas. Likewise maintaining the status quo under Alternatives 1,2, and 4 would not affect blue, sei, or sperm whales either. As previously discussed, several of these requirements (e.g., weak link provisions) are unlikely to provide any ancillary benefit to smaller protected species, such as sea turtles, bottlenose dolphins, Atlantic white-sided dolphins, Risso’s dolphins, pelagic delphinids, harbor porpoises, or harbor, gray and harp seals; however, increasing trawl size could afford such benefits. Thus, relative to the status quo, relieving previously regulated vessels from these ALWTRP requirements could have an adverse impact on other protected species that may occur in newly-exempted waters. The potential for adverse effects may be greatest for sea turtles. Loggerhead and Kemp’s ridley turtles prefer inshore waters and embayments for foraging on crustaceans and mollusks (NMFS, 2001b). Leatherbacks may also swim into shallow waters if there is an abundance of jellyfish nearshore.      Depending on the season, 10 to 220 active vessels fish in New Hampshire state waters. Roughly 25% of these vessels fish in already exempt waters. Thus, the expansion of exempted waters in this state would likely affect a relatively large number of vessels, which in turn could have an adverse impact on other protected species, particularly leatherbacks. Alternatively, there are only 20-25 fishermen fishing in the waters surrounding Matinicus Island, Monhegan Island, and Ragged Island. There currently is no evidence of interactions between Kemp’s ridleys or green turtles and lobster trap/pot gear, and very limited information about interactions between loggerheads and lobster trap/pot gear.      From 2002 to 2013, there were no confirmed records of a leatherback entanglement in NH  waters  and  four  in  waters  near  the Maine  islands.	The four confirmed animals were
disentangled and released alive, therefore the likelihood of adverse impacts on leatherbacks is minimal.5.3.2 Impacts to Essential Fish Habitat      As noted in Chapter 4, using the types of fixed fishing gear regulated under the ALWTRP (i.e., traps/pots and anchored gillnets) can affect essential fish habitat primarily through  the gear's impacts on the benthic environment. Such impacts generally arise as a result of contact between fishing gear and the sea floor, especially during the setting and retrieval of the gear. In some cases, bottom contact can alter the physical structure of the seabed, injure or kill benthic organisms, alter the structure and productivity of the benthic community, contribute to the suspension of sediments, and cause changes in the chemical composition of the water column overlying affected sediments. However, the habitat impacts of mobile, bottom-tending gear are much more severe than the impacts attributed to fixed, bottom-tending gear (see Section 4.4.4.1).      The regulatory alternatives under consideration are likely to have no more than a temporary or minimally adverse impact on the benthic environment (see Section 5.2.2.2). The regulatory provisions with the greatest potential to affect benthic habitat are those that may influence contact between ALWTRP-regulated gear and the sea floor. As discussed below, the provisions of interest are those pertaining to exempted waters and to buoy line and weak link requirements.5.3.2.1 Exempted and Buffer Waters      As described above, Alternatives 3,5, and 6 (Draft) would exempt New Hampshire state waters from the requirements under the ALWTRP. Alternative 6 (Preferred) would exempt New Hampshire state waters and buffer waters surrounding certain Maine islands from the minimum number of traps per trawl requirement. These changes, coupled with an increase in regulatory requirements in other areas, might create an incentive for fishermen to relocate their effort to exempted waters. If this were to occur, it would increase stress on the benthic environment in these areas.18 Any relocation of effort, however, is likely to be limited by other  factors, including the already crowded conditions in inshore and nearshore waters and the conflicts between fishermen that could arise if those who attempted to relocate their effort were perceived as encroaching on territory unofficially claimed by others. As a result, any adverse impact on essential fish habitat in exempted waters is likely to be limited. Under Alternatives 1, 2, and 4 the waters would not be exempt, so there would be no additional impacts to essential fish habitat.5.3.2.2 Buoy Line Requirements      With the exception of Alternative 1 (No Action), all of the regulatory alternatives under consideration would require increasing the number of traps per trawl fished in the Northeast           18 This change presumably would be offset by a decrease in fishing pressure in other areas, with potentially beneficial implications for benthic habitat in these areas.
region. This increase in trawl length under Alternatives 2 through 6 (Draft and Preferred) may in turn increase the use of sinking groundline. This would not be the case with Alternative 1 and as such there would be no additional impact to benthic habitat as a result of Alternative 1. The use of such line increases the line’s contact with the sea floor, creating the potential for adverse impacts on benthic habitat. Such impacts, however, are not expected to be more than minimal or temporary in nature. The expected impacts of sinking groundline on benthic habitat would occur primarily when trawl lines of pots are hauled to the surface. During this process, the line may snag on bottom features and organisms as it is dragged across the bottom. Current knowledge suggests that trap/pot fishermen minimize the distance at which gear is drawn across the sea  floor when hauling in their gear, as this contact causes abrasion of the protective coating on the traps themselves. Hence, fishermen position their vessels above their gear, pulling sets up through the water column instead of across the sea floor. This practice minimizes the adverse impact of sinking groundline on benthic habitat. Furthermore, the amount of bottom area that would be disturbed by sinking groundline, and the frequency of disturbance in the exact same area from repeated contact with sinking groundline, would be very small, allowing enough time for recovery of benthic communities that would potentially be affected. Therefore, any adverse impacts associated with the increased use of sinking groundline would be temporary as well as minimal.      In contrast, in an effort to reduce damage to sensitive habitats, single trap/pots are preferable in the Southeast. The Southeast U.S. has many more coastal habitats that include live bottom and corals; in particular, there are ample amounts of live bottom off the coast of Northeast Florida19. Traps set in multiple trap trawls can damage live bottom more than single traps. Groundlines may drag across the bottom, potentially shearing off living organisms most important in providing topographic complexity (Barnette 2001). Furthermore, the area swept by the groundline is orders of magnitude greater than the cumulative area of the traps themselves (Barnette 2001). It is estimated that hauling in a single trap results in 30% more damage to the substrate than setting the trap itself (Appledorn et al 2000); thus, hauling in multiple traps would further increase the extent of the habitat than a single pot.5.3.2.3 Weak Link Requirements      The use of weaker weak links, as required by regulatory Alternatives 2 through 6 (Draft and Preferred), is unlikely to have a significant impact on essential fish habitat. Currently, weak links are also required under Alternative 1. It is possible that weak links could benefit essential fish habitat by reducing the likelihood that an entangled whale would drag gear over sensitive areas. Instead, the weak link is expected to break, releasing the gear. To the extent this occurs, potential damage to the marine environment could be avoided.           19 See http://www.habitat.noaa.gov/protection/efh/efhmapper/index.html for maps showing the location of live bottom and coral.
5.3.3 Impacts to Directed Catch and Bycatch      Like other regulations on commercial fishing, changes in ALWTRP requirements could have an impact on directed catch and bycatch in affected fisheries. Directed catch refers to the catch of species targeted by the fisheries currently or potentially subject to ALWTRP requirements (see list of affected fisheries in Chapter 4.2). Under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, bycatch is defined as the harvest of fish that are not sold or kept for personal use, including economic and regulatory discards.      As described below, potential changes to the ALWTRP are unlikely to have a significant impact on directed catch or bycatch. The discussion is divided into three parts:• Impacts associated with major gear modification requirements;• Impacts associated with seasonal closures; and• Impacts associated with changes to exempted waters.5.3.3.1 Major Gear Modification Requirements      None of the major gear modification requirements specified under Alternatives 2 through 6 (Draft and Preferred) are likely to have a significant impact on directed catch or bycatch. Alternative 1 does not require additional gear modifications above and beyond what is currently required; therefore, there would be no impacts to directed catch or bycatch as a result of Alternative 1. The NMFS Gear Research Team reports that no significant changes in catch have been observed by or reported to them for any of the gear modifications currently required under the ALWTRP. The gear modification requirements envisioned under Alternatives 2 through 6 (Preferred) primarily involve increasing the number of traps per trawl or codifying current practices (singles in the Southeast). A vessel may experience catch changes but these impacts may diminish over time as fishermen adapt to new gear configurations and learn to fish longer trawls more efficiently. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that changes in gear configuration could have an overall adverse impact on directed catch or bycatch at first. The magnitude of these impacts is uncertain.5.3.3.2 Seasonal Closures      It is possible that the seasonal closures proposed in Alternatives 3 through 6 (Draft and Preferred) would experience a reduction in catch. If the vessels chose to suspend fishing then their catch level would be affected during the months of the closure. If the vessels chose to relocate fishing effort outside the closure area, there is the possibility that the catch level could be reduced relative to that in the preferred fishing location inside the closure area. Catch reductions could occur due to numerous reasons including unfamiliarity with the new location, competition, or lower productivity of the grounds. Alternative 1 does not require additional closures above and beyond what is currently required; therefore, there would be no impacts to directed catch or bycatch as a result of Alternative 1.
5.3.3.3 Addition of Exempted and Buffer Waters      Alternatives 1, 2, and 4 do not require changing the current exempted waters; therefore, there would be no impacts to directed catch or bycatch as a result. As discussed above, Alternatives 3, 5, and 6 (Draft and Preferred) would expand the waters that would be exempted from some or all of the ALWTRP requirements with the exception of the gear marking requirements. If vessels relocated their effort to exempted areas to avoid the costs of complying with ALWTRP requirements, more directed catch and bycatch in these waters could occur. As a result of this increased fishing pressure, stocks of both targeted and bycatch species in these waters could be adversely affected.5.3.4 Summary of Impacts      Alternative 1 (No Action) would not result in additional conservation benefits to other protected species. There are no additional impacts to essential fish habitat and directed catch and bycatch as Alternative 1 maintains the status quo.      As the discussion above suggests, there is no significant difference among Alternatives 2 through 6 (Draft and Preferred) with respect to impacts on other protected species, essential fish habitat, directed catch, or bycatch; in each case, the impact is expected to be minimal. All the Alternatives (with the exception of Alternative 1) include some form of gear modifications and some level of increased traps per trawl. The main differences among these alternatives stem from differences in the extent to which they would close certain areas to fishing during certain times of the year. Other protected species would indirectly benefit from the measures put in place to protect the species covered under the ALWTRP.      With the exception of Alternatives 1, 2, and 4, the regulatory alternatives under consideration would expand the area of coastal waters that would be exempted from ALWTRP requirements. This change would relieve previously regulated vessels from ALWTRP requirements, and thus could have an adverse impact on other protected species relative to the status quo. The practical impact of the potential change in exempted waters is unclear, since data on the number of vessels that currently fish in exempted waters are unavailable. Expansion of exempted waters in certain areas (e.g., New Hampshire) could affect a relatively small number of vessels; however, the impact on other protected species would depend upon the gear modifications that such vessels have already implemented but would no longer be required to maintain. If these vessels have relied primarily upon weak links to comply with ALWTRP requirements − as seems likely − the impact of removing these requirements is likely to be negligible. Conversely, if these vessels have met ALWTRP standards by switching to sinking groundline, the impact of exempting them from these standards could be greater.20           20 The discussion above focuses on the impacts of expanding exempted waters assuming that a significant number of fishermen might choose to fish exclusively within those waters, and thus avoid the need to comply with ALWTRP requirements. It is possible that fishermen would choose to modify their gear to comply with ALWTRP requirements in non-exempt waters and would use the same gear in exempt areas. To the extent this occurred, the potential for any adverse impact on other protected species would be reduced.
      For the most part, impacts on other protected species, essential fish habitat, directed catch, or bycatch as a result of the proposed measures are expected to be minimal or be seasonal as is the case with the proposed closures.

Appendix 5-BSENSITIVITY OF THE CO-OCCURRENCE ANALYSIS TO THE USE OF ADJUSTED WHALE SIGHTINGS VALUES
INTRODUCTION      The analysis presented in Chapter 5 develops co-occurrence scores by relying upon data on sightings of right and humpback whales per unit of survey effort (SPUE). The use of effort- corrected sightings data is necessary to characterize the likely distribution of whales within the waters that are subject to the ALWTRP. The dataset, however, is not comprehensive, adding uncertainty to the analysis of both baseline co-occurrence scores and the impact of alternative management measures. This uncertainty is related to two specific issues:1. Inclusion of SPUE values of “0” that are based on very low levels of survey effort; and2. The absence of SPUE values (and therefore, co-occurrence values) in areas where effort-adjusted survey data are unavailable.      Members of the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Team (ALWTRT) have expressed concern about these issues and suggested a variety of methods to address them, including a detailed proposal submitted by Dr. Robert Kenney.1 Dr.  Kenney’s proposal focuses on  the use of opportunistic sightings data to redefine SPUE values of zero when those values are based on relatively little survey effort. NMFS has developed a modified version of this approach,  extended it to address both of the issues noted above, and employed the approach to investigate how the use of adjusted sightings data would influence evaluation of the potential impact of vertical line management measures. This appendix describes the steps employed to develop adjusted sightings values and presents the results of the analysis.ANALYTIC BOUNDARIES AND PARAMETERS      The approach described in this appendix has been applied to a limited geographic area and at a particular spatial resolution. These parameters are described below.Geographic Extent of Application      The adjustment of sightings values has been limited to waters within the ALWTRP’s Northeast region. In addition, Narragansett Bay has been excluded from the analysis, based on the understanding that this area is unlikely to comprise important habitat for right or humpback whales.2 SPUE-based scores assigned to cells within Narragansett Bay are left unchanged regardless of whether the value is zero or undefined.Resolution of Analysis      The approach employed to develop adjusted sightings values is consistent with the general design of the Vertical Line Model. Specifically:1 Robert D. Kenney, Ph.D., University of Rhode Island Graduate School of Oceanography, “Estimating Minimum SPUE Values for Right and Humpback Whales in Northeast Areas with Low Survey Effort: An Analysis Completed for the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Team,” January 31, 2012.2 Email communication with Dr. Robert Kenney, University of Rhode Island, July 27, 2012.
* Adjusted sightings values are developed for each month, based on  multiple years of opportunistic sightings data;* Adjusted values are developed and assigned at the same spatial resolution as SPUE scores (i.e., 10-minute by 10-minute grid cells);* Adjusted sightings values are independently developed for both right and humpback whales.3ADJUSTED SIGHTINGS VALUES FOR AREAS WITH LIMITED SURVEY EFFORT      The approach employed to redefine sightings values in cells with limited or no survey effort mirrors closely the approach described in Dr. Kenney’s January 2012 proposal, with some minor revisions. The steps of the analysis are described below, as well as the justification for the approach selected for each step. Exhibit 5B-1 presents a flow chart that summarizes these steps.Exhibit 5B-1OVERVIEW OF ANALYTIC APPROACH3 The adjusted sightings value for the two species combined is the sum of the adjusted values assigned to the individual species.
Step 1. Isolate Zero And Undefined Values      In the first step of the analysis, records for which the SPUE value is greater than zero (in which case the original value will be retained) are separated from records for which the value is zero or undefined (in which case the value will be retained or redefined based on the steps described below).  This is not to say that a value greater than zero is inherently more reliable  than a zero value that is based on the same level of survey effort. Rather, the approach is based on the premise that the ultimate goal of the exercise is to redefine some reasonable, minimal SPUE value for areas and months in which the reported SPUE value is zero or undefined, but there is reason to believe that this value is not representative of the likely distribution of whales. Retaining a zero or undefined value in these instances could cause the model to understate potential co-occurrence.Step 2. Apply Presence/Absence Indicator      Opportunistic sightings data provide additional evidence of the potential for whales to be present in areas where systematic surveys have not identified them. Available opportunistic data are used in conjunction with data on survey effort to determine an adjusted sightings value.Preparation and Sources      Data identifying opportunistic sightings of right and humpback whales were retrieved from the North Atlantic Right Whale Consortium (NARWC) Sightings and Survey Database.4 Each record specifies the date of the sighting, the species sighted, the location (i.e., latitude and longitude), and the certainty of the identification. The records date from the 1800s but are extremely sparse until 1966.      Opportunistic data are used to assign a “Presence/Absence” (P/A) score to each cell by month and species. For a given month and species, if an acceptable record identifies a whale sighting, a P/A score of “1” is assigned. If the available records indicate no sightings, a P/A  score of “0” is assigned. For this analysis:* Only available records from 1966 or later are used; and* Only records that designate the reliability of the sighting as “sure,” “probable,” or “not recorded” are retained; records of “possible” sightings are omitted.54 The NARWC data and User Guide are available at http://gsosun1.gso.uri.edu/~rkenney/DATABASE/.5 Retaining records for which the reliability of the sighting was not recorded expands the dataset to include the use of NMFS aerial survey records.
Application      The remainder of the analysis applies different treatments to those areas (i.e., cells) in which the opportunistic data confirm that whales have been observed, as opposed to those where no sightings have been documented. Thus, in this step, those cells with a P/A score of “1” are separated from those with a P/A score of “0.” Due to known biases associated with the opportunistic sightings data, NMFS believes it would be inappropriate to apply any greater degree of significance to them than as a simple indicator of the documented presence of whales.Step 3. Define Minimum SPUE Values      Adjusted sightings scores are based on two factors: an assumed minimum SPUE value (MIN SPUE) that is based on reported non-zero SPUE values for a particular species, as defined in this step, and a multiplier that will be defined in Step 4. There are numerous options for defining a minimum value to be applied to each species, including:* Use of the annual minimum (non-zero) SPUE value reported for the species in Northeast waters;* Use of monthly minimum values;* Use of seasonal minimum values; or* Other permutations.For purposes of this analysis, NMFS employs a hybrid approach that adjusts for potentially significant variations in seasonal minimum values. Specifically:* For right whales, the analysis employs the spring minimum value for the spring and the annual minimum value for the winter, summer, and fall;6* For humpback whales, the analysis employs the winter minimum value for the winter and the spring minimum value for the spring, summer and fall.7These minima are shown in Exhibit 5B-2.6 For this analysis, as in the Vertical Line Model, the seasons are defined as follows: Winter, January-March; Spring, April-June; Summer, July-September; Fall, October-December.7 This approach is consistent with Dr. Kenney’s recommendation in an email dated 7/27/2012.

Apply Functions To Determine Adjusted Sightings Multiplier      In the final step of the process, a multiplier is applied to the minimum values specified above (MIN SPUE) to calculate the final adjusted sightings value. As Exhibit 5B-3 illustrates, the magnitude of the multiplier is a function of the P/A score and the survey effort in the cell. When the P/A score for a species is “0” (i.e., when the opportunistic data indicate no sightings of the species within the month and area of interest), the multiplier applied is defined by function f; when the P/A score for a species is “1” (i.e., when the opportunistic data indicate at least one sighting of the species within the month and area of interest), the multiplier applied is defined by function g. In each case, the maximum and minimum multipliers are determined by the P/A score. Specifically:* When P/A = 0, the maximum multiplier applied to MIN SPUE is 0.5; the minimum multiplier is 0.* When P/A = 1; the maximum multiplier applied to MIN SPUE is 1; the minimum multiplier is 0.1.      In both cases, the maximum multiplier is applied whenever the survey effort for the area and month in question is less than 13 kilometers, a distance that in the Northeast corresponds roughly to one latitudinal transit of a 10-minute grid cell. Conversely, the minimum multiplier is applied whenever the survey effort for the area and month in question is greater than or equal to63.3 km, which is the median level of survey effort per cell in the Northeast across all months. When the survey effort for the area and month in question is between these two values, the multiplier applied to MIN SPUE is defined by function f when P/A = 0, and function g when P/A= 1.8 The underlying assumption is that the greater the survey effort associated with a reported SPUE value of zero, the greater the likelihood that the reported value is representative of the actual distribution of the species (i.e., the greater the likelihood that the “true” value is zero or very close to zero). This is particularly the case when no opportunistic sightings have been reported.8 Expressed in slope-intercept form, these equations are approximately: f(Effort, P/A=0) = -0.01*Effort + 0.63 and g(Effort, P/A=1) = -0.018*Effort + 1.234.
FUNCTIONS EMPLOYED IN DEVELOPING ADJUSTED SIGHTINGS VALUESEFFECT ON SIGHTINGS AND CO-OCCURRENCE SCORES      The full results of the analysis are presented in the attachments that follow. Attachment 5B-1 shows the impact of the analysis on the combined sightings score for right whales and humpback whales in Northeast waters, while Attachment 5B-2 shows the corresponding impact on baseline co-occurrence scores. As intended, the analysis increases sightings scores in areas and months that have been the subject of little or no systematic survey effort. The overall effect is to eliminate all undefined cells, with the exception of those within Narragannsett Bay, and to retain zero values only in cells where (1) whales have not been sighted after substantial survey effort and (2) opportunistic sightings have not been recorded. All other cells that had undefined or zero SPUE values have been replaced with minimum values that vary based on the extent of survey effort within the cell and whether records of opportunistic sightings exist. This in turn increases co-occurrence scores in areas where vertical line is present. This is particularly noticeable in areas of Maine state waters landward of the ALWTRP exemption line, where there is a relatively high concentration of vertical line.      Attachment 5B-3 summarizes the impact of the adjusted sightings values on the evaluation of the regulatory alternatives that NMFS is considering. The attachment includes  three tables, all of which show (a) the impact of each alternative on co-occurrence in waters that are subject to the ALWTRP seaward of the exemption line for the sinking groundline requirement; and (b) the impact of each alternative on co-occurrence in all waters subject to the ALWTRP, including those that are exempt from the sinking groundline requirements. As the tables indicate, the use of adjusted sightings values tempers the impact of each management measure on the co-occurrence score. The effect is relatively minor when exempt waters are excluded from the analysis. In this case, the use of adjusted sightings values reduces the estimated impact of each measure on the annual co-occurrence score by no more than 0.3
percent. The impact is greater, however, when exempt waters are included in the analysis, with the net effect, on an annual basis, ranging between 1.6 and 1.9 percent (see Table 5B-3).      As the tables indicate, the use of adjusted sightings values has a similar impact on the estimated effectiveness of Alternatives 2 through 6. As a result, the use of these values rather than the SPUE values employed in the main analysis has no effect on the relative ranking of the alternatives with respect to their impact on co-occurrence. Under all cases considered, Alternative 5 has the greatest estimated impact on co-occurrence, followed in order by Alternative 4, Alternative 6 (Draft) and Alternative 6 (Preferred), Alternative 3, andAlternative 2..

ECONOMIC IMPACTS	CHAPTER 66.1 INTRODUCTION      The regulatory alternatives under consideration would subject commercial fishermen operating in fisheries covered by the ALWTRP to a number of new requirements.  These include:• Minimum trawl-length standards, which would apply to the lobster, blue crab, and other trap/pot (OTP) fisheries in the plan’s Northeast waters;• New gear configuration requirements, which would apply to trap/pot fisheries in the plan’s Southeast waters;• Seasonal closure of designated areas in the Northeast to trap/pot gear; and• New gear marking requirements, which would apply to regulated fisheries in all waters that are subject to the ALWTRP, as well as some areas that are exempt from other ALWTRP requirements.Complying with these requirements is likely to impose additional costs on commercial fishermen and, in some instances, to have an adverse impact on their revenues. If these impacts are large, it is possible that some fishermen may switch their effort to other fisheries or cease fishing entirely.      The following discussion describes the methods used to estimate the costs that commercial fishermen would incur in complying with potential modifications to the ALWTRP and presents the results of this analysis. These cost estimates represent the direct impact of new regulations on the commercial fishing industry. They also provide a foundation for subsequent evaluation of the regulations’ potential effect on commercial fishing activity, and of the implications of such effects for communities that depend on the commercial fishing industry (see Chapter 7). The discussion is organized as follows:• Section 6.2 describes the data sources and methodology employed to estimate compliance costs associated with minimum trawl-length and other gear configuration requirements;
• Section 6.3 describes the data sources and methodology employed to characterize the economic impact of the seasonal closure of certain areas to trap/pot gear;• Section 6.4 describes the methods used to estimate the compliance costs associated with gear marking requirements;• Section 6.5 presents the resulting estimates of compliance costs for each regulatory alternative; and• Section 6.6 describes the distribution of estimated costs by fishery.      The analysis examines the costs of each regulatory alternative in a social welfare framework, focusing on potential changes in producer and consumer surplus. In the context of this analysis, producer surplus is the difference between the revenues that fishermen receive for their catch and the economic costs incurred in harvesting it. Similarly, consumer surplus is the difference between the maximum amount that consumers would be willing to pay for the catch and the price they actually pay. Any reduction in consumer or producer surplus represents a loss of economic welfare, and thus, a cost to society.      The analysis measures the cost of complying with new regulatory requirements relative to Alternative 1, the no action alternative; it does not address the cost of complying with ALWTRP requirements already in place. This is not to imply that implementation of the  ALWTRP's current requirements is costless. Commercial fishermen clearly incur costs to meet current standards. The economic analysis, however, is designed to measure costs on an incremental  basis − i.e., to measure the change in costs associated with a change in regulatory requirements. If no change in regulatory requirements is imposed − as would be the case under Alternative 1 − the costs of complying with the ALWTRP would remain unchanged. Thus, the incremental cost of the no action alternative is zero.      Much of the analysis described in this chapter builds on the foundation provided by NMFS’ Vertical Line Model. As discussed earlier in this EIS, the model integrates information on fishing activity, gear configurations, and whale movements to provide indicators of the potential for entanglements to occur at various locations and at different points in time. The  costs that the management measures under consideration might impose depend on the fishery (or fisheries) in which a vessel participates; the seasons and locations in which a vessel operates; the regulations to which it is already subject; and the current configuration of the vessel’s gear. The Vertical Line Model specifies operating assumptions for groups of vessels that hold these key features in common, providing an important starting point for assessing economic impacts. The role of the model in the analysis of economic impacts is described in detail below; readers interested in additional information on the model’s structure or the data, assumptions, and methods it employs should consult the model’s formal documentation, which is available for review on the ALWTRP website (http://www.nero.noaa.gov/Protected/whaletrp/index.html).
6.2 ANALYTIC APPROACH: GEAR CONFIGURATION REQUIREMENTS      A major component of Alternatives 2 through 6 (Preferred) is a minimum trawl length requirement – i.e., prohibiting trawls of less than a specified number of traps or pots – for trap/pot fisheries in Northeast waters. The exact nature of this requirement varies by alternative and location. The costs that fishermen are likely to incur in complying with such requirements fall into several categories:• Gear Conversion: Vessels fishing shorter configurations (e.g., singles, doubles) would need to reconfigure their gear to comply with trawling requirements. These changes may require expenditures on new equipment as well as investments of fishermen’s time.• Catch Impacts: Catch rates may decline for vessels that are required to convert from shorter sets to longer trawls, reducing the revenues of affected operations.• Other Impacts: Some vessels that shift to longer trawls may experience changes in the rate at which gear is lost. In addition, some fishermen may need to modify their vessels or add crew to handle longer trawls.       Given the broad scope of the ALWTRP, a vessel-by-vessel analysis of the costs of complying with these requirements is infeasible. Instead, the analysis is based upon the model vessels defined in the Vertical Line Model. Each model vessel represents a group of vessels that fish in the same area, share other operating characteristics, and would face similar requirements under a given regulatory alternative. As Exhibit 6-1 illustrates, the analysis estimates regulatory compliance costs for each model vessel. This cost estimate is then applied to the population of active vessels that the model represents, and aggregated across this population to estimate regulatory compliance costs for all vessels in a given category.1 The sum of costs across all vessel categories provides an estimate of regulatory compliance costs for the commercial fishing industry as a whole.           1 The population of active vessels that a model vessel represents is based in part on vessel trip reports that indicate the location of fishing activity. Some vessels report activity in multiple areas in a given month. To avoid double-counting in such cases, the analysis assigns the vessel’s activity to each area in proportion to the distribution of trips it reports. For example, if over the course of a month a vessel reports seven trips to Area A and three trips to Area B, the analysis will assign 0.7 active vessels to Area A and 0.3 active vessels to Area B. Thus, all estimates of the number of vessels active in a given area are reported on a full-time equivalent basis; the number of vessels that fish a portion of their gear in the area each month may be higher. The documentation for the Vertical Line Model provides additional information on this issue.
6.2.1 Development of Model Vessels      The first step in analyzing the impacts of trawling requirements is to define the relevant suite of model vessels, i.e., groups of vessels that operate in a similar fashion and thus are likely to face similar compliance costs. The regulations currently imposed under the ALWTRP vary by fishery, location, and time of year. Potential modifications to the ALWTRP, as embodied in the regulatory alternatives under consideration, would follow a similar approach. Thus, compliance costs are likely to vary depending upon the fishery in which a vessel participates, the location in which it operates, and the seasons in which it is active. The model vessels employed in the cost analysis are designed to capture these differences.      In addition, the model vessels are designed to take into account differences in compliance costs that would result from the nature, configuration, and quantity of gear that vessels employ. For example, some lobster vessels fishing in a given region may configure their traps/pots in pairs, while others may already use longer trawls; since this difference could have a significant impact on the costs of complying with trawling requirements, it is important that the cost analysis differentiate between such vessels. Similarly, the configuration of gear and operating characteristics of vessels participating in other trap/pot fisheries could vary significantly depending upon the species they target. For example, vessels that target black sea bass and those that target conch employ different configurations of gear, and thus are likely to face different compliance costs. Again, it is important to differentiate between such vessels in the  cost analysis.      Analysis of the economic impact of the trawling requirements requires comparing the baseline configuration of gear assigned to model vessels in the Vertical Line Model with the new configuration of gear that would be required under each regulatory alternative. This procedure allows assessment of compliance costs for the full suite of possible outcomes. For instance, for the set of lobster vessels fishing in non-exempt state waters in Maine Lobster Zone B, the Vertical Line Model identifies 36 possible gear configuration options, as defined by a matrix that
specifies both the number of traps fished (four categories) and the number of traps per trawl (nine categories). The model relies on survey data to characterize the baseline distribution of  gear configurations within this matrix. The cost analysis then identifies the gear configurations that would be prohibited under each regulatory alternative; vessels that currently fish sets shorter than the required minimum would need to reconfigure their gear. The difference between the baseline configuration and the new configuration of gear that each regulatory alternative would require (which varies by area and alternative) drives the analysis of gear conversion costs; thus, estimates of compliance costs for vessels that are subject to identical requirements will vary depending upon the configuration of gear they currently employ. As described below, the cost analysis takes into account a broad range of “before and after” gear configuration options.6.2.2 Gear Conversion Costs      When vessels convert from shorter sets to longer trawls, one impact is the direct cost of converting gear to the new configuration. These costs include two major elements:• Equipment Costs: Fishing traps in a new configuration may require the use of new equipment. For instance, the use of longer trawls is likely to require additional groundline. These costs may be offset, at least in part, by a reduction in the use of other types of equipment, such as a reduction in the use of vertical line, buoys, etc.• Labor Costs: The costs of converting gear include the implicit value of the time that fishermen spend reconfiguring their equipment.      Exhibit 6-2 illustrates the methodology employed to estimate these costs. As shown, for each regulatory provision applicable to a group of vessels, the analysis identifies new gear conversion requirements (i.e., modifications that are not already specified under existing rules), estimates the material and labor required to bring all gear into compliance, and calculates the resulting cost. For each provision, equipment costs are a function of the quantity of gear to be converted and the unit cost of the materials needed to satisfy the trawling requirement. Labor costs are a function of the time required to implement a specific modification, the quantity of gear to be converted, and the implicit labor rate. All costs are calculated on an incremental basis, taking into account any savings in equipment costs that might result from efforts to comply with new ALWTRP regulations. The discussion below further describes how these costs are estimated.6.2.2.1 Equipment Costs      Vessels that switch to longer trawls as a result of new ALWTRP requirements will incur costs for new equipment, but may also realize savings on components of gear that the new configuration would use less extensively or eliminate entirely. For example, under Alternative 2, the use of singles or doubles in the regulated state waters portion of Maine Lobster Zone B would be prohibited; trap/pot vessels that currently fish singles or doubles would need to switch to trawls of no fewer than three traps in order to comply with the alternative’s requirements. The analysis assumes that the affected vessels would switch to the minimum set length the new requirements would permit – in this case, triples. For vessels that previously fished doubles, this implies an increase in the quantity of groundline and a decrease in the quantity of vertical line
employed. It also implies a decrease in the number of buoys and other gear elements (e.g., weak links) associated with each set. To capture this dynamic, the gear cost analysis compares “before” and “after” gear configurations for each category of affected vessels, identifying the impact of each regulatory alternative on the gear that vessels in that category would employ.      The equipment cost that vessels would incur is also a function of the total number of traps that must be reconfigured. For each model vessel, the cost model itemizes changes in the quantity of all gear elements based on the maximum number of traps fished at any point during the year. In this way, the estimate of gear conversion costs for each model vessel reflects the  cost of reconfiguring all of its gear, not just the subset of traps it may fish in a particular month.      Gear specifications for each model vessel are customized to the relevant fishing area.  The specification of baseline gear use is consistent with typical practices and existing regulatory requirements, while the specification of gear use under each regulatory alternative is based on an
assessment of the changes needed to comply with the new requirements. The factors considered in each case include:• set configuration (i.e., the number of traps and number of endlines per trawl);• the depth at which gear is typically set, combined with a vertical line slack factor (to define vertical line length);• vertical line diameter;• vertical line composition (i.e., the percent of vertical line that is sinking line);• buoy system features (buoy size, number, and type);• the number of anchors (if any) per set;• the length and diameter of any anchor lines;• the distance between traps on a trawl (to define groundline length); and• groundline diameter.2Appendix 6-A details how these parameters vary by fishing area. As explained in the appendix, many of these parameters are based on information provided in McCarron and Tetreault (2012). Additional specifications draw on data provided by state fisheries managers to support development of the Vertical Line Model.      To evaluate the net change in equipment costs associated with fishing longer trawls, the analysis incorporates unit cost information gathered from marine supply retailers. The unit cost estimates represent the average of prices quoted by two major marine supply retailers in the northeast, Friendship Trap and New England Marine and Industrial. This price information was gathered via searches of on-line catalogs as well as personal communication with company representatives. Supplementary information from other retailers provides prices for miscellaneous gear elements.      Fishermen would incur the change in equipment costs when new requirements go into effect, and on an ongoing basis thereafter. To appropriately reflect the opportunity costs associated with such investments, the analysis presents these costs on an annualized basis. The cost model develops the annual cost of the “before” and “after” gear configurations based on standard discounting procedures, employing estimates of the useful life of each gear element. These estimates were developed with guidance from NMFS gear specialists. The calculation of annualized costs is based on a real annual discount rate of seven percent, consistent with current Office of Management and Budget guidelines. All costs are reported in 2011 dollars.           2 The analysis assumes that groundline employed in non-exempt waters is sinking line, consistent with the ALWTRP’s current requirements.
      Appendix 6-A summarizes the unit prices and useful life estimates compiled for all gear elements.6.2.2.2 Labor for Gear Conversion and Associated Costs      In addition to equipment costs, converting trap/pot gear to longer trawls would require an investment of fishermen’s time. The following discussion summarizes the assumptions the analysis employs to estimate the amount of time fishermen are likely to spend reconfiguring their gear, as well as the method used to estimate the implicit value of their time.Labor for Gear Conversion      Numerous factors may influence the amount of time a fisherman is likely to spend on gear conversion, including:• The individual’s skill and experience;• The complexity of the reconfiguration required;• Whether gear is reconfigured on shore or at sea;• For reconfiguration at sea, the distance between sets;• The availability of a sternman to assist with the work; and• The method (knots, splicing, etc.) used to string traps together into trawls.      In the absence of data to support characterization of all of these factors, the labor cost analysis applies a simplified method. Following the recommendation of NMFS gear specialists, the analysis assumes 15 minutes of labor for each trap that must be converted to a new configuration, based on the assumption that the reconfiguration will be performed at sea.3 To determine the number of traps that must be converted, the analysis first calculates, for each model vessel, the number of sets that the new configuration will accommodate. Using the model vessel’s baseline gear configuration as a starting point, it then calculates the number of traps that must be added to each set to reach the target set length. For example, assume as a starting point  a model vessel that under baseline conditions fishes 400 sets of doubles (a total of 800 traps), but under a given regulatory alternative would be required to fish trawls of at least five traps. In this case:• The regulatory alternative will accommodate 160 sets of 5-trap trawls (800/5 = 160);• The analysis takes as a starting point 160 sets of doubles (320 traps);3 Personal communication with NMFS gear specialists, September 24, 2012.
• The remaining 480 traps must be added to these sets to create five-trap trawls;• At 15 minutes per trap, the analysis estimates that 120 labor-hours would be required to reconfigure the 480 traps (480 traps times 0.25 hours per trap).While this approach is highly simplified, it is intended to encompass the suite of considerations noted above. In addition, because it is based upon an estimate of the time required to reconfigure gear at sea, it is designed to be more conservative (i.e., to yield a higher cost estimate) than would be the case if the analysis assumed that the reconfiguration of gear occurred on shore.Labor Cost      The cost model assigns an implicit value to fishermen’s time based on labor rates in professions they would pursue if not involved in fishing. Economists refer to this concept as the “opportunity cost” of time. To identify alternative professions, the analysis relies on responses provided to a survey administered by the Gulf of Maine Research Institute in 2005 (GMRI, 2006). The GMRI survey asked a sample of 1,158 randomly selected lobstermen a variety of questions regarding education, vessel characteristics, fishing effort, and other aspects of their work. Compiled and published in 2006, the survey findings guide a number of assumptions in  the cost and socioeconomic analysis presented in this EIS.      When asked about alternative professions, the GMRI survey respondents most commonly indicated that they would be involved in carpentry, other trades, vessel maintenance, merchant marine activity, or another aspect of commercial fishing (i.e., harvesting other species, boat maintenance). Exhibit 6-3 summarizes the responses.      The cost analysis uses the distribution of responses to develop a weighted average wage rate that reflects the opportunity cost of a fisherman’s time. First, the analysis normalizes the survey responses, eliminating the indeterminate or non-relevant responses (“other”, “don’t know” and “retire”). The analysis then matches the alternative occupations with Bureau of  Labor Statistics (BLS) occupational categories, developing a simple average wage rate for each occupation (or group of occupations) based on the May 2011 mean hourly wage rate reported by BLS. For instance, the survey response “carpentry/trades/mechanic” is assigned an  average wage rate based on the rates that BLS reports for “Carpenters” and for “Automotive Service Technicians and Mechanics”. Finally, the analysis weights the wage rates by the distribution of survey responses to estimate an average opportunity cost of $22.48 per hour.

      The analysis uses this wage rate to characterize the opportunity cost for lobstermen and fishermen who spend time reconfiguring their gear under the proposed requirements.4 For purposes of expressing compliance costs on an annualized basis, the analysis assumes that labor costs would be incurred when the regulations take effect, and amortizes them over a period of five years. This period reflects the approximate length of the ALWTRP’s regulatory review cycle.6.2.2.3 Caveats and Uncertainties      The discussion above highlights several key assumptions in the analysis of gear conversion costs. Chief among these are (1) the specific baseline configurations and gear elements used in each fishing area; (2) the cost and useful life of various gear elements; (3) the amount of labor needed to convert short sets to longer trawls; and (4) the implicit value of fishermen’s time. There are uncertainties associated with each of these assumptions, but the overall direction of any potential bias in the resulting estimates of gear conversion costs is unclear.      It is noteworthy that the analysis of gear conversion costs results in net cost savings for some groups of vessels. This occurs when trawling implies lower expenditures on key gear elements. For instance, vessels fishing in the Federal waters of Lobster Management Area (LMA) 1 are likely to employ relatively sophisticated and expensive buoy systems. If trawling reduces the number of sets fished and the number of buoys used, the result is reflected as a net cost savings, even after accounting for investments of time needed to reconfigure gear. While  the analysis incorporates these impacts, it also recognizes the potential for other costs – in particular, adverse impacts on catch rates – to offset any savings implied by estimates of changes in gear costs. The following section discusses these impacts in greater detail.6.2.3 Catch Impacts Associated with Trawling Requirements      The analysis of compliance costs associated with trawling requirements recognizes the potential for impacts on landings under certain conditions. Fishermen use singles and other short sets for a variety of reasons. In some cases, short sets may allow fishermen to target especially productive bottom structure where longer trawls may be inefficient or difficult to haul (e.g., because of fouling on bottom structure). This advantage may be most prevalent in  rocky habitats, including those around islands. Second, short sets can be distributed more widely than trawled traps. Wide distribution may aid in the search for the target species. Likewise, wide distribution may reduce competition between traps, increasing the catch per unit of effort.      Data to support a quantitative analysis of trawling effects on catch are extremely limited. Because multiple factors influence catch rates (gear configuration, gear density, the abundance of the target species, bottom structure, soak time, individual skill, etc.), it is difficult to isolate the effect of trawl configuration on catch. The Maine Department of Marine Resources (DMR)           4 The approach the analysis employs to value the opportunity cost of time treats the time required to  comply with new ALWTRP requirements as time that would otherwise be invested in productive activity, rather than leisure. This approach provides a conservative (i.e., higher) estimate of the cost of complying with new regulations.
developed and implemented a project designed, in part, to assess the impacts of longer trawls on catch in the lobster fishery (DMR, 2012). Participants hauled roughly 2,300 sets of gear in control configurations (singles and doubles) and 835 sets of gear in trawls ranging from triples to tens. The research found no statistically significant reduction in catch per trap when comparing the control configurations to the experimental configurations.      Despite this finding, industry experts believe it is possible, and in some instances likely, that changes in gear configuration could have an adverse impact on catch. Experts from the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries, for example, have called attention to the potential for catch impacts in the inshore lobster fishery around Cape Cod, where single traps are routinely fished.5 Research has demonstrated that the optimal spacing of lobster traps depends upon the abundance of lobster in an area; the greater the density of lobster, the greater the density of traps that can be fished without an adverse impact on catch per trap (Schreiber, 2010). The use of singles in the Cape region is partly attributable to this dynamic. The density of lobsters in these waters is lower than it is off the Maine coast; under these conditions, traps that are placed relatively close together – as would be the case when fishing trawls – are more likely to compete with one another in attracting lobsters. As a result, traps fished in trawls around the Cape might be less productive than traps fished as singles.6      Lacking any systematic data linking gear configuration and catch rate, the analysis applies a simplified approach to characterize potential impacts. To recognize the potential for catch impacts to be greater when gear configurations change markedly, it first classifies affected vessels into two categories:• Category A – Those subject to relatively large increases in trawl length, defined as an increase of a factor of two or more in the number of traps in each set; and• Category B – Those subject to smaller increases in the number of traps in each set.The analysis then incorporates two scenarios designed to provide a reasonable estimate of the range of potential catch impacts:• Lower Bound – In the lower bound scenario, the analysis assumes that vessels in Category A experience a five percent reduction in annual catch. The catch of vessels in Category B is assumed to be unaffected.• Upper Bound – In the upper bound scenario, the analysis assumes that all vessels in Category A experience a 10 percent reduction in annual catch, while those in Category B experience a five percent reduction.5 Personal communication with Massachusetts DMF, November 7, 2012.           6 Personal communication with Massachusetts DMF, November 7, 2012. DMF also  noted  that several ports on the Outer Cape have sandbars that can only be cleared when the tide is high. Fishermen access and haul their traps in a relatively narrow window of time each day. While trawl fishermen tend to haul more gear to make  up for lower catch rates, this may not be an option for those whose ability to exit and return to port is limited by the tides.
The impact of a reduction in catch on a vessel’s annual landings is calculated as follows:   Baseline Catch per Trap (pounds/trap) x Traps Fished (traps/year) x Catch Reduction (%)Similarly, the reduction in annual landings is converted to a loss in annual revenue using the following equation:Reduction in Catch (pounds/year) x Ex-Vessel Price ($/pound)Exhibit 6-4 summarizes the source and value of key parameters applied in the analysis. For example, in Maine Lobster Management Zones A through G, the estimated annual catch per trap (33.5 pounds) is an average of two figures: (1) the annual catch per trap reported for the Gulf of Maine in the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission’s most recent Lobster Stock Assessment (2009); and (2) the average annual catch per trap reported by LMA 1 lobstermen in the GMRI survey (2006). At an ex-vessel price of $3.21 per pound – the average price reported for landings in Maine from 2009 through 2011 – this translates to annual revenues of $107.57 per trap. Thus, a five to ten percent reduction in catch implies a reduction in annual revenues of$5.38 to $10.76 per trap.      It is vital to note that the assumptions applied in estimating potential catch impacts are generalized, and the magnitude of such impacts is highly uncertain. A given vessel may experience catch changes greater or less than the impacts assumed in the analysis. These impacts may diminish over time, as fishermen adapt to new gear configurations and learn to fish longer trawls more efficiently. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that changes in gear configurations could have an overall impact on catch rates. The analysis does so, applying a range of assumptions to illustrate the potential magnitude of this effect.6.2.4 Other Potential Impacts Associated with Gear Configuration Requirements      The analysis does not attempt to quantify several other impacts potentially associated with changes in ALWTRP gear configuration requirements. These include:• Costs associated with increased gear loss;• The potential need for a larger crew to handle longer trawls;• Vessel modification costs;• Costs for various gear requirements proposed for trap fisheries in the southeast Atlantic;• Savings that may result under Alternatives 3, 5, and 6 (Draft) as a result of exempting gear in New Hampshire state waters from existing gear modification requirements (e.g., the requirement to use sinking groundline); and• Savings that may result under Alternative 6 (Preferred) as a result of establishing a quarter-mile buffer around select islands on the Maine coast; trawling requirements would not apply in these buffer areas.

The analysis addresses these impacts qualitatively, either because data to develop reasonable estimates are lacking or because available information suggests the impacts will be relatively small. The subsections below address each of these costs in greater detail.6.2.4.1 Gear Loss Costs      Some gear configuration requirements affecting fixed-gear fisheries have the potential to affect rates of gear loss. Substantial changes in equipment losses can have important cost implications, and should therefore be examined carefully.      The impact of minimum trawl length requirements on gear loss in trap/pot fisheries is difficult to predict with confidence. The uncertainty is largely attributable to the array of underlying factors responsible for gear loss. On the one hand, longer trawls may increase the likelihood that groundline will foul on bottom structure, increasing the potential for line to part while hauling traps. Longer trawls may also increase the potential for gear conflicts, particularly situations in which one fisherman’s gear is laid across another’s. In these cases, one party may inadvertently sever another’s lines, making it impossible to retrieve all or some of the gear. A longer trawl also increases the consequences of such incidents; i.e., the more gear on a single trawl, the more gear is lost when that trawl is rendered irretrievable.      In other ways, trawling requirements may reduce the potential for gear loss. The fundamental objective of longer trawls is to limit the number of vertical lines in the water column and reduce encounters with large whales; such encounters are one possible source of gear loss. Likewise, a decrease in the number of vertical lines may reduce the frequency with which gear is entangled in ship propellers or certain types of fishing gear. Furthermore, in areas where trawling requirements necessitate addition of a second endline (e.g., for a vessel going from triples to ten-trap trawls), the second endline may make it easier to locate and retrieve gear when one endline is lost. Longer trawls are also heavier and may be less likely to be swept away during extreme storm or tidal events.      Available data assessing how trawling requirements could affect gear loss are inconclusive. The Maine DMR trawling project (discussed above) asked participants to record whether they lost gear while hauling. An analysis of the raw data provided by DMR shows that of the roughly 3,100 sets of gear, 28 were lost. Of the lost sets, all but six were trawls of three traps or longer. While this outcome suggests a potential increase in gear loss when trawls are required, nine of the lost sets were seven- and 10-trap trawls fished with a single endline (an intentional feature of the project design). This gear configuration is unlikely in normal practice and would not be required by any of the alternatives that NMFS is considering. Furthermore, the participants fished the trawls on an experimental basis; for example, they may have intentionally placed some trawls on bottom structure unsuited to the experimental configuration. Overall, the sample of gear loss incidents in the project is too small to draw reliable conclusions about how trawling influences gear loss.      In 2010 and 2011, the Massachusetts DMF completed a comprehensive study of gear loss and “ghost” fishing (i.e., impacts from lost or derelict gear). Roughly 520 Massachusetts lobstermen responded to the survey (about 59 percent of all the lobstermen permitted in the Commonwealth); the responses were distributed across LMAs 1, 2, 3, and the Outer Cape in approximate proportion to lobstering activity. Respondents characterized the extent of their gear
loss in different seasons and discussed the perceived causes of gear loss. Exhibit 6-5 summarizes key information gathered in the survey. The findings demonstrate that gear loss is common and represents a significant cost for many lobstermen.Exhibit 6-5SUMMARY OF FINDINGS FROM MASSACHUSETTS DMF GEAR LOSS AND GHOST GEAR SURVEYLMA Average Number of Traps Lost per VesselPrimary Causes of Gear LossAverage Value of Gear Lost per Vessel110 to 23Storm events and vessel traffic$640 to $1,570Outer Cape14 to 34Storm events and vessel traffic$1,410 to $2,95028 to 21Vessel traffic and bottom hang ups$570 to $1,500319 to 46Gear conflicts, line wear, storm events$3,860 to $7,140Source: Massachusetts DMF, 2011      The survey also included questions about typical gear configurations, allowing DMF to examine how gear loss varies with trawl length. Exhibit 6-6 summarizes the findings. The minimum gear loss rates reported for each configuration show slightly higher losses associated with singles. The maximum rates more strongly suggest that gear loss is greater when fishing singles and doubles than when trawls of three or more traps are used.  Overall, these data  indicate that rather than exacerbating gear loss, trawling requirements may reduce the amount of gear lost and thereby yield an economic benefit to affected fishermen.Exhibit 6-6INFLUENCE OF CONFIGURATION ON GEAR LOSS: MASSACHUSETTS DMF GEAR LOSS AND GHOST GEAR SURVEYConfigurationTrap Loss RateMinimumMaximumSingles2.7%21.4%Doubles1.6%19.3%Trawls (three or more traps)2.1%8.7%Source: Massachusetts DMF, 2011      Overall, the effect of trawling on gear loss is unclear. While data from the Maine  trawling project suggest some potential for increased gear loss during fishermen’s transition to trawls, the more extensive data from the Massachusetts ghost gear survey suggest that trawls are less subject to gear loss in steady-state conditions. Gear loss is likely a function of numerous variables that extend well beyond the trawl configuration, including bottom structure, shipping traffic, gear density, gear conflicts, tides, currents, and weather events. The net effect of trawling in the context of all these variables is difficult to characterize or quantify. Hence, the cost estimates discussed in this chapter do not explicitly incorporate the impact of gear loss changes.6.2.4.2 Addition of Crew      Fishermen operating alone could potentially have difficulty handling the longer trawls required under some of the regulatory alternatives. The physical demands of hauling trawls may be challenging for fishermen who haul by hand rather than with a mechanized hauler. Even with
a hauler, older fishermen may find it difficult to manage longer trawls. Addition of a sternman  or other crew is one possible response for affected vessels. However, fishing alone is relatively uncommon on most vessels in ALWTRP-regulated waters. In addition, the cost of adding crew  is prohibitive for most vessel operators. The subsections below present data suggesting that the addition of crew is unlikely as a response to the trawling requirements.Crew on Affected Vessels      Numerous lobstermen and OTP fishermen choose to fish alone, primarily for economic reasons. To the extent that the desired quantity of gear can be hauled safely and efficiently without a sternman, vessel operators are likely to avoid the cost of additional crew (see below). The GMRI socioeconomic survey (2006) asked respondents (lobstermen landing more than 1,000 pounds) about their typical crew size (including the captain). A significant share of lobstermen fish alone, ranging from 19 percent in Maine Zone C to 66 percent in the LMA 2 portion of Massachusetts waters. It is important to note, however, that the GMRI data do not distinguish between inshore vessels and vessels fishing further offshore, an important predictor of crew size. In particular, it is important to consider crew size in exempt versus non-exempt waters.      In Maine, where many affected vessels operate, data suggest that a large share of lobstermen fishing alone operate in waters that would be exempt from the trawling requirements. While comprehensive data on crew size are not available, Maine DMR data on lobster licenses indicate the maximum crew per vessel. Permits coded LCO (for operators over 70 years of age) or LC 1 allow only the operator to fish; LC 2 and LC 3 permits allow for one and two sternmen, respectively.7 A variety of other licenses are issued to students, minors, and other groups.      The permit classification data were linked to data from DMR’s Annual Logs Survey, a 2010 survey of Maine lobstermen.8 The supplemented data allow a more detailed analysis of the geographic area fished by vessels with only the captain on board. Exhibit 6-7 demonstrates that while about 16 percent of vessels in exempt waters hold permits restricting crew to the vessel operator, only about seven percent of vessels in non-exempt state waters are similarly restricted. Likewise, the vast majority of vessels fishing in Federal waters hold licenses that allow for one or more sternmen. Overall, these data suggest that a small percentage of Maine vessels in ALWTRP-regulated waters fish without a sternman. Furthermore, the data indicate that a very small percentage of these vessels are operated by older captains who might have particular difficulty managing trawls.           7 Note that the permit types designate the maximum crew allowed, not actual crew; e.g., an operator with an LC 2 license could fish without a sternman. Therefore, the analysis may understate the actual number of vessels  with no crew.           8 The Vertical Line Model bases its characterization of gear use by Maine lobster vessels in large part on information obtained from the Annual Logs Survey. Issued in 2010 to all Maine lobstermen, the survey requested information on gear configurations and the location of fishing effort, specifying one or more of 21 areas. Approximately 2,100 lobstermen responded to the survey.

As part of supplemental reporting for permit renewal, DMF asks vessel operators to report the size crew the vessel typically carries. Linking these data to 2009 Catch Report data enables a comprehensive analysis of crew size. Exhibit 6-8 summarizes the distribution of crew size for all lobster and other trap/pot vessels in all months and waters. As shown, about 30 percent of all vessel operators report that they fish alone. This practice is especially predominant in inshore areas. Unlike Maine, however, most of these inshore areas are subject to ALWTRP requirements (i.e., the geographic extent of exempt waters is extremely limited). Nonetheless, the majority of potentially affected vessels already fish with a crew.Exhibit 6-8       DISTRIBUTION OF VESSELS BY CREW SIZE: ACTIVE LOBSTER AND OTP VESSELS IN MASSACHUSETTSOperator OnlyOne Crew MemberTwo or More Crew MembersNot Reporting30.3%44.7%13.5%11.4%Source: Analysis of Massachusetts DMF Permit and Catch Report data (2009).Sternman Costs      Vessel operators choose to work with crew primarily for economic reasons. For instance, a sternman may be cost-effective when lobster abundance is high, harvests are large, and fishing effort is high. Sternmen may also be hired for non-economic reasons, such as safety in offshore waters and for apprenticing purposes.      Sternmen are typically paid a percentage of the vessel’s gross (or sometimes net) revenue. Exhibit 6-9 summarizes data from GMRI’s 2005 survey of lobstermen in the Gulf of Maine.9 As the exhibit indicates, payments to sternmen represent a substantial operating cost. A single sternman may be paid roughly 20 percent of gross revenue. On offshore vessels that typically operate with multiple crew members, sternmen may be paid a third of gross revenues.           9 Figures are adjusted to 2011 dollars using the Gross Domestic Product Implicit Price Deflator index provided in the Economic Report of the President, 2012.

If an operator fishes alone, trawling requirements are not likely to alter that preference. Moreover, the  available data suggest that vessel operators who work without a sternman are not necessarily limited to fishing singles. For example, of the Massachusetts lobster and OTP vessel operators who work alone, over two-thirds already fish trawls of three or more traps.10 Anecdotal discussions with fisheries managers also indicate that trawls are routinely fished by vessel operators working alone.11      Nonetheless, the physical demands of hauling trawls may prove to be a challenge to some lone operators. In Maine, these vessels may have the option of relocating to exempt waters. Beyond this option, it is possible that the trawling requirements may force some fishermen to fundamentally reconsider their operations, including crew choices. For instance, an operator fishing alone may choose to hire a sternman, fish more traps, and possibly move to a new location. NMFS does not believe such changes will be widespread, and the analysis does not reflect the cost of such major operational shifts.6.2.4.3 Vessel Modification      For a variety of reasons, operators of smaller vessels may find it difficult to fish trawls. Some small vessels, for example, may lack the deck space to accommodate trawls. Experts with Maine DMR, however, note that in some cases, operators of smaller vessels have made it feasible to use trawls by affixing plywood sheeting to the stern or the rail of their vessels, thus extending the available deck space.12 The operators of small vessels affected by the proposed trawling requirements may choose to make similar modifications.      Estimating the number of vessels that would need this type of modification would require data on vessel size and other features that are not readily available; thus, the estimate of10 Based on analysis of MA DMF permit and 2009 Catch Report data.11 Personal communications with Maine DMR (August 30, 2012) and Massachusetts DMF (November 7,

compliance costs does not specifically incorporate vessel modification costs. All else equal, the exclusion of these costs biases the estimate downward. In aggregate, however, these costs are likely to be relatively low; thus, the magnitude of any bias is likely to be minor.6.2.4.4 Requirements for Southeast Trap/Pot Fisheries      As described in Chapter 3, Alternatives 2 through 6 (Preferred) include a set of special requirements for trap/pot gear in the Southeast region, which would affect the blue crab and OTP fisheries operating in ALWTRP-regulated waters off the coasts of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. In waters off South Carolina and Georgia, the alternatives would require affected  vessels to fish singles; use weak links with a breaking strength no greater than 600 pounds; use vertical line with a breaking strength no greater than 2,200 pounds; and use vertical line that is free of weights and knots. The requirements for waters off Florida are similar, but specify 200- pound weak links and the use of sink rope with a breaking strength no greater than 1,500-pounds over the entire length of each vertical line. In addition, the alternatives would require trap/pot gear set in Federal waters in the Southeast to be returned to shore at the conclusion of each trip, effectively prohibiting overnight sets of this gear. All vessels operating in regulated waters would also be required to adhere to ALWTRP gear-marking conventions.      Research suggests that current practices are largely consistent with the gear configuration requirements outlined above; therefore, the cost of complying with them is unlikely to be significant.13 NMFS’ Southeast Regional Office (SERO) has verified that most affected vessels currently use singles; this observation is consistent with research performed in developing the Vertical Line Model. In addition, SERO inspections suggest that fishermen are already using weak links of the recommended breaking strength. The consistency of current practices with the remaining gear configuration requirements is slightly less certain, but for the reasons noted below, significant compliance costs are unlikely:• SERO indicates that most fishermen already use rope with the proposed breaking strength.• In addition, SERO indicates that the use of sinking material across the entire length of each vertical line is already required for traps/pots set in South Carolina state waters and is standard practice off the coast of Georgia. SERO is less certain whether the use of sinking material across the entire length of vertical line is standard practice in the waters off Florida.• The requirement for vertical line to be free of knots, weights, and splices raises greater uncertainty, but the available data suggest that current practice is largely consistent with this requirement. NOAA Enforcement inspections in Florida found a small number of crabbers (two or three) with non-continuous line. In addition to finding limited use of non-           13 Personal communication with Jessica Powell of NMFS/Southeast Regional Office and Richard Chesler  of NOAA Enforcement, September 17, 2012.
continuous line, NOAA Enforcement notes that Florida crabbers fish in shallow water (30 to 40 feet), so the need for splicing is fairly minimal.      A simple worst-case illustration suggests that complying with the requirement to use continuous sinking line of the proper breaking strength would impose relatively modest costs on vessels in the southeast blue crab and OTP fisheries, even if these requirements necessitated replacement of all of a vessel’s vertical line. If a vessel fishes 200 traps in 40 feet of water, it would require approximately 8,000 feet of vertical line. At a price of approximately $0.053 per foot, this quantity of line would cost approximately $424.14 Amortized over the useful life of the line, these costs would have little influence on the profit of any single vessel. Moreover, operators of these vessels could choose to avoid the cost by relocating their effort to exempt waters.      The prohibition on overnight sets in the Southeast region’s Federal waters would likely affect a subset of vessels in the blue crab fishery, but the data available on activity in these waters suggest that the impact would be limited. The majority of blue crab effort in  the Southeast occurs in exempt waters landward of the COLREGS line; therefore, the number of vessels that would be affected by a change in requirements for Federal waters would be small. Southeast Logbook data show no crabbing activity in Federal waters; however, a number of Georgia and South Carolina fishermen who commented on the DEIS at public hearings indicated that they occasionally set gear in Federal waters.15 State fisheries experts confirm this, noting  that this activity tends to peak from December through March, when blue crabs typically migrate to deeper water in search of more desirable salinity and temperature conditions.16 A one-time survey performed by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources (DNR) indicates that approximately 25 fishermen harvested blue crab in ocean waters in the winter months of 2009 (George, 2010). These fishermen collectively placed about 400 to 500 traps in Federal waters; the same fishermen fished roughly three times as many pots in state waters. Based on this  survey, DNR estimates that roughly 12 to 25 fishermen might fish a portion of their traps in Federal waters at some point during the year. South Carolina data show even fewer vessels operating in Federal waters; in 2010, only one vessel fished in South Carolina’s ocean waters, suggesting that activity in Federal waters was negligible that year.      The prohibition on overnight sets would likely eliminate fishing for blue crab in Federal waters, since returning gear to port each night is impractical. In years when the crabs’ migration falls short of Federal waters, this would have little or no impact on landings. In others, however, the prohibition on overnight sets in Federal waters would force fishermen to restrict their effort to state waters, and would likely lead to a reduction in landings. Characterizing the landings loss is difficult given the lack of location-specific data and the annual variation in fishing conditions. A rough, upper-bound estimate for the Georgia fishery is possible using the limited data           14 This figure is based on the list price for a 1,000-foot spool of Osprey #8 sinking crab pot rope, as specified by a supplier in North Carolina (mikekellerltd.com).           15 State fisheries experts indicate that blue crab fishermen typically report the estuary in which they set  most of their gear as the location of their activity. This may explain the absence of Logbook data on crabbing activity in Federal waters.           16 Personal communication with Clay George and Doug Haymans, Georgia Department of Natural Resources, December 19, 2013.
available. In 2009 (the year of the DNR survey), about 65 crabbers fished during the winter months (December through March). The DNR survey estimates that a maximum of 25 of these fishermen (38 percent) fished in Federal waters. The survey also suggests that these fishermen fished about one-quarter of their traps in Federal waters; this is equivalent to approximately 9.5 percent of all gear fished during the winter period. NMFS dealer data indicate that Georgia crabbers landed about $896,000 in blue crab during the winter of 2009. Pro-rating this figure suggests that gear set in Federal waters accounted for approximately $85,000 in gross revenue during 2009. It is unlikely, however, that all of this revenue would be lost. Some might be recovered by relocating gear to state waters during the winter months, and some might be recovered at other times of the year, as the crabs return inshore. Overall, the prohibition on overnight sets could prevent a small subset of crabbers from maximizing their harvests in certain years, but it is unlikely to create substantial economic losses in the fishery.      Given these considerations, the quantitative economic impact estimates presented in this chapter do not include gear conversion or other costs related to potential new requirements in the Southeast. The only costs for Southeast blue crab and OTP vessels that are incorporated into these estimates are those associated with new gear marking provisions, which under Alternatives 2 through 6 (Preferred) would apply to all fisheries that are subject to ALWTRP requirements (see discussion below).6.2.4.5 Exemption for New Hampshire State Waters      As previously noted, Alternatives 3, 5, 6 (Draft), and 6 (Preferred) would exempt trap/pot gear in New Hampshire state waters from minimum trawl length requirements. Alternatives 3, 5, and 6 (Draft) also would exempt gear in these waters from all other provisions of the ALWTRP except for gear marking requirements. While the economic analysis takes the exemption from minimum trawl length requirements into account in estimating the costs of complying with Alternatives 3, 5, 6 (Draft), and 6 (Preferred), it does not attempt to estimate potential cost savings associated with exempting gear in New Hampshire waters from the ALWTRP’s existing gear requirements (e.g., the requirement to use sinking groundline). It is likely that an exemption from these requirements would reduce operating costs for vessels fishing in New Hampshire waters. To the extent that this is the case, the analysis of gear conversion costs will overstate the costs of complying with Alternatives 3, 5, and 6 (Draft).6.2.4.6 Buffer Areas for Maine Islands      Alternative 6 (Preferred) would establish quarter-mile buffer areas around three Maine islands: Matinicus Island, Ragged Island (located adjacent to Matinicus), and Monhegan Island. Vessels fishing in these areas would not be subject to minimum trawl length requirements. The rationale for the buffers, described further in Chapter 3, focuses on the likely absence of whales in close proximity to these islands and bottom conditions that favor the use of single traps.      Relative to the other action alternatives, the designation of a quarter-mile buffer zone around Matinicus, Ragged, and Monhegan Islands would reduce compliance costs for vessels fishing singles in these waters. The effect is difficult to quantify, since the available data on the location of trap/pot activity is insufficiently precise to characterize the concentration of gear within these areas. Those familiar with the islands, however, note that the quantity of gear likely
to be set within the buffer areas is small. Experts at the Island Institute, a non-profit organization devoted to protecting Maine’s remote island and coastal communities, indicate that only five to 10 lobstermen work the waters around Monhegan.17 Likewise, only about 10 to 15 lobstermen fish the waters surrounding Matinicus and Ragged Islands. Those fishing closest to the islands (many of whom are nearing retirement or are young entrants learning the trade) tend to use smaller vessels and fewer traps, further limiting the quantity of gear affected.18 Thus, while the establishment of buffer areas would likely reduce compliance costs for a small number of vessels, this measure is unlikely to have a substantial impact on compliance costs for the lobster fishery as a whole and is not taken into account in estimating the cost of complying with Alternative 6 (Preferred).6.3 ANALYTIC APPROACH: SEASONAL CLOSURES      As described in detail in Chapter 3, Alternatives 3 through 6 (Preferred) include provisions that would close certain areas to trap/pot gear during specified periods. Analysis of available data on vessel activity indicates that the practical impact of these provisions would be limited to the lobster fishery, since vessels in other trap/pot fisheries do not appear to be active in the areas of interest when a closure would be in effect. How a lobster vessel is likely to respond to a given closure depends on the features of the closure as well as the unique economic incentives facing the vessel operator. In general, vessel operators will likely choose one of two responses:• Relocate – It may be possible for vessel operators to fish for lobster in other areas during the closure period. The potential for relocation depends on many factors, including regulatory restrictions on access to alternative areas, the distance to those grounds, the productivity of the grounds, and the potential for competition with others to limit access to a new area.• Suspend Fishing – If alternative fishing grounds are not readily available, vessel operators may suspend fishing while their regular grounds are closed and resume fishing in the area when the closure ends.These responses have different implications for economic welfare, and affected fishermen may respond differently, depending upon individual circumstances. The discussion that follows examines this issue, beginning with a brief review of the literature on the effect of area closures on commercial fisheries. It then describes the general approach the analysis employs to analyze the costs associated with closures. Finally, it examines each of the proposed closures individually, describing how affected vessels are likely to respond.

Department of Marine Resources and the Maine Legislature. The agreement limits fishing to  250 days from  October to June and allows a maximum of 400 traps per vessel. Personal communication  with Erin Summers, Maine Department of Marine Resources, January 13, 2014.
6.3.1 Review of the Literature on Closure Impacts      To inform the analysis of closure impacts, NMFS conducted a brief review of methods that other studies have employed to evaluate similar actions. Exhibit 6-10 summarizes  the  results of this review. The research identified no studies that employed methods directly applicable to analysis of the closures under consideration. In particular, none of the recent  studies address the fisheries and areas that would be subject to seasonal closures under Alternatives 3 through 6 (Preferred). In addition, several of the studies apply quantitative methodologies requiring detailed, vessel-specific information on fishing location, landings, and other parameters. This type of information is not available for the vast majority of vessels that the closures under consideration would affect.      Despite these limitations, the literature identifies several concepts that help inform analysis of the economic impacts of a closure:• First, most of the studies focus on two fundamental responses to closures: suspending fishing or relocating fishing effort. The analysis presented  here examines both potential responses.• Second, the studies emphasize the high degree of uncertainty regarding the potential impact of a closure. To reflect this uncertainty, the analysis applies methods that yield a range of estimated economic impacts.• Finally, at least one study found a tendency for affected vessels to relocate to the perimeter of the closed area. As discussed below, we  apply a similar assumption as a default when available data do not allow a more detailed analysis of relocation options.Exhibit 6-10LITERATURE ON FISHERY CLOSURE IMPACTSAuthorYearFisheryApproaches and/or Major FindingsNMFS2006Sea Scallop Dredge Fishery(Mid-Atlantic)Study assumed that 100 percent of affected vessels would cease fishing during the May through November scallopclosure in the Mid-Atlantic.Power and Abeare2009VariousStudy applied an Ideal Free Distribution model to assess closure effects. This technique uses optimization methods to predict where vessels will relocate. The approach assumesthat vessels will move to locations that offer the greatest catch or profitability.Murawski, et al.2008Groundfish (New England)Study examined redistribution of effort in response to 1994 groundfish closure in New England. It found evidence ofeffort intensification within five kilometers of the closed area.Goni, et al.2006Spiny Lobster(Mediterranean)Study found that vessels initially congregated around theclosed area but later relocated to avoid traffic and congestion.Rijnsdorp, et al.2001Dutch Beam TrawlStudy demonstrates the potential for temporal shifts in effort following a closure. Dutch trawlers quickly returned to a codfishing area after a seasonal closure and fished the area intensively for approximately two weeks thereafter.
6.3.2 Costs of Suspending Fishing      Fishermen may respond to closures by suspending fishing during the closure period. The forgone revenue associated with inactivity would be the primary cost for fishermen who choose to sit out closures. The sections below describe the general methodological approach used to estimate costs for trap/pot vessels that suspend fishing activity.6.3.2.1 Catch per Trap      The analysis of the cost of suspending fishing is based on estimates of revenue per trap, which are then used to estimate forgone revenue based on the number of traps fished on affected vessels. The estimates of revenue impacts are tailored to the area and season each closure would affect. In each case, the analysis incorporates catch-per-trap estimates based on the best  available data. For the Jeffreys Ledge (Alternative 4 & 5) and Jordan Basin (Alternative 4 & 5) closures, the analysis relies upon data from GMRI’s 2005 survey of lobster fishermen. Respondents fishing in LMAs 1, 2, and 3 reported their average landings and traps fished during each quarter of the year; Exhibit 6-11 summarizes the survey findings and the resulting estimates of catch per trap. To estimate catch per trap during the closure period, the analysis weights the relevant quarterly catch-per-trap figures to conform to the period of each closure and the relevant LMA. For example, the analysis of the Jeffreys Ledge closure is based on the catch-per-trap data for LMA 1, applying weights of 1.0 to the fourth quarter catch-per-trap figure (October through December) and 0.33 to the first quarter figure (January).Exhibit 6-11CATCH PER TRAP ESTIMATES BASED ON GMRI SURVEYLMANumber ofSurvey RespondentsQuarterTraps per VesselPounds LandedCatch perTrap (Pounds)1N=91814438591.924812,9096.0355711,07119.9455010,67819.4Annual55725,51745.82N=20513677842.123941,9374.934504,84610.844482,5395.7Annual45010,10622.53N=3311,0415,6185.421,03012,06611.731,05525,97024.641,03529,49728.5Annual1,05573,15169.3
      For the closure of the Cape Cod Bay Restricted Area (Alternative 3), Massachusetts Restricted Area #1 (Alternatives 4 & 5), and Massachusetts Restricted Area #2 (Alternative 6 Draft and 6 Preferred), the analysis incorporates catch per trap estimates based on Massachusetts DMF’s Catch Report data. Using 2011 data, DMF compiled information for each statistical reporting area (SRA) on landings and traps fished in each month. These data enable estimation  of catch per trap figures that are tailored to the specific geographic areas and months affected by each closure. Specifically, the catch-per-trap estimate for each closure is a weighted average of the seasonal catch per trap in the affected SRAs. The weights represent the percent of all the  gear affected by the closure that is associated with the given SRA. For instance, if gear from SRA 6 represents 10 percent of all the gear displaced by the closure in February, a weight of 0.1 is applied to the February SRA 6 catch per trap figure. The weights are developed using NMFS’ Vertical Line Model. Exhibit 6-12 presents the final catch per trap figures estimated for each of the Cape Cod closures.Exhibit 6-12CATCH PER TRAP ESTIMATES FOR CAPE COD CLOSURESAreaMonthsRegulatory AlternativesAffected SRAsCatch per Trap During Closure Period (Pounds)CCB Restricted AreaFeb - Apr36, 7, 8, 192.77Massachusetts Restricted Area #1Jan - Apr4 & 55, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 18, 196.08Massachusetts Restricted Area #2Jan - Apr6 Draft and 6Preferred5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 18, 196.08Source: Analysis of Massachusetts DMF Catch Report data (2011).6.3.2.2 Revenue per Trap      Catch per trap is combined with ex-vessel price data to estimate gross revenue per trap. At the time this analysis was developed, the NMFS Dealer data provided ex-vessel prices through 2011. To characterize typical market conditions, the analysis incorporates price data for the three most recent years available (2009 to 2011).19 To align prices with the area-and season- specific catch-per-trap data, the analysis uses ex-vessel price data from the states and months relevant to each closure.      Gross revenue per trap is the product of the catch per trap and the applicable ex-vessel price for each closure. A final adjustment is needed to convert gross revenue per trap to net revenue per trap. Fishermen who suspend fishing during closures will forgo revenue but will save the operating costs associated with the effort (while continuing to pay fixed costs such as boat payments). Operating costs are the costs that vary with fishing effort, and primarily include bait, fuel, and payments to sternmen (when relevant). The GMRI survey (as summarized in Thunberg, 2007) characterized operating costs as a percent of gross revenue for each of the three major LMAs, as shown in Exhibit 6-13. Operating costs as a percent of gross revenue range           19 All price information is adjusted to 2011 dollars using the Gross Domestic Product Implicit Price Deflator index provided in the Economic Report of the President, 2012.
from a total of 23 percent (LMA 2, no sternman aboard) to a high of 56 percent (LMA 3, sternmen aboard).20Exhibit 6-13OPERATING COSTS AS A PERCENT OF GROSS REVENUECost ElementLMA 1LMA 2LMA 3No SternmanSternmanNo SternmanSternmanSternmanSternman PayN.A.21%N.A.17%32%Fuel and Bait26%23%23%21%24%Total26%44%23%38%56%Source: Thunberg, 2007      The analysis applies these figures to the estimates of gross revenue per trap to calculate revenue per trap net of operating cost savings. Lacking definitive data on crew size, the analysis applies the mid-point of the “with sternman” and “without sternman” figures to estimate revenue per trap net of operating cost savings.21      Exhibit 6-14 summarizes the parameters used to estimate lost revenue per trap for each closure. As discussed further below, the analysis includes a closure-specific estimate of the number of traps fished per vessel. Thus, the impact of the closure on the net revenue of each affected vessel is the product of the number of traps the vessel would ordinarily fish in the closed area and the estimate of forgone revenue per trap, net of operating cost savings.6.3.2.3 Transition Costs      In addition to costs incurred within the closure period, vessels suspending fishing will likely incur transition costs preceding and following the closure. Specifically, vessels will need to remove gear from the closed area in advance of the closure start date in order to ensure that no gear remains in the restricted area when the closure begins. Likewise, at the end of the closure period, vessels returning gear to the restricted area will reset it incrementally until all traps are in place.      Based on discussion with NMFS gear experts, the analysis assumes that most lobster vessels can haul/remove 60 traps per trip and set 80 traps per trip.22 For instance, if a vessel           20 Note that these figures are consistent with those reported in earlier studies. In 1995, a University of Rhode Island study estimated operating costs of 34 percent, 32 percent, and 71 percent, respectively, for the northern inshore, southern inshore, and offshore segments of the lobster fishery. In 1989, Liebzeit and Allen found percentages ranging from 30 to 56 percent, depending upon the state (Massachusetts and Rhode Island) and vessel size.           21 Most vessels in regulated waters fish with a sternman aboard; therefore, the estimates of lost revenue per trap may slightly overstate the loss most vessels would incur.           22 The analysis assumes that any large offshore vessels affected by a closure would be capable of pulling or resetting 120 traps per trip.
fishes 300 traps, it can remove these traps over the course of five days. As more traps are removed, the loss in net revenues increases. Similarly, net revenue losses diminish as traps are reset. The magnitude of transition costs for each particular closure is a function of the total number of traps that affected vessels fish, as well as the unique net revenue per trap figures that apply to the closure.6.3.2.4 Caveats      Ex-vessel prices for lobster are a key factor in estimating the losses associated with suspending fishing. The estimates of net revenue per trap employed in this analysis are based on 2009 to 2011 price data, the most recent data available at the time the analysis was developed. Prices during 2012 trended lower; ex-vessel prices during the summer of 2012 were reported in some areas of Maine to have gone as low as $1.50 per pound. Most observers consider this decline to have been anomalous, partly the product of the early arrival of shedder (soft-shell) lobsters ahead of tourist season (Associated Press, 2012). Nonetheless, a downward trend in prices is possible. All else equal, continuation of that trend would lead the analysis to overstate future losses in net revenue.      It is also important to note that the analysis of the revenue losses associated with suspending fishing assumes that fishermen lose all the catch they would ordinarily harvest during the closure period. The loss in landings may actually be less, depending on lobster movements and behavior. Specifically, some of the lobsters not caught during the closure may simply be harvested once the closed area is reopened (i.e., catch rates may be higher than normal following the closure). To the extent that this occurs, the analysis may overstate the economic losses associated with suspending fishing.

6.3.3 Relocation Costs      The distance that a vessel must travel to reach alternative fishing grounds during a closure is likely to differ from the distance it would ordinarily travel to reach fishing grounds within the closed area. This implies a potential change in two major operating costs: fuel and time. The general approach to evaluating these changes is discussed below, focusing on parameters that remain constant regardless of the closure in question. Later sections discuss key parameters unique to each closure.6.3.3.1 Fuel Costs      One potential impact of relocating effort during a closure is a change in operating costs associated with fuel consumption. This is a function of the change in distance that a vessel operator must steam in order to tend his or her gear, the number of trips taken during the period in question, the vessel’s fuel efficiency, and the price of fuel.      The impact of each closure on the distance that vessel operators must steam to tend their gear is determined on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the ports from which affected vessels are known or are likely to operate, the distance from these ports to the area affected by the closure, and the distance from these ports to alternative areas. Additional information on the areas to which the analysis assumes vessels would relocate is provided in the detailed discussion of the analysis of each closure. In all cases, however, the method assumes that relocation to the substitute fishing area is temporary, and that the affected vessels will return to their preferred fishing grounds when the closure has ended.      Once the alternative fishing location is identified, the total change in distance traveled depends on the number of fishing trips made during the closure period. The GMRI survey asked fishermen how many trips they took per week during each quarter of the year, dividing the responses by LMA. The analysis uses the survey data to estimate the number of affected trips, tailoring the estimate to correspond with the location and timing of each closure.      Any change in fuel costs also depends on the fuel-efficiency of the affected vessels, which is a function of engine size (horsepower). Information on the engines with which affected vessels are equipped is not available; however, it is possible to estimate the horsepower of affected vessels based on the general correlation between horsepower and vessel length. The analysis employs an equation characterizing this relationship, using it, in combination with an estimate of the average length of affected vessels, to estimate the horsepower of vessels that may relocate their effort while a closure is in effect.      Consistent with data from a recent study by the Maine Maritime Academy (MMA, 2011), the analysis assumes that marine engines burn 0.053 gallons of diesel fuel per hour for each unit of horsepower delivered. The analysis uses this figure to estimate total fuel use per hour for all affected vessels. Based on input from NMFS gear specialists, the analysis also assumes that vessels steam at an average speed of 14 knots. This figure, in combination with data on distances, provides a basis for estimating the change in steaming time to and from alternative
fishing grounds. The analysis then multiplies this figure by the estimate of diesel use per hour to obtain an estimate of the change in fuel use per trip.      Multiplying fuel use per trip by the number of trips and price of diesel fuel yields the change in fuel costs. The analysis is based on a retail diesel price of $3.93 per gallon, the mean of the weekly prices recorded for New England from October 2010 through October 2012 (EIA, 2012). In calculating the change in costs attributable to each regulatory alternative, the analysis uses the pre-tax price of diesel fuel; state and Federal fuel taxes are excluded from the analysis, since these taxes represent a transfer payment rather than a true social cost. The pre-tax fuel  price employed in the analysis of each closure varies with the region affected. For instance, in the case of the closures affecting vessels in the Cape Cod region, the price employed is the Massachusetts pre-tax price.Exhibit 6-15SUMMARY OF FUEL USE PARAMETERS USED IN CLOSURE COST ASSESSMENTParameterValue/Estimation MethodSourceHorsepower (Lobster Vessels)HP = -16.3566 + 9.71*(VesselLength in Feet)NMFS Permit Data (2011)Fuel Consumption at Cruising Speed0.053 gallons/hour/HPMaine Maritime Academy,2011Typical Cruising Speed (Lobster Vessels)14 knotsNMFS Gear SpecialistsRetail Price for Diesel Fuel$3.93 per gallonEnergy InformationAdministration, 2012State and Federal Fuel Taxes: Maine57.1 cents per gallonAmerican Petroleum Institute, 2012State and Federal Fuel Taxes: Massachusetts47.9 cents per gallonAmerican Petroleum Institute,2012Pre-Tax Diesel Price: Maine$3.36 per gallonDerived from abovePre-Tax Diesel Price: Massachusetts$3.45 per gallonDerived from above6.3.3.2 Time Costs      Steaming to alternate fishing grounds is also likely to alter the time that an affected vessel’s captain and crew spend on the water. This change is a function of the change in travel distance and vessel speed (see above). Combining this information with information on the number of trips taken during the closure period yields an estimate of the overall change in time at sea. The analysis values this time as follows:• The captain’s time is valued using the opportunity cost ($22.48 per hour) estimated for the gear conversion analysis discussed above. This figure is a weighted average of wage rates in a variety of alternative occupations identified in the GMRI survey.• The analysis also incorporates the opportunity cost of sternmen’s time. Each hour of this time is valued at $14.53, the mean hourly wage for
Fishers and Related Fishing Workers (BLS, May 2011).23 The number of sternmen per vessel is estimated based on closure-specific data, as discussed below.      The opportunity cost of labor is an appropriate cost component in a welfare economic framework; however, neither the captain nor sternmen are paid on an hourly basis. Instead, they typically are paid a portion of either the gross or net revenue for each trip. Fishermen’s actual take-home pay will vary only to the extent that catch varies. As such, labor costs are an implicit cost rather than an out-of-pocket expense for the vessel operator.6.3.3.3 Transition Costs      In addition to costs incurred within the closure period, vessels that relocate their effort will likely incur additional costs preceding and following the closure, both in moving their traps to a new location and returning them to their original location when the closure ends. The relocation of gear is likely to take place incrementally, with a portion of the affected traps moved each trip until all traps are relocated.      The fuel and time costs associated with moving gear to and from alternate fishing grounds are a function of several factors:• Vessel size (and deck space), which determines the number of traps that can be moved in a single trip;• The total number of traps that must be moved; and• The additional distance traveled in order to relocate gear each trip.The total number of traps affected and the quantity of gear that can be transported each trip determines the number of trips that must be made in order to relocate the gear displaced by the closure. Based on discussions with NMFS gear experts, the analysis assumes that most trap/pot vessels can transfer 40 traps per trip; for larger offshore vessels, the analysis assumes relocation of 120 traps per trip. Multiplying the number of trips required by the extra distance traveled each trip allows estimation of the added fuel and time costs, applying the same parameters discussed above.6.3.3.4 Catch Impacts      It is also possible that relocating vessels will experience a reduction in catch relative to their preferred fishing location inside the closed area. Catch reductions could result because of crowding and heightened competition in the areas to which fishermen relocate; because fishermen are less familiar with the bottom structure or other determinants of catch in the new           23 No reliable information exists on alternative occupations for sternmen, and the value of the captain’s  time likely overstates the opportunity cost for sternmen. Hence, the analysis incorporates the average wage rate in the fishing sector.
area; or simply because the alternative fishing grounds available are less productive than those inside the closed area.      The data required to develop a rigorous estimate of potential catch impacts are not available. Such an estimate would require a well-defined characterization of catch rates in the closed area and similar knowledge of conditions (e.g., lobster density) in a specific alternative fishing area. In practice, the potential impact is likely to vary significantly from individual to individual, depending upon the fisherman’s expertise and ability to adapt to a new area. As a result, any catch reduction estimated for vessels that relocate their effort is subject to significant uncertainty.      Lacking more specific data, the analysis assumes that vessels which choose to relocate would experience a 20 percent reduction in catch during the closure period. The revenue loss per vessel is estimated by multiplying the gross revenue per trap figures (summarized earlier in Exhibit 6-14) by the number of traps fished per vessel.6.3.3.5 Caveats      In addition to the assumptions noted above, the analysis of relocation costs is based on a number of other assumptions that are subject to considerable uncertainty. These include:• The assumption that fishermen would reconfigure their gear, as necessary, to meet the minimum trawl length requirement in any area to which they relocate, but would incur no gear conversion costs beyond those  associated with meeting these requirements;• The assumption that fishermen who relocate their effort would continue to fish the same number of traps they used in the closed area.• The assumption that fishermen will continue to make the same number of fishing trips while using the alternate location.The net effect of these assumptions on the cost estimates is unclear. The methodological discussion for each of the individual closures highlights additional uncertainties associated with the selection of specific relocation sites for affected vessels.6.3.4 Analysis of Specific Closure Scenarios      Vessel operators are likely to respond to the closure of a particular area in the way they believe would have the least adverse impact on their income, subject to financial, regulatory, and other constraints on the options available to them. Their responses will depend not only on the nature of their fishing operations (e.g., fishery, vessel type, quantity of affected gear) but also on the features of the closure itself (area and time period). The variety of possible outcomes and the large number of potentially affected fishermen precludes a vessel-by-vessel analysis of likely responses.
      As noted above, this analysis examines two general response scenarios to evaluate the potential impact of closures: relocation or suspension of fishing effort. Within that framework, however, the analysis of economic impacts seeks to recognize key variables that may differ from case to case, such as the number of vessels a particular closure would affect, the scale of the fishing operations affected, regional differences in the prices that affected vessels may receive for their catch, and the availability of alternative fishing sites. The sections below discuss each closure individually, focusing on unique aspects of the approach to analyzing their potential impacts.6.3.4.1 Jordan Basin Restricted Area      The closure of the Jordan Basin Restricted Area to trap/pot gear from November through January is an element of Alternatives 4 and 5. As shown in Exhibit 6-16, the closure would extend over a 725 square-mile area in the northern portion of LMA 3, immediately adjacent to Maine Lobster Zones C and D. A small portion of Zone C, which is located in LMA 1, is also included in the closure area.      The Vertical Line Model estimates that on average five vessels fish in the Jordan Basin Restricted Area during the period the area would be closed: one in LMA 3 and four in LMA 1.24 The distinction between LMA 3 and LMA 1 waters has important implications in estimating closure costs, since vessels that operate in LMA 3 are typically larger, fish a larger number of traps, and harvest more lobster per trap during the closure period than vessels in LMA 1. Exhibit 6-17 summarizes the parameters employed to estimate costs for each category of vessel.      Detailed information on lobster vessels active in the Jordan Basin area is generally not available, making it difficult to predict how vessels potentially affected by a closure would respond.25 In the absence of better information, the analysis takes a bounding approach to assessing the decision to relocate or suspend fishing. In the upper bound, the analysis assumes that all affected vessels would suspend fishing during the closure and forgo the revenue (net of operating cost savings) on the lobster they would have otherwise landed. This is a highly conservative assumption, since vessels operating in these waters would likely be capable of reaching alternate fishing grounds. The incentive for these vessels to relocate their traps rather than suspend operations from November through January is also likely to be strong, since prices during this period tend to be higher than in the summer or early fall.           24 The number of vessels that fish a portion of their gear in the Jordan Basin area may exceed this estimate. For purposes of analysis, however, the estimate of affected vessels is presented on a full-time equivalent basis. For additional information on the characterization of vessel activity, see the documentation for the Vertical Line Model.           25 Unlike other commercial fishing permits, Federal lobster permits currently impose no trip report requirements. Information on the location of trips taken by vessels that hold Federal lobster permits is limited to those that also hold permits for fisheries that require trip reports. The Vertical Line Model assumes that the activity of vessels that do not file trip reports is evenly distributed across the LMA for which the permits were issued. The estimate of activity in the Jordan Basin area – particularly in LMA 1 – is based primarily on this approach. For additional information, see the documentation for the Vertical Line Model.
      As an alternative to suspending operations, the lower bound of the analysis assumes that the vessels affected by the Jordan Basin closure would relocate their effort to new grounds. Specifically, the offshore vessel would relocate its effort to LMA 3 waters immediately outside the closed area. Likewise, the LMA 1 vessels would relocate their effort to waters north and east of the closed area, in Maine Lobster Zone C. The analysis estimates the additional time and fuel costs these vessels would incur each year to transfer their gear to these alternative locations, as well as the costs they would incur to return the gear to the restricted area when the closure period ends. The additional distance traveled each trip in moving gear between the restricted and unrestricted areas is estimated as the average distance from the centroid of the closed area to the surrounding waters; this distance is developed separately for LMA 3 and LMA 1 vessels. Absent information on the home ports of the affected vessels, the analysis assumes that the relocation of gear has no material effect on steaming time to and from port; i.e., no additional fuel or time costs are incurred when fishing in the new locations.

      For purposes of calculating the impact of relocating gear on fishermen’s time, the LMA 3 vessel is assumed to carry a captain and two sternmen. The average number of trips made each week (2.2) is based on data provided by LMA 3 respondents to the GMRI lobster survey; the figure is a weighted average of the frequency of trips reported for the fourth and first quarters of the year (GMRI, 2006).26 For LMA 1 vessels, the same sources and approach are used to calculate trips per week (see Exhibit 6-17). Average crew (1.5) is based on crew data from the GMRI lobster survey as well as Maine permit data, which suggest that about half of the vessels in Zone C Federal waters fish with one sternman, while most others fish with two.6.3.4.2 Cape Cod Restricted Areas      The regulatory alternatives under consideration incorporate several closures affecting waters around Cape Cod:• Alternative 3 – the closure of the Cape Cod Bay Restricted Area from February through April;• Alternatives 4 & 5 – the closure of Massachusetts Restricted Area #1 from January through April; and• Alternatives 6 Draft & 6 Preferred – the closure of Massachusetts Restricted Area #2 from January through April.Exhibit 6-18 shows the boundaries of these areas, while Exhibit 6-19 summarizes key features of the closures. The general approach used to assess the impact on affected vessels is the same for all the Cape closures; therefore, this section discusses the closures as a group.As with other closures, the analysis of the impact of the Cape Cod closures first considers the costs that affected vessels would incur if they chose to suspend fishing for the duration of the closure. This approach provides an upper-bound estimate of potential impacts, since it assumes that fishermen would forgo all revenue (net of operating cost savings) for the catch normally harvested during the closure period.      For a lower-bound estimate of closure impacts, the analysis assumes that at least a  portion of the affected vessels would relocate their effort while the closure is in effect. Massachusetts DMF Catch Report data from 2009 provide the foundation for this analysis. The data provide information on approximately 80 percent of commercial fishing vessels that landed their catch in Massachusetts in 2009.27 Vessel operators reported a variety of information, including the statistical reporting areas (SRAs) and months in which they fished. The analysis employs this information to help predict likely relocation responses for affected vessels.           26 The GMRI survey included only 33 respondents fishing in LMA 3. This small sample size  may affect  the reliability of the parameters used to characterize impacts on offshore lobster vessels, although the direction of the bias is unclear.27 The data exclude 20 percent of active vessels that participated in a trip-level pilot reporting program in2009.
Different methods are applied for vessels holding only a state permit versus those that hold a Federal permit. These methods are discussed further below.Exhibit 6-19FEATURES OF CAPE COD CLOSURESFeatureCCB Restricted Area  Massachusetts Restricted Area #1  Massachusetts Restricted Area #2Regulatory Alternative34 & 56 Draft and 6 PreferredClosure PeriodFebruary - AprilJanuary - AprilJanuary - AprilSize (square miles)6442,4642,161Statistical Reporting Areas (MA SRAs with Over 25% ofWaters Inside Closed Area)6, 7, 8, 195, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 18, 195, 6, 7, 8, 9, 18, 19Relocation of Vessels Holding Only a State Permit      Vessels holding only a state permit are authorized to fish exclusively in Massachusetts SRAs 1 through 14 (the inshore SRAs). Many of these vessels are relatively small, and their ability to relocate their effort within state waters – particularly in the winter and early spring –
may be constrained by safety considerations and practical limits on their range. To assess the potential for affected vessels to relocate, the analysis examines the distribution of their current effort, as reflected in the 2009 Catch Report data. If a vessel reports fishing in one or more  SRAs that would remain open (in whole or in part) while a restricted area is closed, the analysis assumes that it would be possible for that vessel to relocate all of its effort outside the restricted area while the closure is in effect. Conversely, if the data show that, during the period of  interest, a vessel fishes solely in SRAs that fall wholly within a restricted area, the analysis assumes that it would not be feasible for that vessel to relocate. SRA 7, for example, is fully contained within the Cape Cod Bay Restricted Area; the analysis assumes that all vessels that report fishing exclusively in this area from February through April would be forced to suspend fishing while the Cape Cod Bay Restricted Area is closed. Likewise, in the case of  Massachusetts Restricted Areas #1 and #2, the analysis assumes that vessels that fish solely in SRAs 6, 7, and/or 8 from January through April would be forced to suspend fishing while these areas are closed. Exhibit 6-20 shows the resulting estimates of the percentage of affected vessels that would suspend fishing in response to each closure, as well as the percentage the analysis assumes could relocate.Exhibit 6-20PERCENT OF AFFECTED VESSELS IN STATE WATERS THAT ARE ASSUMED TO RELOCATE THEIR EFFORT DURING CAPE COD CLOSURESResponseCCBRestricted Area  Massachusetts Restricted Area #1  Massachusetts Restricted Area #2Suspend Fishing17.1%46.6%47.4%Relocate82.9%53.4%52.6%      The analysis also relies on the 2009 Catch Report data to identify the SRAs to which vessels deemed able to relocate are likely to move their gear. The approach assumes that vessels will relocate their gear to new areas in proportion to their current distribution of gear, adjusting that distribution to take into account the share of each SRA that would remain open while a particular closure is in effect. This assessment involves the following steps:• First, the analysis draws on the Catch Report data to develop a matrix illustrating the distribution of activity by SRA for vessels whose effort would be partially displaced by the closure. This distribution focuses solely on vessel activity during the months the closure would be in effect.• The analysis adjusts this distribution to take into account the impact of the closure on the proportion of each SRA that remains open to fishing. For example, under Alternative 3, the closure of the Cape Cod Bay Restricted Area from February through April would leave 42 percent of SRA 6 open to fishing. Thus, the analysis adjusts the baseline distribution of vessel activity in SRA 6 by multiplying the baseline value by a factor of 0.42. Values for SRAs that would be entirely closed throughout the closure period are set to zero.
• The analysis then converts the resulting set of values to a frequency distribution by dividing the value for each SRA by the sum of the values across all SRAs. The results indicate the relative distribution of activity  for affected vessels outside the restricted area, providing the basis for redistributing the effort the closure would displace.Exhibit 6-21 shows the results of this process for each of the Cape Cod closures. The exhibit indicates that the majority of the effort displaced by the closure of the Cape Cod Bay Restricted Area would likely relocate to SRA 6. In contrast, the majority of the effort displaced by the closure of Massachusetts Restricted Area #1 or #2 would likely relocate to SRAs 4 and 5.Exhibit 6-21REDISTRIBUTION OF EFFORT FOR STATE PERMITTED VESSELS AFFECTED BY CAPE COD CLOSURESSRACCBRestricted Area  Massachusetts Restricted Area #1  Massachusetts Restricted Area #245.4%43.8%41.8%526.3%51.4%51.2%659.2%0.0%0.0%70.0%0.0%0.0%87.7%0.0%0.0%91.4%2.2%6.9%100.0%2.6%0.0%      Once the locations for the redistribution of gear are established, the analysis uses GIS techniques to estimate impacts on trip distances and resulting changes in fuel and time costs.  The closure cost assessment first requires information on the incremental distance that vessels will travel when moving traps to a new location. This extra distance is estimated by determining the distance from the centroid of the closed portion of each SRA to the centroid of the open portion of each SRA to which gear is assumed to be moved. The frequency distributions discussed above are then used to calculate the weighted average distance that affected vessels would be required to travel in order to relocate their gear.      The impact of each closure on the distance that displaced vessel operators must steam to tend their gear is determined as follows:• First, the analysis calculates the weighted average distance from each relocating vessel’s homeport to the closed portion of the SRA that the vessel vacates.• Next, the analysis calculates the weighted average distance from each vessel’s homeport to the centroid of the open portion of the SRA(s) to which it is assumed to relocate its displaced effort.• Finally, the difference between these values serves as the estimate of the incremental distance traveled for each round trip.
It is important to note that this methodology yields small or even negative incremental travel distances for some vessels. This issue is explored further below.Relocation of Vessels that Hold a Federal Permit      The Cape Cod closures would affect relatively small portions of Massachusetts SRAs 18 and 19, which lie in Federal waters. The Massachusetts Catch Report data are unlikely to reflect all activity in these waters; in particular, the data will not capture the activity of vessels that do not land their catch in Massachusetts. The available Federal data are also incomplete, since vessels that hold only a Federal lobster permit are not subject to Vessel Trip Report (VTR) requirements. In the absence of more complete data on activity in SRAs 18 and 19, the analysis employs a simplified approach to characterize the potential relocation of effort by vessels that hold a Federal permit. Specifically, the analysis assumes that these vessels will relocate their gear to the perimeter of the closed area, while remaining within the SRA originally fished. The distance that vessels travel when relocating their gear before and after the closure is the average of the distance from the centroid of the closed portion of each SRA to the perimeter of the closed area. The incremental change in the distance that vessel operators must travel to tend their gear  is calculated using the method described above for vessels that hold only a state permit; in this case, however, the analysis is based on the homeports of the vessels that hold a Federal permit and are known to fish in SRAs 18 or 19.Summary of Cape Cod Closure Parameters      Exhibit 6-22 summarizes the final set of parameters used to estimate costs associated  with each of the Cape Cod closures. The travel distances developed via the methods discussed above warrant discussion. In all cases, the impact of relocation on the distance that vessel operators must travel to tend their gear is either small or negative. A reduction in travel  distances reflects the possibility that some vessel operators may respond to a closure by relocating their gear closer to their homeport. While somewhat counterintuitive, this outcome is possible when considering the logical set of alternatives open to affected vessels.

6.3.4.3 Jeffreys Ledge Restricted Area      The closure of the Jeffreys Ledge Restricted Area to trap/pot gear from October through January is an element of Alternatives 4 and 5. As shown in Exhibit 6-23, the closure would extend over a 607 square-mile area off the coast of southern Maine and New Hampshire. Most  of the affected area lies in the Federal portion of Maine Lobster Zone G, which is located in LMA 1.      The timing and location of the Jeffreys Ledge closure suggest a potential for significant economic impacts. The fall season is a productive one for New England’s lobster fishery, particularly in southern Maine, where weather conditions at that time of year are milder than in down east coastal areas. Available data for LMA 1 indicate that lobster vessels catch an average of over 19 pounds of lobster per trap during the fourth quarter of the year, making this period nearly as productive as the third-quarter summer season.      As a monthly average from October through January, the analysis estimates that on a full- time equivalent basis, approximately 69 lobster vessels are active in the Jeffreys Ledge Restricted Area. This estimate, however, is based on relatively incomplete data. Many vessels that hold LMA 1 lobster permits are not required to file vessel trip reports. As a result,
comprehensive information on lobster vessel activity within the area is unavailable. Some insight, however, can be obtained by reviewing the available VTR data; Maine’s Annual Logs Survey, in combination with state permit data from the Maine Department of Marine Resources; and Massachusetts Catch Report data, combined with state permit information from the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries. These sources suggest the following:• The vessels that would be affected by the closure originate primarily from Maine. Relatively few potentially affected vessels – perhaps no more than one to three – appear to be from Massachusetts. In addition, the VTR data suggest that some New Hampshire vessels may be affected – between two to four, depending on the month.• The Maine lobster vessels originate in several homeports along the southern Maine coast from Portland to the New Hampshire border, with Kennebunkport, Ogunquit, and Kittery accounting for the largest share of vessels. The New Hampshire vessels originate from or near Portsmouth Harbor.• Based on Maine permit data, lobster vessels active in the closure area vary in size, ranging from approximately 25 to 45 feet in length, and averaging about 36 feet.      Given the heterogeneous nature of the affected vessels, predicting the likely response to the closure of Jeffreys Ledge is difficult. In the absence of better information, the analysis takes  a bounding approach to assessing the decision to relocate or suspend fishing. In  the upper  bound, the analysis assumes that all affected vessels would suspend fishing during the closure and forgo the revenue (net of operating cost savings) on the lobster they would have otherwise landed. This is a highly conservative assumption, since vessels operating in the area are likely to be capable of reaching alternate fishing grounds. The incentive for these vessels to relocate their traps rather than suspend operations from October through January is also likely to be high, since the lobster catch during this period is an important source of revenue.      As an alternative, the lower bound of the analysis assumes that the vessels affected by the Jeffreys Ledge closure would relocate their effort to the unaffected portion of Federal waters in Maine Lobster Zone G. The analysis estimates the additional time and fuel costs these vessels would incur each year to transfer their gear to these waters, as well as the costs they would incur to return the gear to the restricted area when the closure period ends. It also analyzes the impact of relocation on the distance vessel operators must travel to tend their gear while the restricted area is closed, and the resulting impact on time and fuel costs. Estimates of the impact of the closure on the distances that affected vessels must travel are calculated as follows:• The average distance that vessels must travel in moving gear between the restricted and unrestricted areas is the distance from the centroid of the closed portion of Zone G (Federal) to the centroid of the unrestricted portion of Zone G (Federal).• The impact of relocating on the distance that vessel operators must travel to tend their gear is the difference between (1) the average distance from
relevant ports in Maine and New Hampshire to the centroid of the closed portion of Zone G (Federal) and (2) the average distance from these same ports to the centroid of the unrestricted portion of Zone G (Federal). This analysis includes all major fishing ports from Portland, Maine south to Portsmouth, New Hampshire.The average number of trips taken per week (3.3) is based on GMRI survey data for lobstermen in LMA 1 during the months the closure would be in effect (GMRI, 2006). Exhibit 6-24 summarizes these and other relevant parameters used in estimating the costs associated with the Jeffreys closure.Exhibit 6-24SUMMARY OF PARAMETERS AFFECTING CLOSURE COSTS: JEFFREYS LEDGEParameterValueBasisClosure PeriodOctober - JanuarySee Chapter 3Number of Affected Lobster Vessels69Vertical Line ModelPercent of Vessels RelocatingLower: 100%Upper: 0%Bounding assumptionAvg.

As explained in greater detail in Chapter 3, the proposed gear marking scheme calls for three 12-inch marks per vertical line, adhering to a regional color-coding system. The requirements would apply to all fisheries  subject to the ALWTRP, including the lobster, OTP, blue crab, and gillnet fisheries. Under Alternatives 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (Draft), the requirements would apply to gear set in all non-exempt waters, as well as exempt waters in Maine and New Hampshire. Under Alternative 6 (Preferred), gear set in Maine waters landward of the ALWTRP exemption line would remain exempt from gear marking requirements.      The analysis relies on the Vertical Line Model to estimate the number of vertical lines it would be necessary to mark under Alternatives 2 through 6 (Preferred). In each case,  the estimate of gear marking demands is consistent with the new trawling requirements the alternative specifies. Aggregate gear marking costs are based on numbers of active vessels estimated in the Vertical Line Model.      The estimate of gear marking costs considers both the cost of material/equipment and labor costs. To model these costs, the analysis assumes that lines would be marked using gear marking whips that would be woven into the line.   Whips are currently available at a cost of$0.06 each; thus, given the need to mark in three locations, the equipment cost for gear marking is estimated at $0.18 for each vertical line. NMFS gear experts estimate that each whip would take roughly five minutes to install. At an implicit value of $22.48 for an hour of a labor (see above), this translates to a labor cost of $1.87 per mark, or $5.62 for each vertical line.   The
resulting total cost – $5.80 per vertical line – is amortized over the useful life of the line to develop an annualized estimate of gear marking costs.286.5 ESTIMATED COMPLIANCE COSTS BY ALTERNATIVE      As noted in the introduction to this chapter, the economic analysis is designed to measure regulatory compliance costs on an incremental basis − i.e., to measure the change in costs associated with a change in regulatory requirements. If no change in regulatory requirements is imposed − as would be the case under Alternative 1 − the economic burden attributable to the ALWTRP would be unaffected. Thus, Alternative 1 would impose no additional costs on the regulated community.      The analysis of the remaining alternatives measures their economic impact relative to the status quo – i.e., relative to the no action alternative. The impact of these alternatives can be characterized in several ways, including the number of vessels that would need to take action in order to comply with new requirements. As shown in Exhibit 6-26, the gear marking provisions of Alternatives 2 through 6 (Preferred) would affect the largest number of fishing operations. This figure varies little across the alternatives, except in the case of Alternative 6 (Preferred); that alternative removes the requirement that Maine vessels in ALWTRP-exempt waters mark gear. As a result, the number of affected vessels is reduced from approximately 6,100 to 4,000.      The gear configuration provisions of these alternatives also affect a large number of vessels, primarily lobster vessels that would need to reconfigure their gear in order to meet trawling requirements. Under Alternatives 2 and 4, the analysis estimates that approximately 1,800 vessels would be required to reconfigure their gear; this figure falls to approximately 1,400 under Alternatives 3, 5, 6 (Draft), and 6 (Preferred). In contrast, the provisions for fishing area closures specified under Alternatives 3 through 6 (Preferred) are estimated to affect no more than 200 vessels. The impact on these vessels, however, could be significant.           28 Under Alternatives 2 through 6 (Draft), the marking requirements for gear fished in exempt portions of Maine state waters would differ from the requirements for gear fished in non-exempt areas. Similarly, under Alternatives 3, 5, and 6 (Draft and Preferred), the marking requirements for gear fished in New Hampshire state waters would differ from the requirements for gear fished in non-exempt areas. Fishermen who move gear between exempt and non-exempt waters over the course of a year would be required to comply with the applicable gear marking provisions for each area, either by maintaining separate sets of vertical line or by re-marking their line before it is moved. The estimate of gear marking costs does not take this issue into account. To the extent that these circumstances arise, the analysis may understate the costs associated with the introduction of new gear marking requirements.

Several findings are noteworthy:• Of the action alternatives, estimated costs are lowest for Alternative 3. This alternative incorporates less stringent trawling requirements than specified under Alternative 2 and includes only the CCB Restricted Area closure, which affects relatively few vessels and poses limited costs.• Alternative 4 is likely to pose the greatest costs. It includes three closures, all of which cover large areas. The estimated impact of the closures specified under this alternative ranges from $1.3 million to $2.1 million per year.• The cost of complying with Alternative 5 is likely to be somewhat less than that of complying with Alternative 4. The difference is attributable to a difference in trawling requirements, which are slightly less stringent under Alternative 5.• In general, compliance with gear configuration requirements imposes the greatest costs, with estimates ranging as high as $4.4 million per year.  The costs attributable to the seasonal closure of restricted areas also contribute significantly to the estimate of total compliance costs under Alternatives 4, 5, 6 (Draft), and 6 (Preferred). Gear marking requirements add approximately $1 million annually to the estimated cost of complying with most of the action alternatives.• Gear marking costs are significantly lower under Alternative 6 (Preferred) because it does not require gear in Maine waters landward of the ALWTRP exemption line to be marked. In the lower bound scenario, this leads the estimate of total compliance costs for Alternative 6 (Preferred) to be lower than the corresponding figures for the other action alternatives.
In the upper bound scenario, the overall estimate for Alternative 6 (Preferred) is slightly higher than that for Alternative 3, but lower than the estimates for the other action alternatives.Exhibit 6-27ESTIMATED ANNUAL COMPLIANCE COSTS BY ALTERNATIVE(2011 dollars)Regulatory AlternativeGear ConfigurationClosures  Gear MarkingTotalLowerUpperLowerUpperLowerUpperAlternative 1 (No Action)$0$0$0$0$0$0$0Alternative 2$1,241,000$4,392,000$0$0$1,014,000$2,255,000$5,407,000Alternative 3$1,003,000$3,349,000$21,000$49,000$1,047,000$2,070,000$4,445,000Alternative 4$1,213,000$4,288,000$1,340,000$2,113,000$1,010,000$3,562,000$7,411,000Alternative 5$996,000$3,240,000$1,340,000$2,113,000$1,043,000$3,379,000$6,396,000Alternative 6 (Draft)$1,009,000$3,323,000$557,000$831,000$1,054,000$2,620,000$5,208,000Alternative 6 (Preferred)$1,015,000$3,316,000$557,000$831,000$338,000$1,910,000$4,484,000Note: Values may not sum to the totals shown due to rounding.      Exhibit 6-27 indicates that variation in the estimate of compliance costs across alternatives also depends on the provisions each alternative incorporates for the seasonal closure of restricted areas. These impacts are greatest under Alternatives 4 and 5, which include the seasonal closure of three areas: Jeffreys  Ledge, Jordan Basin, and Massachusetts Restricted  Area #1. As shown in Exhibit 6-28, the Jeffreys Ledge closure poses the greatest potential impact, with estimated costs ranging from $0.7 million to $1.2 million per year. The costs attributable to the closure of Massachusetts Restricted Area #1 are estimated at $0.6 million to$0.8  million per  year,  while those attributable to the closure of Jordan  Basin  are  estimated at$43,000 to $103,000 annually. The estimate of costs attributable to the closure of Massachusetts Restricted Area #2, as specified under Alternatives 6 (Draft) and 6 (Preferred), ranges from $0.6 million to $0.8 million; these figures are comparable to the estimates developed for the closure of Massachusetts Restricted Area #1. In contrast, the estimated impact of closing the CCB Restricted Area on a seasonal basis is relatively modest, adding less than $50,000 per year to the estimated cost of complying with Alternative 3.

The impact of greatest concern is likely to be the effect on the lobster fishery. As explained, the analysis assumes that lobster vessels converting to longer trawls may realize a decrease in landings and gross revenue. In addition, vessels affected by closures may experience a reduction in catch as a result of suspending fishing or relocating to less productive fishing grounds. Despite these potential effects, the aggregate impact on lobster landings is likely to be minor. The greatest impact is likely to occur under Alternative 4, where the analysis estimates a potential reduction in lobster landings of approximately 2.1 million pounds per year. This is equivalent to approximately 1.7 percent of lobster landings in 2011. A landings reduction of this size is well within the range of annual variation in lobster catch and is unlikely to have significant implications for the market price of lobster.6.6 ESTIMATED COMPLIANCE COSTS BY FISHERY      Of the fisheries subject to the requirements of the ALWTRP, the lobster fishery would bear the largest share of impacts from the regulatory alternatives under consideration.  As  Exhibit 6-29 shows, the lobster fishery accounts for the greatest number of vessels that would be required to reconfigure their gear to comply with trawling requirements. This is true across all action alternatives. In addition, the analysis indicates that the lobster fishery alone would be affected by the seasonal closure of fishing grounds. In contrast, all vessels fishing gear that is subject to the requirements of the ALWTRP would be affected by the gear marking provisions incorporated under Alternatives 2 through 6 (Draft); this includes gear fished in Maine and New Hampshire waters that otherwise would be exempt from ALWTRP requirements. Alternative 6 (Preferred) is the exception in that it would not require gear fished in Maine’s exempt waters to be marked.      Exhibit 6-30 summarizes the estimate of annual compliance costs by fishery and regulatory alternative. Depending on the alternative and scenario (upper versus lower bound) in question, the analysis indicates that the lobster fishery would incur roughly 80 percent to 90 percent of estimated costs under Alternatives 2 through 6 (Preferred). OTP vessels would also
incur a significant share of costs under these alternatives, primarily because of the proposed minimum trawl-length requirements.29 The impact of the action alternatives on other fisheries is likely to be minor, reflecting the costs associated with meeting new gear marking requirements.Exhibit 6-29NUMBER OF VESSELS AFFECTED BY NEW REQUIREMENTS, BY FISHERYRegulatory ProvisionsRegulatory AlternativeFisheryTotal Lobster Trap/Pot Other Trap/PotBlue CrabGillnetGear ConfigurationAlternative 1 (No Action)00000Alternative 21,679139001,817Alternative 31,256136001,392Alternative 41,695139001,834Alternative 51,263136001,400Alternative 6 (Draft)1,228136001,364Alternative 6 (Preferred)1,221136001,357ClosuresAlternative 1 (No Action)00000Alternative 200000Alternative 31600016Alternative 4184000184Alternative 5184000184Alternative 6 (Draft)109000109Alternative 6 (Preferred)109000109Gear MarkingAlternative 1 (No Action)00000Alternative 25,300282484996,129Alternative 35,300282484996,129Alternative 45,300282484996,129Alternative 55,300282484996,129Alternative 6 (Draft)5,300282484996,129Alternative 6 (Preferred)3,186274484984,006AllAlternative 1 (No Action)00000Alternative 25,300282484996,129Alternative 35,300282484996,129Alternative 45,300282484996,129Alternative 55,300282484996,129Alternative 6 (Draft)5,300282484996,129Alternative 6 (Preferred)3,186274484984,006Note: Values may not sum to the totals shown due to rounding.           29 Due to insufficient data on vessel activity, the analysis of compliance costs under Alternatives 2 through 6 (Preferred) excludes potential impacts on trap/pot vessels operating in the Northern Inshore shrimp fishery. The Vessel Trip Report data incorporated in the Vertical Line Model identify only two such vessels; this suggests that much of the activity of trap/pot vessels in this fishery is accounted for by vessels that are not subject to Federal reporting requirements, presumably because they do not hold a Federal permit and fish only in state waters. Much  of this activity is likely to occur in portions of Maine state waters that are currently exempt from ALWTRP requirements. Under Alternatives 2 through 6 (Draft), vessels operating in these waters would only be subject to ALWTRP gear marking provisions; they would be exempt even from these requirements under Alternative 6 (Preferred). Given these considerations, it is unlikely that exclusion of the Northern Inshore shrimp fishery from the analysis will lead it to substantially understate the costs of complying with Alternatives 2 through 6 (Preferred).

Appendix 6-AGEAR CONVERSION COST METHODOLOGY
      This appendix describes the methods used to estimate the equipment cost associated with configuring gear to comply with minimum trawl length proposals included under Regulatory Alternatives 2 through 6 (Preferred). The costs that vessels incur are a function of baseline gear configurations and the specific configuration required under the trawling proposal. NMFS’ Vertical Line Model assigns baseline configurations to model vessels (i.e., total number of traps fished, number of traps per trawl, and number of vertical lines per trawl) that vary by fishery and location. These model vessels serve as the starting point for assessing how annual gear costs would change. The model allows the analysis to determine the extent to which vessels in a particular area are fishing sets shorter than the required length, providing an estimate of both the number of vessels that would need to convert gear as well as the current configuration used by those vessels. More detail on the Vertical Line Model can be found in the model’s formal documentation, which is available for review on the ALWTRP website (http://www.nero.noaa.gov/Protected/whaletrp/index.html).      Exhibit 6A-1 summarizes the procedure used to estimate the incremental costs associated with converting to longer trawls. For each set of vessels, the method uses unit cost information and useful life information to estimate the annual costs of employing the baseline configuration of gear and the new configuration. The difference between these two annual costs represents the incremental cost of complying with the trawling requirement under consideration. The calculation of annualized costs is based on a seven percent annual discount rate, consistent with current guidance from the Office of Management and Budget (1992).      The estimation of gear conversion costs requires information on certain gear characteristics that are not specified in the Vertical Line Model. Exhibit 6A-2 summarizes these parameters.30 As shown, the typical configuration of gear employed in  trap/pot fisheries varies by region; this variation affects the cost of complying with the proposed trawling requirements. For example, Maine Zone A is characterized by strong tidal currents; to counter the potential effect of these currents, lobster vessels fishing in the area frequently use weights or anchors to keep their gear in place. Similarly, vessels in state waters commonly fish at shallower depths than do vessels in Federal waters, and therefore require less line to connect trawls to surface buoys.

Vertical line consists of a portion of sinking rope and a portion of floating rope.3 A double 5x11 is two 5x11 buoys that are attached to the same stick. Correspondingly, the price is twice that of a single 5x11 buoy.4 Data for Rhode Island vessels were not available. The figures applied are extrapolated from Massachusetts.Sources: McCarron and Tetreault, 2012.6A-3
       In addition to the model vessel configurations and area specifications described in Exhibit 6A-2, several additional assumptions affect the analysis of gear reconfiguration costs:• A gangion is a length of sinking rope attaching a trap to the main groundline. The analysis assumes one gangion per trap when the trawl has two endlines. When a trawl has one endline, the analysis assumes one gangion for all but the last trap.• Every surface buoy is attached to the line by a weak link of appropriate breaking strength, consistent with current ALWTRP requirements.• Anchor line, if used, is assumed to be the same type and diameter as the vertical line float rope.• Rope connecting multiple buoys is the same type and diameter as the vertical line sink rope.• When anchors are used, there is one anchor per endline.      Lacking more detailed information, gear characteristics (e.g., rope diameter, slack factor, etc.) for other trap pot (OTP) fisheries are assumed to be equivalent to those specified for lobster operations in each area. An important exception applies in the case of the conch component of the OTP fishery. Massachusetts DMF officials suggest that trawling conch pots can be problematic because the pots may spill their contents when hauled.31 Although low-cost retrofit options for the traps may exist, little information is available on the nature and cost of these options. Therefore, the analysis assumes that conch vessels switching from singles to trawls will need to purchase all new traps compatible with trawling. This assumption may lead to an overstatement of compliance costs for this fishery.      Exhibit 6A-3 summarizes the unit cost information applied in the analysis. When available, price information for individual gear elements was gathered from on-line catalogs; when information was unavailable or unclear on-line, retailers were contacted by phone. Major suppliers of price data included Friendship Trap and New England Marine and Industrial. In cases where multiple suppliers provided differing prices for a gear element, an average is applied. NMFS gear specialists reviewed the pricing information and provided estimates of the expected useful life for each gear component.3231 Personal communication with Massachusetts DMF, November 7, 2012.           32 Note that the exhibit includes unit cost information only for components of gear that the analysis  suggests might change as a result of the introduction of new regulatory requirements. The analysis does not require cost estimates for other elements of gear, such as lobster traps, that the new regulations would be unlikely to affect.

SOCIAL IMPACTS	CHAPTER 7      As a complement to the economic analysis, the social impact assessment (SIA) examines the social and cultural consequences of the potential changes to the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan (ALWTRP) that are under consideration.  The discussion is organized as follows:• Section 7.1 discusses the requirements to develop an SIA;• Section 7.2 describes the general methodology used to assess the social impacts of the regulatory alternatives that NMFS is considering;• Section 7.3 provides a detailed socioeconomic characterization of the communities that may be affected by modifications to the ALWTRP, and assesses the vulnerability of these communities to adverse impacts;• Section 7.4 examines the potential socioeconomic impacts of Alternative 6 (Preferred), identifying the groups of vessels that may be most heavily affected under NMFS’ preferred alternative;• Section 7.5 identifies other potential impacts of the management measures under consideration, including adverse effects on fishermen’s quality of life and the potential benefits of marine mammal protection for the general public;• Section 7.6 provides a summary of the impacts identified, including a comparison of the social impacts of the alternatives NMFS is considering.7.1 BACKGROUND      The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) is the primary legal authority necessitating development of an SIA for Federal management actions, including those of the ALWTRP under the authority of the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA). According to Section 40 CFR 1508.14, “[if] economic or social and natural or physical environmental effects are interrelated, then the environmental impact statement will discuss all these effects on the human environment.” In addition, Executive Order 12898 requires that Federal agencies achieve environmental justice by addressing “disproportionately high and adverse human health and environmental effects on minority and low income populations.”
7.2 METHODOLOGY      National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) guidance recommends that the SIA take the form of a social factor analysis organized around a matrix of indicators comparing each regulatory alternative (NOAA, 2007). The guidance suggests that the matrix consist of a set of indicators that address the following social factors:• The size and demographic characteristics of the fishery-related work force residing in the area;• The attitudes, beliefs, and values of fishermen, fishery-related workers, and other stakeholders;• The social structure and organization of the affected community, including effects on the ability of jurisdictions to provide support and services to families and communities;• Life-style, health, and safety impacts, as well as non-consumptive and recreational uses of marine resources; and• Historical dependence on and participation in the fishery, as reflected in structural changes in fishing practices, income distribution, and rights.The guidance further recommends that changes in the chosen social variables be considered relative to baseline conditions for these variables, allowing an assessment of the impact of the policy measure in question.      The approach undertaken here is consistent with this guidance. The analysis involves  two basic elements:• First, the analysis uses county-level socioeconomic data and fishery- dependent data to assess the vulnerability of communities (i.e., counties) to adverse social impacts stemming from promulgation of commercial fishing regulations under the ALWTRP. The analysis is primarily built on data from NMFS’ Dealer, Processor, and Vessel Trip Report (VTR) databases, as well as demographic and socioeconomic data from the U.S. Census and the U.S. Department of Labor. Available studies of socioeconomic conditions in Atlantic coast ports provide additional information on community and cultural factors in affected regions.• Second, based on the results of the economic impact assessment (see Chapter 6), the analysis characterizes the changes in fishing practices and fishing activity that may occur under Alternative 6 (Preferred). This includes a review of the estimated impact of the alternative on the annual operating costs and revenues of vessels in the affected fisheries, as well as consideration of the associated socioeconomic impacts, focusing on
potential changes in landings and employment in the harvest, dealer, and processing sectors.      To supplement this analysis, the SIA also qualitatively considers various other social impacts – both negative and positive – that may result from modification of the ALWTRP. In all cases, the analysis measures these impacts relative to Alternative 1, the no action alternative. Alternative 1 would make no change in current ALWTRP requirements, preserving the regulatory status quo. Thus, it would have no effect on prevailing socioeconomic conditions and no impact on the social factors described above.7.3 CHARACTERIZATION OF COMMUNITY VULNERABILITY7.3.1 Factors Affecting Vulnerability      When considering the effect of proposed regulations on fishing communities, one potential approach is to focus the analysis on individual ports or municipalities. Clearly, however, fishing communities can extend beyond the boundaries of a particular port or  city.  Fish can be landed in one town and processed in a neighboring town. Likewise, a fisherman can land catch in one town, live in a neighboring town, and register his vessel in yet another location. In recognition of these factors, this analysis focuses at the county level.1 While a county’s political boundaries do not limit the network of social interactions and economic resource flows described above, the use of counties as an analytic focus offers several advantages. First, the geographic range of the county is a useful spatial mid-point between individual towns/ports and large regions; this is especially important given that ALWTRP regulations apply to such an extensive geographic area (virtually the entire east coast of the U.S.). In addition, many of the data used to characterize communities (e.g., unemployment rate, population) are readily  available at the county level.      The analysis takes as its principal focus coastal counties in the Northeast that are likely to be substantively affected by the management measures under consideration. As Exhibit 7-1 indicates, this includes all coastal counties in Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island for which NMFS data show, in 2011, more than $1 million in ex-vessel revenue attributable to landings made with gear regulated under the ALWTRP. The focus on the Northeast is consistent with the results of the economic analysis, which indicate that the cost of complying with new requirements is likely to be greatest for vessels fishing in Northeast waters. Trap/pot vessels operating out of ports in this region are most likely to be affected by the minimum trawl length and area closure requirements that NMFS is considering. In contrast, trap/pot vessels operating out of ports in the Mid-Atlantic region are less likely to fish in the waters subject to these requirements; although such vessels would be subject to new gear marking requirements under Alternatives 2 through 6 (Preferred), the cost of complying with these requirements is unlikely to spur changes (e.g., vessel retirement or significant reductions in income) that would have marked impacts on the social fabric of the fishing community. Likewise, the economic analysis in Chapter 6 suggests that gear restrictions proposed for Southeast trap/pot fisheries under Alternatives 2 through 6 (Preferred) are already, in many1 This discussion thus uses the terms “counties” and “communities” interchangeably.
areas, standard practice; hence, the social impacts attributable to these measures are likely to be minor.Exhibit 7-1COUNTIES CONSIDERED IN THE SOCIAL IMPACT ANALYSIS      In both fishing and non-fishing communities, the ability to adapt to change varies with social, political and economic considerations. The vulnerability of fishing communities, however, is influenced by additional factors, including the importance of familial relationships, the vulnerability of infrastructure, and the commitment to fishing as a culture and way of life (Clay and Olson 2008). From an analytic perspective, vulnerability includes the characteristics  of “exposure, sensitivity, and capacity of response to change or perturbation” (Gallopín 2006, as cited in Colburn and Jepson 2012). Consistent with Gallopin’s definition, this SIA considers each county’s vulnerability to be a function of the extent to which its fishing industry is affected by the regulations (i.e., exposure), the significance of the fishing industry within the county (i.e., sensitivity), and baseline factors that may affect communities’ ability to absorb the economic costs imposed by the regulations (i.e., capacity to respond to change). The discussion that follows briefly describes the parameters used to evaluate each aspect of vulnerability. Appendix 7-A describes all of the parameters considered in the socioeconomic analysis, as well as the source of the data or methods upon which the analysis draws.
7.3.1.1 Exposure      The analysis first considers the extent to which the local fishing industry is exposed to ALWTRP regulations. Exposure is defined in two ways:• Value/proportion of harvest associated with affected gear – The counties most likely to experience adverse social impacts are those in which gear regulated under the ALWTRP is an important source of commercial fishing revenue, either on an absolute or a relative basis.• Number of entities affected – Similarly, the most vulnerable counties are likely to be those that are home to the greatest number of vessels that fish with gear regulated under the ALWTRP.7.3.1.2 Sensitivity      Those communities that are more heavily dependent (both economically and socially) on the fishing industry are more likely to experience adverse social impacts due to fishing regulations. This analysis relies upon a measure of fishing dependence designed to take additional factors into account. This measure, the Occupational Alternative Ratio Summary (OARS), emphasizes the importance of fishing as an occupation to participants in the labor force as a whole, and the dependence of the local economy on the fishing industry. In general, a  higher score indicates a greater dependence on fishing as an occupation, and a lower likelihood that displaced fishermen can easily enter into alternate occupations.27.3.1.3 Capacity to Respond to Change      A number of economic and demographic factors will influence a community’s ability to absorb economic stress, tempering or exacerbating vulnerability to social impacts stemming from ALWTRP regulations:• Unemployment Rate, Poverty Rate, Median Income – Fundamental economic indicators such as the unemployment rate, poverty rate, and median income can indicate the local economy’s resilience to regulatory impacts. Communities that are already economically depressed may find  it more difficult to absorb the economic effects of regulatory changes and may be subject to greater social impacts.           2 Measures of fishing dependence and gentrification (see below) are based on Hall-Arber et al. (2001). At the time the analysis was developed, these data represented the most recent published attempt to address these issues systematically, allowing for a direct comparison between counties. Colburn and Jepsen (2012) have developed additional indices allowing for evaluation of fishing dependence and gentrification; however, they have yet to be broadly applied. For a qualitative discussion of these issues, see the Community Profiles for Northeast U.S. Marine Fisheries developed by the NMFS Northeast Fisheries Science Center (2010). These profiles are available online at: http://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/read/ socialsci/communityProfiles.html.
• Gentrification – Gentrification can be a key source of coastal community vulnerability (Jacob et al. 2010 and Clay and Olson 2008, as cited in Colburn and Jepson 2012). According to Hall-Arber et al. (2001), as former working waterfronts succumb to the pressures of gentrification, community character and culture are lost, diversity diminishes, and the fishing community is less able to adapt to changes in the environment. Additional fishing regulations can make it even more difficult for individuals to maintain a “fishing way of life.” Communities already experiencing gentrification will likely be more susceptible to social impacts as ALWTRP regulations are implemented. Hall-Arber et al. (2001) integrate various measures of gentrification into a score that can be used to characterize community vulnerability.7.3.2 Assessment of Community Vulnerability      Exhibits 7-2 through 7-4 present socioeconomic data for each county identified as potentially vulnerable to social impacts due to ALWTRP regulations. By evaluating the vulnerability indicators described above, the analysis characterizes the extent to which the counties are susceptible to regulatory-driven social impacts.      Counties in mid-coast and Downeast Maine, where the lobster fishery is the major driver of the commercial fishing economy, tend to be the most vulnerable to adverse social impacts from ALWTRP regulations. Hundreds of lobster vessels are based in these counties, and their landings are extensive (see Exhibit 7-3). Hancock and Knox counties report the greatest value of landings with ALWTRP gear ($108.7 million and $94.6 million, respectively), as well as the greatest number of vessels fishing with such gear (approximately 949 and 953, respectively).  The exposure of these counties to adverse impacts is heightened by the fact that landings made with ALWTRP gear account for a high percentage (91 percent in both cases) of overall ex-vessel revenues. Washington County (ME) is also highly exposed, with potentially affected landings of$51.8 million. Each of these counties is highly dependent on fishing, as measured by Hall-Arber et al.’s OARS score. Moreover, the high poverty and unemployment rates in these counties suggest that they have limited capacity to absorb additional economic stress. As a result, they  are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of ALWTRP regulations.      More than 50 percent of ex-vessel revenue in Maine’s other coastal counties is attributable to landings made with ALWTRP gear. In some instances, however, such as Waldo County, the overall value of these landings is relatively low. In others, such as Lincoln, Sagadahoc, Cumberland, and York, the value of potentially affected landings is substantial, but the economy as a whole is more diversified. As a result, these counties are somewhat less sensitive to adverse impacts that may stem from changes in ALWTRP regulations. The same is true of New Hampshire’s Rockingham County. There, 85 percent of ex-vessel revenue is  derived from landings made with ALWTRP gear, which suggests that the county’s harvesting sector is highly exposed. The sensitivity of the county’s economy as a whole, however, is tempered by its low fishing dependence score. In addition, Rockingham County’s  unemployment rate is the lowest reported among the counties analyzed; this suggests that its
economy has a relatively strong capacity to respond to change and that the region is less vulnerable to adverse impacts than areas where the unemployment rate is higher.      In Massachusetts and Rhode Island, the situation is more varied. In general, the value of landings made with ALWTRP gear in the counties of these states is lower than that reported for counties in Maine and New Hampshire, both on an absolute and a relative basis. In addition, the economies of coastal counties in Massachusetts and Rhode Island tend to be more diversified and less dependent on the commercial fishing sector. Nonetheless, ALWTRP gear accounts for ex- vessel revenues of more than $15 million per year in Essex (MA), Barnstable (MA), and Bristol (MA) counties, suggesting that exposure to adverse impacts in these counties may be substantial. Dependence on commercial fishing is considered medium in Essex and Bristol counties but is rated high in Barnstable County. With an unemployment rate that exceeds 10 percent,  Barnstable County may be particularly vulnerable to adverse impacts stemming from the introduction of new ALWTRP regulations.      Businesses that deal in or process fish or shellfish landed by fisheries subject to the ALWTRP are scattered throughout the Northeast region (see Exhibit 7-4). To the extent that changes in ALWTRP regulations reduce overall harvest, these businesses may be affected. A reduced flow of product to dealers and processors could result in layoffs of employees and, in extreme cases, closure of some businesses altogether. As discussed below, however, the analysis suggests that the regulations under consideration would be unlikely to have a major impact on landings. Thus, any impact on the dealer or processing sectors in the region is likely to be minimal.7.3.3 Caveats      The evaluation of at-risk communities focuses on areas where the absolute impact of potential regulations is likely to be the greatest. While impacts elsewhere may be smaller on an absolute basis, they could be substantial in relative terms; the importance of such impacts to the affected communities should not be overlooked.

7.4 SOCIOECONOMIC IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVES      The preceding discussion identified and characterized communities most vulnerable to potential changes in ALWTRP regulations. The discussion that follows looks more closely at specific segments of the harvest sector and potential impacts on vessel operators. The discussion focuses on whether the costs of regulatory compliance will cause changes in fishing effort (e.g., vessel retirement) and landings that may lead to broader socioeconomic effects, such as impacts to the dealer and processing sectors or changes in regional employment.7.4.1 Comparison of Vessel Compliance Costs to Ex-Vessel Revenues      To examine the potential for socioeconomic impacts due to new ALWTRP requirements, the analysis considers the economic burden placed on different groups of vessels, as identified in Chapter 6. Comparing estimates of average vessel compliance costs to estimates of the revenues typically earned by vessels in the affected sectors helps to indicate the extent to which the regulations will impose a hardship on vessel operators.7.4.1.1 Vessel Distribution by Geographic Area      The comparison of average compliance costs to vessel revenues draws on the model vessels employed in the economic impact analysis. Cost burdens for lobster vessels are characterized for 32 unique fishing areas; burdens for OTP vessels are characterized for five areas. Gillnet vessels face relatively minor costs associated with gear marking requirements, which are unlikely to affect fishing decisions. Thus, they are not included in the cost burden analysis.7.4.1.2 Number of Affected Vessels      The purpose of the SIA is, in part, to identify groups of vessels that may face disproportionately high compliance costs. For this reason, the analysis focuses only on OTP vessels that are active in areas that would be subject to minimum trawl-length standards; i.e., it excludes vessels that fish solely in state waters that would be exempt from these requirements. The estimates of affected vessels and of economic burden that are presented below are consistent with this focus; for state waters, they pertain only to areas that would be subject to minimum trawl-length requirements.7.4.1.3 Vessel Revenue      The analysis compares estimates of average annual compliance costs for each group of model vessels in a particular fishery and location (e.g., lobster vessels fishing in the non-exempt state waters of Maine Zone D) to a corresponding estimate of average annual revenue for the vessels in this area. Gross revenue for each vessel group is estimated as a function of average annual catch per trap, the average number of traps fished over the course of a year, and average annual ex-vessel prices.
      For the lobster fishery, the analysis develops annual catch per trap estimates based on a variety of data sources (see Chapter 6, Exhibit 6-4). The Vertical Line Model provides an estimate of the average number of traps fished by each model vessel. The resulting estimate of annual catch (pounds per year) is converted to an annual revenue figure using area-specific ex- vessel price data (see Exhibit 6-4).      The analysis uses a similar methodology to calculate annual gross revenue for the model vessels that represent the OTP fishery:• Massachusetts OTP Vessels – The OTP fisheries in Massachusetts are relatively small, and catch data for many species and areas are confidential. Therefore, the analysis employs a weighted average catch  per trap figure derived from available data on the catch of three key species (conch, scup, and black sea bass), as reflected in Massachusetts DMF Catch Report data (2011). This process yields a single catch per trap figure for the model vessel representing each geographic area. The same weighting scheme is then used to derive a single price per pound figure for each area. This information, combined with an estimate from the Vertical Line Model of the average number of traps fished by OTP vessels in each area, provides an estimate of annual revenue per vessel.• Other Northeast OTP Vessels – Information on catch per trap is not available for OTP vessels in other Northeast waters. For these areas, the analysis estimates average annual revenue per vessel based on VTR and Dealer data.7.4.1.4 Vessel Compliance Costs      The economic analysis (see Chapter 6) provides estimates of incremental compliance costs for each model vessel and regulatory alternative. Compliance costs include the cost of new gear required to comply with the rule’s minimum trawl length regulations (e.g., additional groundline), labor costs associated with reconfiguring gear, and associated catch impacts. For vessels affected by seasonal closures, upper bound costs reflect the impact of suspending fishing during the closure period. In the lower bound, the estimate of costs reflects a mix of revenue losses for vessels that are assumed to be unable to relocate and relocation costs (e.g., fuel, time, and potential catch impacts) for vessels that seek out alternative fishing grounds. All costs are expressed on an annualized basis.7.4.1.5 Comparison of Costs and Revenues      To identify potentially hard-hit sectors of the commercial fishing industry, the analysis compares estimates of average vessel compliance costs to estimates of average gross revenue per vessel. Exhibits 7-5 through 7-7 present the results. There is no clearly-defined threshold at which annualized costs represent a large enough percent of annual revenues that a vessel
operator  would  cease  fishing or  would  otherwise  suffer  social  and economic hardship.	For purposes of analysis, however, the exhibits highlight two impact categories:• Heavily-Affected Vessels – Segments of a fishery for which the estimated upper bound compliance costs exceed 15 percent of annual revenues.• At-Risk Vessels – Segments of a fishery for which estimated compliance costs range between 5 and 15 percent of annual revenues.These categories are consistent with those employed in previous analyses of the impacts of new ALWTRP regulations.3      The results presented below focus on the impacts of Alternative 6 (Preferred); a summary of the impacts of the other alternatives can be found at the end of the chapter. Because vessels that would not be affected by the seasonal closure of Massachusetts Restricted Area #2 under Alternative 6 (Preferred) are likely to face a substantially lower cost burden than those affected by the closure, the discussion separately describes the estimated impact of these provisions.Impacts of Gear Configuration and Gear Marking Requirements      Under Alternative 6 (Preferred), the cost of meeting new gear configuration and gear marking requirements is estimated to be less than 15 percent of gross revenues for all vessels (see Exhibits 7-5 and 7-6). As a result, the impact of these provisions alone would not lead any group of vessels to be designated as heavily affected, either in the low or high cost scenarios. Several groups, however, are identified as at-risk. Under the lower bound scenario, the at-risk category includes OTP vessels fishing in the state waters of Rhode Island or northern Massachusetts (SRAs 1-9). Under the upper bound scenario, the analysis identifies 10 additional groups of vessels as at-risk:• OTP vessels fishing in Massachusetts SRAs 10 through 13 or SRA 14, as well as OTP vessels fishing in Federal waters of the Northeast region;• Massachusetts lobster vessels fishing in SRAs 7, 9, and 14;           3 See National Marine Fisheries Service, Final Environmental Impact Statement for Amending the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan: Broad-Based Gear Modifications, August 2007.

The negative value reported here reflects such savings, which are primarily attributable to a reduction in the number of buoy systems required when trawls are employed.

ALWTRP - FEIS• Lobster vessels fishing in the non-exempt state waters of Maine Zone E; and• Lobster vessels fishing in the Federal waters of Maine Zones D, E, and F.4The estimate of impacts for these vessels ranges no higher than seven percent of gross revenues in the lower bound scenario and no higher than 12 percent in the upper bound scenario. This impact is substantial; however, the economic burden associated with gear marking and gear reconfiguration provisions alone is not sufficient to place these vessels in the heavily affected category, or to suggest that the impact of complying with these provisions would have a severe impact on socioeconomic conditions in coastal communities.Vessels Affected by Closures      In comparison to Alternative 1, the no action alternative, the analysis estimates that under Alternative 6 (Preferred), 109 lobster vessels would be required to suspend operations or relocate their effort to comply with the seasonal closure of Massachusetts Restricted Area #2. The costs these vessels would incur to comply with the closure would be in addition to the costs attributable to other requirements. The analysis indicates that, in aggregate, these measures would have a substantial impact on the affected vessels (see Exhibit 7-7).• As a lower bound, the analysis assumes that the vessels affected by the closure would be able to relocate their gear and continue to operate in other areas while the closure remains in effect. Under this scenario, the annual cost of compliance is estimated to range from 4.8 to 12.4 percent of the affected vessels’ average annual gross revenue. The results suggest that most of those affected would face a cost burden that would place them in the at-risk category (i.e., annualized compliance costs ranging from 5 to 15 percent of annual revenues).• As an upper bound, the analysis assumes that the affected vessels would suspend operations and forgo the revenue (net of operating cost savings) on the catch they otherwise would have landed. In this case, the annual cost of compliance is estimated to range from 8.8 to 20.4 percent of the affected vessels’ average annual gross revenue. The impact on most of those that would be displaced is estimated at greater than 15 percent – above the threshold specified for “heavily affected” vessels – suggesting the potential for some vessels to cease fishing entirely.           4 It is important to recognize that the estimate of impacts presented for each group of vessels is limited to the costs and revenues associated with gear being fished in a specific location. In practice, vessels may fish in multiple locations. Thus, the estimated cost of compliance as a percentage of revenue does not necessarily represent the overall burden on a particular vessel; instead, it represents the impact on that vessel for the portion of its effort based in a given area. Similarly, the estimate of revenues employed in the analysis does not necessarily represent a vessel’s total revenues; it simply represents the revenues derived from effort in a particular area.7-17

7.4.2 Landings and Employment Impacts      The regulatory alternatives under consideration may have implications for landings and employment in the harvest, dealer, and processing sectors. Building on the cost/revenue comparison presented above, this section discusses the potential landings reduction and employment impacts associated with Alternative 6 (Preferred). Because the analysis indicates that lobster vessels will experience the greatest cost burden, the discussion is limited to potential changes in lobster landings and associated employment impacts. All impacts are measured relative to Alternative 1, the no action alternative.7.4.2.1 Landings Impacts      As Chapter 6 discusses in detail, the economic impact analysis assumes that implementation of Alternative 6 (Preferred) would result in an overall reduction in lobster landings. This effect is due to two factors:• A reduction in catch per trap resulting from the use of longer trawls; and• Reduced effort or relocation to less productive grounds during the seasonal closure of Massachusetts Restricted Area #2.In the lower cost scenario, the analysis projects a reduction in lobster landings of approximately 474,000 pounds per year; in the higher cost scenario, the projected reduction in landings is approximately 1,231,000 pounds per year (see Appendix 7-B). In 2011, commercial landings of lobster totaled 126,460,000 pounds. Thus, the projected impact of Alternative 6 (Preferred) on the lobster catch is a 0.4 to 1.0 percent reduction in annual landings compared to Alternative 1, the no action alternative.      Even if the impacts projected under Alternative 6 (Preferred) for the higher cost scenario are realized, a notable effect on the lobster market is unlikely, particularly in the long run. In the near term, a 1.0 percent reduction in lobster landings would be expected to push prices up, which would have an adverse impact on consumers; the impact on prices would likely be greatest from January through April, when closure of Massachusetts Restricted Area #2 would be in effect.5 On a year-to-year basis, however, lobster landings are likely to fluctuate by considerably more than 1.0 percent; thus, the potential impact of new ALWTRP regulations would be unlikely to lead to a substantial change in overall market conditions.6 Moreover, the impact of gear reconfiguration requirements on catch would likely diminish over time; following an initial adjustment and learning period, fishermen may ultimately achieve catch rates similar to those they achieve with their current configuration of gear.           5 It is important to note that any increase in prices would, at least in theory, help to offset the costs that fishermen would incur in complying with new regulations. Whether this would in fact be the case depends on the extent to which an increase in prices at the retail level would translate to an increase in ex-vessel prices, or would instead be reflected in higher profits elsewhere in the supply chain.6 For data on annual lobster landings, see Chapter 4, Exhibit 4-3.
7.4.2.2 Employment Impacts      As discussed above, the economic analysis estimates that the impact of Alternative 6 (Preferred) on lobster landings is likely to be relatively modest and well within the range of annual variation the fishery has recently experienced. Thus, the analysis does not anticipate that implementation of the alternative would lead lobster dealers or processors to cease operation or significantly reduce their workforces. Impacts on employment, if any, are likely to be concentrated in the harvest sector.      The potential for adverse impacts on employment in the harvest sector is subject to considerable uncertainty. It is difficult to estimate the point at which the cost of regulation  would be so great that vessels would cease operating in the fishery.  Clearly, however, the  greater the burden the regulations would impose, the greater the likelihood that such impacts would occur. Thus, the analysis focuses on employment on vessels previously identified as heavily affected (i.e., those groups for which the upper bound estimate of annualized compliance costs exceeds 15 percent of annual revenues). As Exhibit 7-8 indicates, this includes the following groups:• Massachusetts lobster vessels fishing in SRAs 5, 7, or 9 that would be displaced as a result of the closure of Massachusetts Restricted Area #2; and• Lobster vessels fishing in Federal waters of LMA 1 that would be displaced by the closure of Massachusetts Restricted Area #2.Assuming, on average, that each vessel in these groups carries a captain and a sternman, total employment on heavily affected vessels is estimated at approximately 179. These individuals face the greatest risk of unemployment as a result of the management measures that would be implemented under Alternative 6 (Preferred).      The nature and duration of any employment effects that would result from implementation of new management measures under the ALWTRP is closely tied to the state of the economy where the affected parties reside. In communities where the fishing industry is experiencing economic hardship, it will be difficult for displaced fishermen to find employment on other vessels. Similarly, in communities where unemployment is high, displaced fishermen may find opportunities to work in alternate occupations to be extremely limited. The available data preclude identification of the home ports of all heavily affected vessels. It is reasonable to assume, however, that many of these vessels are based in ports bordering Massachusetts Restricted Area #2; i.e., ports on Cape Cod or in Plymouth County (MA). Economic conditions in these communities vary. In general, however, the fishing industry in these areas faces numerous economic challenges, and the job market as a whole reflects elevated unemployment rates nationwide; thus, it is unlikely that fishermen displaced by the introduction of new ALWTRP regulations would readily find alternate employment.

This approach may mask social impacts on some unique subgroups. The Massachusetts seasonal or “student” lobster fishery constitutes one such group.7 While the number of student license holders, vessels, and landings does not constitute a substantial portion of the Massachusetts lobster fishery, the fishery is socially and culturally important in that it helps young people learn a trade and provides a source of experienced labor for the commercial lobster fishery.      Seasonal license holders must be full-time students. They are limited to 25 traps and are licensed to take and sell lobsters to a licensed dealer from June 15 through September 15. The number of seasonal permits issued varies from year to year and has declined from 60 in 2009 to 37 in 2011. On average, seasonal license holders individually land about 250 pounds of lobster per year. Total annual landings in 2011 were just under 10,000 pounds, less than one-tenth of one percent of all Massachusetts landings.      Seasonal fishermen generally fish from small boats; in some cases, the fishermen haul by hand rather than with a hauler/winch. In 2011, the median vessel size in the seasonal fleet was  20 feet. In 2009, all but eight of the 60 vessels in the seasonal fleet were less than 22 feet in length; the smallest was 12 feet and largest was 36 feet. The seasonal vessels overwhelmingly fish single traps. In 2009, 93 percent of all active vessels fished singles. Of the 47 vessels reporting crew information in 2009, 27 (57 percent) fished with just the operator on board (i.e.,           7 The discussion of the student lobster fishery is based upon information provided by the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries: personal communication, November 7, 2012.
without additional crew). Most of the remaining vessels (13) fished with a single sternman. All seasonal vessels fish inshore waters; they are dispersed widely across the Massachusetts coast.      The minimum trawl-length requirements that NMFS is considering would apply to all commercial trap/pot vessels operating in Massachusetts waters that are subject to the requirements of the ALWTRP, including seasonal vessels. Given the size and configuration of these vessels, the limited experience of the operators and their tendency to fish alone, seasonal license holders may find it difficult to comply with the minimum trawl-length requirements, and participation in the seasonal fishery may diminish. If student fishermen are forced to seek summer employment in other industries, the effects of a diminished apprentice pool could negatively affect the Massachusetts lobster fishery.7.4.4 Caveats      The cost and revenue comparison presented above is subject to a variety of uncertainties that should be considered when interpreting the results, all of which are detailed in Chapter 6. Briefly, these uncertainties include:• The cost of gear reconfiguration, which is based upon available data and assumptions concerning the baseline configurations used in each area, the cost and useful life of specific gear elements, and the amount and value of the time required to implement the necessary conversions;• Whether reconfiguration will result in a need for additional crew or vessel modification;• The likely response (e.g., suspension or relocation) of fishermen faced with seasonal closure of their usual grounds, and the impact of those responses;• The number of traps fished by a given vessel;• The average catch per trap; and• Catch impacts associated with gear conversion and area closures.      The assumptions made in defining heavily affected vessels and affected fishermen’s likely response to ALWTRP requirements are also subject to significant uncertainty.  Key caveats include the following:• The analysis of impacts is based on annualized compliance cost estimates. Depending upon the timing of key regulatory requirements and other factors, the actual stream of annual costs that fishermen may face will vary; i.e., costs may be low in some years and high in others. To the  extent that it is difficult to borrow money to finance purchases in high-cost years, larger numbers of vessel operators may be at risk of ceasing operation than the analysis suggests.
• The analysis is based upon estimates of the average compliance costs faced by all vessels within a vessel group. These estimates likely understate the costs to some vessels and overstate the costs to others.• The analysis identifies vessels incurring costs greater than 15 percent of gross revenue as heavily affected, and focuses on these vessels as the most likely to exit the fishery. It is difficult to estimate the point at which the cost of regulation would be so great that vessels would retire. Further, this decision will be made on a vessel-by-vessel basis, and may include factors other than those considered in this analysis. To the extent that the threshold of adverse social effects for an individual vessel is lower or higher than is assumed in this analysis, social impacts may be over- or underestimated.• The upper bound assumption that all vessels affected by a closure will suspend fishing for the duration of the closure is extremely conservative. Fishermen may have a number of strategies for remaining active during a closure (e.g., relocation). However, fishermen’s ability to pursue these strategies may be constrained by regulations that limit access to alternative fishing grounds; practical considerations (e.g., distance, lack of familiarity with new fishing grounds); and tacit territorial agreements among members of the fishing fleet.• Similarly, assumptions regarding reduced landings as a result of gear reconfiguration are highly conservative. There is no conclusive evidence that gear modifications required under the ALWTRP will result in catch impacts.7.5 OTHER POTENTIAL SOCIAL IMPACTS      The discussion above focuses primarily upon socioeconomic impacts on the commercial fishing industry. The changes to the ALWTRP that NMFS is considering may have other social impacts, influencing the quality of life enjoyed by fishermen, their families, and other groups.7.5.1 Potential Negative Social Impacts      For fishermen and their families, the following social impacts may be associated with modifications to ALWTRP requirements:• Competition for fishing grounds may increase if changes to the ALWTRP include the seasonal closure of certain fishing grounds. Most notably, fishermen who would otherwise fish in the closed area may relocate their effort to new grounds, increasing competition in those areas. Competition for fishing grounds may also increase to the extent that fishermen relocate from their traditional fishing grounds to exempted waters or waters that
are otherwise subject to more moderate regulation. Tension, resentment, and conflict may result from attempts made by outsiders to exploit areas where they have not historically participated. Fishermen who are ultimately excluded from alternate grounds, and subsequently must sit out the season, may experience stress and anxiety associated with inactivity and lost income.• Increased congestion in certain areas may also increase the incidence of gear conflicts. As noted above, individuals whose usual grounds are closed seasonally may relocate to nearby open areas. Similarly, some may move inshore to areas where minimum trawling requirements are less stringent or may move to exempted waters to avoid these requirements entirely. To the extent that effort becomes concentrated in these areas, gear conflicts are likely to become more frequent. The stress associated with such conflicts may erode relationships among fishermen and exacerbate tensions over fixed resources.• Gear conflicts may also arise because of ALWTRP regulations that require fishermen in certain locations to use trawls with a single endline. When a trawl has two or more endlines, competing fishermen can use the location of the endline buoys to infer the position of the trawl on the ocean floor. The use of one buoy line may increase gear conflicts and gear loss, since it prevents other fishermen from visually determining the direction in which a trawl or string is set. The fishing community has generally proven adept at developing standard practices to avoid such conflicts, but their ability to adhere to such practices can be hampered by external variables such as weather.• Minimum trawl length requirements implemented under the ALWTRP may pose safety issues for fishermen. Some industry representatives have suggested that hauling or setting trawls from a small vessel can be dangerous due to the increased quantity of groundline lying on and deploying from a crowded deck, increasing the risk of a crew member becoming entangled and possibly pulled overboard. Furthermore, sources suggest that hauling gear with sinking groundline may pose a danger when fishermen attempt to free fouled line from a snag on bottom structure – an occurrence that could become more common with the introduction of minimum trawl length requirements. Fishermen who ordinarily fish singles and are unfamiliar with the use of trawls may be particularly at risk.• In addition to imposing time and cost burdens on some fishermen, the ALWTRP’s requirements may increase psychological stress on the regulated community. The rule obligates affected fishermen – some of whom have been fishing for decades – to adjust to new fishing techniques. Established fishermen might experience feelings of anger, anxiety, or frustration as they learn the new techniques that the ALWTRP prescribes.
While these feelings would be difficult or impossible to quantify, they nevertheless represent a negative impact for fishermen and their families.• As previously discussed, the management measures under consideration may have an adverse impact on fishermen’s catch. Apart from direct effects on revenue, catch impacts could lead to negative social impacts. For instance, fishermen may spend additional time fishing to make up for the loss in productivity. To the extent that hours at sea increase, this could reduce the quality of life that fishermen and their families enjoy.• Anecdotal evidence suggests that space limitations may make it infeasible for some small vessels to comply with minimum trawl-length requirements. The burden placed on small vessels could have important implications for the structure and character of fishing communities, particularly if it leads the operators of these vessels to exit the industry. This may leave the commercial fishing fleet smaller and more vulnerable to competition from corporate interests operating larger  vessels. Fishermen who value the independence of their profession and the freedom to operate a small business may be harmed by these trends.While such impacts are possible, it is difficult to predict their extent or determine the degree to which the regulatory alternatives differ with respect to the potential for such effects.7.5.2 Potential Positive Social Impacts      It is possible that in some cases, the management measures under consideration would have a beneficial effect on fishermen. The potential for such impacts was noted in a 2012 report on a collaborative pilot project conducted by the Maine Department of Marine Resources, the Gulf of Maine Lobster Foundation, and the lobster industry (Maine DMR, 2012). This project sought to determine the impact of fishing longer trawls in areas in which lobstermen traditionally have fished singles or pairs. The fishermen participating in this effort noted several potential benefits of switching to trawls. In particular:• Several fishermen noted they were able to haul traps configured in trawls more quickly than the same number of traps configured as singles, potentially resulting in decreased time spent at sea;• Several individuals noted that their success in grappling for lost gear was greater with trawls than with singles. Thus, those who switch from singles to trawls may spend less time in their efforts to recover lost gear.8           8 These time savings may be offset by an increased incidence of hang downs with longer trawls; however, the anecdotal evidence suggests that trawls did not hang-down with any greater frequency than the usual single/double trap configured gear.
      To the extent that the ALWTRP successfully protects and helps restore whale populations, those who view and photograph whales from private recreational vessels or from commercial whale watch vessels may also benefit. A number of studies have noted that enjoyment of the whale watching experience is positively correlated with the number of whales sighted. For instance, a study at the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary asked respondents to cite the most attractive features of a whale watch; the top responses included the number of whales seen as well as the number of species seen (Day, 1985 as cited in Rumage, 1990). Hoagland and Meeks (2000) found that in seven of eight ports of entry to Stellwagen Bank, respondents to a survey ranked the number of whales seen as an attractive feature of a whale watch more often than any other feature. Likewise, Loomis and Larson (1994) determined that whale watch riders viewing gray whales were willing to pay more for the experience when populations were increased. Similarly, Shapiro (2006) found that the number of whales seen on  a whale watch was positively and significantly correlated with the likelihood that the participant would recommend the tour to a friend (used as a measure of passenger satisfaction).      Whale watching is one of the most important recreational industries in New England. Hoagland and Meeks (2000) estimated the net economic “use” value of whale watching on Stellwagen Bank to be on the order of $440 million.9 While it is not feasible to quantify the increase in whale sightings or the associated economic welfare benefits associated with the ALWTRP, it is possible to characterize the overall size and popularity of commercial whale watching operations on the east coast.10 While complete data on the industry are lacking, a study by Hoyt (2001) attempted to compile data for operations worldwide. Roughly half of all commercial whale watching worldwide occurs in the U.S., and much of this activity is centered in New England.11 As shown in Exhibit 7-9, the Hoyt study identified 36 whale watching businesses in New England, with most operating multiple vessels. Hoyt estimated that over one million individuals take whale watching tours in the region each year, yielding over $30 million in annual revenue. Because these figures only apply to permitted and registered operations, the full scale and economic impact of whale watching activity is likely greater. Overall, given the level of activity in the industry, the economic welfare benefits associated with enhanced whale watching could be substantial.9 Present value, based on a five percent annual discount rate.           10 The Regulatory Impact Review included in this EIS provides a more detailed discussion of economic welfare concepts.           11 Although whale watching operations exist in the Mid- and South Atlantic states, the degree of activity is smaller and cannot be reliably distinguished from tours to view other species, such as dolphins.

Larger whale populations may increase demand for whale watch services, increasing patronage and/or the price that customers are willing to pay. In either case, whale watch operations may become more profitable.      The protection and restoration of populations of endangered whales may also generate non-use benefits.12 Economic research has demonstrated that society places economic value on (relatively) unique environmental assets, whether or not those assets are ever directly exploited. For example, society places real (and potentially measurable) economic value on simply knowing that large whale populations are flourishing in their natural environment (often referred to as “existence value”) and will be preserved for the enjoyment of future generations.13 Using survey research methods, economists have developed several studies of non-use values associated with protection of whales or other marine mammals. Exhibit 7-10 summarizes these studies. In each, researchers surveyed individuals on their willingness to pay (WTP) for programs that would maintain or increase marine mammal populations.           12 Portions of this discussion of non-use benefits are based on NMFS, Steller Sea Lion Protection  Measures, Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement, November 2001.           13 Non-use values such as those measured in these studies are closely related to “spiritual” or “ethical” values emphasized by some whale conservation advocates. These observers argue that whales deserve protection from human interference and that such protection provides an intellectual or spiritual benefit to mankind.

Through a survey of 8,476 households, the authors estimated an average WTP value (per household per year, for a 10-year period) of $71.62 for full recovery of the species and $38.79 for recovery sufficient to down-list the species from “endangered” to “threatened.” While the other studies noted do not focus specifically on the North Atlantic populations of right, humpback, fin, or minke whales, they do demonstrate that individuals derive economic value from the protection of marine mammals.7.6 SUMMARY AND COMPARISON OF ALTERNATIVES      An analysis of the socioeconomic characteristics of the potentially affected communities indicates that communities in mid-coast and Downeast Maine may be particularly vulnerable to adverse social impacts as a result of changes to the ALWTRP. Washington, Hancock, and Knox counties in particular are highly exposed to the effects of regulation due to the importance of the lobster fishery to these communities. The value of ALWTRP-affected landings in these communities is substantial, and is the greatest of all affected communities. Additionally, the  total number of affected vessels in these three counties is higher than in any other county in the affected region. These communities are also highly sensitive to the proposed regulations, as evidenced by their significant social, cultural, and economic dependence upon fishing. The rural nature of the economy in these counties, coupled with high unemployment and poverty rates,
suggest that they may have a relatively low capacity to adapt to economic impacts induced by new ALWTRP regulations.      The economies of other coastal counties in Maine, as well as the economies of coastal counties in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, tend to be more diversified and less dependent on the commercial fishing sector. As a result, they are somewhat less sensitive to adverse impacts that may stem from changes in ALWTRP regulations. Nonetheless, the unemployment rate in some areas, such as Cape Cod (Barnstable County), is quite high. Thus, these areas are also potentially vulnerable to adverse impacts stemming from the introduction of new ALWTRP regulations.      Exhibit 7-11 summarizes the socioeconomic implications of the regulatory alternatives that NMFS is considering. As previously noted, the analysis measures these impacts relative to Alternative 1, the no action alternative. With respect to the action alternatives, the following findings are noteworthy:• The cost of complying with the gear marking and gear reconfiguration requirements specified under Alternatives 2 through 6 (Preferred) is unlikely, in and of itself, to be substantial enough to force vessel operators out of business or to have a severe impact on socioeconomic conditions in coastal communities. The most significant effect of these requirements is likely to be their impact on small vessels. The size and configuration of these vessels may make it difficult for their operators to comply with minimum trawl-length requirements. The impact of the requirements on small vessels could have important implications for the structure and character of fishing communities, particularly if it leads the operators of these vessels to exit the industry.• Vessels affected by seasonal closure requirements would, in some cases, face economic impacts that would be difficult to absorb. Based on the  ratio of compliance costs to gross revenue, the number of vessels identified as heavily affected ranges from zero under Alternatives 2 and 3 to 163 under Alternatives 4 and 5. For the latter two alternatives, the vessels in the heavily affected category are lobster vessels that would be displaced by the closure of Jeffreys Ledge, the closure of Jordan Basin, or the closure of Massachusetts Restricted Area #1. In contrast, under Alternative 6 (Preferred), the analysis identifies 90 vessels as heavily affected; this group consists of lobster vessels that would be displaced by the closure of Massachusetts Restricted Area #2.• The available data preclude identification of the home ports of all vessels that would be displaced by the closure of Jeffreys Ledge, Jordan Basin, Massachusetts Restricted Area #1, or Massachusetts Restricted Area #2. It is reasonable to assume, however, that many of these vessels are based in nearby ports; i.e., ports in southern Maine, New Hampshire, or on Cape Ann in the case of Jeffreys Ledge; ports in mid-coast Maine in the case of Jordan Basin; and ports on Cape Cod or elsewhere in Massachusetts in the
case of Massachusetts Restricted Area #1 or Massachusetts Restricted Area #2. The fishing industry in these areas faces numerous challenges, while the job market as a whole reflects the heightened unemployment rates that have persisted nationwide for several years. In light of these conditions, fishermen displaced by the introduction of new ALWTRP regulations would likely find it difficult to secure employment on other vessels and could be faced with a lengthy period of unemployment while they seek work in other occupations – or, potentially, in other regions.• The estimated reduction in landings of lobster is greatest under Alternative 4 (2.1 million pounds per year) and smallest under Alternative 3 (997,000 pounds per year). However, landings reductions under all alternatives represent less than two percent of 2011 total landings. Because the reduction is substantially less than the annual fluctuation in total landings in recent years, adverse impacts on the dealer and processing sectors under any of the alternatives are unlikely.• The other adverse social implications of Alternatives 2 through 6 (Preferred) are similar in nature. They include a potential increase in the competition for territory in areas that remain open to fishing; additional potential for gear conflicts in these areas; heightened safety risks associated with fishing longer trawls; and a potential reduction in the size of the commercial fishing fleet. Because the alternatives all affect roughly the same number of vessels, the expected magnitude of such impacts is likely in most cases to be similar. The potential for increased crowding, competition and gear conflicts, however, is lowest under Alternative 2, and is lower under Alternatives 3, 6 (Draft), and 6 (Preferred) than under Alternatives 4 and 5, which include the most extensive seasonal area closures.• The public welfare benefits associated with increased whale protection are likely to be similar across all alternatives. The analysis measures the change in whale protection offered by a given alternative as a change in the co-occurrence of whales and vertical lines. By this measure Alternative 5 offers the greatest protection to whales, with a reduction in co-occurrence (upper bound scenario) of 42 percent. Alternative 2 offers the least additional protection, with a decrease in co-occurrence (upper bound scenario) of 36 percent.      It is important to consider the socioeconomic burden of the ALWTRP in the context of the larger set of regulations faced by ALWTRP fisheries and the fishing industry as a whole. To the extent that certain communities and groups of vessels have been adversely affected by existing regulations, changes to the ALWTRP may add to their burden and have a substantial impact. The cumulative effects analysis presented later in this EIS considers these issues.

In Federal waters, the analysis employs 2011 NMFS Northeast Vessel Trip Report (VTR) and 2011 NMFS Northeast Permit data indicating homeport. In Maine state waters, the analysis uses ME DMR’s 2010 Annual Log Survey dataset to develop distributions of homeports associated with vessels fishing in the ME Lobster Zones. In New Hampshire, the analysis assumes all vessels port in Rockingham County. In Massachusetts, the analysis uses MA DMF permit and 2009 Catch Report data, which identify vessel homeport. In RI, the analysis distributes vessels to counties based on reported harvest values in the 2011 NMFSDealer data. These estimates include vessels fishing in waters currently exempt from the ALWTRP.Estimated total employment on ALWTRP vesselsNumber of individuals working on ALWTRP vessels is based on a low and high bound estimate of the average crew for representative vessels by fishery and location. Average crew size is derived from crew sizes identified in Federal VTR and Permit databases, 2011 Massachusetts Catch Report Data, and the GMRI (2006) survey. Average crew sizes (low/high) are as follows: State waterslobster vessels (1/2); Federal waters lobster vessels (2/3); State waters gillnet vessels (2/4); Federal waters gillnet vessels (3/5); State waters OTP vessels (1/2); and Federal waters OTP vessels (2/3).Dealer SectorOverall number of dealersNumber of seafood dealers purchasing catch landed in the county.

The average employment figure is derived from data in the Census Bureau’s County Business Patterns database (based on data for the “fish and seafood wholesale” industry). Inconsistencies between the number of dealers reported in the U.S. Census Data and those reported in NMFS Dealer database indicate that the definition and nature of businesses identified as “dealers” may differ between the two sources.

SUMMARY AND INTEGRATION OFIMPACT ANALYSIS FINDINGS	CHAPTER 8      This chapter summarizes and integrates the findings of the biological, economic, and social impact analyses presented in the three preceding chapters, assessing the relative merits of the regulatory alternatives considered in this Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). In all cases the analysis measures these impacts relative to Alternative 1, the no action alternative. Alternative 1 would make no change in the requirements of the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan (ALWTRP), preserving the regulatory status quo. Thus, it would have no economic impact and no effect on social conditions in fishing communities. It also would have no impact on the rate at which North Atlantic right whales, North Atlantic humpback whales, or fin whales are seriously injured or killed as the result of incidental entanglement in commercial fishing gear. As Chapter 2 discusses in detail, the available data indicate that additional action is needed to reduce the risk of entanglement and achieve the degree of protection mandated for these species under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA). Accordingly, NMFS is considering modifications to the ALWTRP designed to meet the requirements of the ESA and MMPA. These modifications include:• Minimum trawl-length standards, which would apply to the lobster, blue crab, and other trap/pot (OTP) fisheries in the ALWTRP’s Northeast waters;• New gear configuration requirements, which would apply to trap/pot fisheries in the ALWTRP’s Southeast waters;• Seasonal closure of designated areas in the Northeast to trap/pot gear;• Changes in the designation of waters that would be exempt from ALWTRP requirements off the coast of New Hampshire; and• New gear marking requirements, which would apply to regulated fisheries in all waters that are subject to the ALWTRP and, under most of the alternatives, to gear fished in Maine and New Hampshire waters that would be exempt from other ALWTRP requirements.NMFS has specified several action alternatives – Alternatives 2 through 6 (Preferred) – that include different combinations of these measures. NMFS’ assessment of the biological, economic, and social impacts of these alternatives is summarized below.
8.1 BIOLOGICAL IMPACTS8.1.1 Impacts on Whales      All of the action alternatives include provisions that would revise the gear marking requirements specified under the ALWTRP. Under Alternatives 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (Draft), the new requirements would apply to gear set in all non-exempt waters, as well as exempt waters in Maine and New Hampshire. Under Alternative 6 (Preferred), gear set in Maine waters landward of the ALWTRP exemption line would remain exempt from gear marking requirements. The new gear-marking provisions would have no immediate impact on entanglement risks. In the long run, however, they may help the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) target and improve its efforts to protect large whales. It is often difficult to connect the gear in which a whale is entangled with a particular fishery, because entangled whales frequently carry only a portion of the gear they have encountered and disentanglement efforts sometimes recover only some of the remaining gear. The gear marking requirements under consideration would help to generate information on the nature of the gear involved in an entanglement. In addition, these provisions in some cases would allow NMFS to identify the owner of the gear, which would enable the agency to gather additional information on where, when, and how the gear was set.  By increasing understanding of the nature of large whale entanglements, gear marking measures would allow NMFS, over time, to improve the effectiveness of the ALWTRP. Under Alternative 1, the no action alternative, no additional improvements to the effectiveness of the ALWTRP would occur.      The other regulatory provisions under consideration are likely to have a more immediate and direct effect on the entanglement issue. For example, Alternatives 2 through 6 (Preferred) incorporate various provisions restricting the number of trap/pot buoy lines that fishermen in the Northeast region can employ. Analysis using the Vertical Line Model indicates that the trawling requirements (in combination with other provisions) would reduce the number of vertical lines in ALWTRP-regulated waters by approximately 30 to 35 percent, depending on the alternative. By reducing the number of vertical lines in the water column, these provisions would help to reduce the frequency of entanglements. Under Alternative 1, the no action alternative, the number of vertical lines in the water column would not change, leaving the whales exposed to the current level of entanglement risk.      Alternatives 2 through 6 (Preferred) would also introduce additional gear restrictions for vessels fishing in and around calving grounds in the Southeast. These restrictions affect weak link breaking strength, vertical line strength, vertical line composition, and trawling (i.e., mandatory use of singles). While current practices largely adhere to the proposed restrictions, some incremental conservation benefit may be realized. In addition, these provisions would create safeguards against changes in fishing practices that might increase entanglement risks. Under Alternative 1, the no action alternative, no additional safeguards would be put in place.      Beyond the provisions described above, Alternatives 3 through 6 (Preferred) would also close designated areas in the Northeast to trap/pot gear during months in which whales are most likely to be present (see Exhibit 8-1). Closure of these areas is likely to lead to further reductions in the risk of entanglement compared to Alternative 1, the no action alternative.
Exhibit 8-1SUMMARY OF AREA CLOSURE PROVISIONSClosureRegulatory AlternativeClosure Period    Size (square miles)Cape Cod Bay Restricted Area3February - April644Jordan Basin4 & 5November - January725Jeffreys Ledge4 & 5October – January607Massachusetts Restricted Area #14 & 5January - April2,464Massachusetts Restricted Area #26 (Draft) &6 (Preferred)January - April2,161      Alternatives 3, 5, and 6 (Draft) also include a provision that would expand the areas that are exempt from ALWTRP gear modification requirements to include all New Hampshire state waters. Under Alternative 6 (Preferred), gear in New Hampshire state waters would remain subject to current gear modification requirements (e.g., the requirement to use sinking groundline), but would be exempt from minimum trawl-length regulations. Whales are unlikely to be found in these waters, as suggested both by NMFS' review of the data and its current understanding of whale behavior. NMFS believes that exempting this area from minimum trawl- length regulations would be unlikely to have a significant adverse impact on endangered or protected whales compared to Alternative 1, the no action alternative.8.1.2 Other Biological Impacts      In addition to impacts on large whale species, changes to ALWTRP regulations may affect other aspects of the marine environment, including other protected species, essential fish habitat, and directed catch and bycatch in affected fisheries. Analysis of these issues suggests no significant differences among Alternatives 2 through 6 (Preferred) with respect to impacts on essential fish habitat, directed catch, or bycatch; in each case, the impacts are generally expected to be minor.      Gear restrictions are likely to benefit other protected species prone to entanglement. Specifically, NMFS believes that the trawling requirements could help reduce entanglement risks for sea turtles, whales, dolphins, porpoises, and seals. Likewise, weak link requirements in the Southeast may benefit blue, sei, and sperm whales. The impact of Alternatives 2 through 6 (Preferred) with respect to these benefits is likely to be similar compared to Alternative 1, the no action alternative. The closure of designated areas in the Northeast to trap/pot gear  could provide ancillary benefits to sea turtles, sei whales, harbor porpoises, seals, and some pelagic delphinids that may be present when the closures are in effect. Compared to Alternative 1, the  no action alternative, these benefits are likely to be greatest under Alternatives 4 and 5, which propose the closure of three different areas for various periods over several months, and lower under Alternatives 3, 6 (Draft), and 6 (Preferred), which propose the closure of less extensive areas for three or four months (see Exhibit 8-1).      Adding all New Hampshire state waters to the area designated as exempt from ALWTRP requirements, as provided for under Alternatives 3, 5, and 6 (Draft), would relieve vessels fishing in these waters from the need to comply with current ALWTRP requirements, including universal gear modification requirements, weak link requirements, and the requirement to use
sinking groundline. These changes could have an adverse effect on other protected species, such as sea turtles.8.1.3 Comparison of Biological Impacts across Alternatives      The biological impacts analysis presented in Chapter 5 relies primarily on NMFS’ Vertical Line Model to examine how the regulatory alternatives might reduce the possibility of interactions between whales and fishing gear. As discussed in that chapter, the model integrates information on fishing activity, gear configurations, and whale sightings to provide indicators of the potential for entanglements to occur at various locations and at different points in time. The fundamental measure of entanglement potential is co-occurrence. The co-occurrence value estimated in the model is an index figure, integrated across the spatial grid, indicating the degree to which whales and the vertical line employed in gillnet or trap/pot fisheries coincide in the waters subject to the ALWTRP. Biological impacts are characterized with respect to the percentage reduction in the overall co-occurrence indicator each alternative would achieve.      Exhibit 8-2 summarizes the estimated change in co-occurrence under each action alternative relative to the no-action alternative (Alternative 1). Separate results are provided for Northeast waters and for ALWTRP waters coastwide. Alternative 2, which includes trawling requirements but no closures, is estimated to yield a reduction in co-occurrence of approximately 36 percent. Alternatives 3 through 6 (Preferred) add incrementally to this reduction through closure of high-risk areas at various times of year. The estimated impact of these closures is greater when affected vessels are assumed to suspend fishing rather than relocate to alternative fishing grounds. The greatest reduction in co-occurrence is achieved under Alternative 5, which includes modified trawling requirements as well as three closures (Jeffreys Ledge, Massachusetts Restricted Area #1, and Jordan Basin). Under this alternative, the estimated reduction in co- occurrence ranges from approximately 40 to 42 percent. Under Alternative 6 (Preferred), the estimated reduction in co-occurrence is approximately 38 percent in Northeast waters and 37 to 38 percent coastwide.Exhibit 8-2ANNUAL CHANGE IN CO-OCCURRENCEAlternativePercent Reduction in Co-Occurrence ScoreNortheast WatersCoastwideAlternative 1 (No Action)0.0%0.0%Alternative 2-36.1%-35.8%Alternative 3 (100% Suspend)-37.7%-37.4%Alternative 3 (Relocation)-37.4%-37.2%Alternative 4 (100% Suspend)-40.8%-40.5%Alternative 4 (Relocation)-39.0%-38.7%Alternative 5 (100% Suspend)-42.0%-41.7%Alternative 5 (Relocation)-40.0%-39.7%Alternative 6 – Draft (100% Suspend)-38.2%-38.0%Alternative 6 – Draft (Relocation)-37.7%-37.4%Alternative 6 – Preferred (100% Suspend)-38.2%-37.9%Alternative 6 – Preferred (Relocation)-37.7%-37.4%
8.2 ECONOMIC IMPACTS      The economic impact analysis developed for this EIS provides detailed estimates of the compliance costs associated with potential changes to the ALWTRP. The analysis estimates compliance costs for model vessels and extrapolates from these findings to estimate the overall cost to the commercial fishing industry of complying with the regulatory changes under consideration. As noted above, the analysis measures the cost of complying with new requirements relative to Alternative 1, the no action alternative − i.e., a baseline scenario that assumes no change in existing ALWTRP requirements. Thus, all estimates of compliance costs are incremental to those already incurred in complying with the ALWTRP. All costs are presented on an annualized basis and reported in 2011 dollars. The calculation of annualized costs is based on a real annual discount rate of seven percent.      The discussion that follows begins by summarizing the methods used to estimate the cost of complying with each of the regulatory alternatives that NMFS is considering. It then presents the resulting cost estimates.8.2.1 Compliance Cost Estimation Methods8.2.1.1 Gear Configuration Requirements      A major component of Alternatives 2 through 6 (Preferred) is a minimum trawl-length requirement – i.e., prohibiting trawls of less than a specified number of traps or pots – for trap/pot fisheries in Northeast waters. The exact nature of this requirement varies by alternative and location. The costs that fishermen are likely to incur in complying with such requirements are primarily composed of gear conversion costs and catch impacts.      Vessels fishing shorter configurations (e.g., singles, doubles) would need to reconfigure their gear to comply with trawling requirements. These changes may require expenditures on new equipment as well as investments of fishermen’s time. Analysis of the economic impact of the trawling requirements entails comparing the baseline configuration of gear assigned to model vessels in NMFS’ Vertical Line Model with the minimum trawl length that would be required under each regulatory alternative. The analysis identifies instances in which the reconfiguration of gear would be required, estimates the material and labor necessary to bring all gear into compliance, and calculates the resulting cost. Equipment costs are a function of the quantity of gear to be converted and the unit cost of the materials needed to satisfy the trawling requirement. Labor costs are a function of the time required to implement a specific modification, the quantity of gear to be converted, and the implicit labor rate. All costs are calculated on an incremental basis, taking into account any savings in material or labor costs that might result from efforts to comply with new ALWTRP regulations.      In addition to the direct cost of gear conversion, catch rates may decline for vessels that are required to convert from shorter sets to longer trawls, reducing the revenues of affected operations. To estimate impacts in the lower bound, the analysis assumes that vessels implementing a major increase in trawl length (an increase of a factor of two or more in the number of traps in each set) would experience a five percent reduction in their annual catch. In
the upper bound, the analysis assumes that these vessels would experience a ten percent reduction in catch, while all other vessels would experience a five percent reduction. The resulting impact on each vessel’s annual revenues is based on prevailing ex-vessel prices for lobster or other trap/pot species.      The analysis does not attempt to quantify several other impacts potentially associated with changes in ALWTRP gear configuration requirements. These include:• Costs associated with increased gear loss;• The potential need for a larger crew to handle longer trawls;• Vessel modification costs;• Costs for various gear requirements proposed for trap fisheries in the southeast Atlantic; and• Savings that may result under Alternatives 3, 5, and 6 (Draft) as a result of exempting gear in New Hampshire state waters from existing gear modification requirements (e.g., the requirement to use sinking groundline).• Savings that may result under Alternative 6 (Preferred) as a result of establishing quarter-mile buffer zones around Matinicus, Ragged, and Monhegan Islands, within which trap/pot gear would not be subject to minimum trawl-length requirements.The analysis addresses these impacts qualitatively, either because data to develop reasonable estimates are lacking or because available information suggests the impacts will be relatively small.8.2.1.2 Seasonal Closure Requirements      The analysis of the costs associated with the seasonal closure of designated areas begins by using the Vertical Line Model to estimate the number and type of vessels ordinarily active in each area during the proposed closure period. The remainder of the analysis is organized around two scenarios. In the upper bound, the analysis assumes that these vessels would remove all affected gear from the water for the duration of the closure. In this scenario, economic losses are estimated as the net loss in vessel revenue (i.e., the loss in gross revenue adjusted to take into account estimated savings in operating costs). In the lower bound, the analysis uses available data to identify alternative fishing grounds and the likely subset of vessels that would relocate their gear to alternative areas. In this scenario, estimates of economic losses are based on estimated changes in fuel use, time on the water, and catch per trap.
8.2.1.3 Gear Marking Requirements      Alternatives 2 through 6 (Preferred) specify revised gear marking requirements for all vessels that are subject to the ALWTRP, including those in the lobster, OTP, blue crab, and gillnet fisheries. The requirements apply to gear set in all non-exempt waters. Under  Alternatives 2 through 6 (Draft), the new requirements would also apply to gear set in exempt areas of Maine and New Hampshire state waters. In contrast, under Alternative 6 (Preferred), gear set in Maine waters landward of the ALWTRP exemption line would remain exempt from gear marking requirements. For each alternative, the analysis of gear marking costs is based on the Vertical Line Model’s estimates of the number of affected vessels and the number of vertical lines fished by those vessels (taking proposed trawling requirements into account). To model these costs, the analysis assumes that lines would be marked using gear marking whips woven into the line, each of which takes roughly five minutes to install. Annualized time and material costs are estimated for each model vessel, then extrapolated to the broader population of affected vessels.8.2.2 Economic Impact Results      Exhibit 8-3 summarizes the estimated number of affected vessels and industry compliance costs for each of the regulatory alternatives, breaking the results down by major regulatory component. Several findings are noteworthy:• In general, compliance with gear configuration requirements imposes the greatest costs, with estimates ranging from $1.0 million to $4.4 million per year. The costs attributable to the seasonal closure of restricted areas also contribute substantially to the estimate of total compliance costs under Alternatives 4, 5, 6 (Draft), and 6 (Preferred), with estimated annual impacts ranging from $560,000 to $2.1 million. Gear marking requirements add approximately $1.0 million annually to the estimated cost of complying with Alternatives 2 through 6 (Draft), and approximately $340,000 annually to the estimated cost of complying with Alternative 6 (Preferred).• Estimated compliance costs for Alternative 2 range from $2.3 million to$5.4 million per year, comparable to the estimates given for Alternative 6 (Draft) but lower than those for Alternatives 4 and 5 and higher than those for Alternative 3 and Alternative 6 (Preferred). Most of the estimated compliance costs under Alternative 2 are attributable to the alternative’s gear conversion requirements, which are comparable to those specified under Alternative 4 but slightly more stringent than those specified under Alternatives 3, 5, 6 (Draft), and 6 (Preferred). This alternative would not require the seasonal closure of any area, and thus would impose no costs related to a closure.
• The estimated cost of complying with Alternative 3 – $2.1 million to $4.4 million per year – is lower than that of complying with Alternatives 2, 4, 5, and 6 (Draft), and comparable to that of complying with Alternative 6 (Preferred). This alternative incorporates less stringent trawling requirements than specified under Alternative 2 and includes only the CCB Restricted Area closure, which would affect relatively few vessels and pose limited costs.• Alternative 4 is likely to pose the greatest costs – an estimated $3.6 million to $7.4 million per year – stemming both from its relatively stringent gear conversion requirements and provisions for the seasonal closure of three large areas. The estimated impact of the  closures specified under this alternative ranges from $1.3 million to $2.1 million per year.• The estimated cost of complying with Alternative 5 – $3.4 million to $6.4 million per year – is similar to but somewhat less than that of complying with Alternative 4. The difference is attributable to a difference in  trawling requirements, which are slightly less stringent under Alternative 5.• Total estimated compliance costs for Alternative 6 (Draft) are similar to those for Alternative 2, though the range of estimated costs is somewhat narrower. The total estimated impact – $2.6 million to $5.2 million per year – includes approximately $560,000 to $830,000 in costs attributable to the seasonal closure of Massachusetts Restricted Area #2.• The estimated cost of complying with Alternative 6 (Preferred) is $1.9 million to $4.5 million per year. The costs attributable to gear conversion requirements and the seasonal closure of Massachusetts Restricted Area #2 under this alternative are similar to those estimated for Alternative 6 (Draft); however, gear marking costs are substantially lower under Alternative 6 (Preferred) because it would not require gear in Maine waters landward of the ALWTRP exemption line to be marked. In the lower bound scenario, this leads the estimate of total compliance costs for Alternative 6 (Preferred) to be lower than the corresponding figures for all other action alternatives. In the upper bound scenario, the overall estimate for Alternative 6 (Preferred) is slightly higher than that for Alternative 3, but lower than the estimates for Alternatives 2, 4, 5, and 6 (Draft).

      Depending on the alternative and scenario (upper versus lower bound) in question, the analysis indicates that the lobster fishery would incur roughly 80 percent to 90 percent of estimated costs. OTP vessels in the Northeast would also incur a substantial share of costs, primarily because of the proposed minimum trawl-length requirements. The impact of the action alternatives on other fisheries is likely to be minor, reflecting only the costs associated with meeting new gear marking requirements.      Research suggests that current practices are largely consistent with the gear configuration requirements proposed for Southeast trap/pot fisheries. Therefore, the cost of complying with them is unlikely to be significant, and these costs are not analyzed in detail.8.3 SOCIAL IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVES      The analysis of social impacts considers how compliance with the regulatory alternatives could affect the socioeconomic viability of fishing and fishermen’s quality of life. The method and results described here are presented in greater detail in Chapter 7.8.3.1 Potentially Affected Communities      The social impact analysis first uses county-level data on affected fishing vessels to identify the communities at greatest risk of experiencing adverse social impacts stemming from the ALWTRP modifications under consideration. The analysis uses additional county-level socioeconomic data to characterize key features of the at-risk communities, examining  economic, demographic, and social features that may influence the impact of the regulations on the region.      Communities in mid-coast and Downeast Maine are the most vulnerable to adverse social impacts as a result of changes to the ALWTRP. Washington, Hancock, and Knox counties in particular are highly exposed to the effects of regulation due to the importance of the lobster fishery to these communities. The value of ALWTRP-affected landings in these communities is significant, and the greatest of all affected communities. Additionally, the total number of affected vessels in these three counties is greater than in any other county in the affected region. These communities are also highly sensitive to the proposed regulations, as evidenced by their significant social, cultural, and economic dependence upon fishing. The high unemployment and poverty rates in these counties suggest that they may have a relatively low capacity to adapt to economic impacts induced by new ALWTRP regulations.      More than 50 percent of ex-vessel revenues in Maine’s other coastal counties is attributable to landings made with ALWTRP gear. In some instances, however, such as Waldo County, the overall value of these landings is relatively low. In others, such as Lincoln, Sagadahoc, Cumberland, and York, the value of potentially affected landings is substantial, but the economy as a whole is more diversified. As a result, these counties are somewhat less sensitive to adverse impacts that may stem from changes in ALWTRP regulations. The same is true of New Hampshire’s Rockingham County, where economic diversification and lower unemployment suggest a stronger capacity to respond to change.
      In Massachusetts and Rhode Island, the situation is more varied. In general, the value of landings made with ALWTRP gear in the counties of these states is lower than that reported for counties in Maine and New Hampshire, both on an absolute and a relative basis. In addition, the economies of the counties in Massachusetts and Rhode Island tend to be more diversified and less dependent on the commercial fishing sector. Nonetheless, ALWTRP gear accounts for ex- vessel revenues of more than $15 million per year in Essex (MA), Barnstable (MA), and Bristol (MA) counties, suggesting that exposure to adverse impacts in these counties may be substantial. Dependence on commercial fishing is moderate in Essex and Bristol counties, but is high in Barnstable County. With an unemployment rate that exceeds 10 percent, Barnstable County may be particularly vulnerable to adverse impacts stemming from the introduction of new ALWTRP regulations.8.3.2 Comparison of Vessel Compliance Costs to Ex-Vessel Revenues      To identify potentially hard-hit sectors of the commercial fishing industry, the analysis compares estimates of average vessel compliance costs to estimates of average gross revenue per vessel. There is no clearly-defined threshold at which annualized costs represent a large enough percent of annual revenues that a vessel operator would cease fishing or would otherwise suffer social and economic hardship. For purposes of discussion, however, the analysis highlights two impact categories:• Heavily-Affected Vessels – Segments of a fishery for which the estimated upper bound compliance costs exceed 15 percent of annual revenues.• At-Risk Vessels – Segments of a fishery for which estimated compliance costs range between 5 and 15 percent of annual revenues.The number of vessels identified as heavily affected ranges from zero under Alternatives 2 and 3 to 163 under Alternatives 4 and 5 (see Exhibit 8-4). For the latter two alternatives, the vessels in the heavily affected category are lobster vessels that would be displaced either by the closure of Jeffreys Ledge or the closure of Massachusetts Restricted Area #1. In contrast, under Alternatives 6 (Draft) and 6 (Preferred), the analysis identifies 90 vessels as heavily affected; this group consists of lobster vessels that would be displaced by the closure of Massachusetts Restricted Area #2.8.3.3 Other Socioeconomic Impacts      As Exhibit 8-4 indicates, Alternatives 2 through 6 (Preferred) could generate additional socioeconomic impacts beyond the direct effect of compliance costs on vessel operations. For example:• To the extent that compliance reduces lobster landings, the dealer and processing sectors of the economy could be affected. The estimated reduction in landings of lobster is greatest under Alternative 4 (2.1 million pounds per year) and smallest under Alternative 3 (1.0 million pounds per year). Even in the case of Alternative 4, however, the estimated effect on
landings is less than two percent of total landings in 2011. Because the reduction is substantially less than the annual fluctuation in total landings in recent years, adverse impacts on the dealer and processing sectors under any of the alternatives are unlikely to be substantial.• Competition for fishing grounds may increase if changes to the ALWTRP include the seasonal closure of certain fishing grounds. Most notably, fishermen who would otherwise fish in the closed area may relocate their effort to new grounds, increasing competition in those areas. Competition for fishing grounds may also increase to the extent that fishermen relocate from their traditional fishing grounds to exempted waters or waters that are subject to more moderate regulation.• Increased congestion in certain areas may increase the incidence of gear conflicts. Gear conflicts may also arise because of ALWTRP regulations that require fishermen in some cases to use trawls with a single endline, which prevents other fishermen from visually determining the direction in which a trawl or string is set.• Minimum trawl-length requirements implemented under the ALWTRP may pose safety issues for fishermen. Some industry representatives have suggested that hauling or setting trawls from a small vessel can be dangerous due to the increased quantity of groundline lying on and deploying from a crowded deck, increasing the risk of a crew member becoming entangled and possibly pulled overboard. Furthermore, sources suggest that hauling gear with sinking groundline may pose a danger when fishermen attempt to free fouled line from a snag on bottom structure – an occurrence that could become more common with the introduction of minimum trawl-length requirements.• Some small vessels may find it infeasible to comply with minimum trawl- length requirements due to limitations on deck space and related issues.  To the extent that smaller vessels have difficulty competing, trends toward consolidation and increased corporate ownership of fishing vessels may be reinforced.

Because new gear configuration requirements under Alternatives 2 through 6 (Preferred) would affect roughly the same number of vessels, the impacts related to such requirements under each of these alternatives is likely to be similar. The potential for increased crowding, competition  and gear conflicts, however, is greatest under Alternatives 4 and 5, which include the most extensive seasonal area closures.      The public welfare benefits associated with increased whale protection are likely to be similar across all action alternatives. As noted, the analysis measures the change in whale protection offered by a given alternative as a change in the co-occurrence of whales and vertical lines. By this measure, Alternative 5 offers the greatest protection to whales, with a reduction in co-occurrence (upper bound scenario) of 42 percent. Alternative 2 offers the least benefit, with a reduction in co-occurrence (upper bound scenario) of 36 percent. These biological benefits have socioeconomic implications for the general public. Increasing whale populations would have a positive impact on the consumer surplus derived from whale watching (a use benefit) and may increase producer surplus for operators of whale watch vessels. Likewise, whale conservation may enhance intrinsic values that society holds for healthy, flourishing whale populations.8.4 INTEGRATION OF RESULTS      The inability to quantify and value the benefits of potential changes to the ALWTRP prohibits the use of benefit-cost analysis to identify the regulatory alternative that would be likely to provide the greatest net benefit. Instead, Exhibit 8-5 summarizes the estimated cost of complying with each regulatory alternative, coupled with the estimated impact of each alternative on the Vertical Line Model’s co-occurrence indicator. It also presents estimates of  the cost-effectiveness of each alternative in reducing co-occurrence, both in the aggregate and for its major components (i.e., gear marking, gear reconfiguration, and seasonal area closures). Because the alternatives vary with respect to the reduction in co-occurrence they achieve, it is not possible to identify a superior option based on cost-effectiveness alone. Nonetheless, the cost-effectiveness figures provide a useful means of comparing the relative impacts of the regulatory provisions that each alternative incorporates. The exhibit reveals several noteworthy findings:• The minimum trawl-length requirements yield the greatest reduction in co- occurrence for the associated compliance cost. In contrast, closures are less cost-effective, as evidenced by their greater cost per unit reduction in co-occurrence.• Alternative 3 is cost-effective relative to most of the other alternatives ($56,000 to $119,000 per unit of co-occurrence reduction). This is in part because the costs attributed to the seasonal closure of the Cape Cod Bay Restricted Area are relatively low. In addition, this alternative includes modifications to the gear reconfiguration requirements specified in Alternative 2 that are estimated to have a greater impact on co-occurrence at a lower total cost.
• The cost-effectiveness estimates for the remaining closures – Jeffreys Ledge, Jordan Basin, Massachusetts Restricted Area #1, and Massachusetts Restricted Area #2 – range from $194,000 to $573,000 per unit of co-occurrence reduction.• Overall, the least cost-effective alternative is Alternative 4. It includes the same gear reconfiguration requirements specified under Alternative 2, plus three closures with relatively high costs per unit of co-occurrence reduction. Alternative 5 appears to be superior to Alternative 4, achieving a greater estimated impact on co-occurrence at a lower total cost.• Alternative 6 (Preferred) is the most cost-effective of the alternatives ($51,000 to $118,000 per unit of co-occurrence reduction). It eliminates gear marking requirements for vessels in Maine exempt waters, lowering costs without affecting the estimated co-occurrence reductions. Like Alternative 6 (Draft), it includes only one closure (Massachusetts Restricted Area #2), further improving overall cost-effectiveness relative to alternatives that include more extensive closures.      Exhibit 8-6 further illustrates these findings, using cost-effectiveness curves to compare the impacts of Alternative 6 (Preferred) to those of Alternative 4, the least cost-effective of the alternatives analyzed. The exhibit displays co-occurrence reduction on the horizontal axis and compliance costs on the vertical axis for both the upper and lower bound scenarios for each alternative. The segments of each curve show the marginal impacts of the two alternatives’  major regulatory provisions. As the exhibit shows, gear-marking costs under Alternative 6 (Preferred) are estimated to be approximately one-third of those under Alternative 4, reflecting the exemption from gear-marking requirements the preferred alternative provides for gear in Maine’s exempt waters. This shifts the cost-effectiveness curves for Alternative 6 (Preferred) downward from those for Alternative 4, as reflected in the lower y-intercept. The marginal impacts of the two alternatives’ gear reconfiguration provisions are similar, although these impacts are estimated to be slightly more effective and less costly under Alternative 6 (Preferred). In contrast, the provisions for seasonal area closures under Alternative 4 are more extensive than those under Alternative 6 (Preferred), yielding a greater reduction in co- occurrence scores. The benefits associated with these closures, however, come at a relatively high cost, as reflected in the steeper slope of each segment of the cost-effectiveness curves that represents these impacts.      NMFS has considered the benefit and cost information presented above and believes that Alternative 6 (Preferred) offers the best option for achieving compliance with MMPA and ESA requirements. By excluding vessels in Maine exempt waters from gear marking requirements, Alternative 6 (Preferred) reduces compliance costs with no direct or immediate effect on the estimated reduction in co-occurrence. In addition, Alternative 6 (Preferred) provides most of the benefits that would be achieved under more stringent alternatives, sacrificing only the relatively costly additional reduction in co-occurrence that would be achieved by the closure of Jeffreys Ledge, Jordan Basin, and Massachusetts Restricted Area #1. Based on these considerations, NMFS has identified Alternative 6 (Preferred) as its proposed approach to achieving the goals of the ALWTRP.

CUMULATIVE EFFECTS ANALYSIS	CHAPTER 9      The cumulative effects analysis (CEA) examines the consequences of the regulatory alternatives within the context of past, present, and future factors that influence resources associated with the ALWTRP. The discussion below is organized according to the following topics:• the requirements that necessitate a CEA, which are presented in Section 9.1;• an introduction to the valued ecosystem components (VECs) considered in this analysis, which is located in Section 9.2;• a description of the geographic and temporal scope of the analysis, which is presented in Section 9.3;• a discussion of the past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions that interact with each VEC, which is presented in Section 9.4;• a summary of the biological, economic, and social consequences of the regulatory alternatives, which is in Section 9.5; and• a detailed analysis of the cumulative effects of the regulatory alternatives on each VEC within the context of other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions, which is in Section 9.6.9. 1	BACKGROUND      NEPA requires all environmental impact statements for proposed Federal actions to include a cumulative effects analysis that examines the impact of the actions in conjunction with other factors that affect the physical, biological, and socioeconomic resource components of the affected environment. Guidelines for evaluating cumulative effects, prepared by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), emphasize the growing evidence that “the most devastating environmental effects may result not from the direct effect of a particular action, but from the combination of individually minor effects of multiple actions over time” (CEQ, 1997). The
purpose of the cumulative effects analysis is to ensure that Federal decisions consider the full range of an action’s consequences, incorporating this information into the planning process.9.2 VALUED ECOSYSTEM COMPONENTS      The following VECs would be affected by changes to the ALWTRP and are addressed in this analysis:• Atlantic Large Whales. This VEC includes the three large whale species that are the focus of the ALWTRP  the North Atlantic right whale, the humpback whale, and the fin whale  as well as the minke whale, which also benefits from the plan. The Affected Environment chapter of this EIS provides a detailed discussion of the life cycle and abundance of these species.• Other Protected Species. Other protected species include other whales, dolphins, porpoises, seals, and turtle species that may interact with gillnet and/or trap/pot fishing gear and are classified as (1) endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act, or (2) otherwise protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. The Affected Environment chapter of this EIS provides an overview of the life cycle and abundance of these species.• Affected Fisheries. The affected fisheries are all those currently or potentially subject to the requirements of the ALWTRP:• The lobster trap/pot fishery, including all vessels holding state or Federal limited access lobster permits.• The gillnet fishery, including all vessels with state or Federal limited access or general category permits using gillnet fishing gear. This includes but is not limited to the following gillnet fisheries: multispecies, monkfish, spiny dogfish, shark, and the coastal migratory pelagic fisheries.• The other trap/pot fishery, including all vessels with state or Federal limited access or general category permits using trap/pot fishing gear. This includes but is not limited to the following trap/pot fisheries: black sea bass, conch/whelk, hagfish, Jonah crab, red crab, and scup.The Affected Environment chapter provides a detailed discussion of these fisheries.
• Habitat. The habitat VEC includes all marine habitats deemed essential and/or critical to the well-being and reproduction of commercial marine species and endangered species. For the purpose of this action, Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) includes all water column and benthic habitat of the EEZ. EFH is described in greater detail in the Affected Environment chapter. Critical habitat areas are designated under the Endangered Species Act for endangered or threatened marine species.• Human Communities. This VEC includes all coastal communities  whose economies and social structure are substantially dependent on or affected by lobster, other trap/pot, and/or gillnet fishing activities, whale watching or other passive uses.9.3 GEOGRAPHIC AND TEMPORAL SCOPE      This analysis is limited to the geographical area currently or potentially subject to the requirements of the ALWTRP. This area includes the seawater and sea bottom of the Atlantic Ocean within U.S. jurisdiction from Maine to West Palm Beach, Florida.      The temporal scope of the analysis varies by resource. In all instances, the analysis attempts to take into account both present and reasonably foreseeable future actions (within five years) that could affect valuable physical, biological, or socioeconomic resources. The  discussion of past actions and events, however, reflects underlying differences in the availability of historical information, as well as differences in the period of time that must be considered to provide adequate context for an understanding of current circumstances.• Atlantic Large Whales. The assessment of factors that have influenced the status of large whales employs a broad time horizon, reflecting the long history of commercial whaling and its critical role in the depletion of whale stocks. This history dates to as early as 800 A.D. The discussion notes the continuing impacts of whaling on the status of whales today, but also provides information on a variety of other stresses, including interactions with commercial and recreational fisheries, ship strikes, water pollution, noise pollution, climate change, and prey availability. The discussion of these issues focuses primarily on information gathered over the last two decades, and in particular on information characterizing conditions since 1994, when Congress amended the Marine Mammal Protection Act to require the preparation of annual stock assessments for all populations of marine mammals in U.S. waters.• 	Other Protected Species. The analysis of impacts on other protected species (i.e., whales, porpoises, dolphins, sea turtles, and seals) considers information on populations and large take incidents dating as far back as the 1940s, but again focuses primarily on the last two decades. As with large whales, regular efforts to collect information on porpoise, dolphin,
and seal species did not begin until 1994, when amendments to the MMPA mandated preparation of annual stock assessments. For sea  turtles, recovery plans were completed in the early 1990s; however, the collection of more detailed information did not begin until the mid-1990s, with the establishment of the Turtle Expert Working Group.• Habitat. The analysis of impacts on marine habitat relies primarily on information generated since the 1996 passage of the Sustainable Fisheries Act (SFA). Prior to 1996, marine habitat was directly and indirectly protected through a series of environmental regulations passed in the 1970s to 1990s. The SFA, however, represented the first Federal recognition of the importance of habitat protection for maintaining healthy fisheries, and resulted in a number of new regulations and requirements that applied a more rigorous and structured habitat protection approach. The systematic studies conducted to support the development of these regulations provide the necessary context for evaluating the impact of ALWTRP regulations.• Affected Fisheries and Fishing Dependent Communities. The analysis of impacts on affected fisheries and fishing dependent communities is based in large part on information gathered in the development of Fishery Management Plans (FMPs). These plans are developed under the provisions of the Magnuson-Stevens Act (MSA) and in some cases have been in place for several decades. In other cases, however, FMPs are relatively new or have yet to be implemented. In these instances, the historical analysis is generally limited to information on fishing activity and/or management actions within the last decade.9.4 EFFECTS OF PAST, PRESENT, AND REASONABLY FORESEEABLE FUTURE ACTIONS      The following sections consider the direct, indirect, and cumulative effects of past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions on each of the previously defined valued ecosystem components. The effects described below would occur without implementing any of the proposed modifications to the ALWTRP. The effects of past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions essentially describe the No Action Alternative (Alternative 1) in that the existing and future conditions are characterized relative to their present effects on the VECs.
9.4.1 Atlantic Large Whales      The status of large whales in the Atlantic has been and continues to be affected by numerous factors. Historically, commercial whaling produced the greatest reduction to whale stocks, and is largely responsible for driving the population of certain species to endangered status. Broad adherence to a voluntary international ban on commercial whaling has greatly reduced or eliminated this threat to the most seriously endangered species. Other threats, however, remain, the most documented of which include collisions between whales and ships and entanglements in fishing gear. Additional factors that may adversely affect Atlantic large whale stocks include water pollution, noise pollution, climate change, and prey availability. Less is known, however, about the actual impact of these threats on whale stocks. The following discussion describes the known or potential impact of these factors and provides a summary of past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future management actions taken to address the threat, if any.9.4.1.1 Commercial Whaling Impacts      Commercial whaling may have started as early as 800 A.D. in Scandinavia, and is known to have been practiced by the Basques off the coast of France and Spain as early as the 12th century. The practice spread to the Netherlands and Britain by the 16th century, and to the Americas by the 17th century. Early whaling, utilizing hand-held harpoons, targeted slow- swimming species like right whales and bowhead whales. With the development of steam driven vessels and, in 1868, the invention of the explosive harpoon gun, the age of modern whaling began. These innovations in whaling technology allowed whalers to target faster swimming species such as blue, fin, and sei whales.      The International Whaling Commission (IWC) was established in 1946 to regulate whaling and thus ensure the sustainability of the whaling industry (Cooke, 1995; Holt, 1999). The IWC originally negotiated whaling quotas with member nations based on estimates of whale populations. These quotas were set too high, however, and the system eventually proved incapable of preventing overexploitation (Gambell, 1999).1 By the early 1980s, the organization had shifted its focus from whaling regulation to whale conservation. The result was the 1982 approval of a ban on commercial whaling, which came into effect in 1986 and remains in effect to this day. As a result of this ban, most IWC members have ceased whaling entirely; only Denmark, Iceland, and Norway continue any form of whaling in the North Atlantic, and the number of whales taken by these nations has been greatly reduced.      The following discussion examines the history and current impacts of whaling on right, humpback, fin, and minke whales.           1 Membership in the IWC is voluntary; its resolutions are not binding, and its regulations are not binding on any nation that lodges formal objection to them.
Right Whales      North Atlantic right whales were the first target of commercial whaling and, consequently, the first large whale species to be hunted to near extinction by such efforts. Whalers targeted this species for several reasons, including the presence of right whales in near coastal waters, the relatively slow speed at which they swim, their tendency to float when dead, and the high yield of commercially valuable products (e.g., oil and baleen) they provided. These factors also contributed to the whale's common name, which is said to have originated from the English whalers who designated this species of whale as the "right" (i.e., correct) whale to hunt. More than 800 years of uncontrolled and intense commercial whaling is the primary reason that the population of right whales has declined to its present-day critical level.      As the stocks in these waters became depleted, hunting efforts shifted to the Labrador and New England coasts. In total, between the 11th and 17th centuries, an estimated 25,000 to 40,000 North Atlantic right whales are believed to have been taken.  This intense period of early  whaling may have resulted in a significant reduction in the stock of right whales by the time colonists in the Plymouth area began hunting them in the 1600s. Nonetheless, a modest but persistent whaling effort along the coast of what is now the eastern United States continued. One record from January 1700, for example, reports 29 right whales killed in Cape Cod Bay in a single day (Reeves, 1987).      The League of Nations adopted a resolution banning all whaling of right whales in 1935.2 At that time, it is thought that fewer than 100 right whales survived in the western Atlantic (NMFS, 2001a).Humpback Whales      Throughout their range, humpback whales were heavily exploited by commercial whalers until the middle of the 20th century. Prior to the onset of commercial whaling, the worldwide population of humpback whales is thought to have been in excess of 125,000. American whalers alone killed 14,000 to 18,000 humpbacks between 1805 and 1909 (Best, 1987) and the total North Pacific kill was estimated to be about 28,000 (Rice, 1978). Today perhaps no more than 10,000 to 12,000 exist (Braham, 1984), about ten percent of the estimated initial number.      Commercial hunting of humpbacks ceased in the North Atlantic in 1955 and in all other ocean waters in 1966. Since then, humpback whales have only been taken at three locations: off eastern Canada, where, from 1969 to 1971, 41 humpbacks were taken under a scientific permit; off western Greenland, where, until 1980, aboriginal subsistence hunters were permitted to take up to 10 humpbacks per year; and at Bequia Island in the Lesser Antilles of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, where subsistence hunters are permitted to take up to twenty humpbacks from 2003 through 2007. From 1996 to 2001, the actual take at this last location averaged two per year (IWC, 2003).2 The International Whaling Commission banned all whaling of right whales in 1949.
Fin Whales      Wide-scale hunting of fin whales, which tend to be found farther offshore than right whales or humpback whales, did not occur until the introduction of steam-powered vessels and harpoon gun technology and continued well into the 20th century. Commercial whaling for this species ended in the North Pacific in 1976 and the North Atlantic in 1987. Since 1987, the only area in the Northern Hemisphere where fin whales have been hunted with the authorization of  the IWC is Greenland.3 There, a take of 19 fin whales over five years (2003-2007) is permitted under the IWC’s “aboriginal subsistence whaling” scheme (IWC, 2002). Meat and other  products from whales killed in this hunt are marketed within Greenland, but export is illegal.Minke Whales      Hunting of minke whales did not commence until well into this century as larger whales became fewer in number and gained protected status. Hunting of minke whales was initially confined to small fishing boats in the nearshore waters of Norway and Iceland. After World War II, Norwegian minke whaling expanded to the west. In addition, local whaling commenced off the coasts of Canada and Greenland, and Japanese whalers began to target minke whales in the North Pacific and Antarctic.4 Under an official objection to the IWC moratorium on commercial whaling, Norway continues to hunt minke whales in the North Atlantic region. Greenland has also been active, taking a small number of minkes each year under the IWC's “aboriginal subsistence whaling” scheme. In addition, in 2003, Iceland announced its intention to take 38 minke whales from its coastal waters before the end of the year, and a total of 200 minke whales over two years for scientific research (Icelandic Ministry of Fisheries, 2003; Alvarez, 2003).      Exhibit 9-1 shows the catch history for minke whales by IWC member nations in the North Atlantic and worldwide from 2008 to 2010. These figures demonstrate that minke whales continue to be hunted in significant numbers, both in the North Atlantic and worldwide.           3 Within the last two decades, Iceland and Spain have hunted fin whales.  Iceland last reported a catch in  the 1989-90 season, when it took 68 fin whales; Spain last reported a catch for the 1984-85 season, taking 48 fin whales.           4 Over the past ten years, Japan has taken hundreds of North Pacific and Antarctic minke whales under a provision of the Whaling Convention that permits countries to take whales for scientific research.

The following section summarizes the risk to Atlantic large whales from entanglement in commercial and recreational fishing gear.Entanglements in Commercial Fishing Gear      Fishermen typically leave fishing gear such as gillnets and traps/pots in the water for a discrete period, after which time the nets/traps/pots are hauled and their catch retrieved. While the gear is in the water, whales may become accidentally entangled in the lines and nets.      Whales have been observed swimming with portions of line (with or without the fishing gear) wrapped around the pectoral fin, the fluke stock, the neck, or the mouth. Documented  cases have indicated that entangled animals may travel for extended periods of time and over long distances before freeing themselves or dying as a result of the entanglement (Angliss and Demaster, 1998). Younger animals are particularly at risk if the entangling gear is tightly wrapped, since the gear will become more constricting as the animals grow. The majority of large cetaceans that become entangled are juveniles (Angliss and Demaster, 1998). In addition, poor body condition and reduced blubber thickness resulting from entanglement can limit reproductive success in right whales and may increase susceptibility to disease (Miller et al., 2011).      The effects of entanglement can range from no permanent injury to death. The analysis  of entanglement data presented in Chapter 2 noted the following with respect to recent data on interactions between fishing gear and Atlantic large whales:
• Entanglements that caused serious injury most frequently involved humpback whales, followed by right whales, then minke and fin whales.• Fatal entanglements most frequently involved minke whales, followed by humpback whales, right whales, and fin whales.• Fatal entanglements were most frequently reported off the coast of Massachusetts. Additional fatal entanglements were reported off  the coasts of North Carolina, Virginia, South Carolina, and Maine.5      Exhibit 9-2 presents a summary of total annual mortality, annual mortality from fishing gear interactions, and the potential biological removal (PBR) level for each of the four Atlantic large whale species from 2005/2006-2009/2010. These data which almost surely under represent actual entanglement mortality demonstrate that the current number of detected deaths from fishing gear entanglements exceeds PBR levels for right and humpback whales.Exhibit 9-2TOTAL ANNUAL MORTALITY, ANNUAL FISHING MORTALITY AND POTENTIAL BIOLOGICAL REMOVAL (PBR) LEVELS FOR RIGHT,HUMPBACK, FIN, AND MINKE WHALESRight WhaleHumpback Whale Fin WhaleMinke Whale3Total Annual Mortality13.07.82.65.9Total Annual Mortality,U.S. Waters Only2.47.22.04.7Annual Fishing Mortality,U.S. Waters Only21.65.20.64.3PBR0.92.76.569Notes:1	Total Annual Mortality refers to mortality and serious injury resulting from large whale interactions with commercial fisheries and ship strikes, both inU.S. and Canadian waters.2	Annual Fishing Mortality refers to mortality and serious injury resulting from large whale interactions with commercial fisheries.3	Estimates for minke whales derived from stranding and entanglement data between 1999 and 2003 refer to U.S. waters only.Source: Waring et al., 2012 and 2013.Efforts to Reduce and Track Large Whale Entanglements           5 The location where a whale is first observed and reported as entangled is not necessarily the location where the whale initially became entangled. Sightings data can be influenced by many factors, including the amount of time and area covered by the observer program and/or whether the whales are known to congregate in observed areas.
      In 1996, the Atlantic Offshore Cetacean Take Reduction Team (AOCTRT) was  formed to address the interaction of western North Atlantic stocks of right and humpback whales, among other species, with the Highly Migratory Species (HMS) pelagic longline, pair trawl, and pelagic driftnet fisheries for Atlantic tunas, sharks, and swordfish.6 A draft plan to reduce takes resulting from these types of gear was submitted, but an Atlantic Offshore Cetacean Take Reduction Plan was not finalized as a separate entity. Instead, several protective measures were implemented for these fisheries through the HMS FMP. In particular, NMFS prohibited the use of pair trawls and swordfish driftnets in Atlantic pelagic fisheries, and implemented several other AOCTRT recommendations for the pelagic longline and shark gillnet fisheries. Since the nature of the fisheries that were included in the Plan has changed tremendously since 1996 when the Team was convened, NMFS disbanded the Team in August 2001.      Canada is also taking a closer look at interactions between North Atlantic right whales and Canadian commercial fisheries. In 2000, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, in cooperation with the World Wildlife Fund Canada, developed Canada's first Right Whale Recovery Plan and recovery implementation team. The recovery plan, which is intended as a “blueprint” for action, includes a number of recommendations related to gear entanglement, whale research, and regulatory and enforcement actions.Entanglements in Recreational Fishing Gear      Large whale entanglements may also result from interactions with recreational fishing gear, but data on recreational fishing of trap/pot and gillnet fishing gear are relatively sparse. Finfish recreational fisheries typically use rod and reel and hand lines instead of gillnets or fish pots. Recreational lobster fishing with traps/pots, however, is common, especially in state waters.7 In 2009, the state of Massachusetts issued 10,024 recreational lobster licenses, with 5,088 of these license holders reporting that they fished for lobster (MA DMF pers com, 2012). Common fishing methods included the use of traps/pots and diving for lobsters. The number of traps fished recreationally decreased from 2008 (10,768 traps in 2008). Although many other Atlantic states also allow for a recreational lobster fishery, additional data on the extent of the recreational fishery in other states are not readily available.      Recreational use of trap/pot and gillnet gear is not governed by the ALWTRP. Therefore, while the risk of entanglement in recreational gear may be relatively small, modification of the ALWTRP will not influence recreational fisheries at this time.8           6 Other cetacean species considered by the AOCTRT include Western North Atlantic stocks of sperm and pilot whales; and common, bottlenose, and spotted (Atlantic and pantropical) dolphins.7 Some states also allow recreational gillnet fishing.           8 NMFS does, however, conduct outreach to recreational fishermen; for more information, see Marine Mammal and Sea Turtle Protection: Guidelines for Recreational Fishermen.
9.4.1.3 Ship StrikesImpactsShip strikes − collisions between whales and ships – also pose a significant risk to whales. Exhibit 9-3 provides an estimate of average annual mortality from ship strikes for right, humpback, fin, and minke whales, based on reports from 1996 through 2001. As the exhibit indicates, the reported mortality rate for minke whales is less than 0.20 per year. In contrast, the mortality rate for larger whales is higher, ranging from 1.00 for right whales to 1.50 for fin whales. Given the depleted nature of these stocks, this represents a potentially significant source of risk. For the endangered North Atlantic right whale during the period 2005 through 2009, the minimum rate of annual human-caused mortality and serious injury to right whales from ship strikes averaged 1.6 per year (U.S. waters, 1.2; Canadian waters, 0.4) (Waring et al. 2012). At this time, both ship strikes and gear interactions remain a concern for the continued existence of right whales. As with all estimates of mortality presented here, it is likely that these numbers underestimate the true mortality due to ship strikes.Exhibit 9-3   AVERAGE ANNUAL MORTALITIES FROM SHIP STRIKES, 1996 THROUGH 2001 Right WhalesHumpback Whales  Fin Whales Minke Whales1.001.171.500.17Source: Analysis of data from Laist et al., 2001, and Jensen andSilber, 2004.      Fatal ship strikes of large whales first occurred in significant numbers during the 1950s to 1970s, as the number and speed of ships increased. A review of 58 known vessel collisions by Laist et al. (2001) revealed that while all sizes and types of vessels can hit and injure whales, the most severe injuries result from collisions involving ships that are greater than 80 meters in length or travelling at speeds exceeding 13 knots.9 The risk of such strikes is high near the Northeast seaboard's busiest ports and shipping lanes, some of which are located near waters that large whales frequent. For example, the main shipping lane to Boston traverses the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary, a major feeding and nursery area for several species of baleen whales. Similarly, Cape Cod Canal, another major conduit for shipping along the New England coast, provides passage from Buzzards Bay to Cape Cod Bay, an area known for large whale           9 Most whales swim at three to four knots. When frightened, some whales can swim seven to 14 knots, while a few can reach more than 26 knots. Laist et al. (2001) note several plausible explanations for their observation that collisions leading to serious injury or death generally involve vessels traveling at speeds greater than 13 knots: (1) whales are far more successful at avoiding ships moving at less than 13 knots; (2) ships spend most of their transiting time at speeds of 13 knots or above; (3) collisions at speeds of less than 13 knots are less likely to injure whales seriously or to damage ships, and thus are less likely to be noted and reported; and/or (4) the low number of collisions at speeds of less than 13 knots is an artifact of the small sample size of the collision  records available.
activity (Hoyt, 2001; NMFS, 2001b). In 1999, 1,431 commercial ships used the port of Boston (NMFS, 2001b). In a 1994 survey, 4,093 commercial ships greater than 20 meters in length passed through the Cape Cod Canal, with an average of 11 commercial vessels crossing per day (Wiley et al., 1995).      In southeastern waters, shipping channels associated with Jacksonville and Fernandina, Florida, as well as Brunswick, Georgia bisect the area that contains the highest concentration of whale sightings within right whale critical habitat. These channels and their approaches serve several commercial shipping ports and military bases. The commercial  ports are  growing and the port of Jacksonville is undergoing major expansions (NMFS, 2001b).      In the Northeast Atlantic, various initiatives have been planned or undertaken to expand or establish high-speed watercraft services. In 1998, high-speed ferry service was initiated between Bar Harbor, Maine and Yarmouth, Nova Scotia. The ferry makes regular runs during Nova Scotia’s busy tourist season, which coincides with peak concentrations of right whales feeding on summering grounds. The 91-meter (300-foot) catamaran travels at speeds up to 90 kilometers per hour (48 knots).      Smaller vessels are also known to strike marine mammals, and whale strikes resulting from interaction with whale watch boats and recreational vessels have been recorded. In New England, approximately three dozen whale watch companies operate 50 to 80 boats (NMFS, 2001b). In addition, over 500 fishing vessels and over 11,000 pleasure craft frequent the waters of Massachusetts and Cape Cod Bays (NMFS, 2001b). All of these vessels pose some risk to whales. Although minor vessel collisions may not result in immediate death, the event may weaken or otherwise harm the whale, increasing its vulnerability to other effects such as entanglements, pollution, or disease.Species Most Affected      Laist's review found records of ship collisions involving 11 species of large whales. The species most commonly struck by ships was the fin whale, followed by the North Atlantic right whale and the humpback whale. However, the frequency with which these incidents occur and are reported is strongly influenced by the distribution and abundance of the whale species. Exhibit 9A-1 in Appendix 9-A provides data on ship collisions involving right, humpback, fin, and minke whales over the last two to three decades.      Laist et al. (2001) concluded that for some large whale populations, the number of ship strikes has little impact on stock status, but for the dwindling North Atlantic right whale population, ship strikes are a serious obstacle to the growth and successful recovery of the species. The behavior of right whales makes them particularly vulnerable to collisions.10 Right whales swim close to shore and in or adjacent to major shipping lanes. In addition, they spend           10 Observations of right whales indicate that responses to vessels are dependent on the whale's behavior at the time. Courtship and surface feeding are examples of behaviors during which northern right whales appear unresponsive to the approach of boats. Cows with calves and single long-diving whales appear to be more sensitive to engine noise or vessel maneuvering and have been observed avoiding boats.
much of their time at the surface, skim feeding, resting, mating, and nursing. These behaviors can occur for periods of an hour or more. Calves, which spend most of their time at the surface due to their undeveloped diving capabilities, are particularly vulnerable.      For the period 2005 through 2009, the minimum rate of annual human-caused mortality and serious injury to right whales as a result of ship strike records averaged 1.6 per year (U.S. waters, 1.2; Canadian waters, 0.4). (Exhibit 9-4).Exhibit 9-4RIGHT WHALE MORTALITIES FROM SHIP STRIKES, 2005-2009RegionMortalities from Ship StrikesTotal Mortalities1Southeast35Mid-Atlantic Coast01Great South Channel11Bay of Fundy22TOTAL69Notes:1	Total documented mortalities includes mortalities from entanglement or unknown causes.Source: Waring et al, 2012.      The actual rate of ship collisions with right whales is considered to be much higher than the data indicate. Experts generally believe that many ship strikes go unreported or undetected. In addition, minor ship collisions that may not mortally injure a whale can often weaken the whale, making it more susceptible to further injury (Kraus et al., 1993).Efforts to Track and Reduce Ship Strikes      NMFS’ ongoing program over the last decade to reduce ship strikes to right whales includes aerial surveys to notify mariners of right whale sighting locations, operation of the northeast U.S. and southeast U.S. mandatory ship reporting systems to provide information to mariners entering right whale habitat, working with the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) to issue periodic notices to mariners regarding ship strikes, support of Recovery Plan Implementation Teams that provide recommendations to NOAA Fisheries on recovery activities, support of shipping industry liaisons, and Endangered Species Act (ESA) section 7 consultations.      Recognizing the persistent threat that ship strikes pose to North Atlantic right whales, a joint effort between NMFS and the International Fund for Animal Welfare formed the Northeast Implementation Team, also known as the Ship Strike Committee, in 1994. The Committee identified a range of options for reducing the risk of ship strikes, including routing vessels around high-risk areas, restricting vessel speeds to a maximum of ten knots in high-risk areas,
and changing routes to minimize time in those areas. The Committee submitted its recommendations in a report to NMFS in 2001. NMFS used the report on recommended ship strike reduction management measures as a baseline to develop a proposed Strategy to Reduce Ship Strikes of Right Whales (Strategy), a multi-year blueprint of the specific steps to reduce or eliminate the threat of ship strikes to right whales along the U.S. eastern seaboard. The Strategy takes into account regional differences in oceanography, commercial ship traffic patterns, navigational concerns, and whale biology. Actions needed to execute the overall project include rulemaking, international measures, and various analyses (i.e., economic analyses, NEPA, Port Access Route Studies).      The proposed Strategy was approved by the agency in 2003, and interagency working group meetings were subsequently held to review and provide comments on the Strategy. NMFS published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on June 1, 2004 (69 FR 30857) to solicit comments on proposed operational measures for the shipping industry contained within the Strategy, including consideration of routing and speed restrictions. These measures, as proposed, would be implemented within each of three broad regions - the southeastern coast of the U.S.,  the Mid-Atlantic region, and the northeastern coast of the U.S. - and would contain specific areas (with boundaries) and times in which protective measures would be in effect. The operational measures proposed in the Strategy would generally apply to vessels 65 feet (19.8 meters) and greater, based on information regarding confirmed ship strikes and known vessel size. In June 2005, NMFS released a draft Environmental Assessment to analyze the potential environmental impacts of the operational measures of the Ship Strike Strategy (NMFS, 2005). NMFS released  a proposed rule in June 2006 (June 26, 2006, 71 FR 35229; August 14, 2006, 71FR 46440) and aDraft Environmental Impact Statement in July 2006 (July 7, 2006, 71 FR 38640; July 14, 2006, 71 FR 36299). In December 2008, NMFS promulgated these rules for all vessels 65 feet or greater limiting vessel speed to 10 knots or less in Seasonal Management Areas where whales  are known to occur at particular times (73 FR 60173, October 10, 2008). NMFS also expects,  but does not require, mariners to avoid or limit speed to 10 knots or less in Dynamic Management Areas.      Concurrently, as an additional component of the Strategy, NMFS submitted a proposal to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in 2006 to amend the Boston Traffic Separation Scheme to reduce the likelihood of ship strikes. The IMO has voted to adopt this proposal, shifting and narrowing Boston's shipping lanes to reduce their overlap with waters in which right whales and other large whales are frequently found.      According to Laist et al. (2001), ship operators often do not see whales that they strike, or see them too late to avoid a collision.11 To address this problem, NOAA developed and, in late 1996, implemented the Northeast Right Whale Early Warning System (EWS), now known as the Right Whale Sighting Advisory System (SAS); a complementary system, the Mandatory Ship Reporting (MSR) System, was implemented in July 1999. SAS uses air and ship surveys to provide real-time right whale sighting information to the commercial shipping industry and           11 Mariners may have difficulty seeing right whales because of their dark color and low profile in the water. In some cases, ships may hit right whales without ever knowing a collision occurred. Laist et al. (2001) found that many ship strikes involving vessels over 400 feet appear to go unrecognized by the vessel's crew; those that are recorded are often discovered when the whale becomes pinned to the vessel's bow and is noticed upon entering port.
vessel operators. It provides data to MSR, which operates year-round in a 6,700 square mile area off of Cape Cod, including all 842 square miles of the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary, and from November 15 through April 15 in a 2,500 square-mile nursery area near the Georgia/Florida border. Under the system, all commercial ships of 300 gross tons or more that enter the two areas must contact a Coast Guard-operated shore station to report course, speed, location, destination, and route. In return, a ship will receive the latest information about right whale sightings and avoidance procedures that may prevent a collision. The reporting system affects no other aspect of vessel operations and is provided as a free service to vessel operators. Officials also plan to use the ship reporting system to gather data on the number and traffic patterns of ships travelling through right whale habitat to identify other possible measures to reduce future ship strikes. The entire program is to be reviewed after three to five years to assess its effectiveness, and to introduce advances in ship communication technologies that have become available.      Canada has also taken measures to reduce collisions between ships and right whales within its waters. During the late summer to early fall, over two-thirds of the North Atlantic  right whale population can be found in the Bay of Fundy, an area traversed by shipping lanes to the Port of Saint John, New Brunswick. About 800 vessels, primarily tankers transporting crude and refined oil products, use the shipping lanes leading to this major port each year. Conservation areas for the right whale were designated by the Canadian government in 1993, encompassing the shipping lanes leading to St. John. Fundy Traffic, a Vessel Traffic System, was soon implemented in the Bay of Fundy to monitor all vessels 65 feet (20 meters) or greater in length that enter the area. The system, like NOAA's EWS, notifies vessels of right whale sightings and provides other relevant information. In April 2002, Transport Canada submitted a proposal to the IMO to amend the traffic separation scheme (TSS)12 in the Bay of Fundy.13 The Canadian proposal was adopted at the annual meeting of the IMO's Marine Safety Committee the following December (Canada News Wire, 2003). The changes took effect July 1, 2003 and shifted traffic lanes in the northern TSS area to the east, where the population density of right whales is considerably lower (Transport Canada, 2003).      Over the past decade, the threat of ship collisions to the right whale species has also prompted increased attention by the research community. Ongoing research efforts have focused on developing a better understanding of right whale behaviors around vessels, and the development of new technologies (e.g., passive acoustics monitoring, predictive modeling and sonar detection) to improve management of vessel-whale interactions.14      Recent studies indicate that the likelihood of the occurrence of a vessel strike is decreased by reduced vessel speed (Gende et al. 2011). Reduced vessel speeds also reduce the magnitude           12 The TSS provides for the separation of traffic between the southeastern entrance to the Bay of Fundy and the Port of Saint John, organizing traffic through an area used extensively for fishing. Since the establishment of the TSS in 1983, extensive research has been compiled demonstrating the need for changes to help protect the North Atlantic right whale population in this area.           13 The International Maritime Organization is the United Nations agency responsible for improving ship traffic and safety.14 For more information on ongoing research efforts, see Russell et al., 2001.
of the impact if a whale-ship collision does occur (Vanderlaan and Taggart 2007; Campbell- Malone, et al. 2008; Silber et al. 2010). Studies conducted since the implementation of the vessel speed rule indicate that lowered vessel speeds reduce the risk of fatal whale strikes (Vanderlaan et al. 2009; Vanderlaan and Taggart 2009; Gende et al. 2011; Lagueux et al. 2011; Wiley et al.2011). In particular, Lagueux et al. (2011) and Wiley et al. (2011) concluded that NMFS’s 2008 10-knot vessel speed restrictions reduced the risk of lethal strikes of right whales by 38.5% and 56.7% in waters off the southeast U.S. coast and New England, respectively. The research used to initiate vessel speed restrictions to reduce vessel collisions with right whales, and studies subsequent to implementation of the regulations support continued use of the restrictions (Silber and Bettridge 2012). Therefore, on December 9, 2013, NMFS published a final rule (78 FR 73726) eliminating the expiration date (or “sunset clause”) contained in 2008 regulations requiring vessel speed restrictions to reduce the likelihood of lethal vessel collisions with North Atlantic right whales. The 2008 speed regulations would have expired on December 9, 2013, unless the sunset clause was removed.9.4.1.4 Water Pollution Impacts      Experts believe that pollution in the marine environment adversely affects marine mammals, including cetaceans. Sub-lethal direct effects of exposure to chemical pollutants may alter cetacean physiology, including reproduction, immune defense, endocrine system functions, and possibly neural systems that control social and migratory behavior. Indirect effects include impacts on cetacean prey species and cetacean exposure to pollutants present in prey. Although little direct evidence of the link between chemical pollution and cetaceans is available, evidence of the adverse effects of pollution on terrestrial species and non-cetacean marine mammals is sufficient to warrant concern of similar impacts on cetacean species.      Types of contaminants entering the coastal environment from both point and non-point sources include suspended solids, organic debris, metals, synthetic organic compounds, nutrients, and pathogens. The coastal waters near Boston, Massachusetts have historically been among the most contaminated in North America, with elevated concentrations of trace metals, PCBs and petroleum hydrocarbons (Pearce, 1990). Additional chemical and nutrient loads flow into Massachusetts Bay from the Merrimack River in the north, and several other large rivers from the southern coast of Maine. Contaminant sources include sewage and industrial discharges, combined sewer overflows, stormwater runoff, groundwater inflows, in-place sediments, seeps, and atmospheric deposition (MBP, 1991). Dominant current patterns in the Northeast make it probable that industrial pollutants released into coastal waters will affect important feeding areas off the coast of Massachusetts and Cape Cod Bay. In addition, the proximity of large whale habitats to major shipping lanes introduces the potential of chemical exposure from aromatic hydrocarbons (oil spills, leaks, and discharges) and organotins (leaching from hulls).15      The Massachusetts Bay Disposal Site (MBDS), located 9.5 miles east of Deer Island, began discharging secondary sewage effluent into Massachusetts Bay about 16 miles from identified right whale critical habitat in 2000 (NMFS, 2001a). NMFS concluded in a 199315 For more information see Busbee et al., 1999.
biological opinion that the discharge of sewage at the MBDS may affect, but is not likely to jeopardize, the continued existence of any species listed or proposed to be listed under the ESA. Uncertainties remain, however, concerning potential impacts on the marine ecosystem, the food chain, and endangered species. In light of these uncertainties, the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority is conducting post-discharge monitoring.      Exhibit 9-5 lists chemical contaminants of possible concern to North Atlantic right whales. The list was compiled at a workshop held in Falmouth, Massachusetts in April 2000, convened to identify and set research priorities for potential factors affecting right whale reproduction. The list includes contaminants to which right whales may be exposed, based on(1) trophic level and prey selection, (2) known patterns of chemical use, and (3) the existence of a regional source. Given the overlapping ranges of all four key Atlantic large whale species and their mutual classification as baleen whales, the list can be used as a preliminary guide to those contaminants that might also affect humpback, fin, and minke whales.Exhibit 9-5        CLASSES AND EXAMPLES OF CONTAMINANTS POTENTIALLY AFFECTING NORTH ATLANTIC RIGHT WHALESChemical ClassMore Specific Compounds or ExamplesPersistent organic pollutantsPCBs, PCDDs, PCDFs, PAHs16, DDT, chlordanes, HCH, other pesticidesFlame retardantsPBDEs (polybrominated diphenyl ethers) and other brominated flameretardantsPlasticizersPhthalate estersSurfactantsAlkylphenol ethoxylatesNew-era pesticides and herbicidesNot availableMunicipal and industrial effluentsEndocrine disrupting compounds (e.g., synthetic estrogens, naturalhormones, pulp byproducts)Anti-fouling agentsOrganotins and replacement compoundsDielectric fluidsPCB replacements (e.g., PCNs – polychlorinated naphthalenes; PBBs –polybrominated biphenyls)Aquaculture-related chemicalsAntibiotics, pesticidesMetalsMethyl mercury (MeHg) via atmospheric depositionRadionuclidesNot availableSource: Reeves et al., 2001. For more detailed lists and further discussion, also see O'Shea et al., 1999 andReijnders et al., 1999.      Whales are particularly vulnerable to chemical pollutants because they are long-lived, have extensive fat stores (where chemical pollutants are known to accumulate), and are often top predators in the food chain. Chemical pollutant levels in baleen whales, however, have consistently been found to be one to two orders of magnitude lower than levels found in seals and odontocetes, or toothed cetaceans. This is largely attributed to the fact that baleen whales feed primarily on plankton, krill, and small fish that are at the top of a much shorter food chain and therefore have lower accumulated levels of chemical pollutants.17  Right whales may even be further protected from this type of risk because of their preference for copepods, a low trophic16 Roper and Cherry, 1994.17 For more information see Aguilar et al., 1999.
level organism, making them less susceptible to the bioaccumulation of organochlorines and metals than humpback, fin, or minke whales, all of which feed more regularly on small fish.18      Concentrations of organochlorines, including dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), hexachlorohexanes (HCHs), aldrin, and dieldrin, have been observed in many species of marine mammals, including right, humpback, and fin whales in the North Atlantic (Kraus et al. 2007, Montie et al. 2010). PCBs were found in samples of North Atlantic right whale blubber (Weisbrod et al., 2000a) and at low levels in zooplankton sampled from Cape Cod Bay (Reeves and Clapham, 2001).  Woodley et al. (1991) found PCBs, DDT,  and other organochlorines in northern right whale biopsy samples from the Bay of Fundy, Browns, and Baccarro Banks (Woodly et al., 1991). Organochlorines have also been reported in humpback, fin, and minke whales (Gauthier et al., 1997; Hobbs et al., 2003), fin and sei whales (Borrell, 1993; Borrell and Aguilar, 1987), and pilot whales (Muir et al., 1988).      Heavy metal concentrations have also been observed in many species of marine mammals.19 Sanpera et al. (1993) analyzed tissue samples from 36 fin whales from the  Northeast Atlantic for their total and organic mercury concentrations. A positive correlation between age and the concentration of mercury in the liver was found, suggesting a slow and steady rate of accumulation over time and a low rate of excretion (Sanpera et al., 1993).      A final source of potential pollution stress is biotoxins. Biotoxins are highly toxic compounds produced by harmful algal blooms (HABs).20 There is strong evidence that higher trophic level marine organisms, such as cetaceans and marine turtles, can acquire lethal or sub- lethal doses of these phytoplankton-derived toxins through consumption of zooplankton and planktivorous finfish. Five major classes of biotoxins are associated with HABs: saxitoxins (responsible for paralytic shellfish poisoning); brevetoxins (responsible for neurotoxic shellfish poisoning in the southeastern U.S.); domoic acid (amnesic shellfish poisoning); okasdaic acid and dinophysistoxins (diarrhetic shellfish poisoning); and ciguatoxins. The first three of these classes have been implicated in marine mammal mortality events (Reeves et al., 2001).      Saxitoxins, brevetoxins and domoic acids are the three HAB groups that occur most often in the distribution range of the four ALWTRP species. Saxitoxins cause loss of equilibrium and respiratory distress, with possible implications for feeding efficiency (Reeves et al., 2001; NEFSC, 2003a). An acute exposure to saxitoxin-contaminated mackerel was found to have caused the death of at least 14 humpbacks, two fin whales, and a minke whale off the coast of Massachusetts between November 1986 and January 1988 (Geraci, 1989). In August 2003, another multiple whale mortality occurred on Georges Bank and is suspected to be the result of exposure to domoic acid, a neurotoxin that once prompted the closing of a scallop fishery in the18 For more information see O'Shea et al., 1994 and Montie et al., 201019 For more information see Bowles, 1999.           20 Algae are photosynthetic plant-like organisms that live where there is water. Most species of algae or phytoplankton are not harmful and serve as the energy producers at the base of the food web, without which higher life on this planet would not exist. Occasionally, the algae grow very fast or "bloom" and accumulate into dense, visible patches near the surface of the water. "Red Tide" is a common name for such a phenomenon where certain phytoplankton species contain reddish pigments and "bloom" such that the water appears to be colored red.
mid-1990s (CCEHBR, 2003). In this case, 17 dead whales were found floating over a 125-mile stretch of ocean between Canada and the U.S. At least six of the dead whales were humpbacks; another was a fin whale (NEFSC, 2003b). The event initially raised fears that the North Atlantic right whale might also be at risk, but none appear affected to date. These events, however, indicate that the impact of harmful algal blooms and biotoxins may be greater than previously thought.Efforts to Control Water Pollution      A number of Federal statutes and international agreements are designed to control water pollution at the national or international level. Past and present actions examined include:• the Clean Water Act;• the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972;• the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972;• the Oil Pollution Act of 1990; and• international laws regarding marine pollution.Clean Water Act      The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, or the Clean Water Act (CWA), is the principal Federal law controlling polluting activities in the nation's streams, lakes, and estuaries. Originally enacted in 1948, a series of amendments in 1972 and 1977 gave the Act its current shape and structure. The Act consists of two major parts: regulatory provisions to control industrial and municipal dischargers, and financial assistance provisions to help fund the construction of municipal wastewater treatment facilities.      Prior to 1987, provisions under the CWA were primarily directed at controlling point source discharges of pollution; i.e., pollution originating from discrete and identifiable sources, such as municipal and industrial facilities or bypasses and overflows from municipal sewage systems. In 1987, Congress passed the most extensive changes yet to the CWA, directing new attention to non-point source water pollution, which accounted for an increasing proportion of the nation’s remaining water quality problems. The 1987 amendments added Section 319 to the Act, requiring states to develop and implement programs to control non-point sources of pollution, including runoff from farm and urban areas, construction, and forestry and mining sites.      A number of the provisions included in the CWA contribute indirectly and directly to maintaining the water quality of the marine environment. Specifically, one of the goals of the  Act is to provide for the protection and propagation of fish, shellfish, and wildlife (33 U.S.C. 1251(a)(2)). In addition, the Act contains provisions to address bottom sediment removed by dredging, which now constitutes the majority of material dumped into the nation’s coastal and
marine waters (Boesch et al., 2001). Under the CWA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issues permits for the disposal of dredged material, subject to guidelines established by EPA. Protocols have been developed to determine whether dredged sediments are suitable for placement in the ocean or coastal environment.Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972      The Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) encourages environmentally sound management of coastal areas and provides grants to be used in maintaining coastal areas. It requires that Federal agencies be consistent with the enforceable policies of state coastal zone management programs when conducting or supporting activities that affect a coastal zone. As defined in the Act, the coastal zone includes coastal waters extending to the outer limit of state submerged land title and ownership, adjacent shorelines, and land extending inward to the extent necessary to control shorelines. The coastal zone includes islands, beaches, transitional and intertidal areas, and salt marshes.Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972      The Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 (MPRSA, P.L. 92-532) has two basic aims: (1) to regulate intentional ocean disposal of materials, and (2) to authorize related research. Title I of the Act, often referred to as the Ocean Dumping Act, prohibits dumping of all municipal sewage, sewage sludge, and industrial waste, and regulates the disposal of dredged material under a Department of the Army permit. The EPA also designates sites and imposes strict tests for dredged material disposal. Research provisions concerning general and ocean disposal research are contained in Title II; Title III authorizes the establishment of marine sanctuaries; Title IV established a regional marine research program; and Title V addresses coastal water quality monitoring.Oil Pollution Act of 1990      After the Exxon Valdez oil spill devastated the Alaskan coastline in 1989, Congress passed the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. The Act established an extensive liability scheme designed to ensure that, in the event of a spill or release of oil or other hazardous substances, the responsible parties are liable for the removal costs and damages that result from the incident. A “responsible party” includes the owner, operator, or demise charterer of a vessel. Additionally, a responsible party may be liable for removal costs and damages to natural resources; real or personal property; subsistence use; revenues, profits and earning capacity; and public services.International Laws Regarding Marine Pollutants      The International Maritime Organization (IMO) is the United Nations specialized agency responsible for improving maritime safety and preventing pollution from ships. Pollution of the marine environment by ships of all types, including commercial fishing vessels, is strictly
controlled by the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (known as MARPOL 73/78). The MARPOL 73/78 Convention is a combination of two treaties adopted in 1973 and 1978, respectively, and has been updated by amendments over the years.  Any violation of the MARPOL 73/78 Convention within the jurisdiction of any Party to the Convention is punishable either under the law of that Party or under the law of the flag state.9.4.1.5 Noise Pollution Impacts      Whales, dolphins, and other marine mammals primarily rely on their hearing to locate food, detect predators, find mates, and keep herds together. Large whales communicate  primarily using low-frequency sounds (typically below 1000 Hertz) that travel long distances through water (NRDC, 1999). The growing amount of noise within this range from ships, supertankers, underwater explosions, and other sources represents an additional potential threat to large whales. Noise pollution may disrupt and inhibit feeding and reproduction; displace whales from traditional calving grounds, feeding grounds, or migratory routes; or, in the worst case, cause direct auditory damage and death. Noise pollution sources include ship and boat propeller noise; drilling, blasting, and dredging; acoustic deterrent devices used by fish farms  and fishing vessels; sonar and airguns used in seismic exploration; and the use of low- and mid- frequency sonar in military operations. In recent years, this new source of stress has garnered increased attention from both the scientific community and the general public. The impact of acoustic pollution, however, has been difficult to ascertain, and its effect on marine mammals is one of the least understood subjects within marine mammal science.      Right whales use vocal calls for social communication, including mate attraction (Parks and Tyack 2005). A recent study showed that right whales increase their call amplitude linearly with the rise of background noise, indicating that the whales are able to modify their vocalizations to compensate for the increased noise of their environment (Parks et al. 2011). The cost of this behavior modification may include increased energy expenditure or modification of the original information of the signal, but more data are needed to fully understand the effects of anthropogenic sound on right whale communication (Parks et al. 2011). Noise pollution has been correlated to an increase in stress-related fecal hormone metabolites in North Atlantic right whales (Rolland et al. 2012). Chronic elevations of these fecal hormone metabolites have been shown to negatively affect growth, immune system response, and reproduction in a variety of vertebrate species (Rolland et al. 2012 citing Sapolsky et al. 2000; Romero and Butler 2007).Rolland et al. (2012) suggested that anthropogenic noise pollution may have negative consequences for the North Atlantic right whale’s continued viability.      The best-known noise pollution incident occurred in March 2000 with the stranding of 17 cetaceans of at least four different species (three species of beaked whale and one species of baleen whale) in the Bahamas. Seven of the stranded animals are known to have died, while ten other animals were returned to the water alive. An investigation jointly undertaken by the Navy and NOAA concluded that mid-range frequency sonar aboard U.S. Navy ships transiting the area represented the most plausible source of the event (NMFS, 2001c). Other recent incidents associated with underwater sonar use at mid-range frequencies include a 1996 stranding of a dozen Cuvier's beaked whales off the coast of Greece, and most recently, in 2002, a stranding of
18 whales (11 died) in the Canary Islands. Both of these incidents coincided with North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) units carrying out naval acoustic exercises in the area (Government of the Canary Islands, 2002). A recent study following up on the 2002 stranding event, released in the journal Nature, provides the “most direct evidence to date that sonars can kill marine mammals” (Dalton, 2003). The study concluded the deaths were a result of decompression sickness after the whales shot to the surface to escape sonar activity during Spanish-led international naval exercises (Jepson et al., 2003).      Although acute mortality from noise pollution is established, much less is known about the impact of chronic noise pollution on cetacean health. Potential impacts from long-distance undersea noise vary from no effect to temporary hearing loss or long-term behavioral changes that may reduce whale survival and reproduction. One response of particular concern is the potential for the displacement of cetacean populations as a result of high levels of anthropogenic noise.      In the Atlantic, the three primary sources of anthropogenic ocean noise include shipping, offshore oil activities, and military exercises. Anthropogenic ocean noise is principally the result of the relatively recent increase in shipping traffic. A modern-day supertanker cruising at 17 knots fills the frequency band below 500 Hz and produces sounds of 190 decibels or more. Mid- sized ships such as tugboats and ferries produce sounds of 160 to 170 decibels in the same frequency range (NRDC, 1999). Whale-watching vessels also have the potential to disrupt cetacean behavior. A survey of the response of baleen whale species to whale-watching vessels was done in 1986, and found that minke whales, humpback whales, and fin whales appeared to habituate to boats, while right whales exhibited no change in behavior.21 Another study of fin whales in the Gulf of Maine found significantly reduced dive times and a reduced number of blows per surfacing sequence when whale-watching vessels were present (Stone, 1986). Other studies have found similar results, but whether this change in behavior represents an adverse impact to cetaceans is largely unknown.      The most serious consequence of vessel disturbances is the potential for the cumulative effects of vessel traffic to cause an abandonment or decrease in the use of an important habitat (Tyack, 1990). There have been documented cases of this phenomenon with bottlenose dolphins (Evans et al., 1993), harbor porpoises (Evans et al., 1994), beluga whales (Finley et al., 1990), and sperm whales (Mate et al., 1994) in association with seismic exploration and vessel traffic. There also has been suspected habitat abandonment in response to boating activity, aircraft, and industrial activity (e.g., dredging) by humpback whales (Green, 1991), blue whales (Macfarlane, 1981 in Gordon and Moscrop, 1996), grey whales (Reeves, 1977 in Richardson et al., 1995) and bowhead whales (Richardson et al., 1987).      A second source of significant ocean noise is offshore oil and petroleum exploration activity. Offshore oil exploration requires the use of drilling rigs and airgun arrays, both of  which produce high-energy, low-frequency undersea noise. To detect oil deposits beneath the ocean floor, most companies rely on the explosive power of airguns, arranged in rows behind a           21 It has been suggested that the type of activity in which right whales are engaged influences their sensitivity to, and tendency to avoid, noise disturbance and vessel activity, but more studies are needed (Watkins, 1986).
small ship. The guns fire at short intervals and can produce sounds over 250 decibels.  To  extract the oil, platforms and pipes are constructed, drills positioned, and holes bored into the bedrock. In the Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) area, the potential for noise pollution associated with offshore oil and petroleum exploration exists.22 According to the Minerals Management Service (MMS), a total of 433 blocks in the Atlantic OCS area have been leased for exploration, and a total of 49 exploratory wells have been drilled (MMS, 2003).      A recent study showed that right whales increase their call amplitude linearly with the rise of background noise, indicating that the whales are able to modify their vocalizations to compensate for the increased noise of their environment (Parks et al., 2011). The cost of this behavior modification may include increased energy expenditure or modification of the original information of the signal, but more data are needed to fully understand the effects of anthropogenic sound on right whale communication (Parks et al., 2011). Noise pollution has been correlated to an increase in stress-related fecal hormone metabolites in North Atlantic right whales (Rolland et al. 2012). Chronic elevations of these fecal hormone metabolites have been shown to negatively affect growth, immune system response, and reproduction in a variety of vertebrate species (Rolland et al., 2012 citing Sapolsky et al., 2000; Romero and Butler 2007). Rolland et al. (2012) suggested that anthropogenic noise pollution may have negative consequences for the North Atlantic right whale’s continued viability. Because North Atlantic right whales are experiencing the cumulative impacts of multiple stressors, the effect of noise pollution on the population’s recovery is not yet clear.      Although the evidence is limited, military activities have the potential to disturb, injure, or kill Atlantic large whales. In early 1996, six right whale deaths were documented. Five of these (one attributed to a ship strike) occurred in waters adjacent to the Southeast U.S. (SEUS) critical habitat area. Navy facilities adjacent to the critical habitat use offshore areas for gunnery exercises. Because several of the carcasses were found near a Navy gunnery range, it was suspected that some deaths were related to underwater explosions; however, no conclusive link was established.23      Additional controversy has surrounded the potential use of Surveillance Towed Array Sensor System Low Frequency Active (SURTASS LFA) Sonar. SURTASS LFA is a long- range, low frequency (between 100 and 500 Hertz) sonar system that has both active and passive components. The sonar's detection capability does not rely on noise generated by the target, but rather on the use of active sounds or pulses originating from the system. The purpose of SURTASS LFA sonar is to provide the Navy with a reliable and dependable system for long- range  detection  of  quieter,  harder-to-find  submarines.     Its  low  frequency  sound  travels  in22  The continental shelf is the gently sloping undersea plain between a continent and the deep ocean. UnderU.S. law, the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) consists of the submerged lands, subsoil, and seabed lying between the seaward extent of the states' jurisdiction and the seaward extent of Federal jurisdiction. In 1953, Congress designated the Secretary of the Interior to administer mineral exploration and development of the entire OCS through the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA). Under the Act, the OCS has been divided into four  leasing regions: the Gulf of Mexico OCS Region; the Atlantic OCS Region; the Pacific OCS Region; and the  Alaska OCS Region.           23 The Navy is in ongoing and open consultations with NMFS on the potential effect of some of its operations on protected species, and has made a number of significant modifications to its operations to facilitate protection of right whales in the SEUS critical habitat (Silber and Clapham, 2001).
seawater more effectively and for greater distances than the higher frequency sound used by most other active sonar systems (U.S. Dept. of Navy, 2001).      To evaluate the impact of the system on endangered species, the Navy funded an independent study on the effect of LF sonar on four baleen species of whales (blue, fin, gray, and humpback whales).24 The research determined that these LF-sensitive marine mammals, when exposed to sound pressure levels (SPLs) ranging from 120 to 150 decibels, exhibited only minor, short-term behavioral responses. Given the uncertainty of the science in this area, however, a number of measures were included in the final NMFS rule on the military use of SURTASS LFA, including use restrictions in coastal zones and a monitoring and detection plan.      Environmental and animal welfare groups have opposed deployment of SURTASS LFA Sonar because of concern that increased noise levels in the marine environment would adversely affect marine mammals and other sea life. Opponents argue that the use of SURTASS LFA represents a global activity that does not qualify for a small take authorization; that it will have more than a negligible impact on marine mammals; that insufficient research has been conducted on short-term and long-term impacts on marine mammals; that marine mammal takings during wartime have not been analyzed; that the monitoring of potential impacts is insufficient; and that the modeling used for impact assessment is faulty. These concerns led the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and other organizations to file suit against NOAA for failure to enforce the MMPA, ESA, and NEPA. In October 2002, a preliminary injunction was granted against broad deployment of the LFA system. On August 26, 2003, a Federal judge ruled that  the Navy's plan to deploy LFA violated numerous Federal environmental laws and could endanger whales, porpoises, and fish. The final decision ordered the Navy to reduce the system's potential harm to marine mammals and fish by negotiating limits on its use with the conservation groups who had sued over its deployment.25 Currently, the Navy can only test and  train personnel in the use of the SURTASS LFA system in a two million square kilometer area near Guam, in the western Pacific Ocean (Dalton, 2003).      Individually, each of the sources of undersea noise pollution may not be significant, but the cumulative impact of long-term exposure combined with other whale threats has become the primary concern in this area. Exhibit 9-6 provides NRDC's preliminary list of marine mammal acoustic "hot spots" along the Atlantic coast.           24 The study was limited to these four species of baleen whales because (1) baleen whales are considered to have the best hearing in the low frequency band of all marine mammals, (2) these species have protected status under the law, and (3) there is prior evidence that these species react to low frequency sounds.           25 For more information, see NRDC v.

Soon thereafter, the NMFS Office of Protected Resources began receiving increasing numbers of requests for authorizations to take marine mammals from activities that produced noise. Two of the projects, the John Paul Jones ship shock trial and the ATOC (Acoustic Thermometry of Ocean Climate) project, were highly contentious. By the mid-1990s, NMFS saw a clear need for a coordinated program on this growing issue. Accordingly, in 1995, the agency formed the NMFS Acoustics Program.      Initially, the primary function of the acoustics program was the review and processing of MMPA small take authorizations for permit requests involving acoustic issues. These efforts, however, quickly became insufficient to manage this growing area of concern, and in 1998, the NMFS Office of Protected Resources convened a workshop of experts to review NMFS’  acoustic policy. This workshop produced a number of recommendations, including:• draft acoustic criteria to clearly define acoustic "takes" under the MMPA;• construct a network for monitoring ocean noise on a global basis;• provide contact with other agencies, industry, professional societies, environmental NGOs, and news media on acoustic matters;• outline research that is needed to improve guidelines or regulations on acoustics; and• obtain additional funding for all programmatic aspects of the acoustics program, including research.           26 For more information, see the NMFS Acoustics Program at http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/prot_res/ PR2/Acoustics_Program/acoustics.html.
      Elements of the NMFS Acoustics Program are being integrated into the small take program, scientific research permits, and other NMFS protected species programmatic responsibilities and functions. Additionally:• The NMFS Acoustics Program, in cooperation with the Marine Mammal Commission and a number of partners from the scientific research, conservation, and aquarium communities, launched a nationwide public lecture tour to increase public knowledge about human-generated noise and marine animals. This educational lecture series, entitled “Marine Animals and Human Noise,” ran from March through November of 2004.• In 2004, the NMFS Acoustics Program, with the cooperation of a number of governmental and industry co-partners, hosted the 1st International Symposium on “Shipping Noise and Marine Mammals.”• The NMFS Acoustics Program is actively participating in an international effort to standardize acoustic practices in offshore petroleum exploration activities.9.4.1.6 Climate Change Impacts      Human induced climate change, caused by increasing greenhouse gas concentrations, has the potential to introduce additional pressures on Atlantic large whales. Key changes that may accompany global warming include increased precipitation, increased ocean temperature, decreased sea ice coverage, and increases and decreases in salinity. Climate change effects of this nature have the potential to influence many aspects of an ecosystem, including habitats, food webs, and species interactions.      A number of studies review and discuss the likely impacts of global climate change on cetaceans, marine mammals, and marine environments in general. Evaluations of the direct effects of climate change on whales are generally confined to cetaceans in the Arctic and Antarctic regions, where the impacts of climate change are expected to be the strongest.27 It is possible, however, that the indirect effects of climate change on prey availability and cetacean habitat will be more widespread, and could affect large whales in the ALWTRP action area. For example, climate change could exacerbate existing stresses on fish stocks that are already overfished and indirectly affect prey availability for large whale species. Increasing temperature could alter ocean upwelling patterns, fostering increased blooms of dinoflagellates that produce biotoxins. Also associated with higher temperatures is increased precipitation, which could  result in more pollutant runoff to coastal waters, elevating cetacean exposure to chemical contaminants.           27 For example, a doubling of greenhouse gases from pre-industrial times could reduce sea ice in the Southern Hemisphere by more than 40 percent. This could produce adverse effects on the abundance of krill, the primary source of food for whales in this area.
      Habitat shifts are another possible implication of climate change. Walther et al. (2002) examined recent shifts of marine communities in response to rising water temperatures, concluding that most cetaceans will experience roughly poleward shifts in prey distributions (Walther et al., 2002). Distributional habitat shifts may also occur at the local level, but these are highly dependent on complex local attributes, as well as ocean current and weather patterns.Baleen whales are highly mobile species, migrating annually from food-rich areas at high latitudes to breeding areas at low latitudes. It is postulated that baleen whales use currents, salinity, and temperature cues to locate regions of high prey abundance and thus may be less affected by climatic habitat shifts than by a general reduction in prey availability.28 Nevertheless, any general depression of high latitude prey production and/or poleward shift of feeding grounds could place additional stress on migrating whales. For some whale species, these small changes may have little material effect, but for species already vulnerable because of severe existing problems, like the North Atlantic right whale, these changes could be significant obstacles to species survival. A recent review of the period in the 1990s when the calving interval increased at the same time that survival rate of adult female right whales decreased showed a correspondence with reduced abundance of the copepod Calanus finmarchicus (Kenney 2007). While more research needs to be done on the effects of the ongoing atmospheric and oceanographic variations on right whales, it should be noted that this species has adapted to substantial environmental changes over the course of time (Kenney 2007).Efforts to Address Climate Change      Governments and the scientific community are pursuing research to better understand and mitigate the risks associated with climate change. Many cities and states across the U.S. have prepared greenhouse gas inventories and many are actively pursuing programs and policies that will result in greenhouse gas emission reductions.      At the national level, the U.S. Global Change Research Program coordinates the world's most extensive research effort on climate change. In addition, EPA and other Federal agencies are actively engaging the private sector, states, and localities in partnerships aimed at addressing the challenge of global warming while, at the same time, strengthening the economy.29      At the global level, countries have expressed a commitment to strengthening international responses to the risks of climate change, resulting in emission reduction agreements such as the Kyoto Protocol. The U.S. is working to strengthen international action and broaden participation under the auspices of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.           28 Evidence suggests a strong relationship between right whale distribution and threshold densities of calanoid copepods (Finzi et al., 1999). For example, right whales do not appear to use Cape Cod Bay as a foraging grounds unless the densities of copepods are above a certain minima (Kenney et al., 2001).29 For more information, see the US Climate Action Report (U.S. Department of State, 2002).
9.4.1.7 Prey Availability Impacts      Since the distribution of Atlantic large whales overlaps with many fishing areas, it is possible that whales may be affected by prey availability or competition for prey with fishing activities. For humpback whales, “competition for resources with humans” was identified as a potential impact to this species in the Humpback Whale Recovery Plan (1991). Humpback whales are known to feed on fish species that are directly harvested by humans. In addition,  these whales feed on species that are prey for harvested fish. However, information on the magnitude and extent of these potential interactions is not available.      The Biological Opinion addressing the potential effects of the Federal Atlantic herring fishery management plan on threatened and endangered species (1999) outlined potential effects of competition with the herring fishery on Atlantic large whales, in particular humpback and fin whales. Right whales, by feeding primarily on copepods, may be affected by the abundance of small schooling fishes, such as herring, mackerel, and sand lance, which feed on some of the same prey items as right whales. Experts at the 1999 IWC workshop pointed out that since Calanus sp. is the most common zooplankton in the North Atlantic and current right whale abundance is greatly below historical levels, food limitations do not seem to be a significant factor (Best et al., 2001). However, the abundance of small schooling fishes may directly affect and be affected by humpback and fin whales. Observations have been made of humpback  whales in the vicinity of herring purse seine vessels on Jeffreys Ledge during the summer from 1992 through 1994 (Weinrich et al., 1997). Also, observers deployed in a study conducted in 1997 and 1998 by the Maine Department of Marine Resources reported sightings of fin, humpback, and minke whales in the vicinity of herring operations.      Humpback whale distribution in New England waters is largely correlated with prey species and abundance, along with other factors such as behavior and bottom topography (Waring et al., 2006). These whales usually feed on herring, sand lance, and other small fishes, but in the northern Gulf of Maine, euphausiids are taken as well. In the mid-1970’s, commercial depletion of herring and mackerel in the southwestern Gulf of Maine led to an increase in sand lance with a concurrent decrease in humpback whale abundance in the northern Gulf of Maine (Waring et al., 2006). Humpback distribution during the 1970s and 1980s seemed to  have shifted away from the northern Gulf of Maine toward the sandy shoals in the southwestern Gulf of Maine. A reversal began in the mid-1980s, when the herring and mackerel populations increased, with a subsequent decrease in sand lance. During 1992 and 1993, humpback abundance rose dramatically in the northern offshore Gulf of Maine (Cultivator Shoal, Northeast Peak of Georges Bank, and Jeffreys Ledge), accompanied by a major influx of herring. These areas are traditional locations of herring occurrence. In 1996 and 1997, both sand lance and humpback whales were abundant again in the Stellwagen Bank area. However, herring populations remained relatively abundant, rather than decreasing as they had in the past. Therefore, humpback whales continued to occupy that area (Waring et al 2006). These data suggest that the distribution of humpback whales is affected by prey availability; they also show that the whales are able to shift prey species when abundance of a particular prey item decreases.
Efforts to Address Prey Availability      Currently, the effect of prey availability and competition for resources between Atlantic large whales and fishing operations is not known to be affecting the status of these whales. In  the case of humpback whales, local stocks are known to utilize alternative prey sources. The current and future regulations to control fishing through the Atlantic herring fishery management plan (FMP) may alleviate potential problems associated with limitations on prey availability. Currently, herring are not overfished and overfishing is not occurring. Amendment 1 to the Atlantic herring FMP seeks to develop alternatives to implement a management program that improves resource conservation and management, eliminate the potential for harvesting capacity to increase above the resource capacity, and provide a platform for economic stability for harvesters, processors, and fishing communities (NEFMC, 2004a).9.4.1.8 Summary of Factors Affecting Atlantic Large Whale Survival      As described above, the status of large whales in the North Atlantic has been and continues to be affected by a number of anthropogenic risk factors. Exhibit 9-7 summarizes the factors that may adversely affect Atlantic large whale stocks, the past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions taken to address each risk factor, and the overall effect of these actions.

Additional non-regulatory initiatives include gear research and development; thedisentanglement network; and the right whale sighting advisory system.Reduced entanglement riskShip StrikesKnownHighThe Mandatory Ship Reporting System was implemented in July 1999 to provide real-time right whale sighting information to vessel operators. In 1994, NMFS convened a Ship Strike Committee which submitted its recommendations to NMFS in 2001.NMFS published a proposed Strategy to Reduce Ship Strikes of Right Whales (71 FR 36299; 71 FR 46440) to solicit comments on proposed operational measures for the shipping industry contained within the Strategy.

The IWC has expressed concern that safe catch limits for these populations are not currently available.
      Exhibit 9-8 draws on the information presented in this section, and on the entanglement data presented in Chapter 2, to compare the recent impact of different risk factors on fatalities of right, humpback, fin, and minke whales. The exhibit focuses on known fatalities from 2005 through 2009. As the exhibit indicates, the impact of water pollution, noise pollution, climate change, or prey availability on whale mortality is unknown.30      With respect to known causes of whale mortality, the relative importance of ship strikes and entanglements may vary by species. In general, inadequacies in the available data (e.g.,  small sample size, lack of information on the ultimate fate of entangled animals, unequal probabilities of sighting entangled versus ship struck animals, etc.) prevent determining which of these factors is more important. In the case of right whales, entanglements and ship strikes remain of equal concern. In the case of humpback whales, however, the available data for the period 2006 through 2010 suggest a higher number of fishing gear interactions than ship strikes. Waring et al. (2013) reported that during this period, the total estimated human-caused mortality and serious injury to the Gulf of Maine humpback whale stock was 7.8 per year (U.S. waters, 7.2; Canadian waters, 0.6). This average was derived from two components: incidental fishery interaction records at 5.8 per year (U.S. waters, 5.2; Canadian waters, 0.6), and records of vessel collisions at 2.0 per year (U.S. waters, 2.0; Canadian waters, 0).       Fin whales, on the other hand, had a greater incidence of ship strike mortalities than fishery interactions. A review of NMFS records from 2005 through 2009 yielded an estimated average of 2.6 human-caused mortalities per year (U.S. waters, 2.0; Canadian waters, 0.6). This value includes 0.8 per year resulting from fishery interactions (U.S. waters, 0.6;  Canadian waters, 0.2) and 1.8 per year resulting from vessel collisions (U.S. waters, 1.4; Canadian waters, 0.4) (Waring et al., 2012).      Minke whales, like humpback whales, exhibited a higher incidence of fishery interactions than ship strikes for the period 2005 through 2009; during this period, the total average annual human-caused mortality in U.S. waters was estimated as 5.9 minke whales per year. This value includes 3.5 (CV=0.34) minke whales per year from observed US fisheries, 0.8 minke whales per year (unknown CV) from U.S. fisheries using strandings and entanglement data, 1.2 (unknown CV) from Canadian fisheries using strandings and entanglement data, and 0.4 per year from U.S. ship strikes (Waring et al. 2012). These data suggest that the anthropogenic risk factors that are known to cause serious injury or mortality to large whales may vary by species. All interpretations of the data, however, should consider the uncertainties noted above.30 There are no known deaths of large whales in North Atlantic waters associated with noise pollution.

It does not, however, suggest that efforts to reduce the risks associated with gear entanglements are unwarranted or unnecessary. As described in Chapter 2, the depleted status of right, humpback, and fin whale stocks means that the premature death or serious injury of even a few individuals each year can threaten a species' survival. In light of these circumstances, efforts to preserve Atlantic large whale species must take all risk factors into account, including those associated with commercial fishing activity. While the requirements of the ALWTRP and the regulatory alternatives under consideration focus solely on entanglement risks, the commercial fishing regulations developed under the plan are but one dimension of a multi-faceted effort to address the full range of threats to endangered whale species.9.4.2 Other Protected Species      Chapter 4 identifies several other species, protected either by the ESA of 1973 or the MMPA of 1972, whose range may overlap with ALWTRP regulated fisheries. Chapter 5 assesses the impacts on these species that could result from adoption of the ALWTRP management alternatives. Some of the other protected species, such as the shortnose sturgeon, the Gulf of Maine distinct population segment of Atlantic salmon, roseate terns, and piping plovers, are minimally affected by the commercial fishing operations that are regulated under the ALWTRP and therefore are not addressed by the cumulative effects analysis.      The following section provides a broad discussion of the major threats faced by each of the protected species potentially affected by the ALWTRP, followed by a summary of the significant actions (past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future) taken to mitigate these risks.

In the North Atlantic, blue whales range from the subtropics to Baffin Bay and the Greenland Sea, but they are only occasional visitors to east coast U.S. waters. They are more commonly found  in Canadian waters, particularly the Gulf of St. Lawrence, where they are present for most of the year, and in other areas of the North Atlantic.      Though once hunted intensively, blue whales were given complete protection in the North Atlantic in 1955 under the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling. Photo-identification studies of blue whales in the Gulf of St. Lawrence from 1979 to 1995 identified 320 individual whales. NMFS recognizes a minimum population estimate of 440 blue whales within the Northeast Region (Waring et al., 2010).
       There is limited information on the factors affecting natural mortality of blue whales in the North Atlantic. Ice entrapment is known to kill and seriously injure some blue whales during late winter and early spring, particularly along the southwest coast of Newfoundland. Habitat degradation has been suggested as possibly affecting blue whales in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, where habitat has been degraded by acoustic and chemical pollution. However, there are no data to confirm that blue whales have been affected by such habitat changes (Perry et al., 1999).      Ship strikes and entanglements in commercial fishing gear are believed to be the major sources of anthropogenic mortality and injury of blue whales; however, confirmed deaths or serious injuries are few. Thus, human-related interactions are not deemed to be a major source  of mortality for this species at this time. To the extent that blue whales are present in waters affected by ALWTRP-regulated gear, they are expected to experience the same benefits from gear modifications required by the ALWTRP as the large whale species these modifications were designed to protect.Sei Whale      The Nova Scotian Shelf stock of sei whales, which includes the continental shelf waters of the Northeast Region and extends northeastward to south of Newfoundland, is the only sei whale stock within ALWTRP boundaries. Sei whales typically occur in deep water. In the northwest Atlantic, the whales travel along the eastern Canadian coast in autumn on their way to the Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank, where they occur in winter and spring. Within the Northeast Region, the sei whale is most common on Georges Bank, including the Great South Channel, and into the Gulf of Maine/Bay of Fundy region during spring and summer. There are insufficient data to determine trends in the sei whale population. A minimum  population estimate for this stock is 208 animals (Waring et al., 2010).      Possible causes of natural mortality for sei whales, particularly for young, old, or otherwise compromised individuals, are shark attacks, killer whale attacks, and endoparasitic helminthes (Perry et al., 1999). Few instances of injury or mortality of sei whales due to entanglement or vessel strikes have been recorded in U.S. waters. Thus, human-related interactions are not deemed to be a major source of mortality for this species at this time. To the extent that sei whales are present in waters affected by ALWTRP-regulated gear, they are expected to experience the same benefits from gear modifications required by the ALWTRP as the large whale species these gear modifications were designed to protect.Sperm Whale      In the western North Atlantic, sperm whales range from Greenland to the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean and generally occur in waters greater than 180 meters in depth (Leatherwood and Reeves, 1983). Though hunted extensively world-wide until the late 1900s, all killing of sperm whales was banned by the IWC in 1988. The IWC recognizes one stock for the entire North Atlantic. The best estimate of abundance for this stock of sperm whales is 4,804 (CV=0.38) (Waring et al., 2007).
      Little information is available about the natural mortality of sperm whales, and though entanglements and ship strikes of this species have been known to occur occasionally, few instances of injury or mortality due to human impacts have been recorded in U.S. waters.      The North Atlantic stock of sperm whales was included for discussion when the Atlantic Offshore Cetacean Take Reduction Team (AOCTRT) was formed in 1996 to address the interaction of marine mammals with Highly Migratory Species (HMS) pelagic longline, pair trawl, and pelagic driftnet fisheries for Atlantic tunas, sharks, and swordfish. A draft plan to reduce takes resulting from these types of gear was submitted, and though it was not finalized, several protective measures have been implemented for these fisheries. Since the AOCTRT last met in 1996, NMFS has prohibited the use of pair trawls and swordfish driftnets in Atlantic pelagic fisheries, and implemented other AOCTRT recommendations for the pelagic longline and shark gillnet fisheries through the HMS FMP.      At this time, fishery-related interactions are not deemed to be a major source of mortality for this species. To the extent that sperm whales are present in waters affected by ALWTRP- regulated gear, they are expected to experience the same benefits from gear modifications required by the ALWTRP as the large whale species these gear modifications were designed to protect.      It has been suggested that another potential human-caused source of mortality for sperm whales may be the accumulation of stable pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), chlorinated pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and heavy metals. Though not conclusively caused by contaminant burden, tissue samples from 21 sperm whales involved in a mass stranding in the North Sea in 1994/95 showed cadmium levels twice as high as those found in North Pacific sperm whales, possibly affecting the stranded animals’ health and behavior (Holsbeek, et al. 1999).9.4.2.2 Harbor Porpoise      Harbor porpoises can be found in continental shelf waters throughout the ALWTRP action area, from southern Florida to the Gulf of Maine and Bay of Fundy. The Gulf of Maine/Bay of Fundy stock is categorized as a strategic stock under the MMPA. The best estimate of abundance for this stock is 89,054 (CV=0.47), with a minimum population estimate of 60,970 (Waring et al., 2012). There is little known about the natural causes of mortality for this species.      Fishery interactions with the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic gillnet fisheries are the primary anthropogenic hazard faced by this species. Harbor porpoises have been taken incidentally in sink gillnets since the 1960s, when a sink gillnet fishery for groundfish was developed in the Bay of Fundy, Canada.31 Similar fisheries developed along the New England coast in the 1970s. Before 1998, most of the harbor porpoise takes from U.S. commercial fisheries originated from the Northeast sink gillnet fishery. An investigation conducted in 1984 estimated that a maximum31 The reference to sink gillnets here is assumed to meet the ALWTRP definition of an anchored net.
of 600 harbor porpoises were killed annually in this fishery (Gilbert and Wynne, 1985, 1987). In 1990, NMFS initiated an observer program to investigate marine mammal takes in the Northeast sink gillnet fishery. Observers reported 454 harbor porpoise mortalities related to this fishery between 1990 and 2001. Between 1994 and 1998 (i.e., before implementation of the Harbor Porpoise Take Reduction Plan (HPTRP)), the average annual mortality and serious injury estimate for harbor porpoise in the Northeast sink gillnet fishery was 1,163 (Waring et al., 2003).      The Mid-Atlantic coastal gillnet fishery, which extends from North Carolina to New York, consists of a combination of small vessels that target a variety of fish species. An observer program for this fishery began in 1993. There were no observed harbor porpoise takes in this fishery between 1993 and 1994, but from 1995 through 1998 (i.e., before implementation of the HPTRP), the average annual mortality and serious injury estimate for harbor porpoise was 358 (Waring et al., 2003).      During 1993, 73 harbor porpoises were reported stranded on beaches from Maine to North Carolina. Many of the carcasses recovered in the Mid-Atlantic during this period had cuts and body damage suggestive of net markings (Haley and Read, 1993). Between 1994 and 1996, 107 harbor porpoise carcasses were recovered from beaches in Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina. Only juvenile harbor porpoises were present in this sample. Of the  40  harbor porpoises for which the cause of death could be determined, 25 displayed definitive evidence of entanglement in fishing gear. In four cases, it was possible to determine that the animal was entangled in monofilament nets (Cox et al., 1998).      Over half of the 228 harbor porpoise strandings recorded in 1999 occurred on beaches in Massachusetts and North Carolina. Virginia, New Jersey, and Maryland had the next greatest numbers of strandings, respectively. The cause of death was investigated for all harbor porpoise strandings in 1999, and 38 individuals were determined to have died as a result of an interaction with fishing gear. During 2000, only 27 harbor porpoises stranded on beaches from Maine to North Carolina. Most of these occurred in Massachusetts (8) and North Carolina (6). During 2001, 113 harbor porpoises were reported stranded, and most of these occurred in Massachusetts (39), Virginia (28), and North Carolina (21). Thirteen of these strandings displayed signs of fishery interactions (Waring et al., 2003).Harbor Porpoise Take Reduction Plan (HPTRP)      To address the high levels of incidental take of harbor porpoise in the groundfish sink gillnet fishery, a Take Reduction Team was formed in 1996. A rule (63 FR 66464) to reduce harbor porpoise bycatch in U.S. Atlantic gillnets was published on December 1, 1998, and became effective on January 1, 1999 (63 FR 71041) and was amended on February 19, 2010(75 FR 7383). Since gillnet operations differ between the New England and Mid-Atlantic regions, two sets of measures were devised. The New England portion of the plan pertains to all fishing with sink gillnets and other gillnets capable of catching multispecies in New England waters from Maine through Rhode Island. This portion of the rule includes time and area closures, some of which are complete closures. Other fisheries are closed to multispecies gillnet fishing unless pingers (sound-making devices) are used in the manner prescribed in the Take Reduction Plan regulations. The Mid-Atlantic portion of the plan pertains to the Mid-Atlantic
shoreline  from  New  York  to  North  Carolina.	This portion of the rule also includes gear modifications and time and area closures to mitigate the incidental take of harbor porpoise.9.4.2.3 DolphinsWestern North Atlantic Coastal Bottlenose Dolphin      Coastal bottlenose dolphins can also be found in continental shelf waters throughout the ALWTRP action area, from southern Florida to the Gulf of Maine and Bay of Fundy. The western North Atlantic stock is categorized as strategic under the MMPA. This stock structure was revised in 2002 to recognize both multiple stocks and seasonal management units and again in 2008 and 2009 to recognize resident estuarine stocks and migratory and resident coastal stocks.      Fishery interactions with the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic gillnet fisheries are the primary anthropogenic hazard faced by this species. Western North Atlantic (WNA) coastal bottlenose dolphins are known to interact with commercial fisheries and occasionally are taken in various kinds of fishing gear, including gillnets, seines, longlines, hook and line, shrimp trawls, and crab traps/pots. Interactions are especially common in near-shore areas where dolphin densities and fishing effort are greatest.      The western North Atlantic stock of bottlenose dolphins was included for discussion when the Atlantic Offshore Cetacean Take Reduction Team (AOCTRT) was formed in 1996 to address the interaction of marine mammals with Highly Migratory Species (HMS) pelagic longline, pair trawl, and pelagic driftnet fisheries for Atlantic tunas, sharks, and swordfish. A draft plan to reduce takes associated with these types of gear was submitted, and though it was not finalized, several protective measures have been implemented for these fisheries. Since the AOCTRT last met in 1996, NMFS has prohibited the use of pair trawls and swordfish driftnets in Atlantic pelagic fisheries. In addition, through the HMS FMP, NMFS has implemented other AOCTRT recommendations for the pelagic longline and shark gillnet fisheries.      The MMPA List of Fisheries (LOF) currently designates eleven Category I and II commercial fisheries in the Atlantic that interact with western North Atlantic coastal bottlenose dolphins, several of which fall under the provisions of the ALWTRP: the Mid-Atlantic coastal gillnet, Southeast Atlantic gillnet, and Southeastern U.S. Atlantic shark gillnet fisheries.      Of the fisheries noted above, the Mid-Atlantic coastal gillnet fishery accounts for the highest documented level of mortality or serious injury of WNA coastal bottlenose dolphins. Within this fishery, the North Carolina sink gillnet fishery accounts for the greatest number of observed takes. Bycatch estimates for this fishery are available for 1996 to 2000. Of  12  observed mortalities from 1995 to 2000, five occurred in sets targeting spiny or smooth dogfish and another in a set targeting shark species; two occurred in striped bass sets; two occurred in Spanish mackerel sets; and the remainder were in sets targeting kingfish, weakfish, or finfish generically (Rossman and Palka, 2001).
      The shark gillnet fishery in the Southeast overlaps with the Georgia, Northern Florida, and Central Florida management units of the WNA coastal bottlenose dolphin stock complex. The shark gillnet fishery operates in Federal waters from southern Florida to southern Georgia. The fishery is characterized by vessels using relatively large mesh nets (less than ten inches) and net lengths typically greater than 1500 feet. The fishery primarily uses drifting nets that are set overnight; recently, however, it has begun employing a small number of shorter duration “strike” sets that encircle targeted schools of sharks. During an observer program in 1993 and 1994 and limited observer coverage during the summer of 1998, no takes of bottlenose dolphin were observed (Trent et al., 1997; Carlson and Lee, 2000). However, takes resulting in mortality were observed in the central Florida management unit during 1999 and 2000 (Garrison, 2003).      Trap/pot gear used in several Atlantic fisheries poses another significant threat to bottlenose dolphins. Between 1994 and 1998, 22 bottlenose dolphin carcasses recovered by the Stranding Network between North Carolina and Florida's Atlantic coast displayed evidence of possible interaction with a trap/pot fishery (i.e., rope and/or pots attached, rope marks). Additionally, at least five dolphins were reported to be released alive (condition unknown) from blue crab traps/pots during this time period (Waring et al., 2002). In recent years, reports of strandings with evidence of interactions between bottlenose dolphins and both recreational and commercial crab trap/pot fisheries have been increasing in the Southeast Region (McFee and Brooks, 1998). The increase in reports of such strandings may result from increased effort towards documenting these marks or from underlying increases in mortality.      Bottlenose dolphins are also susceptible to mortality from sources other than the direct result of anthropogenic interactions. From 1997 to 1999, 995 bottlenose dolphins were reported stranded along the Atlantic coast from New York to Florida (Hohn and Martone, 2001; Hohn et al., 2001; Palka et al., 2001). Of these, it was possible to determine whether a human interaction had occurred for 449 (45 percent); it was not possible to determine whether human interactions were involved for the remainder of the stranded animals. An overall average of 34 percent of stranded carcasses were determined to have been involved in a human interaction, but ranged widely from 11 to 12 percent in Delaware and Georgia to 49 and 53 percent in Virginia and North Carolina, respectively.      There are no estimates of indirect human-caused mortality resulting from pollution or habitat degradation. From 1987 to 1988, the WNA coastal bottlenose dolphin population experienced a massive die-off. During the 11-month epidemic, it was estimated that over half of the population died. Possible sources of the event include brevetoxin produced by red tide organisms, environmental contaminants, or natural diseases. The blubber of the stranded dolphins examined from the event contained anthropogenic contaminants in levels among the highest recorded for a cetacean (Geraci, 1989).      In April 2006, NMFS published a final rule to implement the Take Reduction Plan for the WNA coastal stock of bottlenose dolphin (April 26, 2006, 71 FR 24776) to reduce the incidental mortality and serious injury in the Mid-Atlantic gillnet fishery and eight other coastal fisheries operating within the dolphin’s distributional range. The other Atlantic coastal fisheries include the North Carolina inshore gillnet fishery, Southeast Atlantic gillnet fishery, Atlantic blue crab trap/pot fishery, Mid-Atlantic haul/beach seine fishery, North Carolina long haul seine fishery, North Carolina roe mullet stop net fishery, Southeastern U.S. Atlantic shark gillnet fishery, and
the Virginia pound net fishery (NMFS, 2002c). The final rule also revised the large mesh size restriction under the Mid-Atlantic large mesh gillnet rule for conservation of endangered and threatened sea turtles to provide consistency among Federal and state management measures. The Plan was amended on July 31, 2012 (77 FR 45268) to permanently continuing nighttime fishing restrictions of medium mesh gillnets operating in North Carolina coastal state waters.  The measures contained in the Plan include gillnet effort reduction, gear proximity requirements, gear or gear deployment modifications, and outreach and educational measures to reduce dolphin bycatch below the marine mammals stock’s potential biological removal level (PBR).Atlantic White-Sided Dolphin      The Gulf of Maine stock of Atlantic white-sided dolphins is commonly found in continental shelf waters from Hudson Canyon to Georges Bank and from the Gulf of Maine to the Bay of Fundy. The best estimate of abundance for the Gulf of Maine white-sided dolphin stock is 23,390 (CV=0.23), and the minimum estimate is 19,019 (Waring et al., 2012).      There is little information available about the natural causes of mortality for this species. Atlantic white-sided dolphins have become entangled in the Northeast sink gillnet, Mid-Atlantic coastal gillnet, pelagic drift gillnet, North Atlantic bottom trawl, and Atlantic squid, mackerel, and butterfish trawl fisheries. The Northeast sink gillnet and the Mid-Atlantic coastal gillnet fisheries are currently regulated under the ALWTRP.Risso’s Dolphin      The western North Atlantic stock of Risso’s dolphins occurs along the continental shelf from Cape Hatteras to Georges Bank. Based on limited survey estimates in U.S. waters, the best estimate of this stock of Risso’s dolphins is 20,479, and the minimum estimate is 12,920 (Waring et al., 2012).      According to observer records from 2005-2009, this species has been observed as  bycatch in the pelagic drift gillnet, pelagic longline, pelagic pair trawl, and the Northeast multispecies sink gillnet fisheries. Between 1996 and 2000, the estimated mean mortality of Risso’s dolphins taken in the pelagic longline fishery was eight and was three for the Northeast multispecies sink gillnet fishery (Waring et al., 2012). The Northeast sink gillnet fishery is currently regulated under the ALWTRP.      To address levels of Risso’s dolphin bycatch in the pelagic longline fishery, NMFS established the Pelagic Longline Take Reduction Team. The team first met in June 2005. NMFS published a proposed rule on June 24, 2008 (73 FR 35623) and a final rule on May 19, 2009(74 FR 23349), effective June 18, 2009. The plan consists of both regulatory and nonregulatory measures, including a special research area, gear modifications, outreach material, observer coverage, and captains’ communications.
Pelagic Delphinids (Spotted Dolphin, Striped Dolphin, Pilot Whale, Western North Atlantic Offshore Bottlenose Dolphin, Common Dolphin)      The pelagic delphinid complex is made up of small odontocete species that are broadly distributed along the edge of the continental shelf, where depths range from 200 - 400 meters. These species include the western North Atlantic stock of spotted dolphins, western North Atlantic stock of striped dolphins, western North Atlantic stock of pilot whales, the western North Atlantic offshore stock of bottlenose dolphins, and the western North Atlantic stock of common dolphins.Spotted Dolphin      Atlantic and pantropical spotted dolphins are difficult to differentiate at sea. Atlantic spotted dolphins are distributed from southern New England south through the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean to Venezuela (Waring et al., 2000). Pantropical spotted dolphins are distributed worldwide in tropical and some sub-tropical oceans, occur in the Gulf of Mexico in all seasons, and also occur between Nova Scotia and Florida (Waring et al., 2002). Both species are commonly found in large groups and are known to feed on a variety of prey, including small- to-large epipelagic and mesopelagic fishes and squids, and benthic invertebrates (Perrin et al., 2002).      The best estimate of abundance for Atlantic spotted dolphins is 50,978 and the minimum population estimate for this stock is 36,235 (Waring et al., 2007). The best estimate of  abundance for pantropical spotted dolphins is 4,439; the minimum population estimate for this stock is 3,010 (Waring et al., 2007). There is little information available about the natural mortality of these two species.      Bycatch of spotted dolphins has been observed by NMFS Sea Samplers in the pelagic drift gillnet and pelagic longline fisheries. The western North Atlantic stock of spotted dolphins (both species) was included for discussion when the Atlantic Offshore Cetacean Take Reduction Team (AOCTRT) was formed in 1996 to address the interaction of marine mammals with Highly Migratory Species (HMS) pelagic longline, pair trawl, and pelagic driftnet fisheries for Atlantic tunas, sharks, and swordfish. A draft plan to reduce takes resulting from these types of gear was submitted, and though it was not finalized, several protective measures have been implemented for these fisheries. Since the AOCTRT last met in 1996, NMFS has prohibited the use of pair trawls and swordfish driftnets in Atlantic pelagic fisheries, and implemented other AOCTRT recommendations for the pelagic longline and shark gillnet fisheries through the HMS  FMP.  The total annual average fishery-related mortality or serious injury to this stock from 2001 through 2005 was estimated as 6 spotted dolphins (undifferentiated between Atlantic and pantropical).Striped Dolphin      Striped dolphins are found in the western North Atlantic from Nova Scotia south to at least Jamaica, in the Gulf of Mexico, and in general prefer continental slope waters offshore to
the Gulf Stream (Waring et al., 2000). These dolphins, like spotted dolphins, are commonly found in large groups that feed on schools of fish. Striped dolphins feed on a variety of pelagic  or benthopelagic fish and squid; in the Northeast Atlantic, they primarily feed on cod (Perrin et al., 2002). The best estimate of abundance for striped dolphins is 94,462; the minimum population estimate for this stock is 68,558 (Waring et al., 2007).      Bycatch of striped dolphins has been observed in low numbers by NMFS Sea Samplers in the pelagic drift gillnet and North Atlantic bottom trawl fisheries, but no mortalities or serious injuries have been documented in the pelagic longline fisheries, pelagic pair trawl, Northeast multispecies sink gillnet, and Mid-Atlantic coastal gillnet fisheries (Waring et al., 2000).32 The total annual average fishery-related mortality to this stock from 2001-2005 was 0 dolphins.Pilot Whale      Long- and short-finned pilot whales are found in the Gulf Stream and continental shelf and slope waters. The best estimate of abundance for the long-finned pilot whale species is 12,619; the minimum estimate is 9,333 (Waring et al., 2012). The best estimate of abundance for the short-finned pilot whale species is 24,674; the minimum estimate is 17,190 (Waring et al., 2012).      Pilot whale bycatch has been observed by NMFS Sea Samplers in the pelagic  drift gillnet, pelagic longline, pelagic pair trawl, bluefin tuna purse seine, North Atlantic bottom trawl, Atlantic squid, mackerel, and butterfish trawl, and Mid-Atlantic coastal gillnet fisheries, but no mortalities or serious injuries have been documented in the Northeast multispecies sink gillnet fishery.33      The western North Atlantic stock of pilot whales (both long- and short-finned) was included for discussion when the Atlantic Offshore Cetacean Take Reduction Team (AOCTRT) was formed in 1996 to address the interaction of marine mammals with Highly Migratory Species (HMS) pelagic longline, pair trawl, and pelagic driftnet fisheries for Atlantic tunas, sharks, and swordfish. A draft plan to reduce takes resulting from these gear types was submitted, and though it was not finalized, several protective measures have been implemented for these fisheries. Since the AOCTRT met in 1996, NMFS has prohibited the use of pair trawls and swordfish driftnets in Atlantic pelagic fisheries, and implemented other AOCTRT recommendations for the pelagic longline and shark gillnet fisheries through the HMS FMP. Since the nature of the fisheries that were included in the Plan has changed tremendously since 1996 when the Team was convened, NMFS disbanded the Team in August 2001.      It is not possible to partition mortality estimates between the 2 species because there are very few available genetic samples from the area of overlap and season where most mortality occurs. Mortality and serious injury estimates are thus presented only for the 2 species combined. Total annual estimated average fishery-related mortality or serious injury during 2005-2009 was32 Waring et al. (2000) note that the pelagic drift gillnet and the pelagic pair trawl fisheries no longer exist.33 Waring et al. (2003) note that the pelagic drift gillnet and the pelagic pair trawl fisheries no longer exist.
162 pilot whales (CV=0.15). Of this, it is most likely that the mortality due to the pelagic longline fishery, the Northeast midwater trawl fishery, and the Northeast groundfish fishery have the most direct impact on long-finned pilot whales. The Mid-Atlantic coastal gillnet fishery is currently regulated under the ALWTRP. The pelagic longline fishery is currently regulated under the Pelagic Longline Take Reduction Team, and the Northeast midwater trawl fishery is regulated under the Atlantic Trawl Gear Take Reduction Team.      Bycatch data indicate that takes of pilot whales occur in both pelagic longline gear and several Atlantic trawl gear fisheries. Because mortality has been close to PBR, the status of the stock has fluctuated between strategic and non-strategic (Waring et al., 2003). In response, in part, to the problem of interactions between pilot whales and commercial fishing gear, NMFS has formed the Pelagic Longline Take Reduction Team (70 FR 36120); the initial TRT meeting was held on June 29 and 30, 2005. Similarly, NMFS has established the Atlantic Trawl Gear Take Reduction Team; the initial meeting of this group was held on September 19, 20, and 21, 2006 (71 FR 54273).      An additional potential human-caused source of mortality for pilot whales is from polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and chlorinated pesticides, moderate levels of which have been found in pilot whale blubber (Taruski, 1975; Muir et al., 1988; Weisbrod et al., 2000b). In addition, high levels of toxic metals, selenium, and PCBs were measured in pilot whales killed in the Faroe Islands (Nielsen et al., 2000; Dam and Bloch, 2000). The population effect of the observed levels of such contaminants is currently unknown (Waring et al., 2003).Western North Atlantic Offshore Bottlenose Dolphin      The western North Atlantic offshore stock of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) ranges from Florida to Georges Bank along the continental slope. The best estimate of  abundance is 70,775. (Waring et al., 2008).      Little information about natural mortality for this species is available. Bottlenose dolphins are among the most frequently stranded small cetaceans along the Atlantic coast. Many of these stranded animals show signs of human interaction, such as net marks and mutilation (Waring et al., 2003).      Offshore bottlenose dolphin bycatch has been observed by NMFS Sea Samplers in the pelagic drift gillnet, pelagic longline, pelagic pair trawl, North Atlantic bottom trawl, Northeast multispecies sink gillnet, and Mid-Atlantic coastal gillnet fisheries.34 The western  North  Atlantic stock of offshore bottlenose dolphins was included for discussion when the Atlantic Offshore Cetacean Take Reduction Team (AOCTRT) was formed in 1996 to address the interaction of marine mammals with Highly Migratory Species (HMS) pelagic longline, pair trawl, and pelagic driftnet fisheries for Atlantic tunas, sharks, and swordfish. A draft plan to reduce takes resulting from these gear types was submitted, and though it was not finalized, several protective measures have been implemented for these fisheries. Since the AOCTRT last met in 1996, NMFS has prohibited the use of pair trawls and swordfish driftnets in Atlantic34 Waring et al. (2003) note that the pelagic drift gillnet and the pelagic pair trawl fisheries no longer exist.
pelagic fisheries, and implemented other AOCTRT recommendations for the pelagic longline and shark gillnet fisheries through the HMS FMP.      The total annual fishery-related mortality of this stock during 2001-2006 is unknown (Waring et al., 2008).Common Dolphin      The western North Atlantic stock of common dolphins occurs most frequently north of Cape Hatteras along the continental shelf. The best estimate of western North Atlantic stock abundance is 120,743 common dolphins; the minimum estimate is 99,975 (Waring et al., 2012). Little is known about the natural mortality of this species.      Common dolphin bycatch has been observed by NMFS Sea Samplers in the pelagic drift gillnet, pelagic longline, pelagic pair trawl, North Atlantic bottom trawl, Atlantic squid, mackerel, and butterfish trawl, Northeast multispecies sink gillnet, and Mid-Atlantic coastal gillnet fisheries.35      The western North Atlantic stock of common dolphins was included for discussion when the Atlantic Offshore Cetacean Take Reduction Team (AOCTRT) was formed in 1996 to address the interaction of marine mammals with Highly Migratory Species (HMS) pelagic longline, pair trawl, and pelagic driftnet fisheries for Atlantic tunas, sharks, and swordfish. A draft plan to reduce takes resulting from these gear types was submitted, and though it was not finalized, several protective measures have been implemented for these fisheries. Since the AOCTRT met in 1996, NMFS has prohibited the use of pair trawls and swordfish driftnets in Atlantic pelagic fisheries, and implemented other AOCTRT recommendations for the pelagic longline and shark gillnet fisheries through the HMS FMP.      Based on observer data, the estimated annual average fishery-related mortality or serious injury to the western North Atlantic stock attributable to U.S. fisheries was 164 common dolphins from 2005-2009. In the Atlantic pelagic longline fishery between 1990 and 2007, 20 common dolphins were observed hooked and released alive. The 2005-2009 average annual mortality attributed to the northeast sink gillnet was 26 animals. The trawl fisheries (northeast bottom, Mid-Atlantic bottom trawl, Mid-Atlantic mid-water trawl) accounted for 134 mortalities from 2005-2009. Two take reduction teams address the take of common dolphins in these fisheries.Atlantic Offshore Cetacean Take Reduction Team      Historically, Highly Migratory Species (HMS) fisheries that affect marine mammals include the pelagic longline, pair trawl, and pelagic driftnet fisheries for Atlantic tunas, sharks, and swordfish. In 1996, the Atlantic Offshore Cetacean Take Reduction Team (AOCTRT) was formed to address the interaction of these fisheries with Western North Atlantic stocks of right, sperm, humpback, and pilot whales; and common, bottlenose, and spotted (Atlantic and pantropical) dolphins. A draft plan to reduce takes resulting from these gear types was35 Waring et al. (2003) note that the pelagic drift gillnet and the pelagic pair trawl fisheries no longer exist.
submitted, but an Atlantic Offshore Cetacean Take Reduction Plan was not finalized as a separate entity. Instead, several protective measures were implemented for these fisheries through the HMS FMP. In particular, NMFS has prohibited the use of pair trawls and swordfish driftnets in Atlantic pelagic fisheries, and implemented several other AOCTRT  recommendations for the pelagic longline and shark gillnet fisheries. Since the nature of the fisheries that were included in the Plan has changed tremendously since 1996 when the Team was convened, NMFS disbanded the Team in August 2001.Atlantic Longline Take Reduction Team and Atlantic Trawl Gear Take Reduction Team      Data (Waring et al., 2006) indicated that the incidental take of pilot whales in the Atlantic pelagic longline fishery occurs at levels below PBR. The Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC) released an updated estimate of marine mammal bycatch in the U.S. Atlantic pelagic longline fishery during 2001 and 2002, which included the incidental take of long-finned pilot whales (Garrison, 2003). As a result, NMFS announced the formation of the Atlantic Longline Take Reduction Team in June 2005 (70 FR 36120); the initial TRT meeting was held on June 29 and 30, 2005. NMFS published a proposed rule on June 24, 2008 (73 FR 35623) and a final ruleon May 19, 2009 (74 FR 23349), effective June 18, 2009. The plan consists of both regulatory and nonregulatory measures, including a special research area, gear modifications, outreach material, observer coverage, and captains’ communications.      Current data (Waring et al., 2012) indicate that the incidental take of common and Atlantic-white sided dolphins and pilot whales in several Atlantic trawl gear fisheries occurs at levels below PBR for these species. NMFS has established the Atlantic Trawl Gear Take Reduction Team to reduce the incidental mortality and serious injury of these species. This team first met in September 2006, and developed a Take Reduction Strategy in December 2008. This strategy consists of voluntary measures, education and outreach efforts, and a research plan. NMFS continues to monitor the status of Atlantic-white sided dolphins and pilot whales. If the status changes then the team may reconvene.9.4.2.4 SealsHarbor Seal      In the western North Atlantic, harbor seals are distributed from the eastern Canadian Arctic and Greenland south to southern New England and New York, and occasionally the Carolinas (Boulva and McLaren, 1979; Gilbert and Guldager, 1998). It is believed that the  harbor seals found along the U.S. and Canadian east coasts represent one population (Waring et al., 2003).      Since passage of the MMPA in 1972, the number of seals found along the New England coast has increased nearly five-fold; however, present data are insufficient to calculate a minimum population estimate for this stock (Waring et al., 2012).
      Harbor seals were bounty hunted in New England waters until the mid-1960s. This hunt may have caused the demise of this stock in U.S. waters (Katona et al., 1993). Current sources  of mortality include human interactions, such as boat strikes and fishing gear, power plant intake (12-20 per year; NMFS, unpublished data), oil, and shooting (around salmon aquaculture sites and fixed fishing gear); and natural events, such as storms, abandonment by the mother, and disease (Katona et al., 1993; NMFS, unpublished data). Interactions with Maine salmon aquaculture operations seem to be increasing, although the magnitude of interactions and seal mortalities has not been quantified (Anon., 1996).      Annually, small numbers of harbor seals regularly strand throughout their migratory range. Most reported strandings, however, occur during the winter period in the southern New England and Mid-Atlantic regions (NMFS, unpublished data). In 1980, more than 350 seals  were found dead in the Cape Cod area from an influenza outbreak (Geraci et al., 1981).      Incidental takes of harbor seals have been recorded in groundfish gillnet, herring purse seine, halibut tub trawl, and lobster fisheries (Gilbert and Wynne, 1985 and 1987). Mortalities involving the herring purse seine, halibut tub trawl, and lobster fisheries are reportedly rare.      The Northeast multispecies sink gillnet fishery is responsible for the majority of harbor seal fishery takes on the East Coast of the United States. This fishery is located in the Gulf of Maine and in Southern New England. Average annual estimated fisheries-related mortality and serious injury to the harbor seal stock attributable to the Northeast multispecies sink gillnet fishery from 2005-2009 was 332 harbor seals (Waring et al., 2012).      The Mid-Atlantic coastal gillnet fishery was responsible for a minimal number of takes from 1993-1997 and 1999-2001, with observers recording only two mortalities, both in 1998 (Waring et al., 2003). Based on the observer coverage in this fishery, estimated mortality was zero from 1995 to 1997 and 1999 to 2001, and 11 in 1998 (0.77). The average annual estimated fishery-related mortality attributable to the Mid-Atlantic coastal gillnet fishery from 2005-2009 was 45 animals (Waring et al., 2012).Gray Seal      The western North Atlantic population of gray seals occurs from New England to Labrador. There are two breeding concentrations in eastern Canada – one at Sable Island and  one that breeds on the pack ice in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. There are several small breeding colonies on isolated islands along the coast of Maine and on outer Cape Cod and Nantucket Island in Massachusetts (Waring et al., 2003). The population estimate for the Sable Island and Gulf of St. Lawrence breeding groups was 143,000 in 1993. The population in waters off Maine increased from about 30 in the early 1980s to between 500 and 1,000 animals in 1993 and between 1,500 and 1,700 in 2001 (Waring et al., 2003). The gray seal population in Massachusetts increased from 2,010 in 1994 to 5,611 in 1999, although it is not clear how much of this increase may be due to animals emigrating from northern areas. Depending on the model used, the Nmin for the Canadian gray seal population was estimated to range between 125,541 and 169,064 (Trzcinski et al. 2005). The minimum population size for gray seals in U.S. waters is unknown.
      Gray seals, like harbor seals, were hunted for bounty in New England waters until the late 1960s. The hunt may have severely depleted this stock in U.S. waters (Rough,  1995).  In Canada, gray seals were hunted for several centuries by indigenous people and European settlers in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and along the Nova Scotia eastern shore, and were locally extirpated (Lavigueru and Hammill, 1993). By the mid-1900s, gray seals were considered to be rare, and in the mid-1960s, the population in eastern Canada was estimated to be 5,600 (Mansfield, 1966). Since the mid-1960s, the population has been increasing. During a bounty program (1976-1983) and a culling program (1967-1983), the average annual removals were 720 and 1,000 seals, respectively (Fisheries and Oceans Canada, 2001). Between 1993 and 2000, the annual kill of gray seals by hunters was: 1993 (0), 1994 (40), 1995 (364), 1996 (132), 1997 (72), 1998 (275),1999 (98), and 2000 (342). The traditional hunt continued in 2002 and 2003, with 76 and 126 gray seals taken, respectively, off the Magdalen Islands and in other areas, except Sable Island, where commercial hunting is not permitted (Fisheries and Oceans Canada, 2003).      An unknown level of mortality also occurs in the mariculture industry (i.e., salmon farming) and by deliberate shooting (NMFS, unpublished data). In addition, the Cape Cod stranding network has documented several animals with netting or plastic debris around their necks in the Cape Cod/Nantucket area. Between 1997 and 2001, 197 gray seal strandings were recorded, extending from Maine (25) to North Carolina (1). Most of the strandings were in Massachusetts (72), New York (55), and Maine (25). Twenty-three animals showed signs of human interactions: fishery (8), power plant (3), oil spill (6), shot (1), mutilated (1), boat strike (1), and other (3) (Waring et al., 2003). Stranding data probably underestimate the extent of fishery-related mortality and serious injury because not all of the marine mammals that die or are seriously injured wash ashore, nor will all of those that do wash ashore necessarily show signs of entanglement or other fishery interaction.      Fisheries interactions with gray seals take place primarily in the Northeast multispecies sink gillnet fishery in the Gulf of Maine and in Southern New England. There were 47 gray seal mortalities observed in this fishery between 1993 and 2001. Based on observer data, the average annual estimated mortality and serious injury attributable to this fishery from 2005-2009 was 678 gray seals (Waring et al., 2012).Harp Seal      The harp seal occurs throughout much of the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans and has been increasing off the East Coast of the United States from Maine to New Jersey. Harp seals  are usually found off the U.S. from January to May, when the western stock of harp seals is at its most southern point of migration. The minimum population estimate for the western North Atlantic is 6.5 million seals in Canada; present data are insufficient to calculate the minimum population estimate for U.S. waters (Waring et al., 2012).      A large number of harp seals are killed in Canada, Greenland, and the Arctic. For 2003  to 2005, the Canada Department of Fisheries and Oceans set the three-year total allowable catch (TAC) of harp seals at 975,000, with an annual TAC of up to 350,000 in any two years provided that the combined TAC over three years was maintained by a reduction in the TAC in the other
years (Fisheries and Oceans Canada, 2003). In addition, annual harp seal mortalities in Greenland and the Arctic may exceed 100,000 (Waring et al., 2003). The commercial catches do not account for subsistence takes and animals that are killed but not landed (struck and lost) (Lavigne, 1999). A recent analysis of the struck and loss rates suggests that the rate for young seals (majority of Canadian take) is less than 5 percent, while losses of older seals is higher (approximately 50 percent) (DFO, 2000).      From 1988 through 1993 strandings each year were under 50, approaching 100 animals in 1994, and exceeding 100 animals in 1995-1996 (Rubinstein 1994; Waring et al., 2003). In addition, in 1996, there was a stranding in North Carolina. From 1997 through 2001, 980 strandings were recorded, of which 50 percent (495) were in 2001 (Waring et al., 2003). Fifty- two percent (n=258) of the 2001 strandings were carcasses, and the remaining 49 percent were live strandings. Strandings were recorded from Maine (166) to North Carolina (1), and the highest numbers occurred in Massachusetts (339) and New York (277). Many were live strandings, but some seals were euthanized due to the animal’s condition. Other sick and injured seals were transported to rehabilitation facilities, where some subsequently died. Few animals showed signs of human interactions and, except for 4 shot animals, 8 fishery interactions, 1 mutilated animal, 1 boat strike, and 1 ingested plastic, the interactions were classified as other (e.g., no signs of human interaction). Factors contributing to a dramatic increase in strandings in 2001 are unknown (Harris et al., 2002), but may indicate a possible shift in the stock's distribution or expansion southward into U.S. waters (Waring et al., 2003).      The majority of fisheries-related mortality in harp seals can be attributed to the Northeast multispecies sink gillnet fishery, which is based in the Gulf of Maine and in Southern New England. From 2005-2009, the average annual fishery-related mortality and serious injury to this stock from the Northeast multispecies sink gillnet fishery was estimated at 174 harp seals (Waring et al., 2012). Harp seal interactions with the Mid-Atlantic coastal gillnet fishery have been minimal since observer coverage began in 1993. No harp seals were taken on observed  trips from 1993 to 1997 or from 1999 to 2001. One take was recorded in 1998. The average annual estimated fishery-related mortality attributable to this fishery between 2005-2009 was 57 harp seals (Waring et al., 2012).
9.4.2.5 Sea Turtles      The diverse life history of sea turtles leaves them susceptible to numerous threats on land, in the benthic environment, and in the pelagic environment. Natural threats to sea turtles include hurricanes, predation by native species, cold stunning, and biotoxin exposure. Anthropogenic factors that may affect turtle nesting habitat include climate change; beach erosion; beach armoring and nourishment; artificial lighting; beach cleaning; increased human presence; recreational beach equipment; beach driving; coastal construction and fishing piers; exotic dune and beach vegetation; and poaching. An increased human presence at some nesting beaches or close to nesting beaches has led to secondary threats such as the introduction of exotic fire ants and an increased presence of native species (e.g., raccoons, armadillos, and opossums) that feed on turtle eggs. When sea turtles shift from the land environment to the pelagic and benthic marine environments, one of the principal anthropogenic threats they face originates from commercial fisheries, and the threat of serious injury and mortality resulting from interactions with commercial fishing gear. Additional anthropogenic threats to sea turtles in the marine environment include climate change; oil and gas exploration, coastal development, and transportation; marine pollution (including ingestion of and entanglement in marine debris); underwater explosions; hopper dredging; offshore artificial lighting; power plant entrainment and/or impingement; marina and dock construction and operation; boat collisions; and poaching.      Leatherbacks are susceptible to entanglement in the lines associated with trap/pot gear used in several fisheries. From 1990 to 2000, 92 entangled leatherbacks were reported from New York through Maine (Dwyer et al., 2002). Additional leatherbacks stranded wrapped in line of unknown origin or with evidence of a past entanglement (Dwyer et al., 2002). From 2002 to 2011, NMFS received 159 reports of sea turtles entangled in vertical lines from Maine to Virginia, with 147 events confirmed (verified by photo documentation or response by a trained responder; NMFS and USFWS 2008). Of the 147 confirmed events during this period, 133 events involved leatherbacks, 13 involved loggerheads, and 1 involved a green sea turtle. NMFS identified the gear type and fishery for 93 of the 147 confirmed events, which included lobster (5125), whelk/conch (23), black sea bass (10), crab (7), and research pot gear (2). A review of leatherback mortality documented by the Sea Turtle Stranding and Salvage Network (STSSN) in Massachusetts suggests that vessel strikes and entanglement in fixed gear (primarily lobster pots and whelk pots) are the principal sources of this mortality (Dwyer et al., 2002).Efforts to address sea turtle takes from various pressures have occurred or are underway.These include the following:• Atlantic sea scallop dredge fishery,• Trawl fisheries,• Gillnet fisheries,• Hook and line fisheries,• Pot/Trap fisheries,• Fixed net fisheries,• Vessel strikes,• Oil and gas activities,• Dredging operations and shore stabilization activities, and• Power plants.
Atlantic Sea Scallop Dredge Fishery      To reduce serious injury and mortality to sea turtles resulting from capture in the sea scallop dredge bag, NMFS has required the use of a chain-mat modified dredge in the Atlantic sea scallop fishery since 2006 (71 FR 50361, August 25, 2006; 71 FR 66466, November 15,2006; 73 FR 18984, April 8, 2008; 74 FR 20667, May 5, 2009). Federally permitted scallop vessels south of 41°09’N. from the shoreline to the outer boundary of the EEZ are required to modify their dredge gear by adding an arrangement of horizontal and vertical chains (a “chain mat”) over the opening of the dredge bag from of May 1 through November 30 each year. This modification is not expected to reduce the overall number of sea turtle interactions with gear. It is expected to reduce the severity of some sea turtle interactions with scallop dredge gear.      Beginning May 1, 2013, all limited access scallop vessels, as well as Limited Access General Category vessels with a dredge width of 10.5 feet or greater, must use a Turtle Deflector Dredge (TDD) in the Mid-Atlantic (west of 71° W longitude) from May 1 through October 31 each year (77 FR 20728, April 6, 2012). The purpose of the TDD requirement is to deflect sea turtles over the dredge frame and bag rather than under the cutting bar, so as to reduce sea turtle injuries due to contact with the dredge frame on the ocean bottom (including being crushed  under the dredge frame). The TDD has specific components which are defined in  the regulations. These requirements eliminate a number of sources of potential entrapment at the front and on top of the dredge frame (e.g., sloping face of the forward cutting bar, reduced number of bale support bars, reduced spacing of struts). When combined with the effects of  chain mats, which decrease captures in the dredge bag, the TDD should provide greater sea turtle benefits by reducing serious injury and mortality due to interactions with the dredge frame, compared to a standard New Bedford dredge. Observations of interactions between sea turtle carcasses and the TDD suggest that the serious injury rate of the TDD is much lower than a traditional dredge (Smolowitz et al. 2010). NMFS has produced a wheelhouse card describing the chain mat and TDD requirements to help fishermen meet these requirements. Additional measures to help reduce the impact of takes in the marine environment are described below under Other Efforts to Address Takes in Fisheries.Trawl Fisheries      Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) have been the primary tool used to reduce serious injury and mortality to sea turtles resulting from shrimp trawling activities, as well as trawls targeting summer flounder.36 A TED is a grid of bars with an opening in the net at either at the top or the bottom to allow the turtle to escape. The grid is fitted into the shrimp trawl before the codend. Small animals like shrimp pass through the bars and are caught in the bag end of the trawl.  Large animals such as turtles and sharks, when caught in the trawl, encounter the grid bars and escape through the opening. NMFS has been able to show that, when used properly, TEDs are effective at excluding up to 97 percent of sea turtles with minimal loss of shrimp. Shrimp           36 For a description of the development of TEDs and the regulation history in the shrimp fishery, see Appendix 1 in the 2012 section 7 consultation (NMFS 2012).
trawlers operating in the Atlantic Area or Gulf Area37 are required to install a TED on each net that is rigged for fishing, unless the trawler is fishing under one of the exemptions (e.g., skimmer trawl, try net) and all of the requirements of the exemption are met (50 CFR §223.206).Leatherbacks are likely to encounter shrimp trawls working in the coastal waters off theU.S. Atlantic coast (from Cape Canaveral, Florida through North Carolina) as they make their annual spring migration north. For many years, TEDs that were required for use in the U.S. South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico shrimp fisheries were less effective for leatherbacks as compared to the smaller, hard-shelled turtle species, because the TED openings were too small to allow leatherbacks to escape. To address this problem, NMFS issued a final rule on February 21, 2003, to amend the TED regulations (68 FR 8456, February 21, 2003). Modifications to the design of TEDs are now required in order to exclude leatherbacks as well as large benthic immature and sexually mature loggerhead and green sea turtles. Given those modifications, Epperly et al. (2002) anticipated an average of 80 leatherback mortalities a year in shrimp gear interactions, dropping to an estimate of 26 leatherback mortalities in 2009 due to effort reduction in the Southeast shrimp fishery (Memo from Dr. B. Ponwith, SEFSC, to Dr. R. Crabtree, SERO, January 5, 2011).      In 2011, NMFS published a Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and to conduct scoping meetings. NMFS is considering a variety of regulatory measures to reduce the bycatch of threatened and endangered sea turtles in the southeastern U.S. shrimp fishery in light of new concerns regarding the effectiveness of existing TED regulations in protecting sea turtles (76 FR 37050, June 24, 2011). On May 10, 2012, NMFS proposed to withdraw the alternate tow time restriction and require all skimmer trawls, pusher-head trawls, and wing nets (butterfly trawls) rigged for fishing to use TEDs in their nets. The rule was proposed to reduce incidental mortality and to aid in the protection and recovery of listed sea turtle populations (77 FR 27411). The public comment period on this proposed rule closed on July 9, 2012.      TEDs are also required for summer flounder trawlers in the summer flounder fishery-sea turtle protection area. This area is bounded on the north by a line extending along 37° 05’N (Cape Charles, VA) and on the south by a line extending out from the North Carolina-South Carolina border. Vessels north of Oregon Inlet, North Carolina are exempt from the TED requirement from January 15 through March 15 each year (50 CFR §223.206). The TED requirements for the summer flounder trawl fishery do not require the use of the larger escape opening. NMFS is considering increasing the size of the TED escape opening currently required in the summer flounder fishery and implementing sea turtle conservation requirements in other areas and in other fisheries (72 FR 7382, February 15, 2007; 74 FR 21630, May 8, 2009). Georgia currently requires TEDs on whelk, crab, and jellyfish trawls.           37 Atlantic Area means all waters of the Atlantic Ocean south of 36 °33'00.8" N. lat. (the line of the North Carolina/Virginia border) and adjacent seas, other than waters of the Gulf Area, and all waters shoreward thereof, including ports (50 CFR 222.102). The Gulf Area means all waters of the Gulf of Mexico west of 81° W. long. (the line at which the Gulf Area meets the Atlantic Area) and all waters shoreward thereof, including ports (50 CFR 222.102.
      Actions to protect sea turtles also include an initiative, released by NMFS in June 2001, to address sea turtle bycatch in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico more holistically by gear type and across jurisdictional boundaries. The northeast component of the Strategy for Sea Turtle Conservation and Recovery in Relation to Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico Fisheries (Strategy) is focusing on bycatch reduction in trawl fisheries as a top priority. On May 9, 2009, NMFS published an NOI to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement and conduct public scoping meetings, and made available a scoping document presenting various approaches to sea turtle conservation measures in Atlantic trawl fisheries (74 FR 21627).      Research on the effectiveness of TEDs and other conservation measures have been, and continue to be, conducted in Mid-Atlantic and Southeast trawl fisheries. Differences in trawl designs and fishing methods may necessitate modifications or adjustments to TEDs before they can be applied to other trawl fisheries. Existing and new modified TED designs have been tested in the summer flounder (Salerno and Eayrs, 2010), Atlantic sea scallop (Lawson and DeAlteris, 2006; DeAlteris and Parkins, 2009a), and Atlantic croaker (Gearhart 2010)  fisheries. Preliminary testing has also been conducted in the whiting (DeAlteris and Parkins, 2009b) and Loligo (longfin) squid (DeAlteris and Parkins, 2010) fisheries. Another gear modification developed and currently being evaluated in the summer flounder fishery is the topless trawl. The topless trawl has an extended headrope designed to allow sea turtles to escape. This gear has been tested for sea turtle exclusion. A number of trawls with different headrope lengths were tested off the coast of Georgia in 2011. During testing of the trawl with a 160 foot headrope, the experimental gear (i.e., topless trawl) caught 1 sea turtle and the control gear (i.e., traditional trawl) caught 25 (DeAlteris and Parkins, 2012). Tow time data loggers have been developed and now are being evaluated to determine whether they can be used to facilitate enforcement of tow time restrictions. Attached to the trawl door and triggered when the logger reaches a defined depth, the data loggers document tow times. Data loggers are being tested under commercial conditions to determine their operational effectiveness. Additional measures to help reduce the impact of takes in the marine environment are described below under Other Efforts to Address Takes in Fisheries.Gillnet Fisheries   To reduce the impact of large-mesh gillnet fisheries in the Mid-Atlantic, NMFS published a final rule in December 2002 (67 FR 71895) which enacted a seasonally adjusted gear restriction by closing portions of the Mid-Atlantic EEZ to fishing with gillnets with a mesh size larger than 8-inch stretched mesh. These restrictions were revised in 2006 (73 FR 24776, April 26, 2006). Currently, gillnets with stretched mesh of 7-inches (17.8 cm) or larger are prohibited in the EEZ (as defined in 50 CFR 600.10) during the following times and in the following areas: (1) north  of the North Carolina/South Carolina border to Oregon Inlet at all times, (2) north of Oregon Inlet to Currituck Beach Light, North Carolina from March 16 through January 14, (3) north of Currituck Beach Light, North Carolina to Wachapreague Inlet, Virginia from April 1 through January 14, and (4) north of Wachapreague Inlet, Virginia to Chincoteague, VA from April 16 through January 14.      NMFS has also issued regulations to address the interaction of sea turtles in gillnet gear fished in Pamlico Sound, North Carolina. Waters of Pamlico Sound are closed to fishing with gillnets with a stretched mesh size larger than 4 ¼ inch (10.8 cm) from September 1 through
December 15 each year to protect sea turtles. The closed area includes all inshore waters of Pamlico Sound, and all contiguous tidal waters, south of 35Ε46.3' N, north of 35Ε00' N, and east of 76Ε 30' W. As described above, North Carolina has adopted a number of gillnet requirements to reduce the take and mortality of sea turtles in the inshore gillnet fisheries.  Additional measures to help reduce the impact of takes in the marine environment are described below under Other Efforts to Address Takes in Fisheries.Hook-and-Line Fisheries      A number of requirements are in place in the HMS pelagic longline fishery to reduce bycatch, and impacts resulting from bycatch, of sea turtles. Measures include mandatory circle hook and bait requirement, and mandatory possession and use of sea turtle release and disentanglement gear. Fishermen must also possess and use circle hooks and type-approved equipment designed to safely remove fishing hooks and lines from incidentally captured fisheries (50 CFR §635.21). Additionally, owners and operators of HMS-permitted vessels using pelagic longline, bottom longline, or gillnet gear are required to become trained and certified at a Protected Species Safe Handling, Release, and Identification Workshop. These workshops ensure that fishermen possess the skills and knowledge to correctly identify and handle protected species and to maximize the safe removal of the gear from incidentally captured sea turtles. Fishermen are also required to comply with safe handling and release protocols. The safe removal of fishing gear from sea turtles prior to release is important to their survival.      NMFS has also developed and distributed Northeast Marine Mammal and Sea Turtle Protection Guidelines for Recreational Fishermen and Boaters. NMFS continues to reach out to the recreational community on safe fishing practices to reduce interactions with protected species. Additional measures to help reduce the impact of takes in the marine environment are described below under Other Efforts to Address Takes in Fisheries.Pot/Trap Fisheries      Any agent or employee of NMFS, the USFWS, the U.S. Coast Guard, or any other federal land or water management agency, or any agent or employee of a state agency responsible for fish and wildlife, when acting in the course of his or her official duties, is allowed to take threatened or endangered sea turtles encountered in the marine environment if such taking is necessary to aid a sick, injured, or entangled endangered sea turtle, or dispose of or salvage a dead endangered or threatened sea turtle (50 CFR §223.206(b); 50 CFR 2§22.310). This take exemption extends to NMFS’ STSSN. These measures also help to reduce mortality  of sea turtles caught in fishing gear by allowing responders to aid the animal. Animals may be brought into rehabilitation for treatment.      NMFS Northeast Region established the Northeast Region Sea Turtle Disentanglement Network (STDN) in 2002 in response to the high number of leatherback sea turtles found entangled in pot gear along the U.S. Northeast Atlantic coast. The STDN is considered a component of the larger STSSN program and operates in all states in the region. The STDN responds to entangled sea turtles in order to disentangle and release live animals, thereby reducing serious injury and mortality. In addition, the STDN collects data on live and dead sea turtle entanglement events, providing valuable information for management purposes. The
NMFS Northeast Regional Office oversees the STDN program and manages the STDN database. NMFS has also distributed information to federal lobster permit holders on handling and resuscitation of sea turtles and on the NER STDN Disentanglement Guidelines. Measures  to help reduce the impact of takes in the marine environment are described below under Other Efforts to Address Takes in FisheriesFixed Net Fisheries      NMFS has issued several regulations to help protect sea turtles from entanglement in and impingement on Virginia pound net gear (66 FR 33489, June 22 2001; 67 FR 41196; June 17,2002; 68 FR 41942, July 16, 2003; 69 FR 24997, May 5, 2004). Currently, all offshore pound leaders in Pound Net Regulated Area I, as defined in 50 §CFR 222.102, must meet the definition of a modified pound net leader from May 6 through July 15.  The modified leader has been  found to be effective in reducing sea turtle interactions. Nearshore pound net leaders in Pound Net Regulated Area I and all pound net leaders in Pound Net Regulated Area II must have mesh size less than 12 inches (30.5 cm) stretched mesh and may not employ stringers (50 CFR 223.206) from May 6 through July 15 each year. A pound net leader is exempt from these measures only if it meets the definition of a modified pound net leader. In addition, there are monitoring and reporting requirements in this fishery (50 CFR §223.206). Since the 2010  fishing season, the state of Virginia has required modified pound net leaders (as defined by federal regulations) east of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge year round, and in offshore leaders in Regulated Area I (also as defined by Federal regulations) from May 6 to July 31.      As described above, the STDN responds to entangled sea turtles in order to disentangle and release live animals, thereby reducing serious injury and mortality. In addition, the STDN collects data on live and dead sea turtle entanglement events, providing valuable information for management purposes. The STDN has responded to sea turtles trapped in fishing weirs in Massachusetts, releasing live turtles that were free swimming in the weirs and documenting  dead turtles either entangled or free floating in the weir.Other Efforts to Address Takes in Fisheries      NMFS published as a final rule in the Federal Register (66 FR 67495, December 31, 2001) specifying handling and resuscitation requirements for sea turtles that are incidentally caught during scientific research or fishing activities. Persons participating in fishing activities or scientific research are required to handle and resuscitate (as necessary) sea turtles as prescribed in the regulations (50 CFR §223.206). These measures help to prevent mortality of turtles caught in fishing or scientific research gear.Vessel Strikes      In some cases, NMFS, through section 7 of the ESA, has worked with the USCG in an attempt to reduce the probability of vessel strikes during permitted offshore race events. Most races now require a protected species watch program and aerial surveys are usually required prior to and throughout the event. If sea turtles are located within the designated race area, the event is postponed. However, most vessel strikes occur outside of these venues, and there is growing number of licensed vessels, especially inshore and nearshore. Slow speed zones,
implemented for manatee protection, may provide some benefits to turtles, although this has not been quantified (NMFS and USFWS, 2008). One of the efforts of the STSSN is to respond to  sea turtles with injuries, including those caused by vessel interactions. These animals  are brought into rehabilitation facilities for medical care and eventually released back into the wild once the wounds have healed.Oil and Gas Activities      Various Federal, state, and local entities have spill contingency plans and emergency response teams that could reduce potential impacts from these spills. In addition to the response efforts described above, NMFS has prepared protocols for responding to oiled sea turtles. In the Northeast Region, NMFS is working with the Office of Response and Restoration to develop a regional plan for response to and management of protected species during oil spills and other environmental emergencies. Oil and gas development and exploration in other areas on the  Texas coast where Kemp's ridleys have been documented nesting are regulated by various local, state, and Federal regulations (NMFS, USFWS, and SEMARNAT, 2010).Dredging Operations and Shore Stabilization Activities      Through the ESA section 7 consultation process, measures are implemented to minimize and monitor incidental take of sea turtles. These measures can include seasonal restrictions, observers to monitor entrainment of sea turtles, sea turtle deflectors installed on hopper dredge dragheads, and relocation trawling to relocate sea turtles away from active  dredges. Additionally, the States of Georgia, South Carolina, Florida and the USFWS have implemented seasonal restrictions and other protective conditions to reduce the effects of dredging, beach stabilization and nourishment projects on sea turtles.      During ESA section 7 consultations for beach nourishment projects, FWS places conditions on projects to minimize impacts to sea turtles. Minimization measures include nest relocation to non-project areas when nourishment is conducted during the nesting season, use of beach quality sand, sand compaction and escarpment monitoring and remediation, and management of project lighting.Power Plants      Monitoring procedures have been implemented seasonally, and procedures have been developed to rescue turtles found within intake canals. In 1993, Public Service Electric and Gas implemented a policy of removing the ice barriers from the trash racks on the intake structure at the Salem, New Jersey Nuclear Power Plant during the period between May 1 and October 24, which resulted in substantially lower turtle impingement rates at Salem in subsequent years (U.S. NRC, 2010). Power plant operations are also evaluated through the section 7 consultation process.
9.4.2.6 Summary of Commercial Fishing Interactions Affecting Other Protected Species      As described above, the stocks of other whales, porpoises, dolphins, sea turtles, and seals whose ranges overlap with ALWTRP-regulated fisheries have been and continue to be affected by various anthropogenic risk factors. Exhibit 9-9 summarizes the current major interactions with commercial fisheries for each species, the past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions taken to reduce incidental takes in these fisheries, and the overall effect of these actions.

Reductions in entanglement risk have indirectly resulted from measures such as time/area closures and effort reductions (e.g., days-at-sea allocations, trip limits).3 Sources of mortality differ for each species (i.e., Kemp’s ridleys are not taken in longline fishery).4 No fisheries-related takes of hawksbill sea turtles have been observed in the Northeast or Mid-Atlantic (NMFS, 2003c); likewise, no information exists on takes of olive ridley sea turtles in the Northeast or Mid-Atlantic.
9.4.3 Affected Fisheries      Chapter 4 identifies twelve major fisheries affected by the regulatory alternatives and provides a basic description of each fishery, including current regulations, landings, revenue, number of permitted vessels, and key ports. This section adds a more detailed history of Federal management for each fishery. Each section begins with a summary of available data  on  landings, revenue, and vessel activity in the fishery of interest. This is followed by a chronological discussion of major Federal management actions associated with each fishery, and the circumstances that led to these actions. Each section includes a review of the evolving status of the fishery and a summary of any reasonably foreseeable future actions for that fishery. The information presented in this section is based primarily on fishery management plans prepared  by the National Marine Fisheries Service and fishery management councils, including the New England Fishery Management Council (NEFMC), the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council (MAFMC), the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (SAFMC), and the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC).      In addition to regulations stemming from the MSA, many fisheries are also subject to additional regulations resulting from the protection of the nine species previously mentioned that are protected either by the ESA of 1973 or the MMPA of 1972. Following the management history for each fishery, a final section includes a brief summary of additional regulations, if any, resulting from significant interactions with these protected species.9.4.3.1 American Lobster      The commercial lobster fishery is the one of the most economically important fishery along the Atlantic coast. The ex-vessel value of American lobster landings  totaled approximately $423 million in 2011. More than 2,800 vessels held Federal permits to fish for lobster during the 2009 fishing year (a fishing year extends from May 1 to April 30). These vessels employ a variety of gear, but traps/pots, the use of which is regulated under the ALWTRP, account for the majority of lobster landings.Management History      Management of the lobster fishery by individual states began as early as the 1870s and continued through much of the 1900s. In the early 1970s, the weakness of this fragmented management system became evident, as lobster landings declined and the lobster fishery showed signs of collapse. It was clear that a more coordinated management system was needed, making the lobster fishery one of the first targeted for Federal management. In 1983, the Federal government approved the first Federal lobster fishery management plan (FMP).
      Despite having a Federal FMP, uniform regulation across states remained a problem. For example, although states received the Federal FMP in 1978, some states had still not implemented the FMP’s recommended minimum carapace measures in 1983 when the final FMP was approved. A second shortcoming of the Federal FMP stemmed from its geographic limitation to lobster fishing only in the Exclusive Economic Zone. With approximately 80 percent of lobstering activity occurring in state waters, the Federal FMP objectives of maintaining a sustainable fishery and preventing overfishing could not be effectively achieved without including state waters in the management program. This issue was resolved with the passage of the Atlantic Coastal Fisheries Cooperative Management Act (Atlantic Coastal Act) in 1993. The Atlantic Coastal Act represents a new and innovative approach to coordinated management of fisheries along the Atlantic coast, providing a mechanism to ensure Atlantic coastal state compliance with mandated conservation measures in Commission-approved fishery management plans. This legislation provided the foundation to transfer lobster management  from the federally-oriented New England Fishery Management Council to the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC).      New information on the status of the lobster resource became available through a 1996 stock assessment conducted jointly by state and Federal scientists. The assessment, which represented an analysis of lobster stocks through 1994, concluded the American lobster resource was overfished as a result of a dramatic increase in fishing effort, and declared the resource vulnerable to collapse throughout the range of the species. The panel believed that “the risk of stock collapse would be contained or reduced if the fishing effort were capped or reduced, and legal size increased.” Following this assessment, the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission in 1997 approved Amendment 3 to the Interstate Fishery Management Plan (ISFMP).      Amendment 3 created seven lobster management areas (LMAs) covering U.S. waters from Maine to North Carolina (see Exhibit 4-1). The management measures implemented under Amendment 3 included regulations protecting ovigerous females, trap size restrictions, escape vent size increases, trap tag requirements, and requirements for permits and licensing.  In addition to these requirements, trap limits were implemented for all state and Federal lobster permit holders, reducing the maximum trap allocation over a three year period from 1,200 down to 800 traps per vessel for nearshore management areas (except Long Island Sound), and 1,800 traps per vessel for the offshore management area. These schedules were designed to control fishing effort, end overfishing, and begin the rebuilding of American lobster stocks.      Through Amendment 3, the ASMFC also established seven Lobster Conservation Management Teams (LCMT) charged with the development of management programs for each LMA. During the fall of 1998, the seven LCMTs developed and submitted management proposals for each LMA to the Commission’s American Lobster Management Board (Board). The Board subsequently approved the proposals for incorporation into Amendment 3 in two phases:• Addendum I (adopted in 1999): Addendum I incorporated recommendations from LCMT proposals directed at effort control, including the establishment of trap limits for LMAs 3, 4, 5, and 6 based on historical participation levels.
• Addendum II (adopted in 2001): Addendum II incorporated recommendations from LCMT proposals directed at rebuilding lobster egg production levels. In addition, Addendum II detailed a trap reduction schedule for LMA 3, scheduled to take place over four years.38      Despite the warning articulated in the 1996 stock assessment and the new regulations implemented under Amendment 3 and Addenda 1 and 2, lobster landings continued to increase throughout the 1990s. Since 2007, lobster landings have increased (Exhibit 9-10). At the same time as scientific advice suggested that the lobster fishery was overfished, lobster landings achieved record levels.      The Commission initiated an updated stock assessment in 1999 in an effort to clarify the biological assessment of the lobster resource. The updated stock assessment, completed in  March 2000, supported previous assessments of the vulnerability of the lobster resource as a result of increasing levels of fishing effort throughout the species range. In addition, the 2000 stock assessment declared the lobster resource “growth” overfished, according to the overfishing definition provided in the 1997 ISFMP.39 Growth overfishing describes a fishery in which the maximum yield is not being produced because of high fishing mortality effects on smaller lobsters. Recruitment overfishing, in contrast, describes a fishery in which the number of new lobsters available to the fishery each year is reduced by high fishing mortality rates. The 2000 stock assessment concluded that the lobster resource did not exhibit signs of recruitment overfishing, a condition believed to be much more serious and a precursor to stock depletion and stock collapse.           38 Each LMA 3 trap allocation of greater than 1,200 traps will be reduced on the basis of a sliding scale. Trap allocations in such cases will not go below a baseline of 1,200 traps. LMA 3 trap allocations of less than 1,200 traps will remain at their initial qualifying level and will not be permitted to increase. For more detailed  information, see Addendum II to Amendment 3 to the Interstate Fishery Management Plan, available at http://www. asmfc.org/americanLobster.htm.           39 For assessment purposes, the lobster population is split into three regions: Gulf of Maine (GOM), Georges Bank and South (GBS), and South of Cape Cod to Long Island Sound (SCCLIS). The quality and quantity of data do not currently permit the lobster population to be assessed at a greater level of detail.
      The Board initiated development of Addendum III in August 2001. Addendum III incorporated new measures designed to meet the recommended F10% outlined in the updated stock assessment by 2008.40 Measures implemented include minimum and maximum gauge  sizes and mandatory v-notching in LMAs 1 and 3.      In 1999, a mass mortality incident in the Long Island Sound area brought new challenges to the management of the lobster fishery. Beginning in October 1999, a number of fishing operations in the Western Long Island Sound area reported hauling traps containing an unusual number of dead or lethargic American lobsters. Reports of similar incidents increased in number and geographic scope into November and December, until roughly 60 percent of the Sound was reporting mass lobster mortality events. On January 26, 2000, the U.S. Secretary of Commerce declared the Long Island Sound (LIS) lobster die-off a fishery resource disaster. Following this declaration, the U.S. Congress approved a $13.9 million emergency appropriation to address the biological and economic consequences of the fishery disaster. Using this emergency appropriation, NMFS allocated $7.3 million for the economic relief of LIS fishermen and communities dependent on the LIS lobster fishery. The remaining $6.6 million was used to establish a comprehensive research effort into the possible causes of the mass mortality event in the LIS area.      Since 1999, lobster landings in New York, Connecticut, and Rhode Island have fallen significantly, from approximately 17 million pounds in 1998 and 1999 to 7 million pounds in 2002. In February 2003, the ASMFC took emergency action to increase  the minimum gauge  size for lobsters in LMA 2 on an accelerated time scale and initiated action to rebuild the lobster stock in Area 2 through the development of Addendum IV. Addendum IV was approved in December 2003.      The primary measures outlined in Addendum IV for LMA 2 established a multi-state effort control program for LMA 2, including a limited entry program and individual trap limits based on historic participation, a prohibition on the issuance of new LMA 2 permits, a conservation tax for all trap transfers, and new minimum gauge sizes.      Addendum IV also incorporated an accelerated trap reduction program and a transferable trap program for Area 3. This program allows Area 3 lobster fishermen to transfer traps to other lobster fishermen. Along with other measures, the LMA 3 transferability program established an overall trap cap of 2,600 traps in LMA 3 and a two-tiered conservation tax (10 percent or 50 percent) on the purchase of transferable traps, with the higher conservation tax applied for transferring traps when the purchaser owned more than 2,100 traps.      Addendum V, approved by the ASMFC in March 2004, amended the overall trap cap for LMA 3 set by Addendum IV based on comments gathered at public hearings expressing concern that the overall trap cap of 2,600 may be too high. Addendum V includes an LMA 3 overall trap cap of 2,200 traps, with the higher conservation tax imposed when the purchaser owns more than 1,800 traps.           40 F10% is the fishing mortality rate that will keep the spawning stock biomass at a level that will produce 10% of the eggs that a non-fished population would produce.
      Addendum VI, approved by the ASMFC in February 2005, replaces two of the LMA 2 effort control measures of Addendum IV: permits and the historic participation eligibility period. No new LMA 2 permits will be distributed after December 31, 2003. In addition, to qualify for an LMA 2 permit endorsement, a permit holder must document landings between January 1, 1999 and December 31, 2003.      Addendum VI also suspended implementation of a previously approved effort control plan for Area 2 specified in Addendum IV. Prior to implementation of the LMA 2 effort control plan, it became apparent that the plan was ineffective at controlling trap growth over current levels. The specific problems identified in the plan were two-fold: the aggregate allocations  were too liberal – far beyond the recent levels fished – and the individual trap allocation criteria were considered arbitrary. In early 2005, the ASMFC began the development of Addendum VII. The ASMFC directed all jurisdictions with LMA 2 permit holders to work with the LMA 2 industry to modify components of the effort control plan so that all jurisdictions will be capable of implementing the plan specifics and to ensure that it will not allow effort to increase if and when the resource recovers in LMA 2.      Addendum VII, approved by the ASMFC in November 2005, established a multi-state effort control program for LMA 2 to cap effort (traps fished) at recent levels (2001-2003) and allow adjustments in traps based on future stock conditions. The current LMA 2 plan attempts to capture the attrition from the fishery caused by the stock decline, thereby preventing a return of overall fishing levels to the historic highs of the late 1990s. The addendum also rescinded the LMA 2 minimum gauge increases approved in Addendum IV.      Based on recommendations from a peer-reviewed stock assessment in January 2006, the ASMFC approved Addendum VIII in May 2006. Addendum VIII establishes new biological reference points to determine the stock status of the American lobster resource. This addendum also expands the mandatory coast-wide monitoring and reporting requirements of the Interstate FMP to improve the ability of scientists and managers to assess and manage the lobster fishery.      The ASMFC approved Addendum IX in October 2006. Addendum IX establishes a conservation "tax" on a program that permits the transfer of trap allocations between holders of LMA 2 permits. The tax imposes a 10 percent passive reduction in traps on each transfer event. Thus, for every 100 trap tags transferred, 10 will be retired, and the overall cap on traps in LMA 2 will be reduced accordingly.      The ASMFC approved Addendum X in February 2007. Addendum X establishes consistent monitoring and reporting criteria for the lobster fishery and is designed to improve understanding of the productivity of the lobster resource. Beginning January 1, 2008, it will require reporting on landings by all lobster dealers, as well as reporting on landings and vessel activity by a minimum of 10 percent of active harvesters, with the expectation that, in time, 100 percent of license holders will report.      Addendum XI, approved in May 2007, established a time frame for rebuilding the Southern New England (SNE) lobster stock, as well as setting management measures for Lobster Conservation Management Areas 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The addendum also creates a species-specific
mechanism of ensuring that a state meets its obligations under the plan in a way that minimizes the probability that a state's delay in complying does not adversely affect other states' fisheries or conservation of the resource.      Amendment 3 to the FMP for American Lobster established limited entry controls on fishing effort in all LMAs except LMA 1. Each permit holder may fish in each LMA based on rules regarding their permit’s fishing history. Transferability programs were developed under Amendment 3 as well. Addendum XII, approved in February 2009, addresses issues that arise when fishing privileges are transferred, either when whole businesses are transferred, when dual state/Federal permits are split, or when individual trap allocations are transferred as part of a trap allocation transferability program.      Addendum XIII, approved in May 2008, repealed the 2008 deadline to meet the goal of reducing by 20% the number of traps allowed to be fished as mandated under Addendum III. Addendum III mandated a 20% reduction from 1998 levels of traps fished in the Outer Cape LMA to help meet lobster egg production goals and objectives.      Addendum XIV, approved in May 2009, lowered the trap transfer cap from 2,200 to 2,000 traps. It was thought that given the competitive nature of the fishery in LMA 3, it is expected that once transferability is implemented, all fishing entities will elect to fish the highest number of traps to remain competitive. This could lead many who have never fished a larger allocation to buy up to the trap cap of 2,200 traps (under the previous regulation). There were concerns for increased costs and overhead and consolidation in a fishery where only a certain number of traps are allocated. The LCMT recommended that the Board lower the trap cap to address these concerns. The trend of the management process has been to fish fewer traps, and the LCMT considered this a positive move toward the future. This Addendum lowers the trap transfer cap from 2,200 to 2,000 traps.      Approved in November 2009, Addendum XV maintains the historic level of trap fishing effort and curtails a potential influx of new Federal lobster vessels in the LMA 1 EEZ fishery. The addendum limits entry of vessels which have not fished with traps in Area 1 in the past from fishing in Area 1 with traps in the future.      The procedures for adopting and implementing new reference points in each of the three lobster stocks was approved in May 2010 via Addendum XVI.      Addendum XVII, approved on Feb 7, 2012, established area specific management measures for LMAs 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 as the first step in initiating Southern New England (SNE) stock rebuilding. The measures are intended to reduce fishing exploitation on the SNE stock by 10% starting in July 2013 in response to the stock’s depleted condition, which has been at low levels of abundance and experiencing persistent low recruitment since 2002.      Addendum XVIII, approved on August 9, 2012, establishes a consolidation program for LMA 2 and 3 to address latent effort by reducing the overall number of traps allocated. It is estimated that latent effort is 40% and 30% in LMAs 2 and 3, respectively. Implementation of the Addendum’s measures is contingent upon NMFS implementation of transferability and trap reduction rules for Federal waters.
A few addendums have been passed since the DEIS published including:• Addendum XVIX, approved on February 19, 2013 modified the conservation tax in LMA 3.• Addendum XX, approved in May 2013, established an agreement between the offshore lobster fishery and sector trawl fishermen for bottom-sharing in Closed Area 2 in order to protect large concentrations of egg-bearing females and prevent gear conflicts.• Addendum XXI, approved in August 2013, Addendum XXII, approved in October 2013, proposed to scale the SNE fishery to the diminished size of the resource with an initial goal of reducing qualified trap allocation by at least 25 % over a five to ten year period of time.Regulations to Reduce Incidental Takes of Protected SpeciesThe lobster trap/pot fishery in the Gulf of Maine and Mid-Atlantic is listed as a Category I fishery due to interactions with marine mammals, particularly the endangered North Atlantic right whale. The lobster fishery was regulated under the first ALWTRP, which went into effect in 1997 as an Interim Final Rule (62 FR 39157). The regulations contained in this rule were updated in February 1999, and again in December of 2000.  In January 2002, NMFS modified the ALWTRP and published three rules that (1) mandate further modifications to commercial fishing gear; (2) establish a system for restricting fishing in areas where unexpected aggregations of right whales are observed; and (3) establish restricted areas based on annual, predictable aggregations of right whales. In October 2007, NMFS issued a final rule implementing broad- based gear modifications. This broad-based gear modification strategy included expanded weak link and sinking groundline requirements; additional gear marking requirements; changes in boundaries; seasonal restrictions for gear modifications; expanded exempted areas; and regulatory language changes for the purposes of clarification and consistency. This final rule was extended and clarified in September 2008 . The action considered here will represent the sixth modification of regulations under the ALWTRP for the lobster fishery.      In addition to regulations implemented under the ALWTRP, it is possible that the lobster fishery will be made subject to future regulations promulgated under the Strategy for Sea Turtle Conservation and Recovery in Relation to Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico Fisheries (Sea Turtle Strategy). In June 2001, NMFS released a strategic plan to address the incidental capture of endangered or threatened sea turtle species in state and Federal fisheries in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, including Kemp’s ridley, loggerhead, and leatherback sea turtles. The general strategy is to address sea turtle bycatch by gear type. Based on species distribution and foraging patterns, Kemp’s ridley sea turtles are not likely to interact with lobster gear. In contrast, loggerhead and leatherback turtles have been known to become entangled in lobster trap/pot gear; however, the level of observed take is not expected to appreciably reduce the likelihood of both the survival and recovery of either sea turtle species (NMFS, 2001a).9.4.3.2 Northeast Multispecies      Commercial fishing vessels landed a total of 81.5 million pounds in the multispecies groundfish fishery in the Northeastern U.S. in 2011. Of the total landings, 8.9 million pounds (ten percent) were caught using gear that is potentially subject to the requirements of the ALWTRP. Approximately 13 percent of the fishery’s $102.1 million revenue is attributable to
fish caught with ALWTRP-regulated gear. In 2011, about 204 vessels (6.7 percent) held Northeast multispecies permits that indicated ALWTRP-regulated gear (gillnets, pots/traps) as the primary gear type.Management History      The Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management Plan (Groundfish FMP) governs commercial fishing in New England and Mid-Atlantic waters for fifteen species (and 24 stocks) of demersal fish. These species are grouped together under one FMP and managed by the New England Fishery Management Council (the Council) because the fish share common habitats and are often caught at the same time. For a complete description of these species, see Chapter 4.      During the late 1980s, a dramatic increase in the number and size of fishing vessels, deployment of bigger gear, and the development of electronic aids such as fishfinders and navigation equipment contributed to greater efficiencies and intensity in the groundfish fishery. The result was a precipitous drop in landings during the 1980s and a complete collapse of the fishery in the early 1990s, when annual landings reached the lowest levels ever recorded.      Initial Federal efforts at managing the groundfish fishery included annual and quarterly catch quotas for cod, haddock and yellowtail flounder; quota allocations by vessel class; and trip limits. The quota and trip limits imposed during the inception of the Groundfish FMP led to frequent fishery closures affecting one or more segments of the fishing fleet. This form of management frequently imposed economic hardship on the industry, thereby eroding support for the management measures. This in turn led to widespread misreporting and non-reporting by the industry as a way to circumvent the regulations.      Starting in the early 1980s, a new management program was implemented through the 1982 Interim Fishery Management Plan. This plan, and the next several groundfish actions (through Amendment 4 in 1991) managed the groundfish fishery (now expanded to include 13 species) primarily through seasonal closures and minimum mesh and fish size restrictions. These measures, however, proved inadequate, as the condition of the resources, especially cod, haddock and yellowtail flounder, continued to decline to record low levels.      To end overfishing and address the severe decline in the groundfish resource as well as the continuing influx of more and larger vessels to the fishery, the Council developed Amendment 5 to the FMP. This action, which became effective in 1994, implemented a moratorium on permits as well as an effort-control program that reduced a vessel’s days-at-sea allocation by 50 percent over a five- to seven-year period. Amendment 5 became the first action to restrict both access and effort in the groundfish fishery. The FSEIS for Amendment 5 determined that this action might have significant effects on a substantial number of small entities, specifically those vessels less than 45 feet, which, at the time, accounted for 36 percent of the qualified vessels.      Despite the severity of the measures implemented in Amendment 5, stocks continued to decline and a “Special Advisory” was issued by the Northeast Fisheries Science Center in 1994 stating that Amendment 5 was “too little too late.” In December 1994, NMFS implemented an
emergency action to close, on a year-round basis, three large areas (Closed Area I, Closed Area II, and the Nantucket Lightship Closed Area) to all vessels capable of catching groundfish while the Council developed a new plan, Amendment 7 to the Groundfish FMP.      Framework 9, implemented in 1995, extended the 1994 emergency action permanently. In addition, Framework 9 also prohibited all small mesh fisheries in the Gulf of Maine, Georges Bank, and Southern New England Regulated Mesh Areas, unless it could be determined that the fishery had a bycatch rate of less than five percent for regulated groundfish species.      Amendment 7, implemented in 1996, represented the most comprehensive program in a ten-year long sequence of management actions designed to rebuild and manage the Northeast multispecies fishery. Building on the management system implemented in Amendment 5, Amendment 7 implemented controls on the number and size of vessels that may fish for regulated multispecies, accelerated the Amendment 5 days-at-sea (DAS) effort-reduction schedule, and placed new restrictions on the size of the fish that can be caught. In addition, Amendment 7 expanded the five percent bycatch rule established in Framework 9 to include a prohibition on all non-DAS fisheries, further reducing the bycatch of groundfish regulated species. These actions have had a positive impact on the status of several species of groundfish, especially in the Georges Bank area, and landings have increased as a result. Similar to Amendment 5, the FSEIS for Amendment 7 concluded that the proposed action would have significant impacts on a substantial number of small entities in the short term. Projected reductions in overall revenues ranged from ten to 25 percent in the first three years.      Following Amendments 7 and 9, NMFS has approved several framework adjustments implementing further restrictions on the groundfish fishery. Frameworks 20, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, 31, and 33 all implemented additional management measures to protect, in particular, the Gulf of Maine cod stock. These measures included new Gulf of Maine seasonal and year-round  closures, gillnet effort-reduction measures (including limits on the number of allowable nets), and adjustments of the Gulf of Maine cod trip limits.      In August 2002, NMFS implemented interim management measures as a result of the Federal Court decision in the case of Conservation Law Foundation, et al. V. Evans, et al. The suit alleged that Framework Adjustment 33 violated the overfishing, rebuilding, and bycatch provisions of the MSA and Amendment 9 to the Fishery Management Plan by approving groundfish catch levels that were too high and risked further depletion of groundfish populations. On March 1, 2002, NMFS submitted to the Court a proposed remedy to bring the FMP into full compliance with the SFA, the Magnuson-Stevens Act and all other applicable law as quickly as possible. The Settlement Agreement provides protection to the Northeast multispecies fishery while NMFS, the Council, and the public develop long-term measures to comply with the SFA and other applicable laws. Significant new management measures implemented under the 2002 interim final rule include:• a freeze of DAS at the highest annual level used during fishing year 1996- 2000 and a 20 percent reduction from that level;• increased gear restrictions for certain gear types;
• modifications and additions to the closed areas; and• limits on yellowtail flounder catch.      Following implementation of the interim final rule, NMFS published two emergency actions that extended the interim final rule until the final rule implementing Amendment 13 took effect on May 1, 2004 (see below).Amendment 13      On January 29, 2004, NMFS published proposed regulations to implement measures included in Amendment 13 to the Northeast Multispecies FMP, the final phase of the Settlement Agreement described above. The principal objectives of the amendment include rebuilding overfished stocks, ending overfishing, reducing bycatch, and minimizing the impact of the fishery on fish habitat and protected species. The public comment period for this rule ended on February 27, 2004 (69 FR 4362). Full implementation of the final rule for Amendment 13occurred on May 1, 2004.      At the heart of Amendment 13 are the proposed rebuilding programs for overfished stocks of the groundfish fishery. Amendment 13 relies on DAS allocations (the time available to be fished) to reduce fishing mortality to targeted levels.      Under Amendment 13, a vessel’s DAS allocation is first divided into two classes: used DAS, referred to as “effective effort,” and unused DAS. A vessel’s level of “effective effort” is calculated as the maximum DAS used by that vessel in any single fishing year from qualifying fishing years 1996 through 2001. Qualifying years include only those in which the vessel landed a total of 5,000 pounds or more of regulated groundfish species. Unused DAS is equal to the difference between a vessel’s Amendment 7 DAS allocation and a vessel’s level of “effective effort.” Since the implementation of the DAS mechanism in Amendment 5, a large portion of  the total number of allocated DAS were not used. Such unused DAS is known as “latent effort” and represents potential future fishing effort. Amendment 13 takes actions to reduce unused DAS to ensure that gains made in rebuilding overfished stocks are not lost as a result of the future use of unused DAS. Once effective effort is calculated, a vessel’s Amendment 13 DAS is divided into three categories:• Category A  effective DAS available for use;• Category B  effective DAS that can only be used to target “healthy” groundfish stocks identified by NMFS; and• Category C  latent (unused) DAS, equal to the difference between a vessel’s Amendment 7 DAS allocation and its number of effective DAS.      Upon implementation of Amendment 13, all Category B and C DAS were placed in a reserve account for each vessel. Category A DAS are available to fish for any groundfish
species. In fishing years 2004 and 2005, the DAS allocation was limited to 60 percent of effective effort, or 60 percent of the total Category A DAS allocation. Under the terms of Amendment 13, Category B DAS may only be used to target “healthy stocks” as designated by the Council. As rebuilding occurs, the ratio of Category A to Category B DAS may be adjusted, and Category C DAS may be allowed back into the fishery subject to a conservation tax.      In fishing years 2006 through 2008, Category A DAS will be further limited to 55 percent of effective effort, and in 2009, Category A DAS will be limited to 45 percent of effective effort. These default measures may be adjusted based on stock conditions.      The limits on Category A DAS reduced the number of DAS that can be fished on any stock from about 71,000 in fishing year 2003 to about 41,000 in fishing year 2004, a reduction of approximately 42 percent. Actual use in 2003 was 42,118 DAS, and actual use in fishing year 2004 was 32,973 DAS.      In addition to the changes in DAS allocations, Amendment 13 included the following significant measures:• Continuing the current year-round closures in Closed Area I, Closed Area II, the Western Gulf of Maine, Cashes Ledge, and Nantucket Lightship Closed Areas, along with rolling closures;• Implementing additional areas closed to bottom tending mobile gear to protect EFH;• Increasing the Gulf of Maine cod trip limit;• Decreasing the Georges Bank cod trip limit;• Modifying seasonal yellowtail flounder trip limits;• Continuing gear restrictions implemented in August 2002 with some modifications. Gear restrictions implemented under Amendment 13 included an increase in mesh size for trawl and gillnet gear, a reduction in the number of gillnets that can be fished, and a removal of the restriction on the number of trip gillnets in the Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank; and• Continuing commercial minimum fish sizes implemented in August 2002, when the cod minimum size was increased.      On May 1, 2006, NMFS implemented an Emergency Interim Final Rule to further reduce the fishing mortality rate for specific groundfish species, prevent overfishing, and maintain the rebuilding program of the FMP (71 FR 19348). The emergency action included differential DAS counting and reduced trip limits for specific species, among other provisions. In addition, the action continued two programs that would have expired on April 30, 2006: the DAS Leasing Program and a modified Regular B DAS Program on Georges Bank. These changes were largely made permanent through Framework Adjustment 42, implemented November 22, 2006 (71 FR
62156). Principally, Framework 42 focuses on two measures:  (1) stricter trip limits on species  of flounder, white hake, and Gulf of Maine cod; and (2) a system of differential DAS counting for gillnet vessels. Under the differential counting system, one DAS counts as two for inshore areas in the Gulf of Maine and the offshore areas of Southern New England and the Mid- Atlantic. Other measures implemented under Framework 42 include:• Continuation of the DAS leasing program;• Continuation of the Regular B DAS Program (expanded to include all areas, not just Georges Bank);• Mandatory use of Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS) for all groundfish vessels; and• Approval of the Fixed Gear Sector on Georges Bank.   Amendment 16 was implemented on May 1, 2010. The action provides a broad range of measures to target healthy stocks, mitigate the economic impacts of the measures, and improve administration of the fishery. The measures include:• Development of Annual Catch Limits and Accountability Measures;• Implementation of additional sectors for the commercial fishery;• Reductions in DAS allocations and changes to DAS counting methods to achieve fishing mortality targets;• Addition of Atlantic wolfish to the management unit of the FMP;• An allocation of certain groundfish stocks between the commercial and recreational fisheries;• Revisions to mortality targets to achieve rebuilding based on the recent stock assessments. Formal rebuilding programs are proposed for witch flounder, GB winter flounder, pollock, and Atlantic wolfish;• An increase in the minimum size of Atlantic halibut to 41 inches in order to match the median length at maturity for female haddock in the Gulf of Maine;• Certain changes to special management programs are proposed in this amendment. Category B DAS would no longer be able to be used to target pollock. The CAI Hook Gear Haddock SAP would have an extended season and expanded area. The Eastern U.S./Canada Haddock SAP would be reauthorized indefinitely, with the additional rule that trawl gear fishing in the SAP can use codends with a minimum mesh size of six inch square or diamond mesh. The CAII Yellowtail Flounder SAP would be modified to allow targeting of GB haddock even when the area is not open for targeting yellowtail flounder. Finally, the SNE/MA Winter Flounder SAP would be suspended until stock conditions would warrant its re-implementation; and• Not listed here are additional changes to improve administration of the fishery.   Following Amendment 16 was implementation of Framework 44 (effective May 2010) which included the following measures:
• Revision of the Gulf of Maine cod and pollock trip limits implemented in Amendment 16 and implementation of a Georges Bank yellowtail flounder trip limit of 2,500 lb;• Regional Administrator authority to implement inseason trip limits and/or differential DAS counting for any groundfish stock in order to prevent catch from exceeding the ACL;• Specification of overfishing levels, acceptable biological catch levels, and ACLs for all20 groundfish stocks in the FMP for FY 2010 through 2012, as well as the Total Allowable Catches (TACs) for stocks managed by the U.S./Canada Resource Sharing Understanding;• Allocation of zero trips to the Closed Area II Yellowtail Flounder SAP for 2010;• Restriction of common pool vessels to using Category A DAS in the Eastern U.S./Canada Haddock SAP;• Delayed the opening of the Eastern U.S./Canada Area for trawl vessels until August 1; and• Technical corrections to Amendment 16 regulations.A sector rule was implemented to specify management of fishery sectors as provided for in Amendment 16. The sector rule includes the following measures:• Approval of the sector operations plans and contracts from the Northeast Fishery Sectors II through XIII, the Sustainable Harvest Sector, the Tri-State Sector, the Northeast Coastal Communities Sector, the Georges Bank Cod Fixed Gear Sector, and the Port Clyde Community Groundfish Sector; and• Allocation of annual catch entitlement of certain NE multispecies stocks to each of the approved sectors based on the cumulative landing histories of participating vessels.   Framework Adjustment 45, implemented in May 2011, revised the biological reference points and stock status for pollock, updated ACLs for several stocks for FYs 2011–2012, adjusted the rebuilding program for Georges Bank (GB) yellowtail flounder, increased scallop vessel access to the Great South Channel Exemption Area, approved five new sectors, modified the existing dockside and at-sea monitoring requirements, revised several sector administrative provisions, established a Gulf of Maine (GOM) Cod Spawning Protection Area, refined measures affecting the operations of NE multispecies vessels fishing with handgear, and approved the FY 2011 U.S./Canada Management Area total allowable catches (TACs).   Framework Adjustment 46, which became effective September 14, 2011, was developed to address haddock catch in the Atlantic herring fishery. The rule increases the haddock incidental catch cap allocated to the Atlantic midwater trawl herring fishery to 1% of the GB haddock ABC and to 1% of the GOM haddock ABC. In addition, this action would modify the cap AMs applicable to the Atlantic herring fishery such that, upon reaching the haddock incidental catch cap, the midwater trawl herring fleet could not catch or land herring in excess of the incidental catch limit (2,000 lb/907.2 kg) in or from the appropriate haddock stock area. This action is intended to allow the herring fishery to fully use available herring quota, while providing incentives for the midwater trawl fishery to minimize haddock bycatch.
   The New England Fishery Management Council (NEFMC) finalized the development of Framework Adjustment 47 to the NE Multispecies FMP, which became effective in March 2012. This action revised the status determination criteria for three winter flounder stocks and Gulf of Maine cod; 2) revised the Georges Bank (GB) yellowtail flounder rebuilding strategy; 3) changed the administration of the scallop fishery yellowtail flounder annual catch limits (ACLs);4) adopted acceptable biological catches and ACLs for FY 2012 – 2014 for 10 stocks; 5) removed the cap that limits scallop vessel catch of yellowtail flounder in the GB access areas; 6) eliminated the restricted gear areas for common pool vessels adopted in Amendment 16; 7) adopted a zero-possession proactive accountability measure (AM) for Southern New England/Mid-Atlantic winter flounder and Atlantic wolfish; 8) adopted area-based AMs for both windowpane flounder stocks and ocean pout; and 9) prohibited possession of Atlantic halibut if the ACL is exceeded.   NMFS is undertaking a Secretarial Amendment to the NE Multispecies FMP to implement ACLs and AMs for the small-mesh multispecies fishery before the statutory deadline in the Magnuson-Stevens Act (by the end of fishing year 2011). The Secretarial Amendment only will establish ACLs and AMs, and is not expected to modify any of the management measures, including the exemption programs and trip limits. The Secretarial Amendment is intended to implement a subset of the NEFMC’s ACL amendment’s alternatives. It is expected that the NEFMC’s amendment (Amendment 19) to implement ACLs and AMs will replace the measures in the Secretarial Amendment, if approved.   The NEFMC is also currently in the early stages of developing Amendment 18, which is expected to be implemented in May 2014. This action would address concerns related to preventing excessive control or ownership of fishing privileges (e.g., vessels, fishing permits, DAS, fishing quotas, potential sector contributions, ACE, sector allocations), maintaining the diversity of the fleet, addressing impacts of market forces on a highly regulated industry, and maintaining fishery infrastructure and fishing ports throughout New England.   The NEFMC recently implemented Amendment 19 to bring the small-mesh fishery into compliance with the Magnuson-Stevens Act’s requirements for ACLs and AMs. The Final Rule published in April 2013 and will be effective in May 2013. Amendment 19 would modify some of the management measures, including trip limits. This action also established a wider-range of AMs, such as incidental trip limit triggers. The action will not include a limited access program for the small-mesh fishery. Other NE Multispecies FMP actions, including Framework 48, may ease restrictions on accessing previously closed areas. However, potential marine mammal impacts are considered on a case-by-case and overall fishing effort is unlikely to increase in  these areas.Regulations to Reduce Incidental Takes of Protected Species      Of the gear types typically used to catch multispecies finfish, sink gillnets have resulted in the greatest number of listed cetacean takes. Data indicate that gillnet gear has seriously injured right, humpback and fin whales by hampering mobility and feeding, causing chafing injuries, or by drowning. As a result, the Northeast (multispecies) sink gillnet fishery and the Mid-Atlantic coastal gillnet fishery are both listed as Category I fisheries.
      The Northeast multispecies fishery was regulated under the first ALWTRP, which went into effect in 1997 as an Interim Final Rule (62 FR 39157). The regulations contained in this  rule were updated in February 1999 and again in December of 2000. In January 2002, NMFS modified the ALWTRP and published three rules that (1) mandate further modifications to commercial fishing gear; (2) establish a system for restricting fishing in areas where unexpected aggregations of right whales are observed; and (3) establish restricted areas based on annual, predictable aggregations of right whales. In October 2007, NMFS issued a final rule implementing broad-based gear modifications. This broad-based gear modification strategy included expanded weak link and sinking groundline requirements; additional gear marking requirements; changes in boundaries; seasonal restrictions for gear modifications; expanded exempted areas; and regulatory language changes for the purposes of clarification and consistency. This final rule was extended and clarified in September 2008. The action  considered here will represent the sixth modification of regulations under the ALWTRP for the Northeast multispecies fishery.      The Harbor Porpoise Take Reduction Plan (HPTRP) prohibits the setting of gillnets in certain areas for selected time periods. This includes a prohibition on the use of large mesh gillnet gear west of 72Ε30' in southern Mid-Atlantic waters (Maryland, Delaware, Virginia and North Carolina) from February 15 through March 15. Although the prohibition is meant to prevent harbor porpoise takes in gillnet gear, it should also be of benefit to sea turtles by reducing gillnet effort off of North Carolina during this time period, when sea turtles are present.9.4.3.3 Monkfish      Roughly 10.6 million pounds of monkfish were landed in the Northeastern U.S. in 2011. Gillnets or trawls were used to catch the greatest percentage of monkfish, 62 percent and 19 percent. The ex-vessel value of monkfish landings in the Northeast totaled approximately $26.2 million in 2011. During 2011, a total of 479 vessels (approximately 18.9 percent of all monkfish vessels) held permits that indicated ALWTRP-regulated gear as their primary gear.Management History      Significant commercial landings of monkfish were not recorded until the late 1970s to 1980s, when they averaged four thousand metric tons per year. Landings doubled from these levels in the late 1980s to approximately 10,000 metric tons, then increased dramatically throughout the 1990s, with annual landings reported at over 26,000 metric tons from 1995 to 1997.41 The correlation between landings and price per pound was even stronger in  the  emerging market for monkfish livers. Between 1982 and 1995, annual monkfish liver landings rose from 0.02 to 1.10 million pounds as the monkfish liver price jumped from $1.00 to $5.00 per pound.      The status of the monkfish resource was re-assessed by the 23rd Stock Assessment Workshop (1997). This assessment concluded, “[t]he stock [was] at low levels of biomass and41 Most landings (80 percent) come from incidental catch in the groundfish and scallop fisheries.
[was] over-exploited.” The report highlighted the continuing trend of fewer large fish that had been observed in recent trawl surveys and in the commercial catch. It also highlighted the  decline in the calculated egg production level, which it attributed to a decline in the number of large fish in the population. Based on this evidence, it was recommended that the Council take measures to reduce fishing mortality throughout the species’ range and prevent any redirection of displaced effort from other fisheries, which would diminish the prospects of rebuilding the stock. Under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976, the results of the 1997 stock assessment required the Council to prepare and submit an FMP by September 30, 1998, that would stop overfishing and rebuild the monkfish stock within ten years or less.      To meet the requirements of the MSA, the Council developed an FMP to stop overfishing within four years of implementation (2002) and promote rebuilding to the biomass targets within ten years (2009). The final Monkfish FMP (64 FR 54732), effective in November 1999, relies primarily on the implementation of a series of annual days-at-sea allocations over four years to reach these objectives. The plan allocates 40 days-at-sea to all vessels that qualify for a limited access permit in Years 1, 2, and 3 (1999-2001).  Unless these allocations and other restrictions  on size limits and bycatch stop overfishing and achieve the annual rebuilding mortality rates, no days-at-sea will be allocated in Year 4 (2002) or subsequent years of the FMP. To control the level of effort, the management program also applies trip limits to all monkfish days-at-sea.      The Council’s Monkfish Monitoring Committee (MMC) conducted a review of the status of the fishery during Year 3 of the FMP. The MMC review process began in Fall 2001, utilizing the most recent stock assessment results, landings data, and resource survey data to evaluate the status of the fishery. The MMC concluded that the condition of the monkfish resource was improving, and recommended that the Council develop a framework action to extend for one year the existing 40 DAS management measures (Framework 1 to the Monkfish FMP).  However, NMFS rejected Framework 1 because it did not comply with the fishing mortality rate threshold specified in the original plan. In order to take into account the improved status of the fishery, NMFS issued an emergency action to amend the Monkfish FMP, incorporate the results of the most recent stock assessments, and extend the 40 DAS measures as recommended by the MMC. NMFS approved this emergency rule in May 2002, which allowed the fishery to reopen for the remainder of the 2002 fishing year (i.e., through April 30, 2003). In the 2003 fishing  year, the DAS limit remained at 40.      Amendment 2 to the Monkfish FMP incorporated updated scientific information into monkfish overfishing definitions, rebuilding targets, and management measures designed to rebuild stocks to maximum sustainable levels by 2009. Amendment 2 also reduced the overall complexity of the FMP; updated related environmental impact documents; considered modifications to the limited entry program for vessels fishing south of the North Carolina/Virginia border; and updated the plan's Essential Fish Habitat components. The final rule implementing Amendment 2 was published on April 28, 2005 (70 FR 21927) and took effect on May 1, 2005. In accordance with Amendment 2, the target TAC for FY 2006 was set at 7,737 metric tons for the Northern Fishery Management Area (NFMA), and 3,667 metric tons for the Southern Fishery Management Area (SFMA). This action also adjusted trip limits and restricted use of DAS for vessels fishing in the SFMA. The trip limits for the SFMA were reduced to 550 pounds (tail weight) per DAS for limited access Category A, C, and G vessels, and 450 pounds
(tail  weight)  per  DAS  for  limited  access  Category  B,  D,  and H vessels.	DAS usage was restricted to 12 monkfish DAS, plus carryover, for vessels fishing in the SFMA.      The 2006 NEFMC Monkfish Stock Assessment and Fishery Evaluation (SAFE) Report reviewed the status of the monkfish resource and found that monkfish are overfished in both the northern and southern areas (NEFMC/MAFMC, 2006). In part as a response to this finding, the NEFMC in October 2006 enacted Framework 3 of the Monkfish FMP (71 FR 19348), establishing maximum incidental catch levels for monkfish while fishing for northeast groundfish. Effectively, this action prohibited vessels from using B-days (as defined in the Northeast Multispecies FMP) to catch monkfish with no limit. In addition, in 2007, the NEFMC took final action on Framework 4 of the Monkfish FMP. Framework 4 contains a revised  method for establishing TACs, and uses this method to establish target TACs of 5,000 metric tons and 5,100 metric tons for the NFMA and SFMA, respectively, for the final three years of the rebuilding plan (FY 2007-FY 2009), unless otherwise modified by the Monkfish Monitoring Committee. The proposed target TAC for the NFMA is 35 percent lower than the target TAC in effect for FY 2006, and 67 percent lower than the average of target TACs in effect since FY 2002. The proposed target TAC for the SFMA is 39 percent higher than the target TAC in effect for FY 2006, but is 33 percent lower than the average of the target TACs in effect since FY  2002.      In 2007, the Northeast Data Poor Stocks Working Group (DPWG) completed a monkfish stock assessment and recommended revisions to the biomass reference points. The Councils adopted the new reference points as Framework Adjustment 5 to the Monkfish FMP, implemented in May 2008. Also in 2007, the Magnuson-Stevens Act was reauthorized (MSRA) and revised to include, among other things, the requirement that all FMPs establish Annual Catch Limits (ACLs) and measures to ensure accountability (AMs). For stocks not subject to overfishing, such as monkfish, the MSRA set a deadline of 2011 for the implementation of ACLs and AMs. In 2009, NMFS published revised National Standard 1 Guidelines which the Councils have used to develop ACLs and AMs for all FMPs.      In May 2011, Amendment 5 became effective which implemented the MSRA mandated ACLs and AMs and specified DAS and corresponding trip limits. Amendment 5 also modified the Research Set Aside Program, implemented a provision to minimize bycatch resulting from trip limit overages, and enabled vessels to land monkfish heads separate from the body. However, in 2010, after the Council submitted Amendment 5, the Northeast Regional Stock Assessment Review Committee completed a new monkfish stock assessment. Due to the newly available science, the DAS and trip limit specifications for the NFMA were disapproved in Amendment 5. To address the disapproved measures, NMFS proposed Framework Adjustment 7, effective October 2011.  Based upon the newly available science, Framework Adjustment 7  set the specifications for the NFMA and adopted biomass reference point for both areas. The Northeast Regional Stock Assessment Review Committee also declared that neither the northern nor southern stock are considered overfished nor is overfishing occurring.      Furthermore, the Councils released a catch shares scoping document in late 2010 and stated their intent to consider catch shares in the monkfish fishery. In conjunction with the scoping document, the Councils held a series of public meetings on catch shares soliciting public comment through March 7, 2011. The catch share Amendment, Amendment 6, has not been
initiated and is still being discussed by the Councils. At its January 2014 meeting the Council discussed Framework Adjustment 8 to establish new specifications for the fishery for 2014-2016.Regulations to Reduce Incidental Takes of Protected Species      The monkfish fishery is a component of the Northeast sink gillnet fishery and Mid- Atlantic coastal gillnet fishery, both of which are listed as Category I fisheries. The preceding discussion of the multispecies gillnet fishery also covers the protected species regulations affecting the monkfish fishery.      In addition, to reduce the impact of large-mesh gillnet fisheries in the Mid-Atlantic, NMFS published a final rule in December 2002 (67 FR 71895) which enacted a seasonally adjusted gear restriction by closing portions of the Mid-Atlantic Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) to fishing with gillnets with a mesh size larger than 8-inch stretched mesh. Gillnets with mesh sizes larger than 8 inches are known to be more likely to catch sea turtles, and were the gear of choice in the historical sea turtle fishery.9.4.3.4 Spiny Dogfish      A total of 20.9 million pounds of spiny dogfish were landed in the Northeastern U.S. in 2011.  Sink/anchor gillnets and bottom trawls were used to catch the greatest percentage of  spiny dogfish, 60.2 percent and 10.36 percent, respectively. The ex-vessel value of spiny dogfish landings in the Northeast totaled $4.5 million in 2011. A total of 584 vessels (21.3 percent) holding spiny dogfish permits in 2011 indicated ALWTRP-regulated gear (predominantly gillnets) as the primary gear.Management History      For most of the first two decades of extended jurisdiction under the MSA, the spiny dogfish was considered to be an "under-utilized" species of relatively minor value to the domestic fisheries of the U.S. East Coast. With the decline of the traditional groundfish catch, an increase in directed fishing for dogfish resulted in a nearly ten-fold increase in landings from 1987 to 1998.      The lack of any regulations pertaining to the harvest of spiny dogfish in the U.S. EEZ combined with the recent rapid expansion of the domestic fishery led the Mid-Atlantic and New England Fishery Management Councils (Councils) to develop a management plan for the species. The recent fishery expansion in combination with the removal of a large portion of the adult female stock has resulted in the species being designated as overfished (NEFSC, 1998).      Initial management actions to regulate the spiny dogfish fishery began in 1998 with the approval of a draft Spiny Dogfish FMP developed by the New England Fishery Management
Council (NEFMC) and the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council (MAFMC). The final  rule was approved by NMFS on September 29, 1999 and became effective on April 3, 2000. The FMP specifies a coastwide target fishing mortality rate of F = 0.03, which translates to an initial quota of four million pounds. The annual quota is split on a semi-annual basis, with Period I extending from May 1 through October 31 and Period II from November 1 through April 30. To control the level of effort, the management program also imposes possession limits of 600 and 300 pounds for Periods I and II, respectively.      In recent years, there has been a shift in the spiny dogfish fishery from an offshore  fishery to an inshore fishery. In 1998, state water landings accounted for 67 percent of total  spiny dogfish landings. Given this trend, the Federal FMP's objective of rebuilding the spiny dogfish resource could not be achieved without addressing fishing effort in state waters. In June 1999, the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC) convened a Spiny Dogfish and Coastal Shark Management Board (Board) to begin development of an interstate fishery management plan. The Board took emergency action in August 2000 to close the spiny dogfish fishery in state waters when there is a closure in Federal waters. The intent of the emergency action was to:• prevent the overharvest of the spiny dogfish fishery;• prevent the unregulated portion of the spiny dogfish fishery in state waters from undermining the Federal FMP; and• provide additional time for the ASMFC to develop the interstate spiny dogfish FMP, which would provide a framework for managing the fishery in state waters.      On November 21, 2002, the ASMFC approved the Interstate Fishery Management Plan for the Spiny Dogfish with an implementation date of May 1, 2003. The FMP complements the existing Federal regulations and adopts the target and threshold fishing mortality rates specified in the Federal plan.      Since 2003, the Federal FMP has maintained a spiny dogfish quota of 4 million pounds. In state waters, the ASMFC reduced the initial 8.8 million pound quota set in 2003-2004 to 4.4 million pounds; the following year, the quota was reduced to 4 million pounds. The TAC limits specified for 2006 maintained the limits established for 2005. In addition, the FMPs were modified in 2006 (Framework 1 for the NEFMC/MAFMC FMP and Addendum 1 for the ASMFC FMP) to allow annual specifications to remain in effect for up to 5 years.      The most recent stock assessment report for spiny dogfish (approved January 2007) indicates that the species is no longer overfished and that overfishing is not occurring. This has prompted the ASMFC to raise the state waters quota to 6 million pounds annually through 2009. Fifty-eight percent of this quota is allocated to the New England states, while the remaining 42 percent is allocated to waters from New York south through North Carolina.       Addendum II, approved in October 2008, established a new allocation program for the commercial spiny dogfish fishery while maintaining the conservation goals of the FMP.
      In the fall of 2009, the Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) updated the spiny dogfish stock status using the model from the 43rd Stock Assessment Review Committee (SARC), 2008 catch data, and results from the 2009 trawl survey. Based on the scientific findings, NMFS declared that the spiny dogfish stock was not overfished and overfishing was  not occurring. For FY2009, state and Federal quotas were set consistently at 12 million lb. with 3,000 lb. trip limits. For FYs 2010 and 2011, state and Federal quotas were set consistently at 15 million pounds and 20 million pounds, respectively, with a 3,000 lb trip limit. The relatively low trip limits are believed to discourage a large scale directed fishery for spiny dogfish.      Framework Adjustment 2 (Framework 2) to the FMP, enacted July 24, 2009, provided for automatic incorporation of biological reference points into the FMP as they become recommended through peer-reviewed assessments. The spiny dogfish stock was formally declared rebuilt in June 2010, after new scientific information providing an official biomass target became available. As a result, the FY2010 quota slightly increased from that of FY 2009 and was set at 15 million lb. with 3,000 lb. trip limits. Through the procedure outlined in Framework 2, the 2010 spiny dogfish specifications have updated the Spiny Dogfish FMP to incorporate the new biomass reference point values.      Addendum III, approved in March 2011, dissolves the Southern Region (NY – VA) allocation established in Addendum II and sets state shares for New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina. Northern Region states, from Maine through Connecticut will continue to share 58% of the annual quota. Final measures also address  overage payback, quota transfer, quota rollovers, possession limits, and a three-year reevaluation of final measures.      Addendum IV, approved in August 2012, modified the FMP to: 1) allow greater than 5% spiny dogfish commercial quota rollover from one year to the next with Board approval and 2) update the spiny dogfish overfishing definition consistent with Technical Committee (TC) recommendations.        MAFMC is undergoing public comment period for Amendment 3. Amendment 3 addresses four management issues related to management of the spiny dogfish fishery in Atlantic federal waters. Specifically, the Amendment addresses (1) adding an option for allocating a  small portion of the annual commercial quota as research set-aside, (2) reviewing and updating essential fish habitat (EFH) for spiny dogfish, (3) maintaining previous year annual management measures in case of a delay in the implementation of new annual measures, and (4) modifying the existing seasonal allocation of the annual quota to minimize conflicts with the  geographically allocated interstate fishery.Regulations to Reduce Incidental Takes of Protected Species      The spiny dogfish fishery is a component of the Northeast sink gillnet fishery and Mid- Atlantic coastal gillnet fishery, both of which are listed as Category I fisheries. The preceding discussion of the multispecies gillnet fishery covers the protected species regulations affecting the spiny dogfish fishery.
9.4.3.5 Directed Shark      In the Atlantic Ocean, the directed shark fishery is most active in southern waters. The overall number of Highly Migratory Species (HMS) permits for sharks has increased between 2008 and 2011. In 2011 the number of directed shark permits in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico and totaled 283 while incidental shark permits totaled 330. This is an increase from 2008 where directed permits equaled 214 and incidental permits equaled 285 (NMFS 2012). Florida has the highest number of permit holders 177 (directed) and 170 (incidental).Management History      In 1993, NMFS implemented the FMP for Sharks of the Atlantic Ocean. The Shark FMP included the management of 39 frequently caught species of Atlantic sharks separated into three groups for assessment and regulatory purposes: large coastal sharks (LCS), small coastal sharks (SCS), and pelagic sharks. Through the results from the 1992 stock assessment, NMFS  classified LCS as overfished and SCS and pelagic sharks as fully fished. Management measures in this first FMP included commercial quotas for LCS and pelagic sharks, a recreational trip limit, the prohibition of “finning,” and the establishment of a data collection system through mandatory trip reports, a fishery observer program, and commercial and recreational permitting requirements. Commercial quotas under the FMP were set at 2,436 metric tons and 580 metric tons for LCS and pelagic sharks, respectively. These quotas were divided into two equal half- year quotas, from January 1 through June 30 and from July 1 through December 31.      A number of problems arose in the initial year of the Shark FMP. The January to June LCS quota was exceeded shortly after implementation of the FMP, leading to the closure of that fishery on May 10, 1993. The LCS fishery was re-opened on July 1 with an adjusted quota to compensate for the overage in the first period. Within one month, the quota for the second  period had been reached and the LCS fishery was closed again. To address this problem, a commercial trip limit of 4,000 pounds for LCS permitted vessels was implemented on December 29, 1993, and a control date for the Atlantic shark fishery was established on February 22, 1994. In addition, the LCS quota was increased to 2,570 metric tons based on a new stock assessment completed in 1994.      In June 1996, NMFS convened another stock assessment to examine the status of LCS stocks. The 1996 stock assessment found no clear evidence that LCS stocks were rebuilding and concluded “that recovery is more likely to occur with reductions in effective fishing mortality rate of 50 [percent] or more.” In response to this information, in April 1997, NMFS reduced the LCS commercial quota by an additional 50 percent to 1,285 metric tons, and established a commercial quota for SCS of 1,760 metric tons.      On May 2, 1997, the Southern Offshore Fishing Association (SOFA) and other commercial fishermen and dealers sued NMFS over the April 1997 regulations. The Court  found that NMFS “failed to conduct a proper analysis to determine the [April 1997 LCS] quota’s economic effect on small businesses.” The Court directed NMFS “to undertake a rational consideration of the economic effects and potential alternatives to the 1997 [LCS] quotas” on small businesses engaged in the Atlantic shark commercial fishery. In May 1998, NMFS
completed its economic review of the 1997 LCS quota. It concluded that the quotas might have had a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. However, the report declared that no other viable alternatives were available that would both mitigate these economic impacts and ensure the viability of LCS stocks.      In 1997, NMFS initiated the development of new rebuilding plans for overfished LCS stocks, incorporating updated overfishing definitions and a new LCS stock assessment. The  1998 stock assessment found that the LCS stocks remained overfished and could not be rebuilt under the 1997 harvest levels. In April 1999, NMFS replaced the 1993 FMP with a new management plan entitled the “Highly Migratory Species (HMS)” FMP. Significant measures implemented in the 1999 HMS FMP, published on May 28, 1999, include:• reduced commercial quotas for LCS and SCS;• the establishment of ridgeback and non-ridgeback subgroups within the LCS fishery;• minimum fish sizes for ridgeback LCS;• establishment of blue shark, porbeagle shark, and other pelagic shark subgroups within the pelagic shark fishery;• commercial quotas for the new pelagic shark subgroups; and• an expansion of the list of prohibited shark species.      On June 25, 1999, SOFA et al. sued NMFS again, challenging the commercial measures implemented in the HMS FMP. A settlement agreement was reached between the two parties  and required, among other things, an independent review of the 1998 LCS stock assessment.  The results of the independent review, completed in July 2001, found that the scientific conclusions and management recommendations reached in the 1998 stock assessment were not based on scientifically reasonable uses of appropriate fisheries stock assessment techniques and the best available biological fishery information relating to LCS. In light of this information, NMFS implemented an emergency rule for the 2002 fishing year suspending certain measures of the 1999 regulations and maintaining the 1997 LCS commercial quota (1,285 metric tons) and the 1997 SCS commercial quota (1,760 metric tons).      In May and October 2002, NMFS announced the availability of new stock assessments for the SCS and LCS stocks, respectively. The stock assessment found that: (1) the  LCS complex is overfished and overfishing is occurring; (2) sandbar sharks are not overfished but overfishing is still occurring; (3) blacktip sharks are rebuilt and healthy; (4) the SCS complex, Atlantic sharpnose, bonnethead, and blacknose sharks are healthy; and (5) finetooth sharks are not overfished but overfishing is occurring.42 Per the settlement agreement, the 2002 LCS stock           42 The determination that a stock is overfished is based on whether the size of the biomass is above its threshold (defined in the fishery FMP), and the determination of whether overfishing is occurring is based on whether the fishing mortality rate is below its threshold (defined in the fishery FMP).
assessment was peer reviewed, which found the assessment consistent with the best available science and that the appropriate stock assessment models had been used.      On November 14, 2003, NMFS published the Notice of Availability of the Final Amendment 1 to the Fishery Management Plan for Atlantic Tunas, Swordfish, and Sharks (Amendment 1) in the Federal Register (68 FR 74746). The final rule for Amendment 1 was published on December 24, 2003, and required, among other things: aggregating the large coastal shark complex; using maximum sustainable yield as a basis for setting commercial quotas; eliminating the commercial minimum size; establishing regional commercial quotas and trimester commercial fishing seasons; implementing updated gear restrictions; and establishing a time/area closure off the coast of North Carolina. Most of these regulations took effect on February 1, 2004.43 The new commercial quotas for each group within the Atlantic shark fishery are provided in Exhibit 9-11, along with the previous (i.e., before Amendment 1) commercial quotas. An economic review of the changes in these quotas found minimal impacts on affected Atlantic shark vessels fishing the LCS and SCS stocks, and no impact on vessels fishing for pelagic sharks.Exhibit 9-11AMENDMENT 1 AND BASELINE QUOTAS FOR THE ATLANTIC SHARK FISHERYManagement Unit   Quota (metric tons)PreviousQuota (metric tons)Large Coastal Sharks1,0171,2851Pelagic Sharks8538532Small Coastal Sharks4541,7601Notes:1	LCS and SCS quotas adopted in 1997.2	Pelagic shark quota adopted under the 1999 HMS FMP.Source: NMFS, 2003d.      Following promulgation of Amendment 1, NMFS took steps to consolidate the FMP for Atlantic Tunas, Swordfish, and Sharks with the Atlantic Billfish FMP. The draft of this new FMP was released in August of 2005. After extensive public comment, the new FMP  – identified as the Consolidated Atlantic Highly Migratory Species (HMS) FMP – became law in July of 2006. In addition to consolidating its predecessor FMPs, the HMS FMP implements several new requirements, including mandatory safe handling and release workshops for operators of longline and gillnet vessels, as well as species identification workshops for shark dealers.      Amendment 2, effective July 2008, These measures include, but are not limited to, reductions in the commercial quotas, adjustments to commercial retention limits, establishment           43 The change in commercial quotas, removal of commercial minimum sizes, and the establishment of regional quotas became effective on December 30, 2003.

of a shark research fishery, a requirement for commercial vessels to maintain all fins on the shark carcasses through offloading, the establishment of two regional quotas for non-sandbar large coastal sharks (LCS), the establishment of one annual season for commercial shark fishing instead of trimesters, changes in reporting requirements for dealers (including swordfish and tuna dealers), the establishment of additional time/area closures for bottom longline (BLL) fisheries, and changes to the authorized species for recreational fisheries. This rule also establishes the 2008 commercial quota for all Atlantic shark species groups. These changes affect all commercial and recreational shark fishermen and shark dealers on the Atlantic Coast.      Amendment 3, effective July 2010, implemented the final conservation and management measures for blacknose sharks, shortfin mako sharks, and smooth dogfish. In order to reduce confusion with spiny dogfish regulations, this final rule places both smooth dogfish and Florida smoothhound into the smoothhound shark complex.      NMFS is proposed management measures that would amend the HMS fishery management regulations for the U.S. Caribbean Region to better correspond with the traditional operation of the fishing fleet in the region and to provide NMFS with an improved capability to monitor and sustainably manage those fisheries. The public comment period closed on June 14, 2012 and Amendment 4 went into effect on January 2, 2013.      Amendment 5 was developed in response to the results of several recent shark stock assessments, and will mainly deal with species in the large coastal shark (LCS) and small coastal shark (SCS) complexes. The first assessment initially was published in a peer-reviewed professional journal and later reviewed by NMFS scientists and adopted as a stock assessment for use in domestic shark management (76 FR 23794; April 28, 2011). The other assessments (sandbar, dusky, Atlantic blacknose, and Gulf of Mexico blacknose sharks) were conducted as part of the Southeast Data, Assessment, and Review (SEDAR) process (76 FR 62331; October 7, 2011). NMFS the proposed rule and DEIS was available for review in late 2012. As a result of public comments the action was split into two Amendments (5a and 5b) and the Final Amendment 5 to the Consolidated HMS FMP will be complete in 2014.Regulations to Reduce Incidental Takes of Protected Species      The Southeast U.S. Atlantic shark gillnet fishery under the HMS FMP is listed as a Category II fishery. This fishery is currently subject to regulations under the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan (ALWTRP).      Current ALWTRP regulations include measures such as a closure of the Southeast U.S. right whale critical habitat and adjacent area (approximately Savannah, GA to Sebastian, FL) to all driftnet gillnet gear in the restricted area during the calving season (November 15 - March 31); special provisions for fishing with strikenet gear in the restricted area during the calving season; a 100 percent observer requirement from November 15 to March 31 in the observer area; and gear marking requirements.      Historic HMS fisheries that affect marine mammals also include the pelagic longline, pair trawl, and pelagic driftnet fisheries for Atlantic tunas, sharks, and swordfish. In 1996, the Atlantic Offshore Cetacean Take Reduction Team (AOCTRT) was formed to address marine
mammal interactions with these fisheries. AOCTRT submitted a draft plan to reduce takes resulting from the gear associated with these fisheries, but the draft plan was not finalized. Instead, several protective measures were implemented through the HMS FMP. In particular, NMFS has prohibited the use of pair trawls and swordfish driftnets in Atlantic pelagic fisheries, and has implemented several other AOCTRT recommendations for the pelagic longline and shark gillnet fisheries.      In 2003, the SEFSC released an updated estimate of marine mammal and sea turtle bycatch in the pelagic longline fishery. This report indicated that the incidental take of the common dolphin and the long-finned pilot whale (strategic stock) in the Atlantic pelagic longline fishery may be occurring at levels that exceed Potential Biological Removal (PBR) for both species (Garrison, 2003). As a result of these findings, NMFS has convened an  Atlantic Longline Take Reduction Team. The TRT held its initial meeting in June of 2005 (70 FR  36120). NMFS published a proposed rule on June 24, 2008 (73 FR 35623) and a final rule on May 19, 2009 (74 FR 23349), effective June 18, 2009. The plan consists of both regulatory and nonregulatory measures, including a special research area, gear modifications, outreach material, observer coverage, and captains’ communications. In addition, the NMFS Southeast Regional Office recently concluded that the HMS pelagic longline fishery is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of leatherback sea turtles (NMFS, 2004c). Therefore, NMFS is proposing bycatch mitigation measures throughout the pelagic longline fishery that include mandatory pelagic longline circle hook and bait requirements and mandatory possession and use of onboard equipment to reduce sea turtle bycatch mortality (69 FR 6621).      The HMS fishery is also subject to the Bottlenose Dolphin Take Reduction Plan (April 26, 2006, 71 FR 24776). Takes in the HMS fishery have been documented for both bottlenose dolphins and sea turtles.9.4.3.6 Coastal Migratory Pelagic Species      The Coastal Migratory Pelagic Species Fishery is based primarily in waters off the southeastern United States, including both Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico waters. During the 2012 calendar year, 4,742 vessels possessed permits to fish for coastal migratory pelagic species. Annual catch limits for commercial sectors of the Atlantic migratory groups cobia, king mackerel, Spanish mackerel are currently set at 125,712 lbs, 3.88 billion lbs, and 3.13 million lbs, respectively.Management History      The Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Coastal Migratory Pelagic Resources of the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic includes the management of several species: king mackerel, Spanish mackerel, and cobia. The coastal migratory pelagic species are further managed based on Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic migratory groups.      Between 1983 and 2012, the FMP for the Coastal Migratory Pelagic Species Fishery was amended 18 times. A history of significant actions is included below:
• Amendment 1 (Implemented September 1985). Significant provisions implemented in Amendment 1 include: a downward revision of the king mackerel maximum sustainable yield (MSY); recognition of separate Atlantic and Gulf migratory groups for king mackerel; establishment of fishing permits; establishment of bag limits for king mackerel; elimination of commercial allocations among gear users; and the division of the Gulf commercial allocation for king mackerel into eastern and western zones for the purpose of regional allocation.• Amendment 2 (Implemented July 1987). Amendment 2 focused on Spanish mackerel stocks, implementing measures revising the Spanish mackerel MSY downward, recognizing two migratory groups for Spanish mackerel, and setting commercial quotas and bag limits.• Amendment 3 (Originally approved in 1989, revised and resubmitted in 1990). Amendment 3 prohibited drift gillnets for coastal pelagics and purse seines for the overfished groups of mackerel.• Amendment 4 (Implemented October 1989). Amendment 4 reallocated Spanish mackerel equally between recreational and commercial fishermen in the Atlantic group, with an increase in Total Allowable Catch (TAC) levels.• Amendment 5 (Implemented August 1990). Amendment 5 made a number of changes in the management regime, including the following: extending the management area for Atlantic groups of mackerel through the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council’s area of jurisdiction; revising the fishery and plan objectives; revising the overfishing definition; revising the fishing year for the Gulf group of Spanish mackerel; adding cobia to the annual stock assessment procedure; assigning SAFMC responsibility for pre-season adjustments of the TACs and bag limits for the Atlantic migratory groups of mackerel, and the Gulf Council similar responsibility for the Gulf migratory groups; specifying that Gulf group king mackerel may only be taken by hook-and-line and run-around gillnets; and establishing minimum sizes for king mackerel.• Amendment 6 (Implemented November 1992). Amendment 6 also made substantial changes to the FMP designed to rebuild overfished stocks of mackerel. Implemented measures included size limits, trip  limits, seasonal closures, and gear restrictions.• Amendment 7 (Implemented November 1994). Amendment 7 equally divided the eastern zone commercial quota for the Gulf migratory group of king mackerel between the Florida east and west coast fisheries. It further divided the quota for the west coast sub-zone into equal quotas for hook- and-line and run-around gillnet harvesters. The intended effects of  this rule were (1) the equitable allocation of the eastern zone commercial quota
among users, and (2) avoiding the negative social and economic consequences of a disproportionately large harvest in the commercial fishery for Gulf group king mackerel off the west coast of Florida.• Amendment 8 (Implemented March 1998). Amendment 8 made a number of changes to the management regime, including establishment of a moratorium on commercial king mackerel permits until no later than October 15, 2000; increasing the income requirement for a king or Spanish mackerel permit; setting an optimum yield (OY) target at 30 percent of the static spawning potential ratio (SPR); and clarifying ambiguity about allowable gear specifications for the Gulf group king mackerel fishery.• Amendment 9 (Implemented April 2000). Amendment 9 changed the percentage of the commercial allocation of TAC for the Florida east coast and Florida west coast. It also allowed possession of cut-off (damaged) king or Spanish mackerel that comply with the minimum size limits and the trip limits in the Gulf, Mid-Atlantic, or South Atlantic EEZ.• Amendment 10 (Implemented 1999). Amendment 10 designated essential fish habitat (EFH) and Habitat Areas of Particular Concern for coastal migratory pelagic resources.• Amendment 11 (Implemented 2000). Amendment 11 amended the FMP to make the definitions for MSY, OY, overfishing, and overfished consistent with the “National Standard Guidelines.”• Amendment 12 (Implemented October 2000). Amendment 12 extended the commercial king mackerel permit moratorium from October 15, 2000 to October 15, 2005, or until replaced with a license limitation, limited access, and/or individual fishing quota or individual transferable quota system (ITQ), whichever occurs earlier.• Amendment 13 (Implemented August 2002). Amendment 13 established two marine reserves in the EEZ of the Gulf of Mexico, known as Tortugas North and Tortugas South, in which fishing for coastal migratory pelagic species is prohibited. This action complements previous actions taken under the National Marine Sanctuaries Act.• Amendment 14 (Implemented July 2002). Amendment 14 established a 3-year moratorium on the issuance of charter vessel and headboat king mackerel permits in the Gulf, unless replaced by a comprehensive effort limitation system. The control date for eligibility was established  as March 29, 2001. The amendment also included other provisions for eligibility, application, appeals, and transferability of permits.
• Amendment 15 (July 2005). Amendment 15 established an indefinite limited access program for king mackerel in the EEZ under the jurisdiction of the Gulf of Mexico, South Atlantic, and Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Councils. It also changed the fishing year to March  1 through February 28/29 for Atlantic group king and Spanish mackerel.• Amendment 16. This amendment was not developed.• Amendment 17 (Implemented June 2006). Amendment 17 established a limited access system on for-hire reef fish can coastal migratory pelagic species permits. This amendment only applies to fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico.• Amendment 18 (Implemented January 2012). Amendment 18 established annual catch limits, annual catch targets, and accountability measures for king mackerel, Spanish mackerel and cobia.  This amendment also established both Atlantic and Gulf migratory groups for cobia; modified the framework procedures; and removed species, such as, cero, little tunny, dolphin and bluefish from the Fishery Management Unit.Regulations to Reduce Incidental Takes of Protected Species      The Coastal Migratory Pelagic Species Fishery is listed as a Category II fishery (Southeast Atlantic gillnet fishery) and is subject to regulations under the ALWTRP to reduce interactions with large whales.9.4.3.7 Black Sea Bass9.4.3.7.1 The Northern Fishery      The northern portion of the black sea bass fishery extends from Cape Hatteras to the U.S./Canada border. Landings of black sea bass in the Northeastern U.S. totaled 1.7 million pounds in 2011 with a total ex-vessel value of $5.4 million. Trawls and trap/pot were used to catch the greatest percentage of black sea bass, about 37 percent and 27 percent respectively. In the 2011 fishing year, a total of 1,554 vessels held black sea bass permits. Of this number, a  total of 182 vessels (about 12 percent) relied primarily upon gear that is potentially subject to regulation under the ALWTRP.Management History      Commercial landings of black sea bass have been recorded since the late 1800s. These data indicate that annual landings north of Cape Hatteras averaged approximately six million pounds from 1887 until 1948, when they increased to approximately 15.2 million pounds. Shortly thereafter, landings of black sea bass declined dramatically, falling from a peak of 22 million pounds in 1952 to 1.3 million pounds in 1971. At the time of the development of the
first Federal management plan in 1994, commercial landings of black sea bass totaled approximately two million pounds per year.      A spring offshore survey and an autumn inshore survey of black sea bass have been conducted every year since 1972. The spring offshore survey is used to create an index for black sea bass recruits (fish longer than 20 cm SL44), while the autumn inshore survey is used as an index for black sea bass pre-recruits (fish longer than 11 cm SL). In the 1970s, the spring recruit index ranged from 2.0 to 6.09 fish per tow. In 1982, this number had plunged to a low of 0.2 per tow. Prior to the approval of the first black sea bass FMP, the spring index ranged from 0.28 in 1994 to 0.87 in 1997 (NEFSC, 1995). The fall pre-recruit index showed a similar declining trend during this period.      The black sea bass fishery in the Northeast is jointly managed by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC) and the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council (MAFMC) under the Summer Flounder, Scup, and Black Sea Bass Fishery Management Plan. The Council first started work on an FMP for black sea bass in 1978. The development of the black sea bass plan was delayed, however, through a series of amendments to the Summer Flounder FMP, and work on a separate Black Sea Bass FMP did not resume until 1993.      In 1996, NMFS requested that the black sea bass regulations be incorporated into the Summer Flounder FMP to reduce the number of separate fisheries regulations issued by the Federal government. The Black Sea Bass FMP was incorporated into the summer flounder regulations in Amendment 9 to the Summer Flounder FMP.      Based on fishery conditions in the early-to-mid 1990s, Amendment 9 set a target annual exploitation rate of 23 percent. The estimated annual exploitation rate in the fishery at the time was 60 percent. In order to reach the target exploitation rate, the Board approved a recovery strategy to reduce overfishing over an eight-year time frame. During the first two years of this period, the strategy established minimum fish sizes and commercial gear regulations aimed at reducing mortality rates for smaller black sea bass. Beginning in the third year, additional regulations established an annual commercial quota allocated in four quarters, designed to reduce mortality for larger black sea bass. Under this system the fishery was to be closed once the quota available for each quarter was harvested.      The Commission designed the commercial quota system to allow for black sea bass to be landed during the entire three months in each quarter. However, the black sea bass fishery experienced early closures during the last three quarters of 1999 and 2000. In quarters 3 and 4 of 2000, the quarterly allocation was harvested within one month, leaving the fishery closed for the remaining two months of those quarters. In 2001, early closures were required in all  four quarters (Exhibit 9-12).      Responding to the economic difficulties associated with these long quarterly closures, the Commission chose to abandon the quarterly system in favor of state-by-state quota management (Exhibit 9-13). This resulted in the passage of Amendment 13, in which NMFS implemented44 Standard length (SL) of fish is estimated to the nearest centimeter.
compatible Federal regulations to establish coast-wide annual quotas effective March 31, 2003 (67 FR 72131 and 68 FR 10181). These requirements were continued by an August 2004 addendum. In addition, the 2004 adoption of Framework 5 to the FMP allowed for annual specifications of total allowable landings (TAL) to remain in effect for up to three years (69 FR 62818). Since then, Addendum XIII (2004) has allowed more latitude in establishing three-year TALs, and Addendum XVI (2006) has provided mechanisms to ensure that a state meets its obligations under the FMP in ways that minimize the probability that a state's delay in complying could adversely affect other states' fisheries or conservation of the resource.      A stock assessment report drafted in 2004, which concluded that the black sea bass stock was not overfished, was withdrawn in 2006 after not passing the peer review process. A new stock assessment report is underway. As of 2006, a TAL of 6.5 million pounds was specified for state waters, and a TAL of 5 million pounds was specified for Federal waters.Exhibit 9-12NORTHERN BLACK SEA BASS FISHERY CLOSURESYearQuarterNumber of weeks closed1999Quarter 10Quarter 22Quarter 31Quarter 422000Quarter 10Quarter 23Quarter 39Quarter 472001Quarter 13Quarter 23Quarter 39Quarter 472002Quarter 10Quarter 23Quarter 38Quarter 40Source: ASMFC, 2002a and NMFS, 2004d.

In 2007, Amendment 14 and 16 were established, along with Framework 7.These measures established a rebuilding schedule for scup, standardized bycatch reporting methodology, and defined and updated status determination criteria.      Addendum XIX, effective in August 2007 extended the black sea bass state-by-state commercial allocation established under Addendum XII.      Addendum XX, effective in November 2009, streamlined and coordinated the transfers of quota as well as established clear policies and administrative protocols to guide the allocation of transfers from states with underages to states with overages and allowed for quota transfers to reconcile quota overages after year’s end.      Addendum XXI, approved in March 2011, allowed state by state or regional management measures to be implemented for the 2011 fishing year.Regulations to Reduce Incidental Takes of Protected Species      The northern black sea bass trap/pot fishery is listed as a Category II fishery (Atlantic mixed species trap/pot), elevated in 2001 from Category III (66 FR 42780), due to potential interactions with marine mammals, particularly the endangered North Atlantic right whale. The northern black sea bass gillnet fishery is also subject to regulations under the Harbor Porpoise Take Reduction Plan (HPTRP) that prohibit the setting of gillnets in certain areas for selected time periods. These closures include a prohibition on the use of large mesh gillnet gear west of 72Ε30' in southern Mid-Atlantic waters (Maryland, Delaware, Virginia and North Carolina) from February 15 through March 15. Although the closure is meant to prevent harbor porpoise takes  in gillnet gear, it may also benefit sea turtles by reducing gillnet effort off of North Carolina during this time period, when sea turtles may be present.
      In addition to regulations implemented under the HPTRP, it is possible that the northern black sea bass fishery will be subject to future regulations promulgated under the Sea Turtle Strategy.9.4.3.7.2 The Southern Fishery      The southern portion of the black sea bass trap/pot fishery extends from Cape Hatteras, NC to Cape Canaveral, FL. Commercial permits are issued in the southeast for the South  Atlantic snapper-grouper fishery, which includes black sea bass. The southern black sea bass pot fishery, which is managed under the Snapper-Grouper Fishery Management Plan, is a limited access fishery with only 32 endorsements. Exhibit 4-22 (see Chapter 4) summarizes the number of permitted vessels, by state.Management History      The southern portion of the black sea bass fishery is managed under the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Snapper-Grouper fishery of the South Atlantic Region. The FMP, as amended, establishes minimum size limits, a commercial trip limit, black sea bass pot gear restrictions, and vessel permitting and reporting requirements for the southern black sea bass fishery.      The original Snapper Grouper FMP (South Atlantic Fishery Management Council 1983) included size limits for black sea bass (8” total length (TL)). Trawl gear, primarily targeting vermilion snapper, was prohibited starting in January 1989. In 1991, the Council approved Amendment 4 to the FMP, implementing a series of regulations to reduce mortality of overfished species in the snapper/grouper complex. Fish traps (not including black sea bass pots) and entanglement nets were prohibited starting in January 1992. This action prohibited black sea bass pot fishermen from making multi-gear trips and retaining the incidental catch of other species. This action unintentionally resulted in large economic losses for black sea bass fishermen; in response, the Council requested emergency regulations on July 18, 1992 to modify the definition of black sea bass pots, allow multi-gear trips, and allow retention of incidentally caught fish. On December 11, 1992, the Council submitted a regulatory amendment implementing the emergency action provisions on a permanent basis.      In 1996, a new stock assessment of the snapper/grouper complex, based on 1995 data, was released. The stock assessment produced a spawning potential ratio (SPR) of 26 percent, indicating that the species was overfished.45 This assessment was supported by data on the catch-per-unit-effort of headboats off South Carolina, which had declined from just over 11 fish per angler day in 1980 to just over one fish per angler day in 1995. The Council identified the need for a 56 percent reduction in black sea bass mortality to achieve Optimum Yield (OY), and the need to reduce mortality by 22 percent to eliminate overfishing. Under Amendment 9  (1998), the Council responded to this new information, increasing the minimum size limit from 8 inches to ten inches for both commercial and recreational black sea bass fishermen; establishing           45 Species can be classified as overfished if values of fishing mortality (F), spawning stock biomass (SSB), or spawning potential ratio (SPR) are above or below target levels.
a recreational bag limit of 20 black sea bass per person per day; and requiring escape vents and panels with degradable fasteners on black sea bass pots.      According to the Status of Fisheries Report to Congress (2002), the southern black sea bass fishery remained overfished following implementation of Amendment 9. To address the lack of improvement in the southern black sea bass stock, the SAFMC implemented Amendment 13C to the Snapper Grouper FMP (71 FR 33423). This amendment included provisions to:• Change the commercial and recreational fishing year from January 1 through December 31 to June 1 through May 31;• Establish an annual commercial quota that is to decrease over three years from 477,000 pounds in Year 1 (June 1, 2006, to May 31, 2007) to 423,000 pounds in Year 2 (June 1, 2007, to May 31, 2008), and to 309,000 pounds in Year 3 (June 1, 2008, to May 31, 2009);• Require the use of at least 2-inch mesh for the entire back panel of pots;• Require the removal of pots from the water once the commercial quota is met;• Establish a recreational allocation that would decrease over three years from 633,000 pounds in Year 1 to 560,000 pounds in Year 2, and to 409,000 pounds in Year 3;• Increase the recreational size limit from 10-inch total length (TL) to 11- inch TL in Year 1 and 12-inch TL in Year 2; and• Reduce the recreational bag limit from 20 to 15 per person per day.      In 2008, the SAFMC published Amendment 15A, which: 1) updated black sea bass management reference points; 2) modified the rebuilding schedule; and 3) defined a rebuilding strategy. In 2010, Amendment 17B established annual catch limits and accountability measures and addressed overfishing for nine species in the snapper grouper management complex currently listed as undergoing overfishing, including black sea bass. The commercial annual catch limit for black sea bass was set at 309,000 lbs. In 2011, Regulatory Amendment 9 was implemented and reduced the bag limit for black sea bass from 15 fish per person to 5 fish per person.      In 2012, the SAFMC published Amendment 18A which included management actions to limit participation and effort in the black sea bass fishery. Measures include establishment of an endorsement program, commercial trip limit, increasing minimum size limits for commercial black sea bass to 11 inches, and other modifications to the commercial pot fishery. Vessels are now limited to 35 pots per trip and all pots must be brought back to shore at the conclusion of each trip.
      The most recent regulatory amendment, 19, became effective in 2013 (78 FR 39700). This amendment specified the acceptable biological catch (ABC) and revised the optimum yield (OY), the commercial and recreational annual catch limits (ACLs), and the recreational annual catch target (ACT) for black sea bass harvested in the South Atlantic. These changes were based on the 2013 stock assessment which deemed the stock rebuilt. Amendment 19 also established  an annual prohibition on the use of black sea bass pots from November 1 through April 30.      NMFS is aware that the SAFMC is developing a regulatory amendment, Snapper Grouper Regulatory Amendment 16, to modify or remove the recently implemented black sea bass fishery closure intended to protect right whales from entanglement in vertical lines associated with the black sea bass fishery. NMFS is also aware that this regulatory amendment has the potential to contradict or remain consistent with the intent of this final rule (intended to reduce the threat of entanglement to right and other large whales from vertical lines associated with commercial fisheries). Therefore, NMFS is collaborating with the SAFMC on their regulatory amendment to encourage adequate protection for right whales.Regulations to Reduce Incidental Takes of Protected Species      Similar to the northern Atlantic black sea bass trap/pot fishery, the southern Atlantic black sea bass trap/pot fishery is listed as a Category II fishery (Atlantic mixed species trap/pot) due to potential interactions with marine mammals, particularly the endangered North Atlantic right whale. Although not a regulation, commercial black sea bass trap/pot gear has not been fished from November through April during the right whale calving and large whale migration season since December 2009. This lack of co-occurrence of vertical line and whales is the most effective measure in reducing entanglement risk of endangered large whales.      Amendment 18A introduced a number of regulations to the black sea bass fishery which will have an unknown effect on protected species, including right whales.  Because the number of trap pots and participants was reduced, the potential entanglement risk from this gear type may be reduced provided remaining fishermen do not increase their effort. However, if the reduction in participants and pots, increases effort among the remaining participants or extends the fishing season so that it overlaps with right whale calving season, the entanglement risk could remain the same or increase. Regardless, fishermen are now required to bring all black sea pots back to shore at the end of each trip and this will likely decrease the entanglement risk to right whales because it is expected to reduce ghost fishing and the amount of time vertical pot lines are in the water. Most importantly, Amendment 19 established an annual prohibition on the use of black sea bass pots from November 1 through April 30.9.4.3.8 Hagfish      Landings of hagfish in the Northeastern U.S. totaled 4.9 million pounds in 2010, with a total ex-vessel value of $1.1 million. Nearly all hagfish were caught with fish pots and traps,  gear that is potentially subject to ALWTRP regulations.Management History
      Currently, the Atlantic hagfish fishery is not regulated, but NMFS and the New England Fishery Management Council are moving toward developing a management scheme for the fishery. On September 9, 2002, NMFS issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that established a control date of August 28, 2002 for potential future use in determining historical or traditional participation in the fishery.46 In this notice, NMFS also stated its intent to encourage the New England Fishery Management Council to develop an FMP for the fishery, preventing overcapitalization and increased pressure on the stock due to a movement of vessels into the fishery. This action was motivated, in part, because scientific studies suggest that Atlantic hagfish are likely vulnerable to overfishing due to the low reproductive capacity of the species (67 FR 55191). As a result of these findings, NMFS and the Council are developing a hagfish FMP (NMFS, 2005b) and recently established observer requirements for hagfish vessels, as well as reporting requirements for all dealers purchasing hagfish directly from vessels (72 FR 20036). These requirements are designed to provide data that will support development of the FMP.9.4.3.9 Red Crab      About 3.6 million pounds of red crab were landed in the Northeastern U.S. in 2011, with an ex-vessel value of roughly $3.5 million. Almost all of the red crab landed was caught using crab pots and traps, gear that is potentially subject to ALWTRP regulations.Management History      Since the early 1970s there has been a small directed red crab fishery off the New England and Mid-Atlantic coasts. Though the size and intensity of this fishery has fluctuated since its origin, it has remained consistently small relative to more prominent New England fisheries such as groundfish, sea scallops, and lobster. Throughout the 1980s, landings averaged approximately 5.5 million pounds per year. In the late 1990s, landings increased substantially, reaching a peak in 2001 of 8.8 million pounds. It is suspected that the increased activity in this fishery in the mid-1990s might be a result of the implementation of Amendment 5 to the Northeast Multispecies (Groundfish) FMP, and the subsequent redirection of some fishing effort to “under-exploited” fishery resources such as red crab.      Faced with the increase in landings and interest in the fishery, a group of fishermen approached the New England Fishery Management Council (the Council) in late 1999 requesting the Council to develop a fishery management plan for the red crab fishery. They also asked the Council to consider taking steps to limit access to the fishery, a measure they hoped would help the fishery maintain yields at sustainable levels. In November 1999, the Council agreed to begin development of a red crab FMP, and in 2000 a control date was established for the fishery to discourage "speculative entry," or rapid entry of new vessels into the fishery while the management plan was undergoing development.           46 The notice also served to deny the rulemaking requested in a Petition for Rulemaking asking NMFS to implement emergency measures to limit entry into the fishery, as emergency action was deemed unnecessary.
      Reducing the threat of overfishing became the primary objective of the new red crab FMP. A comprehensive survey conducted when the fishable stock of this resource was considered to be in “virgin” condition estimated maximum sustainable yield (MSY) at 5.5 million pounds of exploitable males (Serchuk, 1977). The Council concluded that average commercial landings of red crab have exceeded this level several times, and in 1982, NMFS declared the red crab resource was “becoming fully exploited.” This determination was based on an increase in landings from nearly 2.7 million pounds in 1979 (there had been a fairly steady increase in landings since 1974) to just over 5.6 million pounds in 1980 (NMFS, 1982). The following year NMFS revised this status to “fully exploited” after landings increased to 6.8 million pounds in 1981 (NMFS, 1983). In more recent years, beginning in 1998, red crab landings increased dramatically again to levels near or above MSY.      The final Red Crab FMP was implemented on October 21, 2002 (67 FR 63221). The  plan granted controlled access permits to vessels that demonstrated average annual landings of red crab greater than 250,000 pounds during a qualifying time period. Five vessels qualified for controlled access permits in fishing year 2002. Additional measures implemented include:• The establishment of baseline trip limits (75,000 pounds) that restrict the amount that can be landed during each fishing trip, with one vessel qualifying for a higher trip limit of 125,000 pounds, based on its landings history;• Designation of an annual total allowable catch (TAC);• Allocation of days-at-sea (DAS, the number of days that can be fished each year) to vessels with a controlled access permit;• Trap limits (600 traps per vessel); and• Limitation on full processing at sea.      The 2003 fishing year was the first full year with the Red Crab FMP in place. In this  year, the FMP allocated the red crab fishery 780 days-at-sea and a TAC of 5.9 million pounds. These effort restrictions translated into 156 days-at-sea for each of the five qualified limited access vessels in the red crab fleet.      Provisions within the Red Crab FMP require the Council to review the status of the stock and the fishery every year, as well as prepare a biennial Stock Assessment and Fishery Evaluation (SAFE Report). The recent adoption of Framework 1 to the FMP, in 2005, allows for annual specifications to remain in effect for up to 3 years (70 FR 44060). For the 2004-2006 fishing years, the DAS allocation and TAC level remained unchanged for the red crab fishery.      In FY 2009, NMFS published a temporary emergency rule to modify the 2009 target TAC and fleet DAS to be consistent with the recommendations of the Data Poor Stocks Working Group and Review Panel (Working Group). The Working Group recommended a reduction in the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) to 3.75–4.19 million lb (1,700–1,900 mt). In keeping with the FMP in setting the target TAC at 95 percent of MSY, NMFS implemented a target TAC of3.56 million lb (1,615 mt), and reduced the fleet DAS allocation from 780 DAS to 582 DAS.
The fleet DAS allocation is divided equally among the vessels active in the fishery, which can vary from year to year. For FY 2009, the allocation was initially divided among four vessels; however, NMFS allowed one of the four vessels to opt out of the fishery for the FY and reallocated the fleet DAS to the remaining three vessels. The only other proposed change to the red crab regulations is to waive the requirement that vessel owners inform NMFS at least 6 months in advance to opt a vessel out of the fishery. No changes to possession limits or gear/trap restrictions were proposed.      In 2011, Amendment 3 was proposed to establish an annual catch limit and accountability measures, as required under the Magnuson-Stevens Act.  Amendment 3 to the Red Crab FMP (76 FR 39369) proposes to establish an annual catch limit and total allowable landings limit of3.91 million lb, establish an proactive accountability measure (in-season closure) and a reactive accountability measure (pound-for-pound payback of an overage). Amendment 3 also removes the DAS and IVR requirements. Amendment 3 became effective on September 29, 2011.Regulations to Reduce Incidental Takes of Protected Species      The red crab fishery is listed as a Category II fishery (Atlantic mixed species trap/pot fishery) due to potential interactions with marine mammals. The red crab fishery is subject to regulations under the ALWTRP, including a requirement to install a weak link at all buoys that break away knotless at 3,780 pounds.9.4.3.10 Scup      In 2011, commercial landings for scup totaled 15 million pounds; of this, approximately seven percent, or 1,045,200 pounds, were caught using traps and pots. The ex-vessel value of scup landings in the Northeast totaled $8.2 million in 2011. A total of 114 vessels indicated the primary gear was affected by the ALWTRP.Management History      Commercial scup landings have declined substantially since peaking in the 1960s. In 1989, commercial landings decreased to 8.2 million pounds, the lowest value recorded during the ten-year period from 1983 to 1992, and only about 17 percent of the 49 million pounds landed in 1960. More recently, the collapse of the Northeast groundfish fishery has resulted in increasing fishing pressures on the already overexploited scup fishery. Annual landings of scup declined from just over 15 million pounds in 1991 to less than 3 million pounds in 2000. Since 2000, however, annual landings have increased (Figure 9-194.      The Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (Commission) and the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council (Council) jointly manage the scup fishery. The Council approved the first Scup FMP under Amendment 8 to the Summer Flounder, Scup, and Black Sea Bass Fishery Management Plan (61 FR 56125). Amendment 8 defines overfishing for the scup as fishing in excess of the Fmax level, where Fmax is equal to 0.24 (or an annual exploitation rate of
19 percent). Based on a review of coastwide data, mortality rates in the early 1980s  were  slightly greater than 0.3. These rates rose to 1.0 in 1988 and 1.3 in 1996 (or an annual exploitation rate of 67 percent). This information indicated that overexploitation in the scup fishery started in the early 1980s; in order to achieve Fmax, the plan identified a need to reduce current exploitation rates by 72 percent.      To reduce scup mortality, the Council adopted a seven-year strategy. Year 1  implemented minimum fish sizes and commercial gear regulations, measures designed to reduce the mortality rate for smaller scup. Beginning in Year 2, the strategy implemented a coastwide annual quota, or Total Allowable Catch (TAC). This annual quota is divided into three periods: Winter I, Summer, and Winter II. Addendum V, approved in 2002, establishes a state-by-state allocation system for the summer period. In this system, each state receives a share of theExhibit 9-14summer period quota based on commercial landings from 1983-1992. The fishery is closed each period once the quota for the season has been reached.      In addition to effort control, Amendment 8 includes a moratorium on commercial permits. Under this moratorium, only a limited number of permits are granted each year. The purpose of this provision is to cap entry so that new entrants to the fishery do not dissipate future gains in productivity and profitability.      The 2000 scup stock assessment classified the resource as overfished. Since then, an updated stock assessment, completed in June 2002, indicated scup was no longer overfished, but that the “stock status with respect to overfishing cannot currently be evaluated.” In addition, the report concluded that, although the “relative exploitation rates have declined in recent years, the
absolute value of F [fishing mortality] cannot be determined.” The assessment, however, did state that “survey data indicate[s] strong recruitment and some rebuilding of age structure” in recent years. However, in 2005, the scup index of recruitment declined and scup is now again considered overfished (ASMFC, 2005).      The Council and ASMFC are currently considering measures that would establish a program and timeline for rebuilding scup stocks. The Council, through Amendment 14 to the FMP, has proposed a timeline of seven years to rebuild the stock in Federal waters, with an option to extend the timeline for three additional years (72 FR 18193). Amendment 14 was approved in July 2007.      Addendum XX, effective in November 2009, streamlined and coordinated the transfers of quota as well as established clear policies and administrative protocols to guide the allocation of transfers from states with underages to states with overages and allowed for quota transfers to reconcile quota overages after year’s end.      Addendum XXI, approved in March 2011, allowed state by state or regional management measures to be implemented for the 2011 fishing year.Regulations to Reduce Incidental Takes of Protected Species      The Atlantic scup gillnet fishery is listed as a Category I fishery (Mid-Atlantic coastal gillnet), elevated in 2003 from Category II, mostly due to potential interactions with marine mammals, particularly protected dolphins. The Atlantic scup trap/pot fishery is listed as a Category II fishery (Atlantic mixed species trap/pot fishery) due to potential interactions primarily with the endangered North Atlantic right whale. The Atlantic scup gillnet fishery is subject to regulations under the Harbor Porpoise Take Reduction Plan (HPTRP) that prohibit the setting of gillnets in certain areas for selected time periods. These closures include a prohibition on the use of large mesh gillnet gear west of 72Ε30' in southern Mid-Atlantic waters (Maryland, Delaware, Virginia and North Carolina) from February 15 through March 15. Although the closure is meant to prevent harbor porpoise takes in gillnet gear, it should also benefit sea turtles by reducing gillnet effort where sea turtles occur during this time period. In addition to regulations implemented under the HPTRP, it is possible that the Atlantic scup gillnet and trap/pot fisheries will be subject to future regulations promulgated under the Sea Turtle Strategy.9.4.3.11 Jonah Crab      Jonah crab is traditionally caught as incidental catch to the Maine lobster fishery. Landings of Jonah crab in the Northeastern U.S. totaled 11.4 million pounds in 2011, with an ex- vessel value of $6.5 million. Nearly all of the landings were accounted for by ALWTRP- regulated gear.Management History      Jonah crab is currently an unregulated species in Federal waters. Little is known about  the species’ biology, distribution, and relative abundance. A recent increase in apparent abundance and market demand has focused new attention on this traditional species caught
incidentally  in  the  Maine lobster fishery.	Landings data over the last decade confirm the emergence of the fishery, with landings peaking in 1997 at just over 4 million pounds.      In September 2003, the Maine Department of Marine Resources (DMR) was granted a one-year Exempted Fishing Permit that allowed up to 100 permitted lobster fishermen to set up to 200 modified lobster traps (in addition to their normal trap allocation) in Federal waters of Federal Lobster Management Area 1.47 Through this process, Maine DMR hopes to demonstrate that the modified lobster trap will catch Jonah crabs only and not lobster. The DMR expects that this study could clarify the sustainability and practicality of a directed Jonah crab fishery in the area (C. Wilson, pers. comm., 2003). DMR implemented biological limits on crabs in 2005 but the Jonah Crab remains unregulated at the Federal level.9.4.3.12 Conch/Whelk      The Atlantic Coast whelk fishery targets two principal species, the knobbed whelk (Busycon carica) and the channeled whelk (Busycon canaliculatum).48 Approximately 2.3 million pounds of whelk were landed in the Northeast U.S. in 2011, with a total ex-vessel value of $9 million. Traps and pots accounted for 78 percent of total landings.Management History      Conch/whelk is currently an unregulated species in Federal waters. The commercial conch/whelk pot fishery extends along the Atlantic coast from Massachusetts to the Carolinas. Little is known about the relative abundance of the conch/whelk resource. Conch/whelk  landings over the last decade have remained steady at approximately two million pounds a year, with a peak in 1994 of approximately 4.1 million pounds.9.4.3.13 Summary of Factors Affecting Fishery Resources      Exhibit 9-15 summarizes the status; the past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions; and the overall effect of those actions on the 12 major fisheries affected by the regulatory alternatives.47 This permit was also granted for the previous fishing year.           48 The knobbed and channeled whelk caught along the Atlantic coast are commonly referred to as "conch" in industry transactions.

9.4.4.1 Management History      In conjunction with the 1996 reauthorization of the MSA through the Sustainable Fisheries Act, Congress amended the MSA by codifying elements of the Habitat Conservation Plan (50 CFR 605.805). Specifically, the 1996 amendments emphasized the importance of habitat protection in maintaining healthy fisheries and promulgated regulations to promote the protection, conservation, and enhancement of the habitats of marine, estuarine, and anadromous finfish, mollusks, and crustaceans. This habitat is termed “essential fish habitat” (EFH) and was broadly defined in the regulations to include “those waters and substrate necessary to fish for spawning, breeding, feeding, or growth to maturity.” Habitat Areas of Particular Concern (HAPCs) are described in the regulations as subsets of EFH. HAPCs are rare habitat areas of special ecological importance that are particularly susceptible to human-induced degradation or located in an environmentally stressed area. Designated HAPCs are not afforded any additional regulatory protection under the Act; however, Federal projects with potential adverse impacts on HAPCs will be more carefully scrutinized during the consultation process.      A second major component of the new habitat regulations required Fishery Management Councils, with guidance from NMFS, to amend their FMPs to describe and protect EFH, and to mitigate any adverse impacts potentially caused by fishing activities. In addition, the regulations provide fishery management options to help guide NMFS and the Councils in reducing adverse impacts on EFH, including, but not limited to, fishing equipment restrictions, time/area closures, and harvest limits.      After the passage of the 1996 amendments, NMFS began development of a final rule implementing the proposed regulations on essential fish habitat. On January 9, 1997 (62 FR 1306) NMFS announced the availability of the “Framework for the Description, Identification, Conservation, and Enhancement of Essential Fish Habitat” (Framework). Over the next year, NMFS held public meetings, briefings, and workshops across the nation to refine the Framework and the pending rule. On December 19, 1997, NMFS issued an interim final rule (62 FR 66531) and on January 20, 1998 the interim final rule took effect. The interim final rule required the Councils to amend fishery management plans by October 1998 and specifically to:• Describe and identify the essential habitat for species managed by the Council;• Minimize, to the extent practicable, adverse effects on EFH caused by fishing; and• Identify other actions to encourage the conservation and enhancement of EFH.      In the Northeast, EFH has been identified for a total of 59 species covered by 14 fishery management plans (FMPs), under the auspices of either the New England Fishery Management Council, Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council, South Atlantic Fishery Management Council, or NMFS. A complete list of managed species with EFH designations in the Northeast, as well as other important habitat parameters, is available at: http://www.nero.noaa.gov/hcd/ .
      After a five-year public review process, NMFS published a final EFH rule on January 17, 2002, replacing the interim final rule of December 19, 1997. The final rule directs the Councils to conduct periodic reviews of the EFH provisions (including HAPCs) of FMPs and revise or amend EFH provisions as warranted. Furthermore, the regulations specify that a  complete review of all EFH information should be conducted at least once every five years.9.4.4.2 Past, Present, and Reasonably Foreseeable Future Actions Affecting Essential Fish Habitat      This section summarizes past and present events affecting essential fish habitat. Events are defined as activities or occurrences that have or had the potential to induce one or more of the following potential effects: alteration of the physical structure; direct mortality of benthic organisms; sediment suspensions; physical and chemical modifications to the water column; benthic community changes; or ecosystem changes. Events can be either external or internal to the trap/pot and gillnet fisheries. In addition, external events can be either human controlled or natural. Past and present events discussed in the section include:• Fishing gear impacts;• Dredging;• Offal discharge;• Vessel groundings;• Port construction and development;• Oil and/or hazardous materials release;• Exotic species;• Toxic algal blooms; and• Storm surges and wind generated waves.Fishing Gear Impacts      The main classes of fishing gear used in the Atlantic EEZ can be separated into two groups: mobile fishing gear such as trawls, and fixed fishing gear such as longline, gillnet, and traps/pots. Each gear type has several components or characteristics that determine its overall effect on the benthic environment. In addition, effects of the gear are dependent on the current condition or health of the substrate and associated organisms, and their ability to rebound from external disturbances.Mobile Fishing Gear      The effects of bottom trawling and other mobile fishing gears on the physical structure of the benthos, sediment suspension, the chemical and physical composition of the water column, and benthic biodiversity (community structure) include changes to living and non-living habitats and potential impacts on prey. External events related to bottom trawling include foreign
fisheries (both pre-and post-MSA), as well as bottom trawling conducted in state waters (past and present). Internal events include the operation of domestic groundfish fisheries under the multispecies FMP.      Otter trawls are one type of mobile trawl gear common to the Atlantic EEZ. Otter trawls fish by pulling conical nets through the water; fish encounter the open forward end and are gathered into a restricted bag or “codend” at the back of the net. Otter trawls, especially those that fish along the bottom for groundfish, have four main components that can connect with the seabed: doors, sweeps, footrope, and netting.      Doors are flattened metal structures that ride vertically in the water column; their sheer weight and force through the water act to horizontally spread the net open and force it down in the water. Some bottom trawl doors use contact with the seafloor to accomplish the spreading and downward pull. On pelagic trawls, the net is pulled above the seafloor and the doors are unlikely to contact the bottom. Trawl doors used in the Atlantic EEZ are typically less than nine feet long.      Sweeps are steel, fiber, or some combination of steel and fiber cables that connect the doors to the trawl net. The cables pass over the bottom at a narrow angle from the direction of travel and herd near-bottom fish toward the net. When used on bottom trawls, these cables commonly come into contact with the seafloor and often have protective disks strung on them. Sweep lengths will vary with the target species fished, substrate characteristics, and individual vessel preference. For example, a large vessel targeting flounder on a smooth bottom may use 1,000 feet of sweeps, while a small cod trawler on rough bottom may only use 100 feet.      The footrope of the trawl is a cable or chain connected along the bottom edge of the trawl net and, on bottom trawls, is designed specifically to contact the seafloor. The footrope usually has rubber cones, spheres, or disks (known collectively as “bobbins”) strung along its entire length. The bobbins serve to limit damage to the netting and reduce bycatch of crabs and other invertebrates. Alternatively, tire gear is used in the center net section, particularly when the preferred fishing grounds consist of a rough substrate, to protect the netting and allow fishing in areas where otherwise it would not be possible. Tire gear consists of used vehicle tires or sections of tires linked side-by-side to form a continuous cylinder.      The netting is the least likely component of bottom trawls to directly contact the seafloor. The bobbins or tire gear act to raise the netting so that only very prominent features of the seafloor could come into contact with the netting without entering the trawl. However, the codend can come into contact with the seafloor, particularly when it contains rocks, substrate, or numerous fish.      The pelagic trawl is a specially modified otter trawl designed for catching fish that inhabit the water above the seabed. These trawls have a very large mesh opening in the forward section and the doors are fished above the bottom. By regulation, these trawls must not use bobbins or other protective devices; therefore, the footropes are small in diameter, and typically consist of bare chain. Since these trawls are fished with the doors above the seafloor,  door effects on substrates are not realized. Because the footrope is unprotected, pelagic trawls are not
used on rough or hard substrates and, therefore, are less likely to contact some of the more vulnerable habitats.Fixed Gear      Fixed gear fisheries, such as gillnet and trap/pot pot fisheries, affect living and non-living benthic physical structure, cause direct mortality of benthic organisms, resuspend sediment, and, if extensive, modify epifaunal and infaunal prey in localized areas. It is unlikely that these fisheries would cause ecosystem-wide effects because of the short-term, site-specific sets of the fixed gear. Activities or events that employ fixed gear include: the various state-managed trap/pot fisheries for lobster, crab, and shrimp; the various fixed gear fisheries managed within the Atlantic EEZ, including American lobster, red crab, Jonah crab, hagfish, and black sea bass; and anchored gillnet fisheries managed under the multispecies, monkfish, and dogfish FMPs. Chapter 2 provides a description of the fixed gear used in ALWTRP regulated fisheries and fisheries proposed to be managed under the ALWTRP.Dredging      Dredging is the action of bringing up sediment from the ocean floor either to deepen navigation channels or to harvest shellfish such as clams and scallops. Dredging has  the potential to change non-living and living habitat, and to affect epifaunal and infaunal  prey. These activities can also resuspend large amounts of sediment and can potentially change the chemical and physical composition of the water column. If widespread and chronic, these  actions can cause overall changes to the benthic community.Offal Discharge49      Offal discharge events have occurred in trap/pot and gillnet fisheries both externally and internally. This discharge can alter the physical structure of the benthos, smother benthic organisms, resuspend sediment, alter the chemical and physical composition of the water column, and, if extensive, cause impacts to the benthic community or ecosystem. The latter two effects are more likely in a closed bay or system where water circulation is impeded. In addition, significant amounts of deposition can decrease the oxygen available to benthic organisms, creating anoxic conditions that only a few species (e.g., polychaetes) can survive.49 Offal is defined as all dead and discarded catch and fish by-catch.
Vessel Groundings      Vessel groundings, both within and external to the trap/pot and gillnet fisheries, influence the physical structure of the benthos and cause direct mortality of benthic organisms. If extensive, these impacts could lead to changes in the benthic community on a very localized, site-specific scale. Therefore, it is unlikely that ecosystem impacts would be realized due to vessel groundings and there are no documented impacts of vessel groundings on EFH.Port Construction and Development      Port construction and development has occurred along the Atlantic coast and is likely to have caused the following impacts on the benthic community: alteration of physical structure, direct mortality, sediment re-suspension, chemical and physical modification of the water column, and localized changes in community structure. The localized, site-specific nature of these events, however, makes it unlikely that they would adversely affect overall ecosystem health.Oil and/or Hazardous Materials Releases      Releases of oil and/or hazardous pollutants into the Atlantic EEZ range from small (less than ten gallon) spills to those of significantly greater magnitude, such as the 35,000 to 55,000 gallon oil spill that occurred on April 27, 2003 in Buzzards Bay (Massachusetts). Large spills cause direct mortality, alter the chemical composition of the water column, and cause changes to the structure of the benthic community.      Oil spills may cover and degrade coastal, inshore and offshore habitats and associated benthic habitats, or may produce a surface slick which disrupts the pelagic community. These impacts can eventually lead to disruption of community organization and dynamics in affected regions. Oil can persist in sediments for years after the initial contamination. Non-point sources of oil include municipal and agricultural run-off, industrial shipping, recreational boating, and contaminated sediments. Point sources include power plant discharge, marine transportation (i.e., ferries, freighters, and tankers), energy and mineral exploration and transportation, and ocean disposal of contaminated dredged material.      Other hazardous pollutants, such as metal contaminants, pesticides and herbicides, and chlorine, can also be found in the water column and persist in the sediments of coastal, inshore, and offshore habitats.Exotic Species      Introduction of non-native, or exotic, organisms can alter the biological and physical composition of freshwater and marine habitats (Rosecchi et al., 1993; Whitman, 1996). The  issue of the introduction of exotic or reared species, including finfish, shellfish, plants, and
parasites, in the wild is a major concern, and possibly the largest single problem faced by aquaculturists, ecologists, and resource managers (deFur and Rader, 1995). Reared and exotic organisms have been released from aquaculture facilities accidentally and intentionally (e.g., stocking programs) (Bedzinger, 1994). The natural community structure may be changed  through increased competition, niche overlap, predation on indigenous organisms, decreased genetic integrity, and transmission of disease. Several methods, including producing sterile organisms and escape-proof facilities, are being developed to lessen the ecological threats associated with exotic and reared organisms (Conkling and Hayden, 1997; MCZM, 1995).Toxic Algal Blooms      Nutrient over-enrichment can lead to organic loading and eutrophic conditions in the water column and benthos. Eutrophication has been associated with the appearance of serious toxic algal blooms throughout the Atlantic EEZ. These external events alter the physical and chemical composition of the water column and can cause mortality to benthic and pelagic organisms. The term “toxic algal blooms” applies not only to toxic microscopic algae, but also  to non-toxic macroalgae (i.e., seaweeds), which can grow uncontrollably and cause ecological impacts such as displacing indigenous species, altering habitat suitability, and depleting oxygen. However, long-term community and ecosystem changes are not likely because the community has adapted to their occurrence and, unless already stressed by other factors, can rebound. On  the other hand, if unable to rebound, impacts include alterations of marine food chains through adverse effects on eggs, juvenile and adult marine invertebrates (e.g., corals, sponges), sea turtles, seabirds, and mammals.Storm Surges and Wind Generated Waves      Storm surges and wind generated waves are external events that are likely to affect EFH through physical alteration of the bottom structure as well as chemical and physical modifications of the water column. However, unless the duration of these events is extensive, or they occur in conjunction with other events known to stress the environment, community and ecosystem changes typically are not realized.9.4.4.3 Management Actions Affecting EFH      This section summarizes management actions influencing essential fish habitat. Management actions are defined as regulations and other specific management decisions that have the potential to mitigate alteration of the physical structure; direct mortality of benthic organisms; sediment suspensions; physical and chemical modifications to the water column; benthic community changes; and ecosystem changes. This section is divided into two sections: external management actions and internal management actions.
9.4.4.3.1 External Management Actions Affecting EFH      External management actions are those determinations or regulations that have been enacted by agencies or governments outside of the jurisdiction of NMFS and the Councils.  These actions have the potential to affect EFH in either a positive or negative manner. The following past and present external management actions have the potential to impact EFH:• the Clean Water Act;• the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972;• the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972;• the Oil Pollution Act of 1990; and• international laws regarding marine pollution.Descriptions of each action are provided in the section discussing the impact of water pollution on Atlantic large whales, Section 9.4.1.4.9.4.4.3.2 Internal Management Actions Affecting EFH      Internal management actions are determinations or regulations that have been enacted by NMFS or the Councils. Internal actions that can clearly benefit EFH include measures such as area closures (depending upon size of area, time closed and habitat type within), gear restrictions/alterations, permitting restrictions, reductions in effort allowed or days at sea (DAS), and possession/trip limits. Some measures such as effort monitoring, crew limits, onboard observers, recreational measures, and Total Allowable Catch (TAC) limits may also benefit habitat. Other measures, such as an increase in fish and mesh size limits, although they are designed to meet stock rebuilding objectives, may have negative habitat effects since they may encourage increased fishing effort to meet catch limits if DAS are not limiting.      This section summarizes internal management actions in the Atlantic EEZ to protect EFH in the New England, Mid-Atlantic, and South Atlantic regions.New England EFH Management Actions      The NEFMC is responsible for the management of fishery resources in Federal waters off Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut. FMPs developed by the NEFMC include plans for Atlantic salmon, Northeast multispecies, sea scallop, Atlantic herring, monkfish, Northeast skate complex, and Atlantic deep-sea red crab.      The first action from the New England Fishery Management Council came with the release of the Omnibus EFH Amendment of 1998 (Omnibus Amendment I). Omnibus Amendment I identified and described the EFH for all species managed by the Council to better
protect, conserve, and enhance this habitat. The EFH descriptions and identifications for New England FMPs were approved on March 8, 1999 for Atlantic salmon (Amendment 1), Northeast multispecies (Amendment 11), and Atlantic sea scallop (Amendment 9). The FMPs for Atlantic deep-sea red crab (2002) and the Northeast skate complex (2002) established EFH descriptions for those fisheries after Omnibus Amendment I was implemented. General provisions implemented through these FMP Amendments include:• Vessel Restrictions: This measure limits the horsepower and size of fishing vessels being replaced or upgraded.• Gear and Crew Restrictions: Restricts the number of crew allowed on a vessel; has an indirect habitat effect by limiting effort.• Days-at-Sea Allocations: Limits overall fishing time and indirectly protects habitat by causing an overall reduction of fishing effort associated with the gears and methods likely to affect habitat.• Closed Areas: Numerous fishery closures and/or restrictions that protect benthic habitat exist in the EFH of various NEFMC-managed fisheries.      Since initial implementation of the Omnibus EFH provisions, the Council has approved the following measures to protect EFH associated with New England fisheries:• Amendment 13 to the Northeast Multispecies FMP: Significant measures implemented to protect essential fish habitat for the groundfish fishery include effort reductions through significant DAS reductions and seasonal closures, as well as closure of habitat areas to all bottom-tending mobile gear.• Amendment 10 to the Atlantic Sea Scallop FMP: Significant measures implemented to protect essential fish habitat for the sea scallop fishery include effort reductions through significant DAS reductions and rotation management; closure of habitat areas to scallop dredge gear; and gear modifications.• Framework 16/39 for the Sea Scallop/Northeast Multispecies FMPs:  A significant portion of this framework is devoted to designating the boundaries for habitat closed areas so that the areas are the same for both fisheries, which is not the case under Amendments 10 and 13.• Amendment 2 to the Monkfish FMP: Significant measures to minimize the impacts of gear effects on monkfish EFH include gear modifications and closed areas.      The guidelines implementing the MSA’s EFH provisions require the Councils to review and revise EFH components of FMPs at least once every five years. On February 24, 2004, the
New England Fishery Management Council, in cooperation with NMFS, published a notice of intent (NOI) to prepare a programmatic EIS and a second Omnibus Amendment to the FMPs for Northeast Multispecies, Atlantic Sea Scallop, Monkfish, Herring, Skates, Atlantic Salmon and Red Crab. Omnibus Amendment II will review the EFH components of all the FMPs managed by the Council, including:• The identification and consideration of new Habitat Areas of Particular Concern (HAPCs) and Dedicated Habitat Research Areas (DHRA);• The integration of alternatives to minimize any adverse effects of fishing on EFH for all species managed by the Council;• A review of the groundfish closed areas, due to the significant amount of spatial overlap between the two types of closed areas; and• An analysis of the impacts of any proposed management measures.      In September 2005, NMFS and NEFMC initiated Omnibus Amendment 2 and published a supplemental NOI to propose a two-phase approach (70 FR 53636). As proposed, the first volume of the EIS will review and update EFH designations and HAPCs; this volume will also update non-fishing impacts and review research and information needs. The second volume of the EIS will review and update existing gear effects evaluations and associated management measures for reducing impacts on EFH. However, in 2009, a second supplemental NOI (74 FR 51126) proposed to recombine the two phases of Omnibus Amendment II and NMFS and the Council will publish a single EIS for Omnibus Amendment II in 2014. Two more supplemental NOIs have been published that announced that (1) the NEFMC added consideration of the groundfish closed areas into the development of Omnibus Amendment II due to significant spatial overlap with the EFH closed areas (76 FR 35408), and that (2) the NEFMC was considering removing consideration of management of deep-sea corals to a separate amendment (77 FR 44214).   These EFH and HAPC alternatives were developed by the Habitat Plan Development Team (PDT) and Committee between 2004 and 2007, and substantially approved by the Council in June 2007. The Habitat PDT made minor updates to some of the EFH maps and text  descriptions during 2010 and 2011, and these changes were approved by the Committee. A few additional updates are pending. All of these alternatives will receive final Council review and approval when the entire EFH Omnibus Amendment is complete. The designations would affect the following FMPs:• Amendment 14 to the Northeast Multispecies FMP• Amendment 14 to the Atlantic Sea Scallop FMP• Amendment 4 to the Monkfish FMP• Amendment 3 to the Atlantic Herring FMP• Amendment 2 to the Red Crab FMP• Amendment 2 to the Skate FMP• Amendment 3 to the Atlantic Salmon FMP
   The Habitat PDT and Committee have developed a new set of habitat management areas designed to minimize adverse effects on EFH from fishing to the extent practicable. Another Council group, the Closed Area Technical Team (CATT), has developed a new set of groundfish closed areas. Throughout 2013, the Habitat PDT and Committee in conjunction with the CATT and the Groundfish Oversight Committee will discuss how to most appropriately combine these two sets of management areas to meet both the goals of EFH management and groundfish stock rebuilding. Omnibus Amendment II is scheduled for final implementation in December 2014.Mid-Atlantic EFH Management Actions      The MAFMC is responsible for the management of fishery resources in Federal waters off New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina. The description and identification of EFH and HAPCs for MAFMC managed species were approved on April 28, 1999 for Atlantic surfclam and ocean quahog (Amendment 12); Atlantic mackerel, squid and butterfish (Amendment 8); and summer flounder, scup, and black sea bass (Amendment 12). EFH descriptions and identifications for Atlantic bluefish (Amendment 1) were approved on July 29, 1999. Spiny dogfish EFH descriptions and identifications were approved on September 29, 1999, and tilefish EFH descriptions and identifications were approved on May 10, 2001. The Council continues to update EFH descriptions and asses gear impacts on EFH. As of September 29, 2011 the following amendments pertaining to EFH are pending a council recommendation or review:• Amendment 11 to the Squid/Mackrel/Butterfish FMP• Amendment 4 to the Bluefish FMP• Amendment 3 to the Dogfish FMP• Amendment 15 to the Surfclam and ocean quahog FMP      The Council has implemented many regulations that have indirectly acted to reduce fishing gear impacts on EFH. For fisheries designated as overexploited, a number of management measures have been implemented that result in a reduction of fishing effort, such as harvest limits, gear restricted areas, and gear restrictions. These measures translate to  a  reduction in gear impacts that can adversely affect habitat.South Atlantic EFH Management Actions      The SAFMC is responsible for the management of fishery resources in Federal waters off the coasts of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and east Florida to Key West. The description and identification of EFH and HAPCs for SAFMC managed species were approved on June 3, 1999 in the Comprehensive Habitat Amendment for snapper/grouper (Amendment 10); Atlantic coast red drum (Amendment 1); Atlantic shrimp fishery (Amendment 3); Atlantic coral, coral reefs, and live/hard bottom habitats (Amendment 4); Atlantic golden crab (Amendment 1); spiny lobster (Amendment 5); and the coastal migratory pelagics fishery (Amendment 10).
      The SAFMC has taken a leading role in the protection of habitat essential to managed species in the South Atlantic. Examples of regulations that directly and indirectly impact South Atlantic EFH include:• Amendment 4 to the FMP for Coral, Coral Reefs, and Live/Hard Bottom Habitats: Through the implementation of the Coral FMP, and subsequent amendments to that plan, the Council has protected coral, coral reefs, and live/hard bottom habitat in the South Atlantic  region. Significant measures implemented in this plan include establishing an optimum yield of zero and prohibiting all harvest or possession of these resources, which serve as essential fish habitat to many managed species.• Oculina Bank Habitat Area of Particular Concern: Another significant measure implemented by the SAFMC is the designation of Oculina Bank as a HAPC. Oculina Bank is a unique and fragile deepwater coral habitat off southeast Florida that is protected from damage by all bottom tending fishing gear.• Amendment 10 to the FMP for the Snapper-Grouper Fishery: To protect EFH, the snapper-grouper FMP prohibits the use of the following gear: bottom longlines in the EEZ inside of 50 fathoms or anywhere south of St. Lucie Inlet, Florida; fish traps; bottom tending (roller-rig) trawls on live bottom habitat; and entanglement gear.      Other actions taken by the Council that directly or indirectly protect habitat or ecosystem integrity include the prohibition of rock shrimp trawling in a designated area around the Oculina Bank; mandatory use of bycatch reduction devices in the penaeid shrimp fishery; a prohibition on the use of drift gill nets in the coastal migratory pelagic fishery; and a mechanism that provides for the concurrent closure of the EEZ to penaeid shrimping if environmental conditions in state waters are such that the overwintering spawning stock is severely depleted.      The SAFMC engaged in a review of all EFH information for South Atlantic fisheries. As was done in developing the original 1998 Habitat Plan, Council habitat staff are conducting a series of technical workshops. The purpose of these workshops is to review the information presented in the 1998 Habitat Plan and update EFH information as necessary. In particular, SAFMC efforts are aimed at integrating comprehensive details of habitat distribution and the biology of managed species, including the characteristics of the food web in which managed species exist. As a result of these workshops SAFMC developed the South Atlantic Council Fishery Ecosystem Plan (FEP) and moved toward habitat conservation through ecosystem based management (EBM). The FEP significantly expands and updates the SAFMC Habitat Plan (SAFMC 2009). The FEP will serve as a source document for future amendments to the FMPs.

Nine of the twelve affected fisheries are discussed:50• 	American lobster;• 	Northeast multispecies;• 	Monkfish;• 	Spiny dogfish;• 	Shark;• 	Coastal migratory pelagic species;• 	Black sea bass;• 	Red crab; and• 	Scup.           50 The remaining three fisheries, hagfish, Jonah crab, and conch/whelk, are not yet regulated under the  MSA and thus, have experienced no significant management actions. In all three cases, however, increased pressure on the resource due to the movement of vessels into the fishery could prompt development of a fishery management plan in the near future.
      For each of the fisheries, the discussion of fishing dependent communities is organized into two sections:• The first presents a summary of fishing communities engaged in the fishery.• The second summarizes the impact of past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future management actions on fishing dependent communities.The information presented in this section is based primarily on fishery management plans prepared by the National Marine Fisheries Service and the fishery management councils, including the New England Fishery Management Council (NEFMC), the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council (MAFMC), the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (SAFMC), and the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC).9.4.5.1 American Lobster      Lobster has consistently ranked among the Atlantic coast's most commercially important species. In 2009 the annual revenue was estimated at $299.5 million. Landings over the past decade have increased from about 60 million pounds in the early 1990s to 97 million pounds in 2009. This dramatic increase is due to several factors, including an increase in the total area and number of traps/pots fished; advancements in trap technology; and increased entrance of new fishermen into the lobster industry.51 Scientists believe that the lobster resource is being overfished and that subsequent years of record high landings may push the fishery to collapse.Fishing Communities      Generally, community dependency on lobster fishing, and more specifically lobster trap fishing, decreases from north to south. While industry participants from downeast (northern) and mid-coast Maine are largely dependent on lobster, lobstermen from southern Maine, Massachusetts and Rhode Island are proportionately less reliant on lobster compared to other fisheries. The community dependency on lobster fishing decreases dramatically south of Rhode Island, and landings of lobster from Connecticut to North Carolina accounted for less than three percent of coastwide landings in 2008 (ASMFC, 2009). Of the approximately 3,152 Federal lobster permits in 2008, 2,311, or about 73 percent hail from Maine and Massachusetts ports. Consequently, vessels from these two states land about 90 percent of the total U.S. lobster harvest (ASMFC, 2009).           51 Advancements in trap technology include a switch to more effective wire traps instead of wood traps; increased trap size; changes in trap design (most notably the rise of “double parlor” traps); and increased soak time (ASMFC, 1997).
Effects of Management Actions on Fishing Dependent Communities      The American lobster fishery is governed through both interstate (ASMFC) and Federal management systems (NMFS). Addendum I to the Interstate Fishery Management Plan under  the ASMFC went into effect in August 1999. This action established a trap limit of 800 traps per vessel for LMA 1 (the Northern New England coast) and controls on fishing effort in LMAs 3, 4, and 5.52 On March 27, 2003, NMFS issued a final rule implementing Federal regulations consistent with Addendum I. Major provisions implemented in this action include:• Limits on the number of vessels to be issued Federal lobster permits, based on historical participation criteria.• Controls on fishing effort by limiting vessels permitted to fish in LMAs 4 and 5 to a maximum of 1,440 traps each; limiting those permitted to fish in the Federal waters of LMA 1 to a maximum of 800 traps each; and establishing a four-year trap reduction schedule in LMA 3.      From a socioeconomic standpoint, the most significant of these provisions is the trap reduction schedule implemented in LMA 3. Under Addendum I, the number of traps fished by Federal permit holders in LMA 3 will be reduced from an estimated 105,821 traps in Year 1 to 96,419 traps in Year 4. The plan contains an initial cap of 2,656 traps per vessel. Vessels that were previously allocated more than 1,200 traps will see their allocations reduced over a four- year period. These reductions will be implemented on a sliding scale, based on historical participation, and will provide each vessel a minimum allocation of 1,200 traps. Vessels that were previously allocated fewer than 1,200 traps (approximately 11 percent of qualifying vessels) are capped at historic qualifying levels, and will not be permitted to exceed this limit in future years. These provisions will reduce the number of traps fished by approximately 20 to 35 percent relative to 1997 and 1992 levels, respectively.      The LMA 3 trap reduction schedule was designed to mitigate the socio-economic impacts of this action to reduce fishing effort. Specifically:• The trap reduction schedule was designed to maintain the permit holder’s market share at historic levels; and• Trap reductions are imposed over a four-year period in an effort to soften the economic impact and minimize sudden and immediate financial hardship.      On June 1, 2012, NMFS issued a final rule establishing a limited entry program for LMA1. The limited entry program established to dissuade a potential flood of new fishers in LMA1 that could upset lobster stock stability and undermine social and cultural fishing           52 This action and all interstate actions under the ASMFC are not bound by Federal regulations to conduct an environmental impact statement under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Therefore, no Federal analyses of the economic or social impacts of these actions were prepared.
traditions. At the time of the proposed rule, the draft EA (now final) showed that 1,643 Federal lobster permits will likely qualify under this action. According to the draft and final EA, of the 3,152 Federal lobster permits in existence, 1,509 permit holders will likely not qualify into the Area 1 trap fishery. Of this 1,509 total, the vast majority (1,419 permit holders) are from locales south of Area 1 waters and/or have never sought to fish with traps in Area 1 in the past.      While it is difficult to discern the overall socioeconomic impacts of these restrictions, it is clear that the lobster fishery is unlikely to continue the growth and revenue trends realized in the 1990s. Additional restrictions on access and reductions in effort are expected to continue in  order to prevent overexploitation of the lobster resource. Fishermen and fishing communities active and/or dependent on the lobster resource in LMA 2 and 6 may be particularly vulnerable to increased regulatory costs as a result of the 1999 mass mortality event in Long Island Sound.9.4.5.2 Northeast Multispecies      For centuries, Atlantic groundfish stocks have supported a fishery that has served to shape the economy and culture of New England. Development of advanced gear technologies, electronic navigation, fish-finding tools, and increased vessel power during the 20th century greatly expanded the New England groundfish fishery. In response to these pressures, Amendment 5 (1994) to the Multispecies FMP capped fishery participation and established additional measures to reduce fishing effort. Subsequently, between 1995 and 2000, commercial landings of groundfish increased 19.4 percent. The value of commercial groundfish landings in the year 2002 was approximately $114 million.      Since the implementation of Amendment 5 in 1994, the aggregate biomass of New England groundfish stocks has nearly tripled, increasing from 161,217 metric tons (mt) in 1994 to 451,346 metric tons in 2000 (NEFMC, 2004b). Among the species that have demonstrated dramatic increases since 1994 are Georges Bank haddock, yellowtail flounder, and winter flounder. For other stocks, however, little progress has been made, as harvest levels remain too high and further regulations are required to reduce fishing mortality. The stocks requiring the largest reduction in fishing mortality are Gulf of Maine cod, Georges Bank cod, Cape Cod/Gulf of Maine, yellowtail flounder, Southern New England/Mid-Atlantic yellowtail flounder, Southern New England/Mid-Atlantic winter flounder, white hake, window pane flounder (Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank), and witch flounder.Fishing Communities      While there are over 100 communities that are homeport to one or more Northeast groundfish vessels, the multispecies fleet is dominated by vessels with home ports in Massachusetts and Maine. In general, larger vessels have home ports in southern states (North Carolina, Virginia, and Florida) while smaller vessels are based in northern states (Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Maine). Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Rhode Island vessels landed 97.4 percent of the groundfish in FY 2009. Permitted multispecies vessels with home ports in some southern New England and Mid-Atlantic states, though contributing a high percentage of landings to the total, are less active than Maine and New Hampshire vessels in the groundfish fishery. States in southern New England and the Mid-
Atlantic may be more dependent on non-groundfish fisheries such as scup, squid, mackerel and butterfish.      Groundfish landings have fluctuated in recent years. Landings declined from 80 million pounds in FY 2004 to 50 million pounds in FY 2006. Landings increased in FY 2008 to 66 million pounds only to decrease again in FY 2009 to 63 million pounds (Exhibit 9-17). In 2009, the dockside value of these groundfish landings was slightly less than $60 million.      In the Environmental Assessment for the proposed regulations to implement Framework Adjustment 46 to the Multispecies Fishery Management Plan, NMFS examined groundfish landings by port from 2001-2009 to identify primary and secondary communities engaged in the groundfish fishery. Primary communities are identified as those substantially engaged in the groundfish fishery based on historical participation and landings and which are most likely to be affected by any groundfish measures under the changes. Secondary communities are those that may not be substantially dependent or engaged in the groundfish fishery, but have demonstrated some participation in the fishery since the 1994 fishing year. Exhibit 9-18 provides a summary of the available information on these primary and secondary communities.

Beginning in 1994 with Amendment 5, seven management actions have been implemented with high adverse impacts on fishing dependent communities. The significant provisions implemented in these actions have included drastic cuts in days-at-sea allocations, trip limits, and fishing closures. Exhibit 9-19 presents a summary of management actions from 1977 to 2012 resulting in moderate to high adverse impacts on fishing dependent communities.

The analysis of economic impacts presented in the Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (FSEIS) made the following conclusions about the impact of Amendment 13 on fishing dependent communities:• Those vessels or communities that are most dependent on groundfish will be most affected by the proposed action. These communities include the ports of Boston, Chatham/Harwichport, New Bedford, Portland, and Upper Mid-Coast Maine.• Median revenue losses for gillnet and hook gear, expected to be 9.7 and7.7 percent respectively, are much lower than for trawl gear, with an expected median revenue loss of 22.7 percent.
• Twenty-five percent of the vessels that claim Maine, New Hampshire, or Massachusetts as a homeport will lose at least one-third of gross revenues.• For those vessels that rely on groundfish for seventy-five percent or more of their fishing revenue, the median expected revenue loss is thirty-five percent.• Looking at impacts on vessels by size, the FSEIS concluded that the proposed action would have larger revenue impacts on large as compared to smaller vessels.      More specifically, gillnet gear groups would seem to be split between vessels that may experience significant revenue losses and vessels that may experience revenue gains. This disparity is likely due to differences in dependence on Georges Bank cod and Gulf of Maine cod. Because cod tends to represent a higher proportion of total fishing income for gillnet vessels, revenue is very sensitive to changes in cod trip limits      Amendment 16 was implemented in May 2010, extensively revised and expanded the use of sectors to mitigate (to the extent possible) the economic impacts. Amongst the changes were expanded requirements for sector operations plans, including detailed monitoring systems. Sector vessels are also granted a number of exemptions from existing effort control regulations in exchange for constraining catch to their allocated quotas. Seventeen sectors are now in operation, encompassing nearly half of the limited access northeast multispecies permits and over 90 percent of historical groundfish landings. Those groundfish vessels that did not join a sector are subject to trip limits drawing from the balance of the overall quota, or roughly 10 percent of the quotas for groundfish species, known as the common pool. Nearly half of all Federal groundfish vessels (714 of 1,473) participate in the common pool sector.9.4.5.3 Monkfish      Traditionally, monkfish was taken as incidental catch in the groundfish and sea scallop fisheries, having little to no commercial value. Beginning in the late 1980s, commercial landings in the monkfish fishery increased dramatically in response to an increase in the market value of the species, combined with a decline in the abundance of traditional New England species.      Concern over management of the monkfish resource first arose in the early 1990s. In 1997, a stock assessment for the monkfish resource concluded the stock was over-exploited. The 2006 NEFMC Monkfish Stock Assessment and Fishery Evaluation (SAFE) report reviewed the status of the monkfish resource and found that monkfish are overfished in both the northern and southern areas (NEFMC/MAFMC, 2006).      Landings have declined each year since FY2005, and are approximately 40% of what they were at the peak in FY2003 (Exhibit 9-20).
Exhibit 9-20Fishing Communities      Because of the nature of the monkfish fishery, the vessels and communities involved with it overlap with those involved with the multispecies (groundfish) and scallop fisheries. Many vessels that target monkfish or catch them incidentally also target groundfish or scallops. All but six percent of the limited access monkfish permit holders hold limited access multispecies or scallop permits.      The Monkfish SAFE report identifies both primary and secondary monkfish communities. Primary monkfish ports are defined as those averaging more than $1 million in monkfish revenues from 1994 to 1997 (based on dealer weighout data). Secondary communities are defined as those that averaged more than $50,000 in monkfish revenues from 1994 to 1997. Exhibit 9-21 summarizes the primary and secondary monkfish ports identified in the Monkfish SAFE report.

The FMP adopts a rebuilding strategy that takes place over ten years.      The FMP relies primarily on the implementation of a series of annual days-at-sea allocations over four years to reduce fishing mortality on monkfish stocks. An analysis of the economic impacts of the DAS reduction according to the ten-year rebuilding strategy was completed when the Monkfish FMP was approved in 1998. This analysis concluded that monkfish landings should be expected to be less than the status quo for eight years (i.e., from 1999 to 2007), until stock rebuilding allows for the harvest of higher yields. Gross revenues  were also expected to decline, relative to status quo, through 2006, and then to begin recovering.      Past actions implemented under the Monkfish FMP have served to rebuild the fishery and neither the stocks in the northern or southern fishery management areas are overfished, nor is overfishing occurring. This management trend should continue through the adoption of the proposed biomass reference points which will be neutral or positive for monkfish stocks since, while not directly affecting fishing effort, provide the basis for monitoring stock status and achieving optimum yield from the fishery while preventing overfishing. The rebuilding of the monkfish resource over the past decade, along with the stability afforded by the multi-year specifications-setting process have had an overall positive effect on the affected human communities (NEFMC 2011b).
9.4.5.4 Spiny Dogfish      The spiny dogfish traditionally was considered an “under-utilized” species of relatively minor value to the domestic fisheries of the U.S. Atlantic Coast. With the decline of the groundfish fishery in recent years, an increase in directed fishing for dogfish resulted in a nearly ten-fold increase in landings from 1987 to 1996.      On April 3, 1998, NMFS declared spiny dogfish overfished. The agency approved the first Spiny Dogfish FMP on September 29, 1999 (effective April 3, 2000). To reduce fishing mortality, the Spiny Dogfish FMP contains a restrictive rebuilding schedule allowing only limited, incidental catch of dogfish until the stock is rebuilt. For the period from May 1, 2000 through April 30, 2002, the annual quota was set at 4 million pounds, with trip limits of 600 pounds and 300 pounds for quota periods I and II, respectively. NMFS proposed the same  annual quota and trip limits for the 2003 fishing year beginning May 1, 2003.      The most recent peer-reviewed evaluation of the status of the Northwest Atlantic spiny dogfish stock was conducted at the 43rd Northeast Regional Stock Assessment Workshop. According to that assessment the spiny dogfish stock is not overfished and overfishing is not occurring and the stock is rebuilt (MAFMC 2008).Fishing Communities      Spiny dogfish are landed in every state from Maine to North Carolina. However, prior to 1990, Massachusetts was responsible for the vast majority of commercial spiny dogfish landings. Beginning in 1989 (as the U.S. fishery expansion began), dogfish landings in the states of New Jersey, Maryland and Maine began to increase in importance. By 1996, the expansion of the spiny dogfish fishery had occurred in virtually every state in New England and the Mid-Atlantic, especially in North Carolina.      For fishing years 2000-2004 combined, the majority of commercial landings were made in Massachusetts ports (72 percent), with another percent made in New Jersey and North Carolina. Exhibit 9-22 identifies the primary ports of spiny dogfish landings from 2000 to 2005.Primary PortCommercial Landings (lbs)Chatham, MA2,186,000Gloucester, MA458,000Provincetown, MA258,000Plymouth, MA256,000Hatteras, NC149,000Salisbury, MA143,000Point Judith, MA126,000Harwichport, MA123,000
Effects of Management Actions on Fishing Dependent Communities      The rebuilding schedule identified in the original Spiny Dogfish FMP was expected to eliminate overfishing and rebuild the spiny dogfish stock in the shortest possible time. The management measures required to achieve this goal, however, are expected to have significant economic consequences for the fishery. The FMP establishes an annual quota on landings that will be maintained at under 4.4 million pounds until the target biomass is reached. According to the EIS for the FMP, this quota would result in a 30 percent reduction in landings in Year 1, leading to a decrease in gross revenues of greater than five percent for approximately 149 vessels and two processors. In Year 2, the quota will impose an 89 percent reduction in total landings (relative to the status quo) and 232 harvesters would face a reduction of revenues greater than five percent. The decline in landings could force at least 12 spiny dogfish harvesters to cease operations. In addition, the decline in volume would hamper processors’ ability to process spiny dogfish in a cost-effective manner. This could result in the elimination of dogfish processing operations, the potential loss of approximately 200 jobs, and virtual elimination of the directed spiny dogfish fishery. These measures were deemed necessary, however, to restore the stock.9.4.5.5 Directed Shark      In the Atlantic Ocean, the directed shark fishery is most active in southern waters. Authorized gear types include: pelagic or bottom longline, gillnet, rod and reel, handline, or bandit gear. However, shark gillnets are the only portion of the fishery that is affected by the ALWTRP. The authorized shark species in the Atlantic highly migratory species management include large coastal sharks (LCS) (blacktip, bull, lemon, nurse, spinner, silky, tiger, great hammerhead, smooth hammerhead, and scalloped hammerhead), small coastal sharks (SCS) (Atlantic sharpnose, blacknose, bonnethead, finetooth) and pelagic sharks (blue, common thresher, oceanic whitetip, porbeagle, shortfin mako). Overall, the status of the LCS and pelagic sharks complex are unknown. The SCS complex is not overfished and overfishing is not occurring.

This number is based on an analysis of commercial landings data, dealer permit data, and vessel permit data. Currently, fishermen in the states of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and Georgia, possess a total 277 incidental and directed shark permits54. These fishermen are located in 122 different cities throughout the southeast Atlantic United States. Communities where the directed shark fishery operates (including all gear types) and where this fishery overlaps with the ALWTRP action area include the following:• North Carolina. There are 16 licensed shark dealers in North Carolina operating in 13 locations. There are 17 directed shark permits and 12 incidental shark permits held by fishermen in North Carolina.53 Consolidated Atlantic Highly Migratory Species Fisheries Management Plan. Amendment 1.

There are 29 licensed shark dealers in Florida operating in 25 locations. On the Atlantic side of the state there are 17 dealers operating  in 16 locations. There are 126 directed shark permits and 135 incidental shark permits held by fishermen in Florida.Effects of Management Actions on Fishing Dependent Communities      The following information regarding Amendment 2 and 3 was acquired from the 2011 Stock Assessment and Fishery Evaluation (SAFE) Report for Atlantic Highly Migratory Species55. Based on 2005 and 2006 stock assessments, NMFS further revised shark management measures and rebuilding periods in Amendment 2 to the 2006 Consolidated Atlantic Highly Migratory Species Fishery Management Plan on June 24, 2008 (73 FR 35778; corrected on July 15, 2008, 73 FR 40658). In the final rule, NMFS removed sandbar sharks from the LCS  complex and established a non-sandbar LCS complex that was split into two regions (Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico). Amendment 2 also implemented new annual adjusted quotas for sandbar sharks, non-sandbar LCS, and a porbeagle shark commercial quota. Amendment 2 also required that all sharks be landed with all fins attached to the carcass through landing and offloading.      Stock assessments results from 2007 for blacknose and shortfin mako sharks required NMFS to publish Amendment 3 to the Consolidated HMS FMP (75 FR 30484; June 1, 2010). This amendment created a species specific quota for blacknose sharks, modified the quota for the non-blacknose SCS, added smooth dogfish to the management unit and established a quota, and would take action at the international level through international fishery management organizations to establish management measures to end overfishing of shortfin mako sharks.      Passerotti et al. 2011 further summarized the effects of Amendment 256: Since the implementation of Amendment 2, the directed LCS gillnet fishery has been greatly reduced. The 33-head LCS trip limit has essentially ended the strike net fishery and limited the number of fishers targeting LCS with drift gillnet gear. The SCS fishery was also limited by Amendment 2, but was more directly impacted by Amendment 3 which significantly reduced the SCS quota and established an individual quota for blacknose sharks. As a result, many gillnet fishers that historically targeted sharks are now targeting teleost species with varying types of gillnet gear.55 Consolidated Atlantic Highly Migratory Species Fisheries Management Plan.

      The following information regarding Amendment 5 was acquired from the 2011 Stock Assessment and Fishery Evaluation (SAFE) Report for Atlantic Highly Migratory Species57. Recently, NMFS updated the stock status determinations for blacknose, sandbar, and dusky sharks (76 FR 62331; October 7, 2011). The blacknose shark stock was split into two regions with the Atlantic stock being determined as overfished with overfishing occurring, and the Gulf of Mexico stock status was determined to be unknown. The status of sandbar sharks was determined to be overfished with no overfishing occurring, which is a change from the previous determination of overfished with overfishing occurring. The status of dusky sharks is unchanged and remains overfished with overfishing occurring. NMFS also determined that the status of the scalloped hammerhead shark stock is overfished with overfishing occurring (76 FR 23794; April 28, 2011). As a result of these stock assessments, NMFS is currently developing Amendment 5 to the Consolidated Atlantic Highly Migratory Species Fishery Management Plan.9.4.5.6 Coastal Migratory Pelagic Species      The Coastal Migratory Pelagic (CMP) Species Fishery (managing Spanish mackerel, King mackerel, and cobia) is based primarily in waters off the southeastern United States. Landings in the South Atlantic portion of the CMP fishery for 2011 were approximately 7.5 million pounds.58 According to a recent status report, neither king mackerel, Spanish mackerel, nor cobia was classified as overfished or experiencing overfishing59. In 2005, NMFS adopted Amendment 15 to the FMP for CMP Resources. The amendment defined a limited access  system and made permanent what had previously been a temporary moratorium on king mackerel permits. Amendment 18 further established annual catch limits, annual catch targets, and accountability measures for king mackerel, Spanish mackerel, and cobia.Fishing Communities      The South Atlantic portion of the CMP fishery extends from North Carolina to Florida. To assess the importance of coastal migratory pelagic species in these areas, Exhibit 9-24 notes the contribution of coastal migratory pelagic species to total landings in each state. As the  exhibit shows, the majority of landings for the fishery are from Florida. Fishing community analyses from the recent Amendment 18 from CMP FMP reveal the following60. The top two fishing communities for Spanish and king mackerel were Cocoa and Ft. Pierce, Florida.  Hatteras, North Carolina has the third most landings for Spanish and king mackerel within the South Atlantic region. For cobia, the top three fishing communities, in terms of landings, were Cocoa, Mayport, and Jupiter, Florida.57 Consolidated Atlantic Highly Migratory Species Fisheries Management Plan.

Since the mid-1980s, the fishing communities associated with the coastal migratory pelagic fishery have been subject to a series of management actions designed to reduce fishing mortality and rebuild overfished king and Spanish mackerel stocks. Implemented management actions have included total allow catch quotas (TACs), trip limits, fish size limits, and gear restrictions. These management measures have succeeded in rebuilding the Atlantic migratory groups of king and Spanish mackerel into stocks no longer considered to be overfished or undergoing overfishing. The most recent major management action in January 2012 established annual catch limits (ACL), annual catch targets (ACT), and accountability measures (AMs) for king and Spanish mackerel and cobia.Atlantic king mackerel:ACL: 10.46 million pounds (6.58 million pounds recreational, 3.88 million pounds commercial) ACT: No ACT for the commercial sector; 6.11 million pounds for the recreational sectorAMs: Close the commercial sector when the commercial ACL (quota) is reached; reduce the  bag limit or season length the following year if the recreational ACL (quota) is reached. Only make bag limit or season length adjustments if the total ACL is exceeded. If a sector-specific ACL is exceeded, reduce the sector-specific ACL the following year by the amount of the overage, only if the stock is overfished and if the total ACL is exceeded.Atlantic Spanish mackerel:ACL: 5.69 million pounds (2.56 million pounds recreational, 3.13 million pounds commercial) ACT: No ACT for the commercial sector, 6.11 million pounds for the recreational sectorAMs: Close the commercial sector when the commercial ACL (quota) is reached; reduce the  bag limit or season length the following year if the recreational ACL (quota) is reached. Only make bag limit or season length adjustments if the total ACL is exceeded. If a sector-specific ACL is exceeded, reduce the sector-specific ACL the following year by
the amount of the overage, only if the stock is overfished and if the total ACL is exceeded.Atlantic cobia:ACL: 1,571,399 pounds (1,445,687 pounds recreational, 125,712 pounds commercial) ACT: No ACT for the commercial sector, 1,184,688 pounds for the recreational sectorAMs: Close the commercial sector when the commercial ACL (quota) is reached; reduce the  bag limit or season length the following year if the recreational ACL (quota) is reached. Only make bag limit or season length adjustments if the total ACL is exceeded. If a sector-specific ACL is exceeded, reduce the sector-specific ACL the following year by the amount of the overage, only if the stock is overfished and if the total ACL is exceeded.These actions are expected to result in positive economic and social impacts for South Atlantic mackerel fishermen.9.4.5.7 Black Sea Bass9.4.5.7.1 Northern Fishery      The northern portion of the black sea bass fishery extends from Cape Hatteras to the U.S./Canada border. The stock has been considered rebuilt since 2009 (ASFMC 2010).Fishing Communities      According to NMFS weigh out landings data, in 1999, black sea bass was landed in 99 ports from Maine to North Carolina. In order to assess the importance of black sea bass to  fishing dependent communities, NMFS considered the proportion or contribution of black sea bass to total revenue from all landings (fishing revenue dependence) in each port. Black sea bass accounted for less than five percent of total revenues at 84 of the 99 ports reporting black sea bass landings. Black sea bass accounted for five to ten percent of revenues at six ports and greater than ten percent of revenues at nine ports (MAFMC and ASMFC, 2002). Since 1998 landings have ranged from 2.86 to 3.53 million pounds with a decrease in landings in 2009 from 2008 of a total of 1.4 million pounds (ASMFC 2010).Effects of Management Actions on Fishing Dependent Communities      The first major management action for the Black Sea Bass fishery was implemented in 1998 under Amendment 9 to the Summer Flounder, Scup, and Black Sea Bass FMP.  Amendment 9 established a quarterly commercial quota for the fishery, a necessary action to advance the recovery of the black sea bass stock. The Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) for this action reviewed 1999 landing statistics to determine the reliance of key ports on black sea bass landings. Based on this information, the FEIS concluded that black sea bass landings were not of critical importance to the commercial fishing industry in the key ports identified.
      Since the implementation of this action, however, significant social and economic impacts have resulted from Amendment 9. Although the quarterly quota system was designed to allow for landings in each of the four periods, early fishery closures occurred in the second, third, and fourth quarters of 1999 and 2000. In 2001, the black sea bass fishery was only open  for approximately two months during a six-month period between July and December. The unintended result of the quarterly quota system has been a series of long closures associated with significant social and economic consequences for fishing communities. For example:• Reduced or inconsistent streams of income can cause significant financial hardships for fishermen dependent on the black sea bass fishery;• Fluctuating supply can result in decreased market demand;• Short open periods for the fishery can result in “derby-style” fishing that promotes unsafe fishing practices (e.g., fishermen will fish in unsafe weather in order to catch “their share” of the quota); and• Derby-style fishing practices may also favor larger, more mobile vessels that may be able to land more fish at the beginning of each period than smaller, less mobile vessels.      In addition, inter-regional inequities may have been created as a result of the coastwide quota system, with landings shifted to the north. For example, in the last quarter of 2000, Massachusetts accounted for 41 percent of black sea bass landings (MAFMC and ASFMC, 2002). A shift in abundance of black sea bass to the north could account for this concentration of landings; however, some fishermen have also indicated that the restrictive possession limits favored fishing operations in the north, where black sea bass are caught closer to shore.      To address the negative impacts of Amendment 9, the NEFMC initiated development of Amendment 13. Amendment 13, approved March 4, 2003, implemented a state-by-state allocation system of the annual commercial quota. This system allows for a more equitable distribution of the commercial quota without the additional burden of Federal monitoring by NMFS. In this system, states are allowed to design allocation programs based on possession limits and seasons that ensure a continuous and steady supply of fish throughout the year and/or establish a fair and equitable distribution of black sea bass to all fishermen who have traditionally landed black sea bass in their state. The FEIS concluded that this system is likely to eliminate derby-style fishing and reduce the likelihood of seasonal closures. Amendment 13 is expected to have overall positive economic and social impacts to black sea bass fishing communities.      The FMP has been amended multiple times since Amendment 13. Each of these actions have been administrative in nature or have affected the recreational fishery.
9.4.5.7.2 Southern Fishery      The southern portion of the black sea bass fishery extends from Cape Hatteras, NC to Cape Canaveral, FL, but the majority of the pot fishery is concentrated off North Carolina and northern South Carolina (Exhibit 9-25). The southern stock of black sea bass is no longer undergoing overfishing61 (fishing mortality if above threshold). The fishery is no longer overfished (biomass below threshold and is rebuilt62.Exhibit 9-252011 Commercial Landings by Pounds and ValueStateBlack Sea Bass Landings (lbs) Black Sea Bass Landings (dollarsAll Species Landings (lbs)All Species Landings (dollars)North Carolina272,189$627,74467,480,815$71,171,882Florida (East Coast)134,616$164,07731,245,100$60,673,426GeorgiaData not available12,646,360$16,295,007South Carolina176,039$296,69813,559,035$28,284,297Source: Annual Commercial Landings Statistics.

In North Carolina, black sea bass are the second most targeted snapper grouper species after vermilion snapper. From 2008-2010, in North Carolina, black sea bass pot gear landings were the highest in Onslow County, particularly from vessels with the home port of the community of Sneads Ferry. Pender County had the next highest landings during this time period, and most of these were from the communities of Hampstead and Topsail Beach.      In South Carolina, from 2008-2010, cumulative black sea bass pot gear landings were greatest in Horry County, with most landings in the community of Little River. Georgetown County has the next highest pot gear landings of black sea bass and most landings are associated with the communities of Georgetown and Murrell's Inlet. In Charleston County (the third highest landings of black sea bass), most landings are reported from the community of McClellanville.61National Marine Fisheries Service - 3rd Quarter 2013 Update Table A.

      Only one community in Georgia, Townsend, lands a substantial amount of snapper grouper species but in general black sea bass is not a significant part of the commercial harvest.       Commercial harvest of black sea bass has historically not been  as prominent in Florida as in North Carolina and South Carolina, but Florida fishermen report that there is more interest in the fishery in recent years. Monroe County has the highest pot gear landings for black sea  bass in Florida, followed by Miami-Dade County and Volusia County. It should be noted that while these landings are associated with the home ports, the vessels may fish in other areas or states.Effects of Management Actions on Fishing Dependent Communities      During the past eight years, the black sea bass pot fishery in the South Atlantic has undergone significant changes as a result of regulatory attempts to control black sea bass harvest and prevent protected species interactions. The black sea bass pot segment of the snapper-grouper fishery is required to adhere to all regulations stipulated in the ALWTRP64. Provisions that have been implemented for the snapper grouper fishery as a whole affect the black sea bass component of the fishery in addition to any black sea bass-specific provisions. The following information reflects all provisions directly applicable to black sea bass harvest (includes all gear types).      Amendment 13C to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Snapper-Grouper Fishery of the South Atlantic Region65 implemented actions to phase out overfishing of black sea bass. Amendment 13C specified a commercial quota of 477,000 pounds gutted weight (563,000 pounds whole weight) in year 1 (2006); 423,000 pounds gutted weight (499,000 pounds whole weight) in year 2; and 309,000 pounds gutted weight (364,000 pounds whole weight) in year 3 onwards until modified. After the commercial quota is met, all purchase and sale is prohibited and harvest and/or possession is limited to the bag limit. Amendment 13C also required the use of at least 2” mesh for the entire back panel of black sea bass pots, and changed the fishing year from the calendar year to June 1 through May 31. Additionally, Amendment 13C required that black sea bass pots be removed from the water when the quota is met. According to the final environmental impact statement (FEIS) for Amendment 13C the overall expected economic impact from these measures would result in short-term losses in net revenue that would increase by an average of $0.07 million, $0.19 million, and $0.28 million during years 1, 2, and 3.      Amendment 17B to the FMP66 established annual catch limits (ACLs) and accountability measures (AMs) for species undergoing overfishing, including black sea bass. Amendment 17B set the commercial ACL for black sea bass at 309,000 pounds gutted weight, and the recreational black sea bass ACL at 409,000 pounds gutted weight consistent with the management measures and rebuilding plan established for black sea bass in Amendments 13C and 15A to the FMP.The commercial sector AM for black sea bass remained the same and prohibited sale of the species and limited harvest to the bag limit when the ACL is met or projected to be met. The64 Specifics of the ATWTRP regulations as they apply to South Atlantic black sea bass are contained in Appendix Dof the whale take reduction website: http://www.nero.noaa.gov/whaletrp/.65 SAFMC South Atlantic Snapper Grouper Amendment 13C.

Available at http://www.safmc.net/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=9BXhV2vGiyM%3d&tabid=415
recreational AM was applied to black grouper, black sea bass, gag, red grouper, and vermilion snapper, and the recreational ACL was compared to the recreational landings over a range of 3 years. If at least one of the species is overfished and the sector ACL is projected to be met, harvest and retention of the species or species group was prohibited. If the recreational ACL was exceeded, independent of stock status, the Regional Administrator would publish a notice to reduce the recreational sector ACL in the following season by the amount of the overage. No overall economic impacts were expected as a result of establishing the commercial and recreational ACLs for black sea bass since they did not change the previously established commercial quota and recreational allocation. The expected economic impacts of the changes in AMs on the recreational sector could not be quantified and, as a result, were not provided in the FEIS; however, the qualitative analysis of the expected economic effects concluded that averaging of harvests over a range of years would allow consideration of both short-term and long-term economic effects, and the ACL payback provisions would provide better protection to overfished stocks, thereby improving the likelihood of protecting the long-term economic benefits of the resource to affected communities.      Regulatory Amendment 9 to the FMP67 reduced the black sea bass recreational bag limit from 15 fish per person per day to 5 fish per person per day in an effort to reduce the rate of recreational harvest and prolong the recreational fishing season. The 5-fish recreational bag limit was expected to reduce headboat harvest by 14%, charter harvest by 20%, and private mode harvest by 5% but, by reducing harvest, the open season for black sea bass was expected to be extended. Extending the black sea bass recreation open season was projected to result in an increase in for-hire vessel profits of from approximately $45,000 to $164,000.      Amendment 18A to the FMP68 modified the recreational and commercial AMs implemented in Amendment 17B by removing the use of the three year running average for the recreational sector and allowing the recreational sector to be closed when the ACL is met or projected to be met regardless of the stock status. For the commercial sector, Amendment 18A modified the commercial AM established in Amendment 17B to include a payback provision if the commercial ACL is exceeded. Amendment 18A also established an endorsement program for the black sea bass pot segment of the snapper-grouper fishery, established a 1,000 pound gutted weight trip limit for black sea bass, modified the current recreational and commercial minimum size limits for black sea bass, limited the number of black sea bass pots that can be fished on a trip, and required all black sea bass pots to be brought back to shore at the end of every trip. Given the variety of factors that affect fisheries, persistent data issues, and the complexity of trying to identify cause-and-effect relationships, it is not possible to differentiate actual or cumulative regulatory effects from external cause-induced effects. In general, it can be stated that the increasingly complex and burdensome regulatory environment for all fisheries, in addition to other adverse influences, has increased the likelihood of economic losses, business failure, occupational changes, and associated adverse pressures on associated families, communities, and industries. Some reversal of this trend is possible and expected. The establishment of an endorsement program for black sea bass and modification to the rebuilding strategy is expected to result in long-term positive impacts on the fishery and associated fishing67 SAFMC South Atlantic Snapper Grouper Regulatory Amendment 9.

communities. By limiting the number of participants and effort in the fishery and increasing allowable harvest as the stock rebuilds, overcapitalization may be avoided and derby conditions may diminish.      Regulatory Amendment 19 specified the ABC and revised the OY, the commercial and recreational ACLs, and the recreational ACT. Also, this amendment established an annual prohibition on the use of black sea bass trap/pots in the South Atlantic from November 1 through April 30. The increases to the annual catch limit for black sea bass in South Atlantic waters is likely to have primarily positive social and economic effects. The increased ACL is expected to lengthen the commercial and recreational seasons for black sea bass. It would be expected that commercial and recreational fishermen may be able to keep more black sea bass that might be discarded otherwise, and increased commerce for for-hire fishers and associated businesses would be expected to improve. An increase in the ACL for black sea bass can provide opportunities for commercial and recreational fishermen if access to another target species becomes limited through regulatory or environmental changes69.      Some negative social and economic effects could result from the proposed changes in the black sea bass ACL. If the ACL is increased but derby fishing continues (which shortens the season and contributes to an increase in regulatory discards), then the perceived social benefits would not accrue and could be negative in contrast. An increase in the ACL of this popular fish may also result in an effort shift from other fisheries and this could reduce the likelihood of the expected lengthened seasons by continuing the derby conditions.      Additionally, a longer commercial season for black sea bass will coincide with right whale calving season. If the commercial ACL is not met before November 1, the pot sector of the commercial black sea bass fishery would forfeit some of the economic benefits of the extended season.9.4.5.8 Red Crab      Since the early 1970s there has been a small directed red crab fishery off the New England and Mid-Atlantic coasts. Though the size and intensity of this fishery has fluctuated since its origin, it has remained consistently small relative to more prominent New England fisheries such as groundfish, sea scallops, and lobster. Throughout the 1980s, landings averaged approximately 5.5 million pounds per year. In the mid-1990s, landings increased substantially, peaking in 2001 at 8.8 million pounds. In recent years landings have decreased to less than 3 million pounds in 2007 and 2008.Fishing Communities69 http://www.safmc.net/sites/default/files/meetings/pdf/Public%20Hearings%20&%20Scoping/Nov%202013%20-%20webinars/sa_reg_am19_appen.pdf
      The directed commercial fishery for deep-sea red crab has relatively few participants. Since the implementation of the FMP 4 vessels have harvested the total landings for the fishery. Six ports were identified as the primary ports of vessel operations and mooring: Fall River, Gloucester, and New Bedford, Massachusetts; Bristol, Maine; Portsmouth, Rhode Island; and Tiverton, Rhode Island.      The type of service industries used by the red crab fishery include: fuel, ice, food and groceries, bait, gear, oil/lubrication, water, hull maintenance, engine maintenance, electronics, insurance, accounting, legal advice, and dockage. The fishery-related service industries in the New Bedford, Massachusetts, area provide more support to the red crab fishery than all other locations combined. Due to the small size of the fishery and the small number of fishing vessels involved, however, it is unlikely that providing these services to red crab vessels accounts for more than a very minor component of any service industry’s overall fishery-related revenue.      All vessels fish out of New Bedford, MA due to the new crab processing plan that was established in August 2009. The vessels in the fishery believe that red crab could not have withstood the level of fishing effort occurring prior to the FMP implementation (NEFMC 2011b).Effects of Management Actions on Fishing Dependent Communities      The most recent management action affecting the red crab fishery is the Red Crab FMP, which became effective on October 21, 2002. The FMP establishes a target total allowable catch (TAC) for the red crab fishery. The TAC is set through an annual specification process at a level equal to the most current estimate of Optimum Yield (OY) for the fishery. Along with the  annual target TAC, the annual specification process involves calculation of the total DAS that may be utilized by the directed fishery, based on the average catch per DAS from the previous year. Total DAS are allocated equally to all vessels issued a limited access red crab permit.      The EIS for the FMP determined that a target TAC to manage the directed red crab fishery could result in adverse social impacts on current participants. First, the TAC may have to be set significantly lower than current landings. This would in turn reduce revenues, with a potential reduction in occupational opportunities for some fishermen, and a general decrease in flexibility and stability associated with this fishery, in turn increasing the uncertainty felt by the participants.
Exhibit 9-26      Second, without other complementary controls, the simple establishment of an overall TAC for the fishery could create a derby-type fishery, where the participants fish much more intensively and more frequently than they would under other conditions, in an attempt to harvest as much crab as they can before the TAC is reached and the fishery is closed down. Depending on the number of participants in the fishery and the level of the TAC, this “race to fish” could result in significant decreases in flexibility and stability in the fishery, as well as significant increases in the uncertainty associated with the fishery and the availability of the resource. In order to reduce the potential for the creation of a derby-style fishery, the Red Crab FMP first calculates total DAS based on the TAC level and the average catch per DAS from the previous year, and allocates the total DAS equally to all vessels in the fishery.      The 2009 Emergency Action that reduced the target TAC and DAS allocations by 40% for the vessels involved in the red crab fishery did not directly impact the participants in the fishery because landings in the most recent years have been below the level specified in the Emergency Action.      The recent Amendment 3 implemented in September 2011 replaced with the TAC and DAS program with a TAL program that provides increased flexibility to the fleet. Trip limits were also eliminated. These changes are expected to result in positive impacts to the fishery.
9.4.5.9 Scup      Commercial scup landings have declined substantially since peaking in the 1960s. In 1989, commercial landings decreased to 8.2 million pounds, the lowest value recorded during the ten-year period from 1983 to 1992, and only about 17 percent of the 49 million pounds landed in 1960. Since 1996, commercial landings have decreased substantially to between three and five million pounds annually, a reflection of low stock abundance and Federal management of the fishery through annual harvest quotas beginning in 1997. The scup resource index improved following implementation of the harvest quotas, resulting in an increase in total allowable catch (from 9.1 million pounds in 1997 to 12.92 million pounds in 2002) and removal of the scup resource from the list of fisheries designated as overfished. In recent years, however, the scup resource index has declined. As of 2005, the scup resource was again considered overfished (ASMFC, 2005). As of 2011, overfishing was not occurring and the stock is considered rebuilt (ASMFC 2010).Fishing Communities      Scup are landed all along the Atlantic coast from Maine to Florida. However, the majority of the harvest is landed in Rhode Island, New Jersey, New York, and Massachusetts. Exhibit 9-27 shows landings per state from 2000-2009.

Effects of Management Actions on Fishing Dependent Communities      The seven-year rebuilding schedule identified in the Scup FMP was expected to reduce exploitation of scup and restore the stock. The FMP also specifies minimum size requirements and commercial gear restrictions, including minimum mesh size, maximum roller diameter, and pot and trap degradable fastener and escape vent provisions. The FEIS  for this  rule indicated that gross revenues may be reduced by more than five percent for some small entity participants, or that operating costs may increase by more than five percent for some small entity participants who have to purchase new gear. It is unlikely, however, that more than 20 percent of affected small entities (otter trawl vessels) in this fishery would be required to make these purchases. Additionally, harvesters must replace codends and rollers as a routine cost of doing business, so not all costs can be attributed to the FMP gear requirements. As a result, NMFS concluded that this rule would not impact a substantial number of small entities (61 FR 43420).      The FEIS presents data demonstrating that the participants in the scup fishery rely on a number of other species as well, including squid, summer flounder, Atlantic mackerel, and silver hake. When compared to the other species, scup is a relatively low-value species for participants in this mixed species fishery. In addition, scup landings in the states of Rhode Island, New Jersey and New York represented only 2.0 percent, 2.3 percent, and 2.1 percent, respectively, of the total commercial value of all other species landed (61 FR 43420).      The FMP has been amended numerous times with the most recently with Amendment XX in November 2009. This amendment implemented policies that would reconcile quota overages. This is expected to have positive effects on the fishery.9.4.5.10 Summary of Factors Affecting Fishing Dependent Communities      Exhibit 9-28 summarizes the number of active or permitted vessels, the past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions, and the overall effect of those actions on the major fishing dependent communities affected by the ALWTRP regulatory alternatives.

9.5 CONSEQUENCES OF THE ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED      The following sections summarize the direct and indirect impacts on each VEC of the regulatory alternatives evaluated in this FEIS.9.5.1 Atlantic Large Whales      A complete analysis of the direct and indirect impacts of the regulatory alternatives considered can be found in Chapter 5.9.5.2 Other Protected Species      A complete analysis of the direct and indirect impacts of the regulatory alternatives considered can be found in Chapter 5.9.5.3 Affected Fisheries      A complete analysis of the direct and indirect impacts of the regulatory alternatives considered can be found in Chapter 6.9.5.4 Habitat      A complete analysis of the direct and indirect impacts of the regulatory alternatives considered can be found in Chapter 5.9.5.5 Fishing Dependent and Human Communities      A complete analysis of the direct and indirect impacts of the regulatory alternatives considered can be found in Chapter 7.9.6 CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF THE ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED      The following tables (Exhibits 9-29 through 9-33) summarize the cumulative effects of each alternative considered in this FEIS on each VEC in relation to the past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions. Cumulative impacts are assessed using the following terms:• “Positive effect” means that the cumulative effects of an alternative are expected to improve the status of the resource relative to its current status under past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions.
• “Negative effect” means that the cumulative effects of an alternative are expected to adversely affect the status of the resource relative to its current status under past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions.• “Neutral effect” means that the cumulative effects of an alternative are expected to be no different than they had been under past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions.• “None identified” means that no cumulative effect is foreseen, but one might exist in the future.The exhibits suggest the following cumulative impacts:• Large Whales: Past and present actions (e.g., whaling bans) have reversed the rapid decline of key whale species. The ALWTRP modifications considered here would reduce the risk of serious injury or mortality due to entanglement without exacerbating the risk associated with any of the remaining stressors. Therefore, all regulatory alternatives, excluding the no action alternative, are expected to have an overall positive cumulative effect on large whale survival. Exhibit 9-29 presents a more detailed analysis by alternative.• Other Protected Species: The ALWTRP modifications considered here would complement existing and forthcoming actions to reduce takes of other protected species. Hence, the cumulative effect of all regulatory alternatives, excluding the no action alternative, is expected to be slightly positive to positive. Exhibit 9-30 presents a more detailed analysis by alternative.• Habitat: The ALWTRP modifications considered here are likely to have no significant, long-term impact on habitat. However, the potential action could contribute to increased contact between fishing gear in some regions (i.e., additional groundline and anchors) and the ocean floor, and could result in adverse impacts on habitat in exempted areas where fishing pressure may intensify. Therefore, the cumulative effects of Alternatives 2-6 (Draft and Preferred) are expected to be slightly negative. Exhibit 9- 31 presents a more detailed analysis by alternative.• Affected Fisheries: The potential modifications to the ALWTRP are likely to have no significant, long-term impact on affected fishery resources (e.g., the American lobster resource, groundfish resources, etc.). Therefore, no cumulative effects are identified for any of the regulatory alternatives (Exhibit 9-32).
• Fishing Dependent and Human Communities: The cumulative impacts for fishing dependent communities are a function of current and forthcoming management actions, as well as the incremental impacts of modifications to the ALWTRP. While the regulatory changes specified under Alternatives 2 and 3 would be unlikely to have significant economic or social impacts, the regulatory changes specified under Alternatives 4, 5, and 6 (Draft and Preferred) would likely have more significant effects due to the proposed seasonal closures. The greatest socioeconomic pressure would likely be felt by those in the lobster trap/pot fishery, particularly those who operate small lobster vessels; compliance costs for these fishermen are likely to represent a greater share of total revenues than would be the case for most others. Although, all fisheries would have to abide by the new gear marking requirements proposed under all alternatives so there would be a minimal economic burden felt by all fisheries. The economic burden associated with these alternatives would be felt by small-boat lobstermen and their families in numerous communities, particularly in Maine, and could force some individuals to leave the industry. Exhibit 9-33 presents a more detailed analysis by alternative for the lobster trap/pot fishery, the other trap/pot fishery, and the gillnet fishery. The No Action Alternative would not have a conservation benefit and whale watching industry would suffer from a lack of protection of large whales. Alternatively, the whale watching industry would experience a positive economic gain and whale watching could become more profitable as the ALWTRP continues to protect and restore large whale populations through Alternatives 2-6 (Draft and Preferred).

The initial rule went into effect in 1997; since then it has been updated in February 1999, December 2000, January 2002, June 2007, October 2007, and September 2008. This rule has resulted in positive effects from the implementation of low-risk gear modifications and seasonal closures where there is significant interaction between whales and lobster trap/pot and gillnet activity.• Fishery Management Actions: Positive effects have also resulted from the implementation of various management actions for fisheries that interact with Atlantic large whales. Reductions in entanglement risk have indirectly resulted from measures such as effort reductions; closures; and days-at-sea and trip limitations.• Other Actions: Whaling bans, water quality regulations.• Fishery Management Actions: Same as past and present actions.• Other Potential Actions: Management efforts to reduce incidental takes of right whales from ship strikes.Significant negative cumulative effect.

      Exhibit 9-34 provides a more concise summary of the cumulative effects of each alternative on the five VECs: Atlantic large whales, other protected species, habitat, fishery resources, and fishing dependent communities. Cumulative effects are assessed using the same terms described above: positive effect, negative effect, neutral effect, and none identified.      The exhibit suggests the following cumulative effects expected across all VECs for each alternative under consideration:• Alternative 1 (No Action): The No Action alternative is not expected to affect four out of the five VECs being considered here, as this alternative would not alter the current state of the ALWTRP. While the fishing industry at first may experience some level of positive impacts because new regulations would not be implemented, these effects would be neutralized over time. The lack of action at this point could result in future actions that may result in negative impacts to the industry. Negative effects would be expected on large whales in light of the continued risk of entanglements. These negative effects may translate into negative effects to the whale watching industry.• Alternative 2: Large whales and other protected species are expected to benefit, as this alternative would implement additional gear marking and setting requirements year-round. Habitat may experience a slight (but minimal) negative effect due to the increased contact of gear with the seafloor, as well as the potential for increased amounts of fishing in exempted waters. No potential effects have been identified on fishery resources. Fishing dependent communities are expected to experience negative to slightly negative effects.• Alternative 3: The potential cumulative effects of this alternative would be similar to those associated with Alternative 2. The implementation of this alternative is expected to benefit large whales by implementing additional gear marking and setting requirements year-round. Other protected species are expected to experience ancillary benefits, as well. There may be slightly negative (but minimal) effects on habitat due to the increased contact of gear with the seafloor, as well as the potential for increased amounts of fishing in exempted waters.  No potential effects are expected on fishery resources, and negative to slightly negative effects are expected on fishing dependent communities.• Alternative 4: The effects of implementing Alternative 4 would be similar to those associated with Alternatives 2. Alternative 4 would implement additional gear marking and setting requirements year-round. Alternative 4 would also implement three seasonal closures; thus, Alternative 4 would provide slightly greater benefits to large whales than Alternative 2 or 3. Fishery resources and fishing dependent communities would experience slightly negative to negative effects.• Alternative 5: The implementation of this alternative would result in a combination of Alternatives 2, 3, and 4. Fishery resources and fishing dependent communities would experience slightly negative to negative effects.• Alternative 6 (Draft): The effects of implementing Alternative 6 would be similar to those associated with Alternative 5. Alternative 6 would implement closures in fewer areas than Alternative 5. Other protected species may receive ancillary benefits from these measures.
Habitat would experience slightly negative (but minimal) effects resulting from an increase in gear contacting the seafloor, as well as the potential for increased amounts of fishing in exempted waters. Fishery resources and fishing dependent communities would experience slightly negative to negative effects but to a lesser extent than Alternative 4 or 5.• Alternative 6 (Preferred): The implementation of the preferred alternative would be similar to Alternative 6 (Draft). However, fishery resources and fishing dependent communities would experience slightly negative to negative effects to a lesser extent than under Alternative 6 (Draft).

REGULATORY IMPACT REVIEW	CHAPTER 1010.1 INTRODUCTION      Actions taken to amend fisheries management plans or implement other regulations governing U.S. fisheries are subject to the requirements of a number of Federal laws and executive orders. Among these is Executive Order 12866, which states the following:In deciding whether and how to regulate, agencies should assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives, including the alternative of not regulating. Costs and benefits shall be understood to include both quantifiable measures (to the fullest extent that these can be usefully estimated) and qualitative measures of costs and benefits that are difficult to quantify, but nevertheless essential to consider. Further, in choosing among alternative regulatory approaches, agencies should select those approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environment, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and equity), unless a statute requires another regulatory approach.      In accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 12866, this Regulatory Impact Review (RIR) evaluates the modifications to the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan (ALWTRP) that the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) is considering. The scope of the discussion includes:• The objectives and legal basis of the proposal to revise the ALWTRP;• The problem of large whale entanglement;• The fisheries affected by the ALWTRP;• The provisions included in the regulatory alternatives under consideration;• Estimation of the costs and benefits associated with the alternatives;• Characterization of the social impacts associated with the alternatives; and• Integration and comparison of the alternatives’ costs and benefits.
10.2 OBJECTIVES AND LEGAL BASIS OF PROPOSED RULES      The revisions to the ALWTRP that NMFS is considering are designed to improve the effectiveness of commercial fishing regulations implemented to conserve and protect three endangered species – North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis), North Atlantic humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), and fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) – thereby fulfilling NMFS' obligations under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA). The need for the proposed revisions is demonstrated by the continuing risk of serious injury and mortality of Atlantic large whales due to entanglement in commercial fishing gear.      The MMPA of 1972 provides protection for species or stocks that are, or may be, in danger of extinction or depletion as a result of human activity. The MMPA states that measures should be taken immediately to replenish the population of any marine mammal species or stock that has diminished below its optimum sustainable level. With respect to any stock or species,  the “optimum sustainable population” is the number of animals that will result in the maximum productivity of the stock or species, taking into account the carrying capacity of the habitat and the health of the ecosystem of which they form a constituent element.      Under the MMPA, the Secretary of Commerce is responsible for the conservation and management of pinnipeds (other than walruses) and cetaceans (including whales). The Secretary of Commerce has delegated MMPA authority to NMFS.      In 1994, Congress amended the MMPA, establishing new provisions to govern the taking of marine mammals incidental to commercial fishing operations.1 These new provisions include the preparation of stock assessments for all marine mammal stocks in waters under U.S. jurisdiction, and development and implementation of take reduction plans for stocks that may be reduced or are being maintained below their optimum sustainable population due to interactions with commercial fisheries.      Take reduction plans are required for all "strategic stocks." Under the MMPA, a "strategic stock" is a stock: (1) for which the level of direct human-caused mortality exceeds the Potential Biological Removal (PBR) level; (2) that is declining and is likely to be listed under the ESA in the foreseeable future; or (3) that is listed as a threatened or endangered species under the ESA or as a depleted species under the MMPA.2 The immediate goal of a take reduction plan is to reduce, within six months of its implementation, the mortality and serious injury of strategic stocks incidentally taken in the course of U.S. commercial fishing operations to below the PBR levels established for such stocks. The long-term goal of a take reduction plan is to reduce, within five years of its implementation, the incidental mortality and serious injury of strategic marine mammals taken in the course of commercial fishing operations to insignificant levels           1 As defined in the MMPA, the term "take" means to harass, hunt, capture, or kill, or attempt to harass, hunt, capture, or kill any marine mammal.           2 The Potential Biological Removal (PBR) level is defined in the MMPA as the maximum number of animals, not including natural mortalities, which may be removed from a marine mammal stock annually while allowing that stock to reach or maintain its optimum sustainable population. Procedures for calculating the PBR level are described in the MMPA.
approaching a zero mortality and serious injury rate, taking into account the economics of the fishery, the availability of existing technology, and existing state or regional fishery management plans.      Right whales, humpback whales, and fin whales are listed as endangered species under the ESA, and are thus considered strategic stocks under the MMPA. Pursuant to its obligations under the MMPA, NMFS in 1996 established the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Team (ALWTRT), an advisory group empaneled to develop recommendations for reducing the incidental take of large whales in commercial fisheries along the Atlantic Coast. The ALWTRT includes representatives of the fishing industry, state and Federal resource management agencies, the scientific community, and conservation organizations. The purpose of the ALWTRT is to provide guidance to NMFS in developing and amending the ALWTRP to meet the goals of the MMPA with respect to Atlantic large whales.      In addition to the MMPA, the ESA provides a legal foundation for measures to protect right whales, humpback whales, and fin whales. The ESA provides for the conservation of species that are in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of their range, as well as the conservation of the ecosystems on which these species depend.3 The right whale, humpback whale, and fin whale species are all federally-listed as endangered and are therefore subject to protection under the ESA.      Section 7 of the ESA directs all Federal agencies to use their existing authorities to conserve threatened and endangered species and to ensure that their actions do not jeopardize listed species or destroy or adversely modify the critical habitat of those species. When a proposed Federal action may affect an ESA-listed marine species, Section 7 directs that the "Action agency" consult with the Secretary of Commerce; this is referred to as a Section 7 consultation.4,5      To assess impacts on large whale and sea turtle species protected under the ESA, NMFS has prepared Biological Opinions for the continued authorization of Federal fisheries under the Fishery Management Plans (FMPs) for the multispecies, spiny dogfish, and monkfish fisheries, and under Federal regulations for the lobster fishery, amongst others. Section 7 consultations were first initiated for each of these fisheries either at the time the FMP was developed or, in the case of lobster, when a significant amendment (Amendment 5) to the Federal Lobster Management Plan was under consideration. The Northeast multispecies fishery has a long consultation history, including formal and informal Section 7 consultations, beginning with a formal consultation initiated on June 12, 1986. Formal consultation was first initiated for spiny dogfish on August 13, 1999; for monkfish on December 21, 1998; and for lobster on March 23, 1994. Subsequent ESA Section 7 consultations on those fisheries incorporated the ALWTRP as           3 "Species," as defined by the ESA, includes any subspecies of fish, wildlife, or plant and any distinct population segment of any vertebrate species which interbreeds when mature.           4 The "Action agency" is the Federal agency charged with permitting, conducting or funding the proposed activity serving as the basis for the consultation.           5 Federal agencies must consult with the Secretary of the Interior when a proposed action may affect an ESA-listed species under the Department of Interior’s purview.
a Reasonable and Prudent Alternative (RPA) to avoid jeopardy to right whales. NMFS reinitiated consultation on May 4, 2000, for the multispecies, spiny dogfish and monkfish gillnet fisheries, and on June 22, 2000, for the lobster fishery, following new whale entanglements resulting in serious injuries to right whales, at least one right whale mortality in gillnet gear, new information indicating a declining status for western North Atlantic right whales, and revisions to the ALWTRP.      The Biological Opinions from the May/June 2000 Section 7 consultations, finalized June 14, 2001, found that NMFS' authorization of these Federal fisheries, as modified by the ALWTRP requirements in effect at that time, was likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the western North Atlantic right whale. The Biological Opinions identified a set of Reasonable and Prudent Alternatives designed to avoid the likelihood of jeopardy to right whales. These measures included:• Seasonal Area Management (SAM);• Dynamic Area Management (DAM);• An expansion of gillnet gear modification requirements and restrictions to Mid-Atlantic waters and modification of fishing practices in Southeastern waters;• Continued gear research and modifications; and• Additional measures that implement and monitor the effectiveness of the RPAs.These measures were intended, in combination, to reduce the risk of serious injury or mortality of large whales from entanglements in commercial fishing gear, and to minimize adverse impacts if entanglements occur.      Following implementation of the measures described above, entanglements leading to serious injury or death of protected whales, including the North Atlantic right whale, continued to occur. Accordingly, NMFS reinitiated consultation on the continued authorization of  a number of fisheries and began to develop modifications to the ALWTRP. At its 2003 meeting, the ALWTRT agreed to manage entanglement risks by focusing first on reducing the risk associated with groundlines, then reducing the risk associated with vertical lines. In October 2007, NMFS issued a final rule that replaced the SAM and DAM programs with broad-based gear modification requirements, including the use of sinking groundline; expanded weak link requirements; additional gear marking requirements; changes in boundaries; seasonal restrictions for gear modifications; expanded exempted areas; and changes in regulatory language for the purposes of clarification and consistency (72 FR 57104, October 5, 2007). The broad-based sinking groundline requirement became fully effective on April 5, 2009. This final rule also incorporated an amendment to the ALWTRP (72 FR 34632, June 25, 2007) that implemented, with revisions, previous ALWTRP regulations by expanding the Southeast U.S. Restricted Area to include waters within 35 nm (64.82 km) of the South Carolina coast, dividing the Southeast
U.S. Restricted Area into Southeast U.S. Restricted Areas North and South, and modified regulations pertaining to gillnetting within the Southeast U.S. Restricted Area.      Following implementation of these measures, NMFS and the ALWTRT turned their collective focus to vertical line risk reduction. At the 2009 ALWTRT meeting, the Team agreed on a schedule to develop a management approach to reduce the risk of serious injury and mortality due to vertical line. As a result of this schedule, NMFS committed to publishing a final rule to address vertical line entanglement by 2014. NMFS also reinitiated consultation on continued authorization of FMPs for a number of fisheries (American lobster; bluefish; spiny dogfish; monkfish; Northeast multispecies; skate; Atlantic mackerel, squid, and butterfish; and summer flounder, scup and Northern black sea bass). These consultations concluded in October 2010. After identifying the steps being taken by NMFS to develop, analyze and implement a vertical line reduction rule, the agency’s Biological Opinions concluded that continued operation of the fisheries noted above would be likely to adversely affect, but not jeopardize, the continued existence of right, humpback, and fin whales.10.3 PROBLEM ADDRESSED BY ALWTRP      Right whales, humpback whales, and fin whales are listed as endangered species under the ESA, and are thus considered strategic stocks under the MMPA. The measures that the ALWTRP requires focus on the conservation of these species, and also benefit minke whales. The current status of these species is summarized below:• Right Whale: The western North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) is one of the rarest of all large cetaceans. It is among the most endangered species in the world and is listed as endangered under the ESA. NMFS considers the best estimate of the population of North Atlantic right whales to be approximately 444, well below the optimum sustainable population (OSP).6 PBR for this species is currently  0.9 whales per year (Waring et al., 2013).• Humpback Whale: The North Atlantic humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) is listed as an endangered species under the ESA. For the Gulf of Maine stock of humpback whales, NMFS estimates a minimum population of 823. PBR for this stock is currently 2.7 whales per year (Waring et al., 2013).• Fin Whale: The fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) is listed as an endangered species under the ESA. Although researchers debate the existence of several distinct subpopulations of this species, NMFS currently treats all fin whales within U.S. waters of the North Atlantic as           6 The optimum sustainable population of any stock or species is defined as the number of animals that will result in the maximum productivity of the stock or species, keeping in mind the carrying capacity of the habitat and the health of the ecosystem of which they form a constituent element (16 USC 1362(9)).
members of a single population, with an estimated minimum size of 2,817. PBR for this species is currently 5.6 whales per year (Waring et al., 2013).• Minke Whale: The minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) is not listed as endangered or threatened under the ESA. Minke whales in U.S. waters of the North Atlantic are considered part of the Canadian east coast stock of this species. NMFS estimates a minimum population for this stock of 16,199; PBR is currently 162 whales per year (Waring et al., 2013).      Atlantic large whales are at risk of becoming entangled in fishing gear because the whales feed, travel and breed in many of the same ocean areas utilized for commercial fishing. Fishermen typically leave fishing gear such as gillnets and traps/pots in the water for a discrete period, after which time the nets/traps/pots are hauled and their catch retrieved. While the gear is in the water, whales may become entangled in the lines and nets that comprise trap/pot and gillnet fishing gear. The effects of entanglement can range from no permanent injury to death.      A scarification analysis conducted by the New England Aquarium (Knowlton et al., 2002) found that juvenile right whales are entangled with greater frequency than adults. Juvenile animals may not have sufficient strength to break free from entangling lines, which can lead to serious injury and infection resulting from the animal "growing into" the lines.      A study of right whale and humpback whale entanglements (Johnson et al., 2005) found that in cases where the point of gear attachment was known, right whale entanglements frequently (77.4 percent; 24 of 31 entanglement events) involved the mouth, which may indicate that many entanglements occur while whales are feeding. The study also found that humpback whales are more commonly reported with entanglements in the tail region (53.0 percent; 16 of 30 entanglement events), in cases where the point of attachment was known.7 The number of entanglements for which gear type can be identified is too small to detect any trends in the type of gear involved in lethal entanglements. Trap/pot and gillnet gear, however, seem to be the  most common, as in 89 percent of the cases the gear was identified as or consistent with trap/pot or gillnet gear (Johnson et al., 2005).8 The study confirmed that vertical lines and floating groundlines posed risks for large whales; however, the authors concluded that any type and part of fixed gear is capable of entangling a whale, and several body parts of the whale can be involved.7 In some cases, other parts of the body in addition to the tail may have been entangled.           8 According to Johnson et al. (2005), analyses focused on entanglements from which the gear  was examined by NMFS gear specialists, as well as other sources considered reliable, but also included entanglements for which the gear type and/or part was identified (e.g., by a fisherman or biologist) but not recovered. In some cases, recovered gear can definitively be traced back to a particular fishery, but in other cases, certain parts of the gear may be recovered that could be considered consistent with gear that is used in a particular fishery. For  example, the gear recovered from right whale #3107 consisted of line with a 600-pound weak link, and thus was considered consistent with gear used in the lobster trap/pot fishery. Note that Johnson et al. (2005) have classified this whale’s entanglement as lobster trap/pot gear that was set in an unknown location.

Humpback whales account for the greatest number of serious injury entanglements (35), followed by right whales (11); minke whales account for five, and fin whales account for four.Exhibit 10-1      Exhibit 10-2 presents available data on fatal entanglements of Atlantic large whales from 1997 through 2010, the most recent year that data is available for all species.

Exhibit 10-210.4 AFFECTED FISHERIES      As required by the MMPA, NMFS maintains a List of Fisheries that places each commercial fishery into one of three categories. Fisheries are categorized according to the level of serious injury and mortality of marine mammals that occurs incidental to that fishery. The categorization of a fishery in the List of Fisheries determines whether participants in that fishery are subject to certain provisions of the MMPA such as registration, observer coverage, and take reduction plan requirements. Individuals fishing in Category I or II fisheries must comply with requirements of any applicable take reduction plan.9      Category I fisheries are associated with frequent incidental mortality and serious injury of marine mammals. These fisheries have a serious injury/mortality rate of 50 percent or more of a stock's potential biological removal rate. Category II fisheries are associated with occasional incidental mortality and serious injury of marine mammals, and have a serious injury/mortality           9 Once a fishery is elevated to Category I or II status, it is eligible for inclusion under the ALWTRP; however, NMFS maintains discretion regarding which fisheries it feels must be folded into the Plan in order to provide adequate protection to right, humpback, and fin whales.
rate of more than one percent but less than 50 percent of a stock's PBR. Category III fisheries rarely cause serious injury or mortality to marine mammals. Category III fisheries have a serious injury/mortality rate of one percent or less of a stock's PBR (NOAA, February 2002).      The List of Fisheries indicates which fisheries NMFS may regulate under the ALWTRP.10 Specific fisheries were initially identified for inclusion under the ALWTRP based on documented whale interactions. In 1996, NMFS announced its intention to regulate the following Category I or II fisheries under the ALWTRP, based on the following documented whale interactions (61 FR 40819-40821):• Gulf of Maine, U.S. Mid-Atlantic lobster trap/pot fishery:11 One  record of a serious injury and/or mortality of a northern right whale, and 11 records of a serious injury and/or mortality of humpback whales were reported for this fishery from 1990 to 1994. In addition, NMFS received several reports of right whale entanglements prior to 1990 and after 1994 which are or may be attributable to the lobster fishery.• U.S. Mid-Atlantic coastal gillnet fishery:12 Between 1989 and 1992, 31 humpback whales stranded from New Jersey through Virginia. Twenty- five percent of the stranded whales had scars consistent with net entanglement. Between 1990 and 1996, 10 humpbacks stranded in Virginia; three animals had rope abrasion injuries consistent with the type of injury expected to result from entanglement in gillnets.• New England multispecies sink-gillnet fishery:13 As of 1996, strategic marine mammal species/stocks seriously injured or killed in this fishery included several humpback whales and a northern right whale.• Southeastern U.S. Atlantic shark gillnet fishery: A right whale calf  was observed in February, 1994, approximately ten miles off Jacksonville, Florida, with severe cuts and other injuries. Researchers believe, based on the observed injuries, that the calf was entangled in gillnet gear and hauled back into the fishing vessel's propeller as the gear was being retrieved. This method of gear retrieval is consistent with the shark gillnet fishery.This list has evolved since 1996, reflecting both changes in nomenclature and modification of the ALWTRP to address additional fisheries. At present, the fisheries regulated under the ALWTRP include the Northeast anchored float gillnet fishery; the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic American lobster           10 Marine mammal take reduction plans relevant to Category I and II fisheries in the Atlantic Ocean include the Harbor Porpoise Take Reduction Plan (50 CFR 229.34), the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan (50 CFR 229.32), and the Bottlenose Dolphin Take Reduction Plan.11 Currently the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic American lobster trap/pot fishery.12 Currently the U.S. Mid-Atlantic gillnet fishery.13 Currently the Northeast multispecies fishery.
trap/pot fishery; the Northeast sink gillnet fishery; the Northeast drift gillnet fishery; the Atlantic blue crab fishery; the Atlantic mixed species trap/pot fisheries (fish, crabs, conch, whelk, shrimp, and other species); the Southeast Atlantic gillnet fishery; the Southeastern U.S. Atlantic shark gillnet fishery; and the U.S. Mid-Atlantic gillnet fishery.10.5 REGULATORY ALTERNATIVES      NMFS has identified seven regulatory alternatives for consideration. The first of these (Alternative 1) is the No Action Alternative, which would make no changes to the ALWTRP. The remaining alternatives propose modifications to the ALWTRP that include some combination of the following:• Gear Configuration Requirements – All of the alternatives propose area-specific minimum trawl lengths for trap/pot fisheries in the  Northeast; the minimums specified vary by alternative (see below). Additional provisions mandate the use of single traps or pots and specify weak link, vertical line strength, and vertical line composition requirements for trap/pot fisheries in the Southeast; these requirements are the same for all action alternatives.• Closures – Several alternatives would prohibit ALWTRP trap/pot vessels from fishing in designated areas during designated periods (see below).• Gear Marking – Each of the action alternatives includes revised gear marking requirements for vessels subject to the ALWTRP. The proposed gear marking scheme calls for three 12-inch marks per vertical line, adhering to a regional color-coding system. Under Alternatives 2 through 6 (Draft), the requirements would apply to all gear set in non-exempt waters, as well as to gear set in exempt waters of Maine and New Hampshire. Alternative 6 (Preferred) would impose similar requirements, but would not require gear set landward of Maine’s exemption line to be marked.      Exhibit 10-3 provides an overview and comparison of the alternatives. With  the exception of Alternative 6 (Preferred), all of the alternatives, were considered in NMFS’ Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS). Alternative 6 (Preferred) is similar to Alternative 6 (Draft), but differs from it in several respects. As noted above, Alternative 6 (Preferred) would not require gear set landward of Maine’s exemption line to be marked. In addition:• Alternative 6 (Preferred) would permit two-trap trawls in Maine pocket waters (see Chapter 3 for a description of these areas).• Alternative 6 (Preferred) would permit the use of single traps within a quarter-mile buffer area surrounding three Maine islands (Monhegan, Ragged, and Matinicus).
• Alternative 6 (Preferred) would maintain existing ALWTRP requirements in New Hampshire state waters, including the requirement to use sinking groundline.• Alternative 6 (Preferred) would permit the use of two-trap trawls in Rhode Island state waters.      Exhibit 10-4 describes the gear configuration requirements of the action alternatives in greater detail, showing how they vary. Most notably, Alternatives 3, 5, 6 (Draft), and 6 (Preferred) modify the minimum trawl length restrictions incorporated under Alternative 2; the trawling requirements under Alternative 4 are equivalent to those specified in Alternative 2.      Alternatives 2 through 6 (Preferred) include a set of special requirements for the blue crab and OTP fisheries operating in ALWTRP-regulated waters off the coasts of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. In waters off South Carolina and Georgia, the alternatives require affected vessels to fish singles; use weak links with a breaking strength no greater than 600 pounds; use vertical line with a breaking strength no greater than 2,200 pounds; and use vertical line that is free of weights, knots, and splices. The requirements for waters off Florida are similar, but specify 200-pound weak links and the use of sink rope with a breaking strength no greater than 1,500-pounds over the entire length of each vertical line.

      As noted, some of the alternatives under consideration would introduce the seasonal closure of designated areas to trap/pot gear. Exhibit 10-5 summarizes the basic parameters of each closure, while Exhibit 10-6 presents a series of maps illustrating the location of the areas in which fishing would be restricted. The objective of these provisions is to reduce the concentration of fishing gear when whales are likely to congregate in the areas designated for closure, thus reducing the risk of entanglement. Chapter 3 provides additional detail on the rationale for each closure.Exhibit 10-5SUMMARY OF AREA CLOSURE PROVISIONSClosureRegulatory AlternativeClosure Period    Size (square miles)CCB Restricted Area3February - April644Jordan Basin4 & 5November - January725Jeffreys Ledge4 & 5October – January607Massachusetts Restricted Area #14 & 5January - April2,464Massachusetts Restricted Area #26 (Draft) &6 (Preferred)January - April2,161Exhibit 10-6LOCATION OF RESTRICTED AREAS

10.6 ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVES10.6.1 Benefit-Cost Framework      Benefit-cost analysis (BCA) is the preferred method for analyzing the consequences of a regulatory action such as modifying the requirements of the ALWTRP.14 BCA is a well- established procedure for assessing the "best" course or scale of action, where "best" is that course which maximizes net benefits (i.e., benefits minus costs).15 Because BCA assesses the value of an activity in net benefit terms, it requires that a single metric, most commonly dollars, be used to gauge both benefits and costs. The data and economic models necessary to estimate costs may be difficult or costly to gather and develop, and a comprehensive analysis of the costs associated with a regulatory action is not always feasible. Nonetheless, the principle is straightforward, and it is generally possible in practice to develop a monetary estimate of at least some portion of regulatory costs. This is the case for costs stemming from changes to the ALWTRP, which would impose additional restrictions on commercial fishing operations.      Assessing the benefits of changes to the ALWTRP in a BCA framework is also straightforward in principle but much more difficult in practice. To the extent that new regulations would reduce the risk that whales will suffer serious injury or mortality as a result of entanglement in commercial fishing gear, they would produce real benefits. Ideally, these benefits would be measured first by a biological metric, and then by a dollar  metric.  A biological metric could take the form of the expected decrease in extinction risk, increase in the annual growth of the population, or similar measures. A BCA would then value these quantified biological benefits in terms of willingness-to-pay, the standard economic measure of economic value recommended by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).16 This would produce a dollar estimate of the benefits of the change in regulations, which could then be compared directly to the costs. In the case of the ALWTRP, however, the data required to complete such  an analysis are not available. Estimation of the economic benefits attributable to each of the regulatory alternatives that NMFS is considering would require a more detailed understanding of the biological impacts of each measure than current models can provide. It also would require more extensive research than economists have conducted to date on the relationship between conservation and restoration of these species and associated economic values.      In the absence of the information required to conduct a full BCA, the discussion that follows presents qualitative information on the benefits that may stem from improved protection of endangered whales, coupled with a quantitative indicator of the potential impact of each alternative. It then presents estimates of the costs attributable to each alternative. As discussed later in this chapter, the analysis uses this information to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the regulatory alternatives under consideration. Because the alternatives vary with respect to the benefits they would achieve, it is not possible to identify a superior option based on cost-           14 U.S. Office of Management and Budget, “Circular A-4,” September 17, 2003, available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a004/a-4.pdf.15 Zerbe, R., and D. Dively, 1994. Benefit Cost Analysis in Theory and Practice, New York: HarperCollins.16 OMB, 2003.
effectiveness alone.17	Nonetheless, the cost-effectiveness figures provide a useful means of comparing the relative impacts of the regulatory provisions that each alternative incorporates.10.6.2 Benefits of Large Whale Protection      Since the suspension of commercial whaling in the U.S., there has been no conventional market for the consumptive use of products derived from whales. Nonetheless, whale protection and associated increases in whale populations may generate two types of benefits: (1) non- consumptive use benefits; and (2) non-use benefits.10.6.2.1 Non-Consumptive Use Benefits      A variety of recreational activities involve the non-consumptive use of natural resources, either in a market or non-market context. The opportunity to enjoy one such activity, whale watching, has fostered the development of the commercial whale watching industry. Although current data on the industry are lacking, a study by Hoyt (2000) suggests that roughly half of all commercial whale watching worldwide occurs in the U.S., and that much of this activity is centered in New England.18 As shown in Exhibit 10-7, the Hoyt study identified 36 whale watching businesses in New England, with most operating multiple vessels. Hoyt estimated that over one million individuals each year take whale watching tours in the region, generating over$30 million in annual revenue for the industry. Because these figures only apply to permitted  and registered operations, the full scale and economic impact of whale watching activity is likely to be greater.Exhibit 10-7NEW ENGLAND WHALE WATCHING INDUSTRYStateNumber of OperationsNumber of Vessels Annual Ridership  Annual Revenue (millions $)Massachusetts1730-351,000,000$24.0New Hampshire46-1080,000$1.9Maine1418-24137,500$4.4Rhode Island1112,500$0.3TOTAL3655-701,230,000$30.6Source: Hoyt, 2000.      The development of the commercial whale watching industry provides a valuable source of information on individuals’ willingness to pay for the opportunity to experience whales in their natural environment. This in turn makes it feasible, at least in theory, to evaluate the potential impact of changes in willingness to pay on surplus values in this market, i.e.:17 OMB, 2003.           18 Although whale watching operations exist in the Mid- and South Atlantic states, the level of activity is lower and cannot be reliably distinguished from tours to view other species, such as dolphins.
• Consumer Surplus – the difference between the maximum amount that consumers would be willing to pay to go on a whale watch and the price they actually pay;• Producer Surplus – the difference between the payments commercial whale watching enterprises receive for their services and the economic costs they incur to provide them.19Any increase in consumer or producer surplus represents a gain in economic welfare, and thus a benefit to society.      A number of studies have demonstrated substantial levels of consumer surplus in the commercial whale watching market. For example, a study of the demand for whale watching at the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary found that tour customers realized an average consumer surplus of approximately $26 per trip (Hoagland and Meeks, 2000). Several studies have noted that customer enjoyment is positively correlated with the number of whales sighted. The Stellwagen Bank study asked respondents to cite the most attractive features of a whale watch; the top responses included the number of whales seen as well as the number of species seen. Likewise, Loomis and Larson (1994) determined that whale watch customers viewing gray whales were willing to pay more for the experience when populations increased. This suggests that an increase in the population of whales could lead to increased demand for commercial whale watching tours, and a concomitant increase in consumer and/or producer surplus values in the market for these services.      It is not feasible at present to estimate the impact of potential modifications to the ALWTRP on producer or consumer surplus values in the whale watching market. Estimation of these impacts would require the ability to forecast the impact of various management measures on the population of whales, coupled with a far more detailed understanding of the relationship between an increase in this population and demand for viewing opportunities. Given the level of activity in the industry, however, it is reasonable to assume that the benefits associated with additional opportunities to see, photograph, and otherwise experience whales in their natural environment could be substantial.10.6.2.2 Non-Use Benefits      The protection and restoration of populations of endangered whales may also generate non-use benefits.20 Economic research has demonstrated that society places economic value on (relatively) unique environmental assets, whether or not those assets are ever directly exploited. For example, society places real (and potentially measurable) economic value on simply           19 The economic cost of the resources (raw materials, capital, and labor) used to provide a particular good  or service to consumers is the opportunity cost of that use; i.e., the value of the goods and services those resources could otherwise produce. Market distortions may yield differences between the costs that producers bear and the  true economic costs of the resources they employ.           20 The discussion of non-use benefits is based in part on NMFS, Steller Sea Lion Protection Measures, Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement, November 2001.
knowing that large whale populations are flourishing in their natural environment (often referred to as “existence value”) and will be preserved for the enjoyment of future generations.21 Using survey research methods, economists have developed several studies of non-use values associated with protection of whales or other marine mammals. Exhibit 10-8 summarizes these studies. In each, researchers surveyed individuals on their willingness to pay (WTP) for programs that would maintain or increase marine mammal populations. The most recent of the studies (Wallmo and Lew, 2012) employed a stated preference method to estimate the value of recovering or down-listing eight ESA-listed marine species, including the North Atlantic right whale. Through a survey of 8,476 households, the authors estimated an average WTP (per household per year, for a 10-year period) of $71.62 for full recovery of the species and $38.79 for recovery sufficient to down-list the species from “endangered” to “threatened.” While the other studies noted do not focus specifically on the North Atlantic populations of right, humpback, fin, or minke whales, they do demonstrate that individuals derive economic value from the protection of marine mammals.Exhibit 10-8STUDIES OF NON-USE VALUE ASSOCIATED WITH MARINE MAMMALSAuthorTitleFindingsGiraud et al.

These observers argue that whales deserve protection from human interference, and that such protection provides an intellectual or spiritual benefit to mankind.
10.6.2.3 Relative Ranking of Alternatives      As noted above, it is not feasible at present to estimate the economic benefits attributable to each of the regulatory alternatives that NMFS is considering. It is possible, however, to develop a relative ranking of the alternatives with respect to potential benefits, based on the estimated impact of each alternative on the potential for whales to become entangled in commercial fishing gear.      The biological impacts analysis presented in Chapter 5 relies primarily on NMFS’ Vertical Line Model to examine how the regulatory alternatives might reduce the possibility of interactions between whales and fishing gear. As discussed in that chapter, the model integrates information on fishing activity, gear configurations, and whale sightings to provide indicators of the potential for entanglements to occur at various locations and at different points in time. The fundamental measure of entanglement potential is co-occurrence. The co-occurrence value estimated in the model is an index figure, integrated across the spatial grid, indicating the degree to which whales and the vertical line employed in gillnet or trap/pot fisheries coincide in the waters subject to the ALWTRP. Biological impacts are characterized with respect to the percentage reduction in the overall co-occurrence indicator each alternative would achieve.      Exhibit 10-9 summarizes the estimated change in co-occurrence under each action alternative relative to the no-action alternative (Alternative 1). Separate results are provided for Northeast waters and all ALWTRP waters coastwide. Alternative 2, which includes trawling requirements but no closures, is estimated to yield a reduction in co-occurrence of approximately 36 percent. Alternatives 3 through 6 (Preferred) add incrementally to this reduction through closure of high-risk areas at various times of year. The estimated impact of these closures is greater when affected vessels are assumed to suspend fishing rather than relocate to alternative fishing grounds. The greatest reduction in co-occurrence is achieved under Alternative 5, which includes modified trawling requirements as well as three closures (Jeffreys Ledge, Massachusetts Restricted Area #1, and Jordan Basin). Under this alternative, the estimated reduction in co- occurrence ranges from approximately 40 to 42 percent. Under Alternative 6 (Preferred), the estimated reduction in co-occurrence is approximately 38 percent in Northeast waters and 37 to 38 percent coastwide.Exhibit 10-9ANNUAL CHANGE IN CO-OCCURRENCEAlternativePercent Reduction in Co-Occurrence ScoreNortheast WatersCoastwideAlternative 1 (No Action)0.0%0.0%Alternative 2-36.1%-35.8%Alternative 3 (100% Suspend)-37.7%-37.4%Alternative 3 (Relocation)-37.4%-37.2%Alternative 4 (100% Suspend)-40.8%-40.5%Alternative 4 (Relocation)-39.0%-38.7%Alternative 5 (100% Suspend)-42.0%-41.7%Alternative 5 (Relocation)-40.0%-39.7%Alternative 6 – Draft (100% Suspend)-38.2%-38.0%Alternative 6 – Draft (Relocation)-37.7%-37.4%Alternative 6 – Preferred (100% Suspend)-38.2%-37.9%Alternative 6 – Preferred (Relocation)-37.7%-37.4%
10.6.3 Fishing Industry Compliance Costs      The costs attributable to the introduction of new regulations on the fisheries subject to the ALWTRP would be borne primarily by commercial fishermen, particularly those in the lobster fishery. This fishery includes thousands of licensed participants, none of whom account for a substantial share of the market. As a result, those in the harvest sector lack the ability to raise prices to cover any increase in their operating costs; the price they receive for their catch is dictated by market conditions, which can vary considerably from season to season. Thus, the costs of complying with new regulatory requirements are likely to be reflected in reductions in producer surplus in the harvest sector.22      The economic impact analysis developed for this EIS provides detailed estimates of the compliance costs associated with potential changes to the ALWTRP. The analysis estimates compliance costs for model vessels and extrapolates from these findings to estimate the overall cost to the commercial fishing industry of complying with the regulatory changes under consideration. The analysis measures the cost of complying with new requirements relative to  the status quo − i.e., a baseline scenario that assumes no change in existing ALWTRP requirements. Thus, all estimates of compliance costs are incremental to those already incurred  in complying with the ALWTRP. All costs are presented on an annualized basis and reported in 2011 dollars. The calculation of annualized costs is based on a real annual discount rate of seven percent, consistent with current OMB guidelines.      The discussion that follows summarizes the estimated cost of complying with each of the regulatory alternatives that NMFS is considering, including both the average cost for affected vessels and industry-wide compliance costs. Additional detail on the methods and results of the economic impact analysis can be found in Chapter 6.10.6.3.1 Compliance Cost Estimation Methods      As discussed above, Alternatives 2 through 6 (Preferred) propose modifications to the ALWTRP that include some combination of gear configuration requirements, the seasonal closure of designated areas, and gear marking requirements. The methods employed to estimate the costs attributable to these requirements are described below.Gear Configuration Requirements      A major component of Alternatives 2 through 6 (Preferred) is a minimum trawl length requirement – i.e., prohibiting trawls of less than a specified number of traps or pots – for           22 As noted later in this chapter, the action alternatives under consideration could have a modest impact on the annual lobster catch. If this occurs, retail prices could rise, resulting in a reduction in consumer surplus. Such an increase in prices would, at least in theory, help to offset the costs that fishermen would incur in complying with new regulations. Whether this would in fact be the case depends on the extent to which an increase in prices at the retail level would translate to an increase in ex-vessel prices, or would instead be absorbed in higher profits elsewhere in the supply chain. Given these uncertainties, the analysis focuses on compliance costs in the harvest sector as a reasonable approximation of the social costs attributable to potential changes in ALWTRP requirements.
trap/pot fisheries in Northeast waters. The exact nature of this requirement varies by alternative and location. The costs that fishermen are likely to incur in complying with such requirements are primarily composed of gear conversion costs and catch impacts.      Vessels fishing shorter configurations (e.g., singles, doubles) would need to reconfigure their gear to comply with trawling requirements. These changes may require expenditures on new equipment as well as investments of fishermen’s time. Analysis of the economic impact of the trawling requirements entails comparing the baseline configuration of gear assigned to model vessels in NMFS’ Vertical Line Model with the minimum trawl length that would be required under each regulatory alternative. The analysis identifies instances in which the reconfiguration of gear would be required, estimates the material and labor necessary to bring all gear into compliance, and calculates the resulting cost. Equipment costs are a function of the quantity of gear to be converted and the unit cost of the materials needed to satisfy the trawling requirement. Labor costs are a function of the time required to implement a specific modification, the quantity of gear to be converted, and the implicit labor rate. All costs are calculated on an incremental basis, taking into account any savings in material or labor costs that might result from efforts to comply with new ALWTRP regulations.      In addition to the direct cost of gear conversion, catch rates may decline for vessels that are required to convert from shorter sets to longer trawls, reducing the revenues of affected operations. To estimate impacts in the lower bound, the analysis assumes that vessels implementing a major increase in trawl length (an increase of a factor of two or more in the number of traps in each set) would experience a five percent reduction in their annual catch. In the upper bound, the analysis assumes that these vessels would experience a ten percent reduction in catch, while all other vessels would experience a five percent reduction. The resulting impact on each vessel’s annual revenues is based on prevailing ex-vessel prices for lobster or other trap/pot species.Seasonal Closure Requirements      The analysis of the costs associated with the seasonal closure of designated areas begins by using the Vertical Line Model to estimate the number and type of vessels ordinarily active in each area during the proposed closure period. The remainder of the analysis is organized around two scenarios. In the upper bound, the analysis assumes that these vessels would remove all affected gear from the water for the duration of the closure. In this scenario, economic losses are estimated as the net loss in vessel revenue (i.e., the loss in gross revenue adjusted to take into account estimated savings in operating costs). In the lower bound, the analysis uses available data to identify alternative fishing grounds and the likely subset of vessels that would relocate their gear to alternative areas. In this scenario, estimates of economic losses are based on estimated changes in fuel use, time on the water, and catch per trap.Gear Marking Requirements      Alternatives 2 through 6 (Preferred) specify revised gear marking requirements for vessels that are subject to the ALWTRP, including those in the lobster, OTP, blue crab, and gillnet fisheries. The requirements apply to all gear set in non-exempt waters. Under
Alternatives 2 through 6 (Draft), the new requirements would also apply to gear set in exempt areas of Maine and New Hampshire state waters. In contrast, under Alternative 6 (Preferred), gear set in Maine waters landward of the ALWTRP exemption line would remain exempt from gear marking requirements. For each alternative, the analysis of gear marking costs is based on the Vertical Line Model’s estimates of the number of affected vessels and the number of vertical lines fished by those vessels (taking proposed trawling requirements into account). To model these costs, the analysis assumes that lines would be marked using gear marking whips woven into the line, each of which takes roughly five minutes to install. Annualized material and time costs are estimated for each model vessel, then extrapolated to the broader population of affected vessels.10.6.3.2 Economic Impact Results      Of the fisheries subject to the requirements of the ALWTRP, the lobster fishery would bear the largest share of impacts from the regulatory alternatives under consideration.  As  Exhibit 10-10 shows, the lobster fishery accounts for the greatest number of vessels that would be required to reconfigure their gear to comply with trawling requirements. This is true across  all action alternatives. In addition, the analysis indicates that the lobster fishery alone would be affected by the seasonal closure of fishing grounds. In contrast, all vessels fishing gear subject to ALWTRP requirements would be affected by the gear marking provisions. Under Alternatives 2 through 6 (Draft), this includes gear fished in Maine and New Hampshire waters that otherwise would be exempt from ALWTRP requirements. Alternative 6 (Preferred) would not require gear set in Maine’s exempt waters to be marked; as a result, the number of vessels projected to be affected by this alternative (approximately 4,000) is substantially lower than the estimate provided for the other action alternatives (approximately 6,100).

Several findings are noteworthy:• Of the action alternatives, estimated costs are lowest for Alternative 3. This alternative incorporates less stringent trawling requirements than specified under Alternative 2 and includes only the CCB Restricted Area closure, which affects relatively few vessels and poses limited costs.• Alternative 4 is likely to pose the greatest costs. It includes three closures, all of which cover large areas. The estimated impact of the closures
specified under this alternative ranges from $1.3 million to $2.1 million per year.• The cost of complying with Alternative 5 is likely to be somewhat less than that of complying with Alternative 4. The difference is attributable to a difference in trawling requirements, which are slightly less stringent under Alternative 5.• In general, compliance with gear configuration requirements imposes the greatest costs, with estimates ranging as high as $4.4 million per year.  The costs attributable to the seasonal closure of restricted areas also contribute substantially to the estimate of total compliance costs under Alternatives 4, 5, 6 (Draft), and 6 (Preferred). Gear marking requirements add approximately $1 million annually to the estimated cost of complying with most of the action alternatives.• Gear marking costs are substantially lower under Alternative 6 (Preferred) because it does not require gear in Maine waters landward of the ALWTRP exemption line to be marked. In the lower bound scenario, this leads the estimate of total compliance costs for Alternative 6 (Preferred) to be lower than the corresponding figures for the other action alternatives.  In the upper bound scenario, the overall estimate for Alternative 6 (Preferred) is slightly higher than that for Alternative 3, but lower than the estimates for the other action alternatives.      Research suggests that current practices are largely consistent with the gear configuration requirements proposed for Southeast trap/pot fisheries. Therefore, the cost of complying with them is unlikely to be substantial and these costs are not analyzed in detail.Exhibit 10-11ESTIMATE OF ANNUAL COMPLIANCE COSTS BY REGULATORY COMPONENT(2011 dollars)Regulatory AlternativeGear ConfigurationClosures  Gear MarkingTotalLowerUpperLowerUpperLowerUpperAlternative 1 (No Action)$0$0$0$0$0$0$0Alternative 2$1,241,000$4,392,000$0$0$1,014,000$2,255,000$5,407,000Alternative 3$1,003,000$3,349,000$21,000$49,000$1,047,000$2,070,000$4,445,000Alternative 4$1,213,000$4,288,000$1,340,000$2,113,000$1,010,000$3,562,000$7,411,000Alternative 5$996,000$3,240,000$1,340,000$2,113,000$1,043,000$3,379,000$6,396,000Alternative 6 (Draft)$1,009,000$3,323,000$557,000$831,000$1,054,000$2,620,000$5,208,000Alternative 6 (Preferred)$1,015,000$3,316,000$557,000$831,000$338,000$1,910,000$4,484,000Note: Values may not sum to the totals shown due to rounding.
      Exhibit 10-12 summarizes the estimate of annual compliance costs by regulatory alternative and fishery. Depending on the alternative and scenario (upper versus lower bound) in question, the analysis indicates that the lobster fishery would incur roughly 80 percent to 90 percent of estimated costs under Alternatives 2 through 6 (Preferred). OTP vessels would also incur a substantial share of costs under these alternatives, primarily because of the proposed minimum trawl-length requirements. The impact of the action alternatives on other fisheries is likely to be minor, reflecting the costs associated with meeting new gear marking requirements.Exhibit 10-12DISTRIBUTION OF ESTIMATED ANNUAL COMPLIANCE COSTS BY FISHERY(2011 dollars)Regulatory AlternativeFisheryTotalLobster Trap/PotOther Trap/PotBlue CrabGillnetLowerUpperLowerUpperLowerUpperAlternative 1(No Action)$0$0$0$0$0$0$0$0Alternative 2$1,814,000$4,546,000$430,000$849,000$7,000$5,000$2,255,000$5,407,000Alternative 3$1,645,000$3,600,000$414,000$833,000$7,000$5,000$2,070,000$4,445,000Alternative 4$3,121,000$6,550,000$430,000$849,000$7,000$5,000$3,562,000$7,411,000Alternative 5$2,954,000$5,551,000$414,000$833,000$7,000$5,000$3,379,000$6,396,000Alternative 6 (Draft)$2,192,000$4,361,000$416,000$836,000$7,000$5,000$2,620,000$5,208,000Alternative 6(Preferred)$1,482,000$3,637,000$416,000$835,000$7,000$5,000$1,910,000$4,484,000Note: Values may not sum to the totals shown due to rounding.      As noted above, the analysis suggests that the lobster fishery would bear the majority of the costs of complying with Alternatives 2 through 6 (Preferred). To provide additional context, Exhibit 10-13 presents the estimates of annual compliance costs for the lobster fishery as a percentage of ex-vessel revenues for the fishery in 2011; these revenues totaled approximately$423.8 million. As the exhibit indicates, the estimated impact ranges from 0.4 percent of  revenue under Alternative 3 (lower bound scenario) to 1.5 percent of revenue under Alternative 4 (upper bound scenario).  Under Alternative 6 (Preferred), the estimate of compliance costs  ranges from 0.3 percent to 0.9 percent of 2011 revenue.

This category, however, covers a range of disparate fisheries. As a result, a comparison of compliance costs to revenue for this category is more difficult to develop and potentially less meaningful. Rather than present such a comparison, the analysis relies on a more detailed examination of the impact of the alternatives relative to estimated revenues for groups of vessels that would be most heavily affected by the introduction of new regulations. This examination is incorporated into the analysis of the social impacts of  the alternatives, which is summarized below.10.7 SOCIAL IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVES      The analysis of social impacts considers how compliance with the regulatory alternatives could affect the socioeconomic viability of fishing and fishermen’s quality of life. The method and results described here are presented in greater detail in Chapter 7.10.7.1 Potentially Affected Communities      The social impact analysis first uses county-level data on affected fishing vessels to identify the communities at greatest risk of experiencing adverse social impacts stemming from the ALWTRP modifications under consideration. The analysis uses additional county-level socioeconomic data to characterize key features of the at-risk communities, examining  economic, demographic, and social features that may influence the impact of the regulations on the region.      Communities in mid-coast and Downeast Maine are the most vulnerable to adverse social impacts as a result of changes to the ALWTRP. Washington, Hancock, and Knox counties in particular are highly exposed to the effects of regulation due to the importance of the lobster fishery to these communities. The value of ALWTRP-affected landings in these communities is substantial, and the highest of all affected communities. Additionally, the total number of
affected vessels in these three counties is higher than in any other county in the affected region. These communities are also highly sensitive to the proposed regulations, as evidenced by their substantial social, cultural, and economic dependence upon fishing. The rural nature of the economy in these counties, coupled with high unemployment and poverty rates, suggest that they may have a relatively low capacity to adapt to economic impacts induced by new ALWTRP regulations.      More than 50 percent of ex-vessel revenues in Maine’s other coastal counties is attributable to landings made with ALWTRP gear. In some instances, however, such as Waldo County, the overall value of these landings is relatively low. In others, such as Lincoln, Sagadahoc, Cumberland, and York, the value of potentially affected landings is substantial, but the economy as a whole is more diversified. As a result, these counties are somewhat less sensitive to adverse impacts that may stem from changes in ALWTRP regulations. The same is true of New Hampshire’s Rockingham County. There, 85 percent of ex-vessel revenues are derived from landings made with ALWTRP gear, which suggests that the county’s harvesting sector is highly exposed. The sensitivity of the county’s economy as a whole, however, is tempered by a relatively high degree of diversification. In addition, Rockingham County’s unemployment rate is the lowest reported among the counties analyzed; this suggests that its economy has a relatively strong capacity to respond to change, and that the region is less vulnerable to adverse impacts than areas where unemployment is higher.      In Massachusetts and Rhode Island, the situation is more varied. In general, the value of landings made with ALWTRP gear in the counties of these states is lower than that reported for counties in Maine and New Hampshire, both on an absolute and a relative basis. In addition, the economies of the counties in Massachusetts and Rhode Island tend to be more diversified and less dependent on the commercial fishing sector. Nonetheless, ALWTRP gear accounts for ex- vessel revenues of more than $15 million per year in Essex (MA), Barnstable (MA), and Bristol (MA) counties, suggesting that exposure to adverse impacts in these counties may be substantial. Dependence on commercial fishing is moderate in Essex and Bristol counties, but is high in Barnstable County. With an unemployment rate that exceeds 10 percent, Barnstable County may be particularly vulnerable to adverse impacts stemming from the introduction of new ALWTRP regulations.10.7.2 Comparison of Vessel Compliance Costs to Ex-Vessel Revenues      To identify potentially hard-hit sectors of the commercial fishing industry, the analysis compares estimates of average vessel compliance costs to estimates of average gross revenue per vessel. There is no clearly-defined threshold at which annualized costs represent a large enough percent of annual revenues that a vessel operator would cease fishing, or would otherwise suffer social and economic hardship. For purposes of discussion, however, the analysis highlights two impact categories, which are consistent with those employed in previous analyses of the impacts of new ALWTRP regulations:23           23 See National Marine Fisheries Service, Final Environmental Impact Statement for Amending the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan: Broad-Based Gear Modifications, August 2007.
• Heavily-Affected Vessels – Segments of a fishery for which the estimated upper bound compliance costs exceed 15 percent of annual revenues.• At-Risk Vessels – Segments of a fishery for which estimated compliance costs range between 5 and 15 percent of annual revenues.The number of vessels identified as heavily affected ranges from zero under Alternatives 2 and 3 to 163 under Alternatives 4 and 5 (see Exhibit 10-14). For the latter two alternatives, the vessels in the heavily affected category are lobster vessels that would be displaced either by the closure of Jeffreys Ledge or the closure of Massachusetts Restricted Area #1. In contrast, under Alternatives 6 (Draft) and 6 (Preferred), the analysis identifies 90 vessels as heavily affected; this group consists of lobster vessels that would be displaced by the closure of Massachusetts Restricted Area #2.10.7.3 Other Socioeconomic Impacts      As Exhibit 10-14 indicates, the regulatory alternatives under consideration could generate additional socioeconomic impacts beyond the direct effect of compliance costs on vessel operation. For example:• To the extent that compliance reduces lobster landings, the dealer and processing sectors of the economy could be affected. The estimated reduction in landings of lobster is greatest under Alternative 4 (2.1 million pounds per year) and smallest under Alternative 3 (1.0 million pounds per year). Even in the case of Alternative 4, however, the estimated effect on landings is less than two percent of total landings in 2011. Because the reduction is substantially less than the annual fluctuation in total landings in recent years, adverse impacts on the dealer and processing sectors under any of the alternatives are unlikely to be substantial.• Competition for fishing grounds may increase if changes to the ALWTRP include the seasonal closure of certain fishing grounds. Most notably, fishermen who would otherwise fish in the closed area may relocate their effort to new grounds, increasing competition in those areas. Competition for fishing grounds may also increase to the extent that fishermen relocate from their traditional fishing grounds to exempted waters or waters that are subject to more moderate regulation.

• Increased congestion in certain areas may increase the incidence of gear conflicts. Gear conflicts may also arise because of ALWTRP regulations that require fishermen in some cases to use trawls with a single endline, which prevents other fishermen from visually determining the direction in which a trawl or string is set.• Minimum trawl-length requirements implemented under the ALWTRP may pose safety issues for fishermen. Some industry representatives have suggested that hauling or setting trawls from a small vessel can be dangerous due to the increased quantity of groundline lying on and deploying from a crowded deck, increasing the risk of a crew member becoming entangled and possibly pulled overboard. Furthermore, sources suggest that hauling gear with sinking groundline may pose a danger when fishermen attempt to free fouled line from a snag on bottom structure – an occurrence that could become more common with the introduction of minimum trawl-length requirements.• Some small vessels may find it infeasible to comply with minimum trawl- length requirements due to limitations on deck space and related issues.  To the extent that smaller vessels have difficulty competing, trends toward consolidation and increased corporate ownership of fishing vessels may be reinforced.Because new gear configuration requirements under Alternatives 2 through 6 (Preferred) would affect roughly the same number of vessels, the impacts related to such requirements under each of these alternatives is likely to be similar. The potential for increased crowding, competition  and gear conflicts, however, is greatest under Alternatives 4 and 5, which include the most extensive seasonal area closures.      The public welfare benefits associated with increased whale protection are likely to be similar across all action alternatives. As noted, the analysis measures the change in whale protection offered by a given alternative as a change in the co-occurrence of whales and vertical lines. By this measure, Alternative 5 offers the greatest protection to whales, with a reduction in co-occurrence (upper bound scenario) of 42 percent. Alternative 2 offers the least benefit, with a reduction in co-occurrence (upper bound scenario) of 36 percent. These biological benefits have socioeconomic implications for the general public. An increase in the abundance of whales would have a positive impact on the consumer surplus derived from whale watching (a use benefit) and may increase producer surplus for operators of whale watch vessels. Likewise, whale conservation may enhance intrinsic values that society holds for healthy, flourishing whale populations.10.8 INTEGRATION OF RESULTS      As previously noted, the inability to quantify and value the benefits of potential changes to the ALWTRP prohibits the use of BCA to identify the regulatory alternative that would provide the greatest net benefit. Instead, Exhibit 10-15 summarizes the estimated cost of
complying with each regulatory alternative, coupled with the estimated impact of each alternative on the Vertical Line Model’s co-occurrence indicator. It also presents estimates of  the cost-effectiveness of each alternative in reducing co-occurrence, both in the aggregate and for its major components (i.e., gear marking, gear reconfiguration, and seasonal area closures). Because the alternatives vary with respect to the reduction in co-occurrence they achieve, it is not possible to identify a superior option based on cost-effectiveness alone.24 Nonetheless, the cost-effectiveness figures provide a useful means of comparing the relative impacts of the regulatory provisions that each alternative incorporates. The exhibit reveals several noteworthy findings:• The minimum trawl-length requirements yield the greatest reduction in co- occurrence for the associated compliance cost. In contrast, closures are less cost-effective, as evidenced by their greater cost per unit reduction in co-occurrence.• Alternative 3 is cost-effective relative to most of the other alternatives ($56,000 to $119,000 per unit of co-occurrence reduction). This is in part because the costs attributed to the seasonal closure of the Cape Cod Bay Restricted Area are relatively low. In addition, this alternative includes modifications to the gear reconfiguration requirements specified in Alternative 2 that are estimated to have a greater impact on co-occurrence at a lower total cost.• The cost-effectiveness estimates for the remaining closures – Jeffreys Ledge, Jordan Basin, Massachusetts Restricted Area #1, and Massachusetts Restricted Area #2 – range from $194,000 to $573,000 per unit of co-occurrence reduction.• Overall, the least cost-effective alternative is Alternative 4. It includes the same gear reconfiguration requirements specified under Alternative 2, plus three closures with relatively high costs per unit of co-occurrence reduction. Alternative 5 appears to be superior to Alternative 4, achieving a greater estimated impact on co-occurrence at a lower total cost.• Alternative 6 (Preferred) is the most cost-effective of the alternatives ($51,000 to $118,000 per unit of co-occurrence reduction). It eliminates gear marking requirements for vessels in Maine exempt waters, lowering costs without affecting the estimated co-occurrence reductions. Like Alternative 6 (Draft), it includes only one closure (Massachusetts Restricted Area #2), further improving overall cost-effectiveness relative to alternatives that include more extensive closures.24 OMB, 2003.

The exhibit displays co-occurrence reduction on the horizontal axis and compliance costs on the vertical axis for both the upper and lower bound scenarios for each
alternative. The segments of each curve show the marginal impacts of the two alternatives’  major regulatory provisions. As the exhibit shows, gear-marking costs under Alternative 6 (Preferred) are estimated to be approximately one-third of those under Alternative 4, reflecting the exemption from gear-marking requirements the preferred alternative provides for gear in Maine’s exempt waters. This shifts the cost-effectiveness curves for Alternative 6 (Preferred) downward from those for Alternative 4, as reflected in the lower y-intercept. The marginal impacts of the two alternatives’ gear reconfiguration provisions are similar, although these impacts are estimated to be slightly more effective and less costly under Alternative 6 (Preferred). In contrast, the provisions for seasonal area closures under Alternative 4 are more extensive than those under Alternative 6 (Preferred), yielding a greater reduction in co- occurrence scores. The benefits associated with these closures, however, come at a relatively high cost, as reflected in the steeper slope of the segments of the cost-effectiveness curves that represent these impacts.
      NMFS has considered the benefit and cost information presented above and believes that Alternative 6 (Preferred) offers the best option for achieving compliance with MMPA and ESA requirements. By excluding vessels in Maine exempt waters from gear marking requirements, Alternative 6 (Preferred) reduces compliance costs with no direct or immediate effect on the estimated reduction in co-occurrence. In addition, Alternative 6 (Preferred) provides most of the benefits that would be achieved under more stringent alternatives, sacrificing only the relatively costly additional reduction in co-occurrence that would be achieved by the closure of Jeffreys Ledge, Jordan Basin, and Massachusetts Restricted Area #1. Based on these considerations, NMFS has identified Alternative 6 (Preferred) as its proposed approach to achieving the goals of the ALWTRP.

FINAL REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ANALYSIS	CHAPTER 1111.1 INTRODUCTION      The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) requires Federal regulatory agencies to examine the impacts of proposed and existing rules on small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions. The RFA requires that agencies develop an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) and a Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (FRFA). These analyses evaluate the impact that the regulatory alternatives under consideration would have on small entities and examine ways to minimize these impacts. Although the RFA does not require that the alternative with the least impact on small entities be selected, it does require that the expected impacts be adequately characterized.      In accordance with the RFA, this FRFA evaluates the modifications to the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan (ALWTRP) that the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) is considering. The FRFA addresses the following issues:• The objectives and legal basis of the proposal to revise the ALWTRP;• The problem addressed by the ALWTRP;• The provisions included in the regulatory alternatives under consideration, and how NMFS considered public comment in reducing the preferred alternative’s impact on small entities;• The small entities potentially affected by the ALWTRP;• The impacts of the proposed rules on small entities; and• Rules that may duplicate, overlap, or conflict with the proposed rule.11.2 OBJECTIVES AND LEGAL BASIS OF PROPOSED RULES      The revisions to the ALWTRP that NMFS is considering are designed to improve the effectiveness of commercial fishing regulations implemented to conserve and protect three endangered species – North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis), North Atlantic humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), and fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) – thereby
fulfilling NMFS' obligations under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA). The need for the proposed revisions is demonstrated by the continuing risk of serious injury and mortality of Atlantic large whales due to entanglement in commercial fishing gear.      The MMPA of 1972 provides protection for species or stocks that are, or may be, in danger of extinction or depletion as a result of human activity. The MMPA states that measures should be taken immediately to replenish the population of any marine mammal species or stock that has diminished below its optimum sustainable level. With respect to any stock or species, the “optimum sustainable population” is the number of animals that will result in the maximum productivity of the stock or species, taking into account the carrying capacity of the habitat and the health of the ecosystem of which they form a constituent element.      Under the MMPA, the Secretary of Commerce is responsible for the conservation and management of pinnipeds (other than walruses) and cetaceans (including whales). The Secretary of Commerce has delegated MMPA authority to NMFS.      In 1994, Congress amended the MMPA, establishing new provisions to govern the taking of marine mammals incidental to commercial fishing operations.1 These new provisions include the preparation of stock assessments for all marine mammal stocks in waters under U.S. jurisdiction, and development and implementation of take reduction plans for stocks that may be reduced or are being maintained below their optimum sustainable population due to interactions with commercial fisheries.      Take reduction plans are required for all "strategic stocks." Under the MMPA, a "strategic stock" is a stock: (1) for which the level of direct human-caused mortality exceeds the Potential Biological Removal (PBR) level; (2) that is declining and is likely to be listed under the ESA in the foreseeable future; or (3) that is listed as a threatened or endangered species under the ESA or as a depleted species under the MMPA.2 The immediate goal of a take reduction plan is to reduce, within six months of its implementation, the mortality and serious injury of strategic stocks incidentally taken in the course of U.S. commercial fishing operations to below the PBR levels established for such stocks. The long-term goal of a take reduction plan is to reduce, within five years of its implementation, the incidental mortality and serious injury of strategic marine mammals taken in the course of commercial fishing operations to insignificant levels approaching a zero mortality and serious injury rate, taking into account the economics of the fishery, the availability of existing technology, and existing state or regional fishery management plans.      Right whales, humpback whales, and fin whales are listed as endangered species under the ESA, and are thus considered strategic stocks under the MMPA. Pursuant to its obligations           1 As defined in the MMPA, the term "take" means to harass, hunt, capture, or kill, or attempt to harass, hunt, capture, or kill any marine mammal.           2 The Potential Biological Removal (PBR) level is defined in the MMPA as the maximum number of animals, not including natural mortalities, which may be removed from a marine mammal stock annually while allowing that stock to reach or maintain its optimum sustainable population. Procedures for calculating the PBR level are described in the MMPA.
under the MMPA, NMFS in 1996 established the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Team (ALWTRT), an advisory group empaneled to develop recommendations for reducing the incidental take of large whales in commercial fisheries along the Atlantic Coast. The ALWTRT includes representatives of the fishing industry, state and Federal resource management agencies, the scientific community, and conservation organizations. The purpose of the ALWTRT is to provide guidance to NMFS in developing and amending the ALWTRP to meet the goals of the MMPA with respect to Atlantic large whales.      In addition to the MMPA, the ESA provides a legal foundation for measures to protect right whales, humpback whales, and fin whales. The ESA provides for the conservation of species that are in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of their range, as well as the conservation of the ecosystems on which these species depend.3 The right whale, humpback whale, and fin whale species are all federally-listed as endangered and are therefore subject to protection under the ESA.      Section 7 of the ESA directs all Federal agencies to use their existing authorities to conserve threatened and endangered species and to ensure that their actions do not jeopardize listed species or destroy or adversely modify the critical habitat of those species. When a proposed Federal action may affect an ESA-listed marine species, Section 7 directs that the "Action agency" consult with the Secretary of Commerce; this is referred to as a Section 7 consultation.4,5      To assess impacts on large whale and sea turtle species protected under the ESA, NMFS has prepared Biological Opinions for the continued authorization of Federal fisheries under the Fishery Management Plans (FMPs) for the multispecies, spiny dogfish, and monkfish fisheries, and under Federal regulations for the lobster fishery, amongst others. Section 7 consultations were first initiated for each of these fisheries either at the time the FMP was developed or, in the case of lobster, when a significant amendment (Amendment 5) to the Federal Lobster Management Plan was under consideration. The Northeast multispecies fishery has a long consultation history, including formal and informal Section 7 consultations, beginning with a formal consultation initiated on June 12, 1986. Formal consultation was first initiated for spiny dogfish on August 13, 1999; for monkfish on December 21, 1998; and for lobster on March 23, 1994. Subsequent ESA Section 7 consultations on those fisheries incorporated the ALWTRP as  a Reasonable and Prudent Alternative (RPA) to avoid jeopardy to right whales. NMFS reinitiated consultation on May 4, 2000, for the multispecies, spiny dogfish and monkfish gillnet fisheries, and on June 22, 2000, for the lobster fishery, following new whale entanglements resulting in serious injuries to right whales, at least one right whale mortality in gillnet gear, new information           3 "Species," as defined by the ESA, includes any subspecies of fish, wildlife, or plant and any distinct population segment of any vertebrate species which interbreeds when mature.           4 The "Action agency" is the Federal agency charged with permitting, conducting or funding the proposed activity serving as the basis for the consultation.           5 Federal agencies must consult with the Secretary of the Interior when a proposed action may affect an ESA-listed species under the Department of Interior’s purview.
indicating a declining status for western North Atlantic right whales, and revisions to the ALWTRP.      The Biological Opinions from the May/June 2000 Section 7 consultations, finalized June 14, 2001, found that NMFS' authorization of these Federal fisheries, as modified by the ALWTRP requirements in effect at that time, was likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the western North Atlantic right whale. The Biological Opinions identified a set of Reasonable and Prudent Alternatives designed to avoid the likelihood of jeopardy to right whales. These measures included:• Seasonal Area Management (SAM);• Dynamic Area Management (DAM);• An expansion of gillnet gear modification requirements and restrictions to Mid-Atlantic waters and modification of fishing practices in Southeastern waters;• Continued gear research and modifications; and• Additional measures that implement and monitor the effectiveness of the RPAs.These measures were intended, in combination, to reduce the risk of serious injury or mortality of large whales from entanglements in commercial fishing gear, and to minimize adverse impacts if entanglements occur.      Following implementation of the measures described above, entanglements leading to serious injury or death of protected whales, including the North Atlantic right whale, continued to occur. Accordingly, NMFS reinitiated consultation on the continued authorization of  a number of fisheries and began to develop modifications to the ALWTRP. At its 2003 meeting, the ALWTRT agreed to manage entanglement risks by focusing first on reducing the risk associated with groundlines, then reducing the risk associated with vertical lines. In October 2007, NMFS issued a final rule that replaced the SAM and DAM programs with broad-based gear modification requirements, including the use of sinking groundline; expanded weak link requirements; additional gear marking requirements; changes in boundaries; seasonal restrictions for gear modifications; expanded exempted areas; and changes in regulatory language for the purposes of clarification and consistency (72 FR 57104, October 5, 2007). The broad-based sinking groundline requirement became fully effective on April 5, 2009. This final rule also incorporated an amendment to the ALWTRP (72 FR 34632, June 25, 2007) that implemented, with revisions, previous ALWTRP regulations by expanding the Southeast U.S. Restricted Area to include waters within 35 nm (64.82 km) of the South Carolina coast, dividing the SoutheastU.S. Restricted Area into Southeast U.S. Restricted Areas North and South, and modified regulations pertaining to gillnetting within the Southeast U.S. Restricted Area.      Following implementation of these measures, NMFS and the ALWTRT turned their collective focus to vertical line risk reduction. At the 2009 ALWTRT meeting, the Team agreed
on a schedule to develop a management approach to reduce the risk of serious injury and mortality due to vertical line. As a result of this schedule, NMFS committed to publishing a final rule to address vertical line entanglement by 2014. NMFS also reinitiated consultation on continued authorization of FMPs for a number of fisheries (American lobster; bluefish; spiny dogfish; monkfish; Northeast multispecies; skate; Atlantic mackerel, squid, and butterfish; and summer flounder, scup and Northern black sea bass). These consultations concluded in October 2010. After identifying the steps being taken by NMFS to develop, analyze and implement a vertical line reduction rule, the agency’s Biological Opinions concluded that continued operation of the fisheries noted above would be likely to adversely affect, but not jeopardize, the continued existence of right, humpback, and fin whales.11.3 PROBLEM ADDRESSED BY ALWTRP      Right whales, humpback whales, and fin whales are listed as endangered species under the ESA, and are thus considered strategic stocks under the MMPA. The measures that the ALWTRP requires focus on the conservation of these species, and also benefit minke whales. The current status of these species is summarized below:• Right Whale: The western North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) is one of the rarest of all large cetaceans. It is among the most endangered species in the world and is listed as endangered under the ESA. NMFS considers the best estimate of the population of North Atlantic right whales to be approximately 444, well below the optimum sustainable population (OSP).6 PBR for this species is currently  0.9 whales per year (Waring et al., 2013).• Humpback Whale: The North Atlantic humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) is listed as an endangered species under the ESA. For the Gulf of Maine stock of humpback whales, NMFS estimates a minimum population of 823. PBR for this stock is currently 2.7 whales per year (Waring et al., 2013).• Fin Whale: The fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) is listed as an endangered species under the ESA. Although researchers debate the existence of several distinct subpopulations of this species, NMFS currently treats all fin whales within U.S. waters of the North Atlantic as members of a single population, with an estimated minimum size of 2,817. PBR for this species is currently 5.6 whales per year (Waring et al., 2013).• Minke Whale: The minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) is not listed as endangered or threatened under the ESA. Minke whales in U.S. waters of the North Atlantic are considered part of the Canadian east coast           6 The optimum sustainable population of any stock or species is defined as the number of animals that will result in the maximum productivity of the stock or species, keeping in mind the carrying capacity of the habitat and the health of the ecosystem of which they form a constituent element (16 USC 1362(9)).
stock of this species. NMFS estimates a minimum population for this stock of 16,199; PBR is currently 162 whales per year (Waring et al., 2013).      Atlantic large whales are at risk of becoming entangled in fishing gear because the whales feed, travel and breed in many of the same ocean areas utilized for commercial fishing. Fishermen typically leave fishing gear such as gillnets and traps/pots in the water for a discrete period, after which time the nets/traps/pots are hauled and their catch retrieved. While the gear is in the water, whales may become entangled in the lines and nets that comprise trap/pot and gillnet fishing gear. The effects of entanglement can range from no permanent injury to death.      A scarification analysis conducted by the New England Aquarium (Knowlton et al., 2002) found that juvenile right whales are entangled with greater frequency than adults. Juvenile animals may not have sufficient strength to break free from entangling lines, which can lead to serious injury and infection resulting from the animal "growing into" the lines.      A study of right whale and humpback whale entanglements (Johnson et al., 2005) found that in cases where the point of gear attachment was known, right whale entanglements frequently (77.4 percent; 24 of 31 entanglement events) involved the mouth, which may indicate that many entanglements occur while whales are feeding. The study also found that humpback whales are more commonly reported with entanglements in the tail region (53.0 percent; 16 of 30 entanglement events), in cases where the point of attachment was known.7 The number of entanglements for which gear type can be identified is too small to detect any trends in the type of gear involved in lethal entanglements. Trap/pot and gillnet gear, however, seem to be the  most common, as in 89 percent of the cases the gear was identified as or consistent with trap/pot or gillnet gear (Johnson et al., 2005).8 The study confirmed that vertical lines and floating groundlines posed risks for large whales; however, the authors concluded that any type and part of fixed gear is capable of entangling a whale, and several body parts of the whale can be involved.      Exhibit 11-1 summarizes all known serious injury entanglements of right, humpback, fin, and minke whales from 1997 through 2010, the most recent year that data is available for all species. Humpback whales account for the greatest number of serious injury entanglements (35), followed by right whales (11); minke whales account for five, and fin whales account for four.7 In some cases, other parts of the body in addition to the tail may have been entangled.           8 According to Johnson et al. (2005), analyses focused on entanglements from which the gear  was examined by NMFS gear specialists, as well as other sources considered reliable, but also included entanglements for which the gear type and/or part was identified (e.g., by a fisherman or biologist) but not recovered. In some cases, recovered gear can definitively be traced back to a particular fishery, but in other cases, certain parts of the gear may be recovered that could be considered consistent with gear that is used in a particular fishery. For  example, the gear recovered from right whale #3107 consisted of line with a 600-pound weak link, and thus was considered consistent with gear used in the lobster trap/pot fishery. Note that Johnson et al. (2005) have classified this whale’s entanglement as lobster trap/pot gear that was set in an unknown location.
Exhibit 11-1      Exhibit 11-2 presents available data on fatal entanglements of Atlantic large whales from 1997 through 2010, the most recent year that data is available for all species. Minke whales account for the most known entanglement mortalities (31), followed by humpback whales (20), right whales (8), and fin whales (6).
Exhibit 11-211.4 REGULATORY ALTERNATIVES11.4.1 Overview      NMFS has identified seven regulatory alternatives for consideration. The first of these (Alternative 1) is the No Action Alternative, which would make no changes to the ALWTRP. The remaining alternatives propose modifications to the ALWTRP that include some combination of the following:• Gear Configuration Requirements – All of the alternatives propose area-specific minimum trawl lengths for trap/pot fisheries in the  Northeast; the minimums specified vary by alternative (see below). Additional provisions mandate the use of single traps or pots and specify weak link, vertical line strength, and vertical line composition requirements for trap/pot fisheries in the Southeast; these requirements are the same for all action alternatives.
• Closures – Several alternatives would prohibit ALWTRP trap/pot vessels from fishing in designated areas during designated periods (see below).• Gear Marking – Each of the action alternatives includes revised gear marking requirements for vessels subject to the ALWTRP. The proposed gear marking scheme calls for three 12-inch marks per vertical line, adhering to a regional color-coding system. Under Alternatives 2 through 6 (Draft), the requirements would apply to all gear set in non-exempt waters, as well as to gear set in exempt waters of Maine and New Hampshire. Alternative 6 (Preferred) would impose similar requirements, but would not require gear set landward of Maine’s exemption line to be marked.      Exhibit 11-3 provides an overview and comparison of the alternatives. With the exception of Alternative 6 (Preferred), all of the alternatives were considered in NMFS’ Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS).      Exhibit 11-4 describes the gear configuration requirements of the action alternatives in greater detail, showing how they vary. Most notably, Alternatives 3, 5, 6 (Draft), and 6 (Preferred) modify the minimum trawl length restrictions incorporated under Alternative 2; the trawling requirements under Alternative 4 are equivalent to those specified in Alternative 2.      Alternatives 2 through 6 (Preferred) include a set of special requirements for the blue crab and OTP fisheries operating in ALWTRP-regulated waters off the coasts of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. In waters off South Carolina and Georgia, the alternatives require affected vessels to fish singles; use weak links with a breaking strength no greater than 600 pounds; use vertical line with a breaking strength no greater than 2,200 pounds; and use vertical line that is free of weights, knots, and splices. The requirements for waters off Florida are similar, but specify 200-pound weak links and the use of sink rope with a breaking strength no greater than 1,500-pounds over the entire length of each vertical line.      As noted, some of the alternatives under consideration would introduce the seasonal closure of designated areas to trap/pot gear. Exhibit 11-5 summarizes the basic parameters of each closure, while Exhibit 11-6 presents a series of maps illustrating the location of the areas in which fishing would be restricted. The objective of these provisions is to reduce the concentration of fishing gear when whales are likely to congregate in the areas designated for closure, thus reducing the risk of entanglement.

11.4.2 Preferred Alternative      In response to comments received on the DEIS and proposed rule, NMFS formulated a preferred alternative for the FEIS that differs in several respects from Alternative 5, which NMFS identified as its preferred alternative in the DEIS. Specifically, Alternative 6 (Preferred) differs from Alternative 5 in the following ways:• It maintains the sinking groundline requirement for gear set in New Hampshire state waters that are currently subject to that requirement;• It imposes no gear marking requirement for waters in Maine that are exempt from all other ALWTRP requirements;• It specifies a minimum of two traps per trawl in Massachusetts and Rhode Island state waters, rather than three;• It requires a minimum of two traps per trawl in Maine pocket waters, rather than three;• It imposes no trawling requirement for trap/pot gear set within a quarter mile of Monhegan, Matinicus, or Ragged Islands;• It does not incorporate the seasonal closure of Jordan Basin or Jeffreys Ledge; and• It requires the seasonal closure of Massachusetts Restricted Area #2 rather than Massachusetts Restricted Area #1.For the most part, the changes in NMFS’ proposed regulations respond to comments concerning the impact of the new rules on commercial fishermen. The changes are designed to reduce the economic and social impacts of the new requirements while having a relatively modest impact on the effectiveness of these requirements in achieving the goals of the ALWTRP. This is borne out by the summary of estimated impacts presented in Chapter 8, which indicates that Alternative 6 (Preferred) would achieve nearly as great a reduction in co-occurrence scores as Alternative 5 (an estimated 37 to 38 percent reduction under Alternative 6 (Preferred) vs. a 40 to 42 percent reduction under Alternative 5) at approximately 57 to 70 percent of the estimated cost. Additional information on NMFS’ consideration of public comments in developing its preferred alternative is provided below.11.4.3 Public Comments and NMFS Response11.4.3.1 Comments during Scoping Process      The scoping efforts conducted for this rulemaking included meetings of the full ALWTRT and ALWTRT subgroups, as well as a series of public meetings held in the summer of 2011 at key locations along the Atlantic coast. The stakeholders engaged through this process recommended a variety of approaches for achieving the goals of the ALWTRP. Chapter 3 of the
EIS summarizes the input they provided, including (1) suggestions that were incorporated into the alternatives analyzed in the EIS, and (2) suggestions that were considered but rejected in the formulation of regulatory alternatives.11.4.3.2 Comments on the DEIS and Associated IRFA      Volume II of the EIS includes a summary of the comments received on the DEIS and NMFS’ response to those comments, highlighting where it has revised the draft analysis or explaining why NMFS believes the issue has been adequately considered. None of the  comments received focused specifically on the IRFA presented in the DEIS. Numerous comments, however – particularly those offered by commercial fishermen at public hearings along the Atlantic coast – questioned the cost-effectiveness of Alternative 5, which NMFS identified as its preferred alternative in the DEIS. In addition, both fishermen and state fisheries management agencies raised concerns about the safety, enforceability, or practicality of proposed requirements in certain areas and noted the economic burden they would place on those affected.      The comments on the DEIS have guided formulation of a new preferred alternative for the FEIS. This alternative – Alternative 6 (Preferred) – differs from Alternative 5 in a number ways. The changes in the proposed regulations are designed to mitigate the economic and social impacts of new ALWTRP requirements without substantially reducing the requirements’ overall effectiveness. The major changes relative to NMFS’ initial regulatory proposal are as follows:• Alternative 6 (Preferred) would impose no gear marking requirement for Maine waters that are exempt from other ALWTRP requirements. Maintaining the status quo for those who fish in these areas relieves them of the cost of marking gear used where whales are infrequently sighted. Moreover, the introduction of a unique gear marking scheme for these areas, as proposed under Alternative 5, would raise operational difficulties for fishermen who routinely shift gear between exempt and non-exempt areas; they would either need to remark their gear each time they crossed the exemption line or maintain different sets of line for each area. By removing the gear marking requirement for exempt waters – as suggested, among others, by Maine’s Department of Marine Resources, the Downeast Lobstermen’s Association, the Island Institute, and the Maine Lobstermen’s Association – Alternative 6 (Preferred) eliminates this complexity and reduces the potential burden on affected vessels.• Alternative 6 (Preferred) specifies a minimum of two traps per trawl in Massachusetts and Rhode Island state waters, rather than three. This change is in response to comments from the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries, the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management, and others who raised concerns about the safety and operational feasibility of fishing three-trap trawls from small vessels that operate in state waters.
• Alternative 6 (Preferred) also specifies a minimum of two traps per trawl in Maine pocket waters, rather than three. This change responds to comments from Maine’s Department of Marine Resources, the Downeast Lobstermen’s Association, and the Maine Lobstermen’s Association concerning the practicality of enforcing a different standard (i.e., a minimum of three traps per trawl) in these waters, which are small areas of the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone that lie between but not within Maine state waters. Chapter 3 illustrates the location of these areas.• Alternative 6 (Preferred) imposes no trawling requirement for trap/pot gear set within a quarter mile of Monhegan, Matinicus, or Ragged Islands. This change is in response to comments from Maine’s Department of Marine Resources, the Downeast Lobstermen’s Association, the Island Institute, and the Maine Lobstermen’s Association, all of whom raised concerns about the safety and operational feasibility of employing trawls in these waters, particularly for those fishing from small boats.• Alternative 6 (Preferred) does not incorporate the seasonal closure of Jordan Basin or Jeffreys Ledge, responding to comments from the Maine Department of Marine Resources, New Hampshire Fish and Game Department, and Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries, among others, who questioned the cost-effectiveness of these measures and noted the substantial burden they would place on the vessels they would displace.• Alternative 6 (Preferred) requires the seasonal closure of Massachusetts Restricted Area #2 rather than Massachusetts Restricted Area #1, thus leaving slightly more than 300 square miles of ocean south and east of Cape Cod open to trap/pot gear from January through April. This change in response to comments from the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries, which noted that Massachusetts Restricted Area #1 includes an area of Nantucket Sound where whales are unlikely to be found and no co- occurrence of whales with trap/pot gear has been documented.11.5 SMALL ENTITIES AFFECTED      The Small Business Administration (SBA) size standards define whether a business entity is small and, thus, eligible for Government programs and preferences reserved for “small business” concerns. Size standards have been established for all for-profit economic activities or industries in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). The SBA defines a small business in the commercial fishing sector as a firm with receipts (gross revenues) of up to$3.5 million. Processing facilities (e.g., canning, curing, freezing) are considered small businesses if they employ 500 or fewer individuals. For fish and seafood wholesalers, a small business is defined as one that employees 100 or fewer employees. As such, virtually all fishing and most wholesale and processing operations in the eastern U.S. are small businesses.
11.5.1 Fishing Operations      The ALWTRP governs fishing operations that set fishing gear in ways that place fishing line (e.g., buoy lines) in the water column, thereby creating the potential for whale entanglements. The fisheries of primary concern that are affected by the ALWTRP include the American lobster trap/pot fishery; the blue crab trap/pot fishery; OTP fisheries such as red crab and Jonah crab; and gillnetting operations. A detailed description of each of the fisheries can be found in Chapter 4 of this EIS. Exhibit 11-7 summarizes the number of vessels in each of the affected fisheries subject to regulation under each management alternative. As shown, the analysis estimates that Alternatives 2 through 6 (Draft) would affect more than 6,000 commercial fishing vessels (i.e., small businesses in the harvest sector), while Alternative 6  (Preferred) would affect approximately 4,000 vessels. The overwhelming majority of these vessels participate in the lobster trap/pot fishery. Chapter 6 describes the data sources and methodology used to derive these estimates in greater detail.Exhibit 11-7NUMBER OF VESSELS AFFECTED BY NEW REQUIREMENTS, BY FISHERYRegulatory ProvisionsRegulatory AlternativeFisheryTotal Lobster Trap/Pot Other Trap/PotBlue CrabGillnetGear ConfigurationAlternative 1 (No Action)00000Alternative 21,679139001,817Alternative 31,256136001,392Alternative 41,695139001,834Alternative 51,263136001,400Alternative 6 (Draft)1,228136001,364Alternative 6 (Preferred)1,221136001,357ClosuresAlternative 1 (No Action)00000Alternative 200000Alternative 31600016Alternative 4184000184Alternative 5184000184Alternative 6 (Draft)109000109Alternative 6 (Preferred)109000109Gear MarkingAlternative 1 (No Action)00000Alternative 25,300282484996,129Alternative 35,300282484996,129Alternative 45,300282484996,129Alternative 55,300282484996,129Alternative 6 (Draft)5,300282484996,129Alternative 6 (Preferred)3,186274484984,006AllAlternative 1 (No Action)00000Alternative 25,300282484996,129Alternative 35,300282484996,129Alternative 45,300282484996,129Alternative 55,300282484996,129Alternative 6 (Draft)5,300282484996,129Alternative 6 (Preferred)3,186274484984,006Note: Values may not sum to the totals shown due to rounding.
      Although the analysis indicates that the alternatives under consideration could affect several thousand vessels, only a subset of these vessels is likely to be substantially affected. The economic analysis estimates the costs of gear marking to be relatively minor (see Chapter 6 for a detailed discussion of the costs of gear marking). The costs of compliance with gear conversion and closure requirements, however, may be substantial. As such, the analysis does not anticipate that blue crab or gillnet vessels will be substantially affected by the regulations. A subset of participants in the lobster fishery and, to a lesser extent, other trap/pot fisheries will bear the greatest regulatory burden.11.5.2 Other Small Entities      In addition to fishing operations, the introduction of new regulations under the ALWTRP could potentially affect seafood dealers and processors. Seafood dealers include wholesale businesses that purchase fish at the dock and distribute it to processors and retailers. Because ALWTRP regulations affect fisheries that land a variety of species, the types of processing facilities that may be affected are diverse, and include operations that fillet, freeze, package, and otherwise prepare seafood. Effects on dealers and processors would be significant to the extent that compliance with the ALWTRP influences the quantity of lobster, crabs and fish landed.      As Chapter 6 discusses in detail, the economic impact analysis assumes that implementation of all action alternatives would result in an overall reduction in lobster landings. This effect is due to two factors:• A reduction in catch per trap resulting from the use of longer trawls; and• Reduced effort or relocation to less productive fishing grounds during seasonal closures.      Exhibit 11-8 summarizes the number of dealers and processors potentially affected by the proposed changes in ALWTRP requirements. Because the requirements that may lead to harvest reductions (i.e., gear modifications and seasonal closures) are limited to the Northeast region, identification of the number of potentially affected dealers and processors is limited to those located in that region. As shown, the analysis suggests that 428 dealers and 64 processors could be affected by the changes to the ALWTRP that NMFS is considering.      In addition to dealers and processors, revisions to ALWTRP requirements could potentially affect other small entities in the regional economy (to the extent that landings are reduced). These include small seafood retailers, fishing gear manufacturers and suppliers, and marina operators. Because data on these sectors are not readily available, the analysis does not examine them in detail.

The number of dealers is derived by identifying all 2011 landings caught with gear potentially subject to ALWTRP regulations, then calculating the number of unique dealer operations purchasing this catch. The number of processors iscalculated by identifying the set of processing facilities that handle any of the species caught in ALWTRP-regulated gear.
11.6 IMPACTS OF REGULATORY ALTERNATIVES ON SMALL ENTITIES11.6.1 Impacts of Alternative 6 (Preferred) on Fishing Operations      As noted above, the analysis indicates that the new management measures incorporated under Alternative 6 (Preferred) would affect approximately 4,000 vessels. In most cases, however, the impact would be limited to compliance with new gear marking provisions. The  cost of complying with these provisions is relatively minor and unlikely to lead to substantial economic impacts, such as vessel retirement (see Chapter 6 for a detailed discussion of the costs of gear marking). Thus, the analysis does not anticipate a substantial impact on vessels that would be affected solely by the introduction of the new gear marking scheme.      The impact of minimum trawl length requirements and the seasonal closure of Massachusetts Restricted Area #2 to trap/pot gear would be more substantial. The cost of complying with the gear configuration provisions includes the cost of acquiring new gear (e.g., additional groundline), labor costs associated with reconfiguring gear, and associated catch impacts. For vessels affected by the closure, the impact is a loss in revenue, coupled with relocation costs (e.g., fuel, time, and potential catch impacts) for vessels that seek out alternative fishing grounds.       The discussion that follows looks more closely at specific sub-segments of the harvest sector and potential impacts on vessel operators. The discussion focuses on whether the costs of regulatory compliance will adversely affect these small businesses and/or cause changes in fishing effort (e.g., vessel retirement) and landings that may lead to impacts to small businesses in the dealer and processing sectors. To identify potentially hard-hit sectors of the harvest sector, the analysis compares estimates of average vessel compliance costs under Alternative 6 (Preferred) to estimates of average gross revenue per vessel.9 Exhibits 11-9 through 11-11 present the results of this analysis. There is no clearly-defined threshold at which annualized costs represent a large enough percent of annual revenues that a vessel operator would cease fishing, or would otherwise suffer economic hardship. For purposes of analysis, however, the exhibits highlight two impact categories:• Heavily-Affected Vessels – Segments of a fishery for which the estimated upper bound compliance costs exceed 15 percent of annual revenues.• At-Risk Vessels – Segments of a fishery for which estimated compliance costs range between 5 and 15 percent of annual revenues.      Vessels that would not be affected by the seasonal closure of Massachusetts Restricted Area #2 are likely to face substantially lower cost burdens than those affected by the closure. In light of this difference, the analysis separately describes the estimated impact of Alternative 6 (Preferred) on these two groups of vessels.9 A summary of the estimated impacts of the other alternatives analyzed is presented later in this chapter.
11.6.1.1 Impacts of Gear Configuration and Gear Marking Requirements      Under Alternative 6 (Preferred), the cost of meeting new gear configuration and gear marking requirements is estimated to be less than 15 percent of gross revenues for all vessels (see Exhibits 11-9 and 11-10). As a result, the impact of these provisions alone would not lead any group of vessels to be designated as heavily affected, either in the low or high cost scenarios. Several groups, however, are identified as at-risk. Under the lower bound scenario, the at-risk category includes OTP vessels fishing in the state waters of Rhode Island or northern Massachusetts (SRAs 1-9). Under the upper bound scenario, the analysis identifies 10 additional groups of vessels as at-risk:• OTP vessels fishing in Massachusetts SRAs 10 through 13 or SRA 14, as well as OTP vessels fishing in Federal waters of the Northeast region;• Massachusetts lobster vessels fishing in SRAs 7, 9, and 14;• Lobster vessels fishing in the non-exempt state waters of Maine Zone E; and• Lobster vessels fishing in the Federal waters of Maine Zones D, E, and F.10The estimate of impacts for these vessels ranges no higher than seven percent of gross revenues in the lower bound scenario and no higher than 12 percent in the upper bound scenario. This impact is substantial; however, the economic burden associated with gear marking and gear reconfiguration provisions alone is not sufficient to place these vessels in the heavily affected category, or to suggest that the impact of complying with these provisions would have a severe impact on socioeconomic conditions in coastal communities.11.6.1.2 Vessels Affected by Closures      In comparison to Alternative 1, the no action alternative, the analysis estimates that under Alternative 6 (Preferred), 109 lobster vessels would be required to suspend operations or relocate their effort to comply with the seasonal closure of Massachusetts Restricted Area #2. The costs these vessels would incur to comply with the closure would be in addition to the costs attributable to other requirements. The analysis indicates that, in aggregate, these measures would have a substantial impact on the affected vessels (see Exhibit 11-11).           10 It is important to recognize that the estimate of impacts presented for each group of vessels is limited to the costs and revenues associated with gear being fished in a specific location. In practice, vessels may fish in multiple locations. Thus, the estimated cost of compliance as a percentage of revenue does not necessarily represent the overall burden on a particular vessel; instead, it represents the impact on that vessel for the portion of its effort based in a given area. Similarly, the estimate of revenues employed in the analysis does not necessarily represent a vessel’s total revenues; it simply represents the revenues derived from effort in a particular area.
• As a lower bound, the analysis assumes that the vessels affected by the closure would be able to relocate their gear and continue to operate in other areas while the closure remains in effect. Under this scenario, the annual cost of compliance is estimated to range from 4.8 to 12.4 percent of the affected vessels’ average annual gross revenue. The results suggest that most of those affected would face a cost burden that would place them in the at-risk category (i.e., annualized compliance costs ranging from 5 to 15 percent of annual revenues).• As an upper bound, the analysis assumes that the affected vessels would suspend operations and forgo the revenue (net of operating cost savings) on the catch they otherwise would have landed. In this case, the annual cost of compliance is estimated to range from 8.8 to 20.4 percent of the affected vessels’ average annual gross revenue. The impact on most of those that would be displaced is estimated at greater than 15 percent – above the threshold specified for “heavily affected” vessels – suggesting the potential for some vessels to cease fishing entirely.

11.6.2 Impacts of Alternative 6 (Preferred) on Dealers and Processors      To the extent that changes in ALWTRP regulations reduce overall harvest, small businesses in the dealer and processing sectors may be affected. For Alternative 6 (Preferred), the analysis projects a potential reduction in lobster landings ranging from 474,000 to 1,231,000 pounds per year (see Appendix 7-B). Relative to 2011, when commercial landings of lobster totaled 126,460,000 pounds, this represents a 0.4 to 1.0 percent reduction in annual landings.      Even if the impacts at the high end of the range projected for Alternative 6 (Preferred) are realized, a notable effect on the lobster market is unlikely, particularly in the long run. All else equal, a 1.0 percent reduction in landings would be expected to result in an increase in the price that dealers and processors pay for lobster. The impact on prices would likely be greatest from January through April, when the closure of Massachusetts Restricted Area #2 would be in effect. This increase, however, is likely to be offset by an increase in prices at the wholesale and retail level; to the extent that this occurs, the profits of dealers and wholesalers would be largely unaffected.11 Moreover, the magnitude of the projected impact is considerably less than the typical fluctuation in annual lobster landings; it may also diminish over time, as fishermen adjust and learn to fish trawls more efficiently. Thus, the marginal effect of the regulations would be unlikely to lead to a substantial change in overall market conditions.      In summary, the analysis suggests that the regulations under consideration would be unlikely to have a major impact on landings. Thus, any impact on the dealer or processing sectors is likely to be minimal.11.6.3 Impacts of Other Alternatives Analyzed      Exhibit 11-12 compares the projected impacts of Alternative 6 (Preferred) on small businesses to those of the other regulatory alternatives analyzed. The following findings are noteworthy:• The number of vessels affected by gear reconfiguration requirements is greatest under Alternatives 2 and 4 (approximately 1,800 vessels), and is only slightly less under Alternatives 3, 5, 6 (Draft), and 6 (Preferred) (approximately 1,400 vessels). None of the vessels subject solely to these requirements would face compliance costs that qualify them as heavily affected.• Based on the ratio of compliance costs to gross revenue, the number of vessels identified as heavily affected ranges from zero under Alternatives 2 and 3 to 163 vessels under Alternatives 4 and 5. For the latter two           11 It is important to note that any increase in ex-vessel prices would, at least in theory, help to offset the costs that fishermen would incur in complying with new regulations. Whether this would in fact be  the  case depends on the extent to which an increase in prices at the retail level would translate to an increase in ex-vessel prices, or would instead be reflected in higher profits elsewhere in the supply chain.
alternatives, the vessels in the heavily affected category are lobster vessels that would be displaced either by the closure of Jeffreys Ledge or the closure of Massachusetts Restricted Area #1. In contrast,  under Alternative 6 (Draft) and 6 (Preferred), the analysis identifies 90 vessels as heavily affected; this group consists of lobster vessels that would be displaced by the closure of Massachusetts Restricted Area #2.• The estimated reduction in landings of lobster is greatest under Alternative 4 (2.1 million pounds per year) and smallest under Alternative 3 (997,000 pounds per year). However, landings reductions under all alternatives represent less than two percent of 2011 total landings. Because the reduction is substantially less than the annual fluctuation in total landings in recent years, adverse impacts on the dealer and processing sectors under any of the alternatives are unlikely.Exhibit 11-12SUMMARY OF IMPACTS BY ALTERNATIVEParameterAlternative 1Alternative 2Alternative 3Alternative 4Alternative 5Alternative 6 (Draft)Alternative 6 (Preferred)Number of Heavily Affected Vessels(Upper Bound Scenario)0001631639090Impacts on DealersNoneMinor short- term supply disruptions possibleMinor short- term and seasonal supplydisruptions possibleMinor short- term and seasonal supplydisruptions possibleMinor short- term and seasonal supplydisruptions possibleMinor short- term and seasonal supplydisruptions possibleMinor short- term and seasonal supplydisruptions possibleImpacts on ProcessorsNoneMinor short- term supply disruptions possibleMinor short- term and seasonal supply disruptionspossibleMinor short- term and seasonal supply disruptionspossibleMinor short- term and seasonal supply disruptionspossibleMinor short- term and seasonal supply disruptionspossibleMinor short- term and seasonal supply disruptionspossible11.7 RULES THAT MAY DUPLICATE, OVERLAP, OR CONFLICT WITH PROPOSED RULENo duplicative, overlapping, or conflicting Federal rules have been identified.

APPLICABLE LAWS	CHAPTER 1212.1 MAGNUSON-STEVENS FISHERY CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT ACT INCLUDING ESSENTIAL FISH HABITAT      The Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) provisions of the Magnuson-Stevens Act require  NMFS to provide recommendations to Federal and state agencies for conserving and enhancing EFH if a determination is made that an action may adversely impact EFH. NMFS policy regarding the preparation of NEPA documents recommends incorporating EFH assessments into environmental impact statements; therefore, this Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) will also serve as an EFH assessment.      Pursuant to these requirements, Chapter 3 of this document provides a description of the alternatives considered for amending the ALWTRP. Chapter 4 provides a description of the affected environment, including the identification of areas designated as EFH (section 4.4.1), Habitat Areas of Particular Concern (section 4.4.2), and an analysis of the impacts of fishing gear on that environment (section 4.4.4).12.2 NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT      This analysis was prepared in full compliance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). All established procedures to ensure that Federal agency decision makers take environmental factors into account, including the use of a public process, were followed (Exhibits 3B-1 and 3B-2). This FEIS contains all the components required by NEPA, CEQ Regulations for Implementing NEPA, and NOAA Administrative Order 216-6, including a brief discussion of the purpose and need for the proposal (Chapter 2), the alternatives considered (Chapter 3), the environmental impacts of the proposed action and the alternatives (Chapter 5), a list of document preparers and contributors (Chapter 13), and other relevant information.12.3 ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT      Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act requires Federal agencies conducting, authorizing, or funding activities that may affect threatened or endangered species to ensure that those impacts do not jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or result in the
destruction or adverse modification of habitat determined to be critical. In 2003, NMFS was advised that the 2002 death of a female right whale (RW #3107) was an entanglement-related mortality. The gear recovered from RW #3107 was consistent with gear approved for use in theU.S. lobster fishery, which provided evidence that the reasonable and prudent alternative (RPA) described in the June 14, 2001, biological opinion for this fishery was not effective at avoiding the likelihood of jeopardy to right whales. As required, the Section 7 consultation was reinitiated to examine the effects of the lobster fishery, as modified by the existing ALWTRP and RPA for right whales. These consultations, which concluded in October 2010, evaluated the effect of the proposed action identified in the 2006 FEIS for the existing ALWTRP, which included the measures under each of the fishery management plans as well as those under the ALWTRP. Specifically, these Biological Opinions stated that it was anticipated that the final regulations implementing the vertical line strategy would prioritize risk reduction in areas where there is the greatest co-occurrence of vertical lines and large whales. After reviewing the current status of right, humpback, fin, and sei whales as well as loggerhead and leatherback sea turtles, the environmental baseline and cumulative effects in the action area, the effects of the continued operation of the American Lobster, bluefish, dogfish, monkfish, multispecies, skate, squid, mackerel and butterfish and summer flounder, scup and Northern black sea bass FMPs, in compliance with the requirements of the ALWTRP, in October 2010, NMFS issued its Biological Opinions that these proposed activities are likely to adversely affect, but not jeopardize, the continued existence of these species.      This document analyzes the potential impacts of the preferred alternative (Alternative 6 Final) on ESA-listed species in Chapter 5. This discussion concludes that the preferred alternative would directly benefit the ESA-listed large whales. The preferred alternative would also benefit leatherback sea turtles, which are known to become entangled in buoy lines of trap/pot gear, by reducing the number of buoy lines in the water. No other effects to ESA-listed species are expected as a result of the alternative.12.4 MARINE MAMMAL PROTECTION ACT      Under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), Federal responsibility for protecting and conserving marine mammals is vested with the Departments of Commerce (NMFS) and Interior (USFWS). The primary management objective of the MMPA is to maintain the health and stability of the marine ecosystem, with a goal of obtaining an optimum sustainable population of marine mammals within the carrying capacity of the habitat. The MMPA is intended to work in cooperation with the applicable provisions of the ESA. The ESA-listed species of marine mammal that occur in the ALWTRP management areas are discussed in section 4.1 of the FEIS. The species of marine mammal not listed under the ESA that occur in the ALWTRP management areas are discussed in section 4.3.2, except minke whales, which are discussed in section 4.1.4. The potential impact of the alternatives considered on marine mammals is provided in Chapter 5.
12.5 COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT ACT      The Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) is designed to encourage and assist states in developing coastal management programs, to coordinate state activities, and to safeguard regional and national interests in the coastal zone. Section 307(c) of the CZMA requires that any Federal activity affecting the land or water uses or natural resources of a state’s coastal zone be consistent with the state’s approved coastal management program, to the maximum extent practicable. NMFS has determined that the implementation of the preferred alternative would be consistent to the maximum extent practicable with the approved coastal management programs of Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. This determination was submitted, along with a copy of this document, for review and concurrence by the responsible state agencies under Section 307 of the Coastal Zone Management Act.12.6 ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT      The Federal Administrative Procedure Act (APA) establishes procedural requirements applicable to informal rulemaking by Federal agencies. The purpose of the APA is to ensure public access to the Federal rulemaking process and to give the public notice and an opportunity to comment before the agency promulgates new regulations. Specifically, the APA requires NMFS to solicit, review, and respond to public comments on actions taken in the development of take reduction plans and subsequent amendments and modifications. Development of the alternatives considered for this amendment to the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan provided several opportunities for public review, input, and access to the rulemaking process. For example, during the public scoping process, NMFS requested suggestions and information from the public on the range of issues that should be addressed and alternatives that should be considered in this document. Summaries of the written and oral comments received during the public scoping process and public hearings are provided in Volume II of the FEIS.12.7 INFORMATION QUALITY ACT (SECTION 515)      The Information Quality Act directed the Office of Management and Budget to issue government wide guidelines that “provide policy and procedural guidance to Federal agencies for ensuring and maximizing the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of information (including statistical information) disseminated by Federal agencies.” Under the NOAA guidelines, the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan is considered a Natural Resource Plan. It is a composite of several types of information, including scientific, management, and stakeholder input, from a variety of sources. Compliance of this document with NOAA guidelines is evaluated below.• Utility: The information disseminated is intended to describe proposed management actions and the impacts of those actions. The information is intended to be useful to: 1) industry participants, conservation groups, and other interested parties so they can provide informed comments on the
alternatives considered; and 2) managers and policy makers so they can choose an alternative for implementation.• Integrity: Information and data, including statistics, that may be considered as confidential were used in the analysis of impacts associated with this document. This information was necessary to assess the biological, social, and economic impacts of the alternatives considered as required under the National Environmental Policy Act and Regulatory Flexibility Act for the preparation of a final environmental impact statement/regulatory impact review. NMFS complied with all relevant statutory and regulatory requirements as well as NOAA policy regarding confidentiality of data. For example, confidential data were only accessible to authorized Federal employees and contractors for the performance of legally required analyses. In addition, confidential data  are safeguarded to prevent improper disclosure or unauthorized use. Finally, the information to be made available to the public was done so in aggregate, summary, or other such form that does not disclose the identity or business of any person.• Objectivity: The NOAA Information Quality Guidelines for Natural Resource Plans state that plans must be presented in an accurate, clear, complete, and unbiased manner. Because take reduction plans and their implementing regulations affect such a wide range of interests, NMFS strives to draft and present proposed management measures in a clear and easily understandable manner with detailed descriptions that explain the decision making process and the implications of management measures on marine resources and the public. Although the alternatives considered in this document rely upon scientific information, analyses, and conclusions, clear distinctions would be drawn between policy choices and the supporting science. In addition, the scientific information relied upon in the development, drafting, and publication of this FEIS was properly cited and a list of references was provided. Finally, this document was  reviewed by a variety of biologists, policy analysts, economists, and attorneys from the Northeast Region as well as the Headquarters office in Silver Spring, MD. In general, this team of reviewers has extensive experience with the policies and programs established for the protection of marine mammals, and specifically with the development and implementation of the ALWTRP. Therefore, this Natural Resource Plan was reviewed by technically qualified individuals to ensure that the document was complete, unbiased, objective, and relevant. This review was conducted at a level commensurate with the importance of the interpreted product and the constraints imposed by legally-enforceable deadlines.
12.8 PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT      The collection of information for or by the Federal government − in the case of the ALWTRP regulations, the marking of fishing gear − is subject to the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) of 1995. PRA establishes a process for the review  and approval of information collections by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in an effort to minimize the paperwork burden resulting from federal information collection efforts. Pursuant to PRA, NMFS must file a separate supporting statement to OMB that requests clearance for the gear marking provisions of the final rule. In this submission, NMFS must detail the purpose, necessity, implementation methods, responses to public comments, and estimates of the time and cost burdens of the new gear marking provisions. The gear marking requirements under Alternative 6 Final (Preferred) are discussed in section 3.1.7 of this document.12.9 EXECUTIVE ORDER 13132 - FEDERALISM      EO 13132, otherwise known as the Federalism EO, was signed by President Clinton on August 4, 1999, and published in the Federal Register on August 10, 1999 (64 FR 43255). This EO is intended to guide Federal agencies in the formulation and implementation of “policies that have federal implications.” Such policies are regulations, legislative comments or proposed legislation, and other policy statements or actions that have substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between the national government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. EO 13132 requires Federal agencies to have a process to ensure meaningful and timely input by state and local officials in the development of regulatory policies that have federalism implications. A Federal summary impact statement is also required for rules that have federalism implications.      EO 13132 establishes fundamental federalism principles based on the U.S. Constitution, and specifies both federalism policy-making criteria and special requirements for the preemption of state law.  For example, a Federal action that limits the policy making discretion of a state is  to be taken only where there is constitutional and statutory authority for the action and it is appropriate in light of the presence of a problem of national significance. In addition, where a Federal statute does not have expressed provisions for preemption of state law, such a preemption by Federal rule-making may be done only when the exercise of state authority directly conflicts with the exercise of Federal authority. To preclude conflict between state and Federal law on take reduction plans, the Marine Mammal Protection Act explicitly establishes conditions for Federal preemption of state regulations. Furthermore, close state-Federal consultation on fishery management measures implemented under the ALWTRP is provided by the take reduction team process. The implementation of any of the alternatives considered would contain policies with federalism implications sufficient to warrant the preparation of a federalism assessment under EO 13132. Therefore, the Assistant Secretary for Legislative and Intergovernmental Affairs will provide notice of the action to the appropriate official(s) of affected state, local and/or tribal governments.
12.10 EXECUTIVE ORDER 12866      The requirements for all regulatory actions specified in EO 12866 are summarized in the following statement from the order:In deciding whether and how to regulate, agencies should assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives, including the alternative of not regulating. Costs and benefits shall be understood to include both quantifiable measures (to the fullest extent that these can be usefully estimated) and qualitative measures of costs and benefits that are difficult to quantify, but nevertheless essential to consider. Further, in choosing among alternative regulatory approaches, agencies should select those approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environment, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and equity), unless a statute requires another regulatory approach.The analysis meeting the above described requirements of the EO are found in the section entitled Regulatory Impact Review (RIR), which is included within this EIS in Chapter 10.12.11 REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ACT      The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) was enacted in 1980 to place the burden on the Federal government to review all regulations to ensure that, while accomplishing their intended purposes, they do not unduly inhibit the ability of small entities to compete. The RFA emphasizes predicting significant adverse impacts on small entities as a group distinct from other entities and on the consideration of alternatives that may minimize the impacts while still achieving the stated objective of the action. When an agency publishes a final rule, unless it can provide a factual basis upon which to certify that no such adverse effects will accrue, it must prepare and make available for public review a Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (FRFA) that describes the impact of the rule on small entities. The FRFA for this action is provided in Chapter 11.12.12 EXECUTIVE ORDER 12898 – ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE      The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines environmental justice as, “the fair treatment for all people of all races, cultures, and incomes, regarding the development of environmental laws, regulations, and policies.” EO 12898 was implemented in response to the growing need to address the impacts of environmental pollution on particular segments of our society. This order requires each Federal agency to achieve environmental justice by addressing “disproportionately high and adverse human health and environmental effects on minority and low-income populations.” In furtherance of this objective, the EPA developed an Environmental Justice Strategy that focuses the agency’s efforts in addressing these concerns. For example, to determine whether environmental justice concerns exist, the demographics of the affected area should be examined to ascertain whether minority populations and low-income populations are present, and, if so, a determination must be made as to whether implementation of the
alternatives may cause disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on these populations. Environmental justice concerns typically embody pollution and other environmental health issues, but the EPA has stated that addressing environmental justice concerns is consistent with NEPA; therefore, all Federal agencies are required to identify and address these issues. Many of the participants in the fisheries regulated under the ALWTRP may come from lower income and/or ethnic minority populations. These populations may be more vulnerable to the management measures considered in this document; however, the economic and social impact analyses performed for the FEIS suggest that a relatively small segment of regulated vessels will incur significant cost impacts relative to annual revenues. Chapter 7 describes the demographic and economic characteristics of the regions where affected vessels are based and examines the features of heavily affected vessel groups.12.13 EXECUTIVE ORDER 13158 – MARINE PROTECTED AREAS      EO 13158 requires each Federal agency whose actions affect the natural or cultural resources that are protected by a Marine Protected Area (MPA) to identify such actions, and, to the extent permitted by law and to the extent practicable, avoid harm to the natural and cultural resources that are protected by an MPA. EO 13158 promotes the development of MPAs by enhancing or expanding the protection of existing MPAs and establishing or recommending new MPAs. The EO defines an MPA as “any area of the marine environment that has been reserved by Federal, State, territorial, tribal, or local laws or regulations to provide lasting protection for part or all of the natural and cultural resources therein.”      Pursuant to this order, the Departments of Commerce and the Interior developed a list of MPAs that meet the definition. The Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary was classified as a MPA. In addition, four Tilefish Gear Restricted Areas in the Mid-Atlantic have been added to the National System of Marine Protected Areas: Lydonia Canyon, Norfolk Canyon, Oceanographer Canyon, and Veatch Canyon.

Also called a set gillnet.Anthropogenic: Human made.Baleen whales: Baleen whales (also known as Mysticeti, or mustached whales) are filter feeders that have baleen, a sieve-like device used for filter feeding krill, copepods, plankton, and small fish. They are the largest whales and have two blowholes. Baleen whales include blue, fin, gray, humpback, minke, bowhead, and right whales.Benthic: The bottom habitat of any aquatic environment.Berried: Carrying eggs.Bioaccumulation: The ability of organisms to retain and concentrate substances from their environment. The gradual build-up of substances in living tissue; usually used in referring to toxic substances; may result from direct absorption from the environment or through the food- chain.Biological opinion: Under the provisions of the Endangered Species Act, an opinion prepared by the Action agency as to whether or not a proposed action is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed species, or adversely modify critical habitat.Biomagnification: Increasing concentration of a substance in successive trophic levels of a food chain.
Biomass: The total mass of living matter in a given unit area or the weight of a fish stock or portion thereof.Biopsy: The removal of a small piece of tissue for microscopic examination. Biotoxins: Highly toxic compounds produced by harmful algal blooms (HABs). Bitter end: The loose end of a line that has detached from a weak link.Bottom portion of the line: For buoy lines, the portion of the line in the water column that is closest to the fishing gear.Breaking strength: The highest tensile force that an object can withstand before breaking.Bridle: The lines connecting a gillnet to an anchor or buoy line.Buoy line: A line connecting fishing gear in the water to a buoy at the surface of the water.Bycatch: Fish that are harvested in a fishery but are not sold or kept for personal use, including economic discards and regulatory discards, but not fish released alive under a recreational catch and release fishery management program.Carapace:	The shield-like exoskeleton plate that covers at least part of the anterior dorsal surface of many arthropods.Caudal peduncle: The stalk of a whale or fish tail that connects the tail fins to the body.Cetaceans: Aquatic mammals, including whales.Ciguatoxin: A toxin produced by microorganisms living in algae found in reef areas. This compound accumulates up the food chain, reaching higher concentrations in top marine predators. Ciguatoxin is not destroyed by cooking, drying, salting, or freezing.Climate change: The term “climate change” is sometimes used to refer to all forms of climatic inconsistency, but because the Earth’s climate is never static, the term is more properly used to imply a significant change from one climatic condition to another. In some cases, “climate change” has been used synonymously with the term, “global warming;” scientists, however, tend to use the term in the wider sense to also include natural changes in climate.Compliance costs: All costs associated with adapting vessel operations to meet regulatory requirements.Copepods: Microscopic crustaceans that are important members of the zooplankton.Critical habitat area: The specific areas within the geographical area occupied by a threatened or endangered species, on which are found those physical or biological features essential to the conservation of the species and which may require special management considerations or protection.
Crustacean: Invertebrates characterized by a hard outer shell and jointed appendages and bodies. Higher forms of this class include lobsters, shrimp and crawfish; lower forms include barnacles.Days at sea (DAS) allocation: The total days, including steaming time, that a boat is permitted to spend at sea fishing.DDT (dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane): An organochlorine insecticide no longer registered for use in the United States.Decompression sickness: A general term for all bubble-related problems arising from decompression. Decompression is the change from one ambient pressure to a lower ambient pressure that results in a reduction of gas pressures in the body.Depleted: Under the provisions of the Marine Mammal Protection Act, any species or population stock below its optimum sustainable population as determined by the Secretary of Commerce after consultation with the Marine Mammal Commission (MMC) and the Committee of Scientific Advisors on Marine Mammals.Dieldrin: An organochlorine insecticide no longer registered for use in the United States.Dinoflagellates: A diverse assemblage of biflagellate unicellular organisms, which constitute an important component of marine, brackish, and fresh bodies of water.Driftnet: A gillnet that is unattached to the ocean bottom and not anchored, secured or weighted to the bottom, regardless of whether attached to a vessel.Effluent: Wastewater, treated or untreated, that flows out of a treatment plant, sewer, or industrial outfall.Endangered: Any species that is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range.Endocrine system: The endocrine system refers to all of the body's hormone-secreting glands. This system works in conjunction with the nervous system to control the production of hormones and their release into the circulatory system.Entanglement: An event in the wild in which a living or dead marine mammal has gear, rope, line, net, or other material wrapped around or attached to it and is:(a) on a beach or shore of the United States; or(b) in waters under the jurisdiction of the United States (including any navigable waters).Epifaunal: Animals and plants that live on the surface of the seafloor, attached to rocks or moving over the bottom.
Essential Fish Habitat (EFH): Those waters and substrate necessary to fish for spawning, breeding, feeding, or growth to maturity. The EFH designation for most managed species is based on a legal text definition and geographical area that are described in the Habitat Omnibus Amendment (1998).Eutrophication: A set of physical, chemical, and biological changes brought about when excessive nutrients are released into the water.Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ): A zone in which the inner boundary is a line coterminous with the seaward boundary of each of the coastal States and the outer boundary is a line 200 miles away and parallel to the inner boundaryExotic: Plants or animals introduced into a community that are not native to the area.F0.1: A conservative fishing mortality rate calculated as the F associated with 10 percent of the slope at origin of the yield-per-recruit curve.FMAX: A fishing mortality rate that maximizes yield per recruit. FMAX is less conservative than F0.1.FMSY: A fishing mortality rate that would produce the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) when the stock biomass is sufficient for producing MSY on a continuing basis.Fathom: A measure of length, containing six feet; the space to which a man can extend his arms; used chiefly in measuring cables, cordage, and the depth of navigable water by soundings.Fecundity: Fertility or ability to reproduce.Finfish: Bony fishes such as bass, trout, salmon, goldfish, carp, etc; does not include sharks or rays.Fishery: The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act defines fishery as "one or more stocks of fish which can be treated as a unit for purposes of conservation and management and which are identified on the basis of geographical, scientific, technical, recreational, and economic characteristics; and...any fishing for such stocks."Fishery Management Plan (FMP): A plan developed by a Regional Fishery Management Council, or the Secretary of Commerce under certain circumstances, to manage a fishery resource in the U.S. EEZ pursuant to the MFCMA (Magnuson Act).Fishing effort: the amount of time and fishing power used to harvest fish. Fishing power is a function of gear size, boat size and horsepower.Fishing mortality (F): A measurement of the rate of removal of fish from a population caused by fishing. This is usually expressed as an instantaneous rate (F) and is the rate at which fish are harvested at any given point in a year. Instantaneous fishing mortality rates can be either fully recruited or biomass weighted. Fishing mortality can also be expressed as an exploitation rate or, less commonly, as a conditional rate of fishing mortality m, the fraction of fish removed during
the year if no other competing sources of mortality occurred. (Lower case m should not be confused with upper case M, the instantaneous rate of natural mortality.)Float line: The rope at the top of a gillnet from which the mesh portion of the net is hung.Food web: The complete set of food links between species in an ecosystem.Fork length: Length of a fish measured from the tip of the snout to the posterior end of the middle caudal rays. This measurement is used instead of standard length for fishes on which it is difficult to ascertain the end of the vertebral column, and instead of total length in fish with a stiff, forked tail, e.g., tuna. Mostly used in fishery biology and not in systematics.Full Time Equivalent Vessel (FTE): Using Federal and state data sources, the model estimates the number of commercial fishing vessels that participate in each fishery. Depending on the location and fishery, the model employs a variety of methods to estimate the number of active vessels this differs from the number of permitted vessels.Gear conflict: Interactions between the gear employed by commercial fishing vessels, such as the severing of a buoy line by a dragger.Gear fouling: Snagging of buoy line or ground line on the ocean floor.Ghost fishing: Continued ability of a piece of gear to capture target and non-target species after it is lost by its tender.Gillnet: Fishing gear consisting of a wall of webbing (meshes) or nets, designed or configured  so that the webbing (meshes) or nets are placed in the water column, usually approximately vertically. Gillnets are designed to capture fish by entanglement, gilling, or wedging. The term "gillnet" includes gillnets of all types, including but not limited to sink gillnets, other anchored gillnets (e.g., stab and set nets), and drift gillnets. Gillnets may or may not be attached to a vessel. The term is intended to include gillnets with or without tiedowns.  Haul/beach seines  have bunt/capture bags and wings, and are therefore not considered gillnets for the purposes of the ALWTRP. North Carolina beach-anchored gillnets, which are fished from shore and report their landings as part of the haul/beach seine fishery, are also not considered gillnets for the purposes of the ALWTRP. Nearshore gillnets, which are set from small vessels just off the beach, but are not attached to the beach, are considered gillnets and are regulated under the ALWTRP.Greenhouse gas: Any gas that absorbs infrared radiation in the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases include, but are not limited to, water vapor, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), ozone (O3), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6).Ground line: With reference to trap/pot gear, a line connecting traps in a trap trawl; with reference to gillnet gear, a line connecting a gillnet or gillnet bridle to an anchor.
Groundfish: Broadly, fish that are caught on or near the sea floor. The term includes a wide variety of bottom fishes, rockfishes, and flatfishes. However, NMFS sometimes uses the term in a narrower sense. In "Fisheries of the United States," the term applies to Atlantic and Pacific  cod, hake, ocean perch, pollock, cusk, and haddock.Growth overfishing: Fishing at an exploitation rate or at an age at entry that reduces potential yields from a cohort but does not reduce reproductive output (see recruitment overfishing).Harmful algal blooms (HABs): The proliferation of toxic nuisance algae that cause a negative impact to natural resources or humans.Heavy metal: A generic term for a range of metals with a moderate to high atomic weight (e.g., cadmium, mercury, lead). Although many are essential for life in trace quantities, in elevated concentrations most are toxic and bioaccumulate.Holding power: The force an anchor can withstand before being dragged along or from the bottom.Hydrocarbons: Organic compounds containing mainly hydrogen and carbon; the basic constituents of fossil fuels.Injury: A wound or other physical harm. In whales, signs of injury include, but are not limited to, visible blood flow, loss of or damage to an appendage or jaw, inability to use one or more appendages, asymmetry in the shape of the body or body position, noticeable swelling or hemorrhage, laceration, puncture, or rupture of eyeball, listless appearance or inability to defend itself, inability to swim or dive upon release from fishing gear, or signs of equilibrium imbalance. Any animal that ingests fishing gear, or any animal that is released with fishing gear entangling, trailing, or perforating any part of the body is considered injured regardless of the absence of any wound or other evidence of an injury.International Maritime Organization: The United Nations agency responsible for improving ship traffic and safety.Isobath: Line connecting points of equal water depth on a chart; a seabed contour.Kyoto Protocol: An international agreement struck by 159 nations attending the Third Conference of Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (held in December of 1997 in Kyoto, Japan) to reduce worldwide emissions of greenhouse gases. If ratified and put into force, individual countries have committed to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by a specified amount.Landings: The portion of the catch that is harvested for personal use or sold.Lead line: The rope, weighted or otherwise, to which the bottom edge of a gillnet is attached.Limited access: Describes a fishery or permit for which a vessel must meet certain criteria by a specified "control date" to participate.
List of fisheries (LOF): A list maintained by NMFS that places each commercial fishery into one of three categories. Fisheries are categorized according to the level of serious injury and mortality of marine mammals that occurs incidental to that fishery.Low risk gear: Gear that is highly unlikely to cause death or serious injury to entangled whales.Marine Mammal Commission (MMC): A scientific advisory board comprised of experts that oversees the administration of the Marine Mammal Protection Act.Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA): An Act passed by the United States Congress in 1972 that prohibits the hunting, killing, harassing, or injuring of marine mammals by any person under U.S. jurisdiction; limited exceptions apply.Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY): The largest long-term average catch or yield that can be taken from a stock or stock complex under prevailing ecological and environmental conditions.Metric ton: A unit of weight equal to a thousand kilograms (1kg. = 2.205 lb.). A metric ton is equivalent to 2,205 lb.
