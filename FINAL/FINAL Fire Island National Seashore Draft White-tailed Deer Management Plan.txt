Final White-tailed Deer Management Plan and Environmental Impact Statement
Fire Island National Seashore, New York
December 2015
Lead Agency: National Park Service (NPS), US Department of the Interior
Cooperating Agencies: New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYS-DEC)
and Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), US Department of Agriculture
This Final White-tailed Deer Management Plan and Environmental Impact Statement (plan/EIS)
describes four alternatives for the management of white-tailed deer at Fire Island National Seashore
(the Seashore), as well as the environment that would be affected by the alternatives and the
environmental consequences of implementing these alternatives.
The purpose of the plan/EIS is to develop a deer management strategy that supports protection,
preservation, regeneration, and restoration of native vegetation and other natural and cultural
resources at the Seashore and reduces undesirable human-deer interactions in the Fire Island
communities. The plan/EIS is also intended to promote public understanding of the complex
relationship between deer and Seashore resources, tick-borne diseases, people, and human
infrastructure. Action is needed at this time to address impacts associated with changes in whitetailed deer abundance, distribution, and behavior across the Seashore. Heavy browsing by whitetailed deer has resulted in adverse impacts on native vegetation across Fire Island as well as on
natural and cultural resources at the William Floyd Estate. The presence of abundant food sources
(including naturally occurring vegetation, unsecured garbage, intentional feeding,
gardens/ornamental landscaping) and shelter in the Fire Island communities have resulted in
adverse interactions between deer and humans and the developed environment. Adverse
interactions also occur due to the habituation of deer to the unthreatening presence of humans and
conditioning of deer, particularly to food sources, in the Fire Island communities and high-visitor
use areas.
Alternative A (the no-action alternative) would continue to implement current management actions,
policies, and monitoring efforts related to deer and their impacts. Current actions within the
Seashore include limited public education and interpretation efforts, vegetation monitoring, and
deer population and behavior surveys. All action alternatives (B, C, and D) would include an
enhanced public education and outreach effort, fencing of the maritime holly forest within the
Sunken Forest, securing the boundary fence at the William Floyd Estate, small-scale fencing to
protect special-status species, increased vegetation monitoring, enhanced deer population and
behavior monitoring, and close coordination with the New York State Department of
Environmental Conservation. Under alternative B, additional deer browsing management actions
would include fencing of the historic core at the William Floyd Estate and rotational fencing of
selected forest areas at the William Floyd Estate lower acreage. The fencing would be implemented
in conjunction with fertility control of white-tailed deer to gradually reduce and then maintain the
deer population at an appropriate density to achieve the plan objectives. Deer observed
approaching humans within the Fire Island communities would be relocated to the Fire Island
Wilderness. Under alternative C (the environmentally preferable alternative), additional actions
would be taken to directly reduce and maintain the deer population at an appropriate deer density
to allow for vegetation regeneration. Deer population reduction and maintenance would be
implemented through a combination of sharpshooting, capture and euthanasia of individual deer
(where necessary), and public hunting (within the Fire Island Wilderness only). Deer observed
approaching humans within the Fire Island communities would be captured and euthanized to
reduce the risk of negative human-deer interactions and prevent other deer from learning this
behavior through observation. Alternative D (the NPS preferred alternative) would include a
US Department of the Interior  National Park Service

combination of actions from both alternatives B and C. The historic core at the William Floyd
Estate would be fenced to exclude deer. The deer population on Fire Island and at the William
Floyd Estate lower acreage would be reduced to an appropriate deer density to achieve the plan
objectives through a combination of sharpshooting, capture and euthanasia of individual deer
(where appropriate), and public hunting (within the Fire Island Wilderness only). Once reduced,
the deer population could be maintained through fertility control or a continuation of actions used
for direct reduction. Similar to alternative C, deer observed approaching humans within the Fire
Island communities would be captured and euthanized.
Implementation of the preferred alternative would result in both beneficial and adverse impacts on
vegetation, unique vegetation communities, and special-status plant species; wetlands; the whitetailed deer population; other wildlife and wildlife habitat; wilderness; cultural landscapes; visitor use
and experience/recreation; Fire Island communities and adjacent landowners; public health and
safety; and Seashore operations.

PURPOSE OF AND NEED FOR ACTION
PURPOSE
The purpose of this White-tailed Deer Management Plan and Environmental Impact Statement
(plan/EIS) is to develop a deer management strategy that: supports protection, preservation, and
restoration of native vegetation and other natural and cultural resources at the Seashore and
reduces undesirable human-deer interactions in the Fire Island communities. The plan/EIS also
promotes public understanding of the complex relationship between deer and Seashore resources,
tick-borne diseases, people, and human infrastructure.

NEED
Since the late 1960s, the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) population at Fire Island
National Seashore (the Seashore) has expanded, leading to severe negative impacts on vegetation
and cultural landscapes and an increase in undesirable human-deer interactions. Seashore staff have
been working to understand and address issues linked to the deer population on Fire Island for 30
years. Concerns were initially focused around a noticeable increase in the number of deer within the
Fire Island communities and the incidence of Lyme disease among Fire Island residents. Impacts of
deer browsing on vegetation were also among the major concerns. In the mid-1980s, researchers
documented a substantial decline in the diversity and abundance of key plant species in the Sunken
Forest, one of the Seashore’s rarest plant communities. More recently, Seashore staff have turned
their attention to the threat posed by deer to native vegetation in other natural zones of the
Seashore and the cultural landscape of the William Floyd Estate.
Information collected as part of research conducted at the Seashore indicates the need for a
management plan to address impacts associated with changes in white-tailed deer abundance,
distribution, and behavior, including




adverse impacts on native vegetation resulting from heavy browsing by white-tailed deer
adverse impacts on natural and cultural resources at the William Floyd Estate resulting
from heavy browsing by white-tailed deer
adverse interactions between deer and humans and the developed environment as a
result of
–
the presence of abundant food sources (including naturally occurring vegetation,
unsecured garbage, intentional feeding, gardens/ornamental landscaping) and shelter in
the Fire Island communities
–
habituation of deer to the unthreatening presence of humans and conditioning of deer,
particularly to food sources, in the Fire Island communities and high-visitor use areas

At current levels, deer browsing in the Sunken Forest and other vegetated areas of the Seashore is
reducing the abundance and diversity of native vegetation, including important understory species.
In some areas, current levels of browsing appear to be creating conditions for an increase in
undesirable species. The loss of native vegetation and overall change in the vegetation communities
could result in impacts on other wildlife species, such as groundnesting birds and small mammals
using these areas for food and shelter.
As a consequence of the habituation of deer to humans on Fire Island, deer have become habituated
to humans and conditioned to human food. This has led to human-deer interactions such as deer

iii

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

approaching humans, people intentionally feeding deer, people unintentionally feeding deer via
unsecured garbage or ornamental plants, and interactions between deer and pets. These
interactions are viewed as undesirable by the Seashore because they raise the risk of injury to people
and deer and increase the likelihood of property damage by deer. In addition, research revealed a
high level of public concern about these topics, and a majority of residents on Fire Island and almost
half of residents in nearby communities on Long Island either worried about deer-related problems
or did not enjoy deer at the Seashore (Siemer et al., 2007). The higher numbers of deer and a limited
understanding of the relationship between deer and tick-borne diseases also promote the
perception by Fire Island community residents of a higher risk of contracting Lyme disease. Other
concerns include injury to deer from fences and deer using residential storage areas and lower
house levels as shelters.
Additionally, current levels of browsing by deer at the William Floyd Estate are resulting in the
degradation of elements of the cultural landscape. The high concentration of deer at the William
Floyd Estate also contributes to the perceived risk of tick-borne diseases, which may affect
visitation at the site.

OBJECTIVES
For the plan/EIS, objectives have been established for the entire Seashore, and more specific
objectives have been developed for the Sunken Forest, the Fire Island communities, and the William
Floyd Estate. The objectives for deer and vegetation management at the Seashore have been
developed to achieve certain conditions throughout the Seashore as a whole and to achieve certain
resource conditions at specific areas within the Seashore, as described below.












Manage a viable white-tailed deer population in the Seashore that is supportive of the other
objectives for this plan/EIS.
Promote natural regeneration of native vegetation.
Protect special-status plant species/vegetation communities and their habitat from high
levels of deer browsing.
Work collaboratively with other land management agencies on issues associated with
abundance, distribution, and behavior of white-tailed deer at the Seashore.
Improve public understanding of the issues such as human-deer interactions, and the
impact of white-tailed deer on the cultural and natural resources of the Seashore, and tickborne diseases throughout the Seashore, including the William Floyd Estate.
Continue to expand the knowledge base regarding the relationship between deer browsing
and plant communities at Fire Island National Seashore to improve management decisions.
Within the Sunken Forest, maintain the character of the globally rare maritime holly forest
in perpetuity by creating conditions for the regeneration of key canopy constituent tree
species and a reasonable representation (as defined in the desired conditions description
below) of herbs and shrubs that made up the Sunken Forest’s vegetative composition when
the Seashore was established.
Reduce the potential for undesirable human-deer interactions both within the Fire Island
communities and at other developed areas of the Seashore.
Manage deer browse to allow for the restoration and preservation of the cultural landscape
of the William Floyd Estate and for the regeneration of the forest within the lower acreage
of the William Floyd Estate.

Description of the Project Area

DESIRED CONDITIONS
Sunken Forest
The Sunken Forest is a globally rare ecosystem with herbaceous vegetation and forest
regeneration that have been impacted by heavy browse pressure from deer. Five studies since
1967 indicate changes in the vegetation structure and composition of the Sunken Forest as the
deer population expanded in the 1970s and 1980s, giving rise to the concern that forest
regeneration to replace the aging canopy is limited and that the understory constituents are
changing. One of the earliest studies (Art 1976) captures the vegetation composition and
structure of the Sunken Forest in 1967 prior to the deer population irruption on Fire Island.
Using Art’s 1976 report as a guide, the desired condition is to maintain the character of the
Sunken Forest, as stated in the Seashore’s enabling legislation, by fostering the regeneration of
key canopy constituent tree species and a reasonable representation of herbs and shrubs
reminiscent of its floristic composition when Fire Island National Seashore was established
(NPS 2011b).

Fire Island Communities
A desired condition of the Seashore is to reduce undesirable human-deer interactions within
the Fire Island communities. Based on staff observations, deer observed approaching humans
are likely responsible for the majority of the interactions in the Fire Island communities. To
achieve this desired condition, the Seashore would need to focus on two goals: (1) changing the
behavior of the people who intentionally and unintentionally feed deer, because they
perpetuate the food conditioning of the deer and create future generations of deer that
approach humans; and (2) addressing the individual deer that are highly food conditioned and
already approach humans.

William Floyd Estate
The 613-acre William Floyd Estate consists of the historic house and surrounding fields of
about 20 acres (“historic core” area), forests (“lower acreage”), small fields scattered among the
forest setting, and a broad marsh associated with Narrow Bay. The historic core area of the
William Floyd Estate experiences browsing impacts by deer at a level that causes repeated
mortality of ornamental plants. Desired conditions for landscaping would be focused primarily
on the historic core area. Specific character-defining features of vegetation at the William Floyd
Estate are identified in the cultural landscape inventory (NPS 2006b), including the lopped tree
line, the West Garden, a small orchard in the West Garden, planted trees southwest of the
Mastic House, and ornamental trees and shrubs. A desired condition is sustainable management
of those same ornamental plants or comparable alternatives and full restoration of the character
of the historic core area for aesthetics and public interpretation. The Seashore would also like
to promote native forest regeneration, particularly oaks and hickories within the William Floyd
Estate forests.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT AREA
PROJECT LOCATION
The Seashore is located in Suffolk County in southeastern New York State, on the south shore
of Long Island, approximately 70 miles east-southeast of New York City. The Seashore

v

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

encompasses 19,579 acres of barrier island natural systems including marine waters, uplands,
1,381 acres of wilderness, and the historic William Floyd Estate. The William Floyd Estate is
located on the southern coast of Long Island, in the village of Mastic Beach. The barrier island
(Fire Island) is separated from Long Island by the Great South Bay and is bordered by the
Atlantic Ocean to the south, Fire Island Inlet to the west, and Moriches Inlet to the east. Upland
areas of the Seashore include 26 miles of the barrier island beginning at Moriches Inlet west to
the boundary of Robert Moses State Park and averages less than 1 mile in width, and the
approximately 613-acre William Floyd Estate in Mastic Beach, Long Island (NPS 2012b).
Three breaches formed on Fire Island during Hurricane Sandy, and one still remains. The open
breach is located in an area known as Old Inlet toward the eastern portion of the Otis Pike Fire
Island High Dune Wilderness (Fire Island Wilderness). This open breach migrated rapidly
westward over the winter storm season of 2012–2013 following Hurricane Sandy, but since then
it has stayed relatively stable.
On Fire Island, 17 private residential communities and the Smith Point County Park are within
the Seashore’s administrative boundary. The eastern boundary of Robert Moses State Park is
the west boundary of the Seashore.

WHITE-TAILED DEER POPULATION
Prior to the establishment of the Seashore in 1964, very few deer occupied Fire Island
(O’Connell 1989). It is likely that the early deer population expanded from the remote natural
areas on the eastern side of the Fire Island to the western side as deer were attracted to artificial
food sources (e.g., gardens, garbage, lawns) in Fire Island communities. By the 1970s and 1980s
the deer population had become established in Fire Island communities due to high survival
rates and the availability of high-quality habitats (Underwood 1991). As a result, the Seashore
began to take steps toward better understanding the population and impacts on Seashore
resources. Over the decades, deer abundance has been estimated using different techniques.
The deer population peaked in the mid-1990s, when the deer density on Fire Island exceeded
257 deer per square mile in some areas (Underwood 2005).
According to Seashore staff, few if any deer occupied the William Floyd Estate when the
property was donated to the National Park Service in 1976. Distance sampling data collected in
2013 estimated the deer population to be approximately 93 deer per square mile (NPS 2015b).
The latest deer density estimates (including confidence intervals) for the Seashore are provided
in table ES-1.

Little is known about individual deer movements at the Seashore. Telemetry data on 20 deer from
the 1980s documented one instance of deer moving off Fire Island and rare instances when deer
traveled long distances across Fire Island, but in general, most deer (particularly females) remained
in smaller, established home ranges, typically 1.5 miles in length (O’Connell and Sayre 1989). Deer
on the western side of the Fire Island Pines/Talisman had higher body weights from nutritional
benefits within the Fire Island communities (from artificial food sources such as ornamental
plantings, gardens, and intentional feeding) and were much more habituated to humans, whereas
deer on the eastern side of the Fire Island had lower body weight, and many exhibited a flight
response when approached (O’Connell and Sayre 1991; Underwood 2005). While some deer may
occupy a home range that includes both Fire Island communities and natural areas, scientists do not
know the frequency or timing of movements between those areas.

ALTERNATIVES
The alternatives under consideration include a no-action alternative and three action alternatives.
Under alternative A: no action, existing deer management and monitoring efforts throughout the
Seashore would continue. These actions include continued public education/interpretation efforts,
vegetation monitoring, and deer population and behavior surveys. Each of the action alternatives

vii

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

(alternatives B, C, and D) includes the monitoring and education actions proposed under alternative
A. In addition, all action alternatives would enhance those education efforts and propose to work
collaboratively with the Fire Island communities, New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation, New York State Parks, Suffolk County Parks, and local environmental groups on
wildlife issues within the Fire Island communities. Each action alternative would manage
undesirable human-deer interactions, protect native plant communities and cultural plantings,
promote forest regeneration, and gradually reduce the deer population in the Seashore.

ELEMENTS COMMON TO ALL ALTERNATIVES
The following actions would continue under alternative A and would also be common to all action
alternatives:





human-deer interaction management
–
education/interpretation
–
deer behavior monitoring
–
incident reporting and response
vegetation monitoring
deer population monitoring

ALTERNATIVE A
Under the no-action alternative, the Seashore would continue to implement current management
actions, policies, and monitoring efforts related to deer and their effects. Current actions within the
Seashore include limited public education/interpretation efforts, vegetation monitoring, early
detection and rapid response to invasive plant species, and deer population surveys.

ELEMENTS COMMON TO ACTION ALTERNATIVES
In addition to continuing the elements described under alternative A (public
education/interpretation efforts, incident reporting and response, deer and vegetation monitoring),
the actions below would be common to all action alternatives:








enhanced public education and outreach effort
fencing of the Sunken Forest
securing the boundary fence at the William Floyd Estate
tri-annual enhanced vegetation monitoring
annual enhanced deer population monitoring
minimum requirements analysis (for actions in the Fire Island Wilderness)
coordination with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation

ALTERNATIVE B
Deer browse would be managed through exclosure fencing of an area encompassing the historic
core at the William Floyd Estate (approximately 80 acres), rotational fencing of selected forest areas
at the William Floyd Estate lower acreage (approximately 66 acres at one time), and small-scale
fencing to protect special-status species, in addition to fencing in the Sunken Forest (approximately
44 acres of maritime holly forest). The fencing would be implemented in conjunction with fertility

viii

Environmental Consequences

control of white-tailed deer to gradually reduce and then maintain the deer population at an
appropriate density to achieve the plan objectives (estimated at 20 deer per square mile across Fire
Island and 20 deer per square mile at the William Floyd Estate). Fertility control would be
implemented using a chemical reproductive control agent (when an acceptable agent, i.e., an agent
meeting criteria specified in the plan/EIS, becomes available). For the purpose of including a diverse
array of management alternatives, the plan/EIS assumes an acceptable chemical reproductive
control agent that meets all of the established criteria may be available within 10 years. Once
adequate levels of tree seedling recruitment have been reached, it may be possible to eliminate or
reduce fencing. This would be assessed using adaptive management. Deer observed approaching
humans within the Fire Island communities would be translocated to the Fire Island Wilderness.

ALTERNATIVE C
Deer browse would be managed through small-scale fencing to protect special-status species and
key plants within the William Floyd Estate historic core, as well as exclosure fencing in the Sunken
Forest (approximately 44 acres of maritime holly forest). Actions would be taken to directly reduce
and maintain the deer population at an appropriate deer density to allow for regeneration
(estimated at 20-25 deer per square mile across Fire Island and 20-25 deer per square mile at the
William Floyd Estate). The deer population would be reduced and maintained through a
combination of sharpshooting, capture and euthanasia of individual deer (where necessary), and
public hunting (within the Fire Island Wilderness only). Deer observed approaching humans within
the Fire Island communities would be captured and euthanized to reduce the risk of negative
human-deer interactions and prevent other deer from learning this behavior through observation.
Alternative C has been identified as the environmentally preferable alternative.

ALTERNATIVE D
Deer browsing management actions would include fencing of an area encompassing the historic
core at the William Floyd Estate (approximately 80 acres) and small-scale fencing to protect specialstatus species, as well as exclosure fencing in the Sunken Forest (approximately 44 acres of maritime
holly forest). The deer population would be reduced to an appropriate deer density to achieve the
plan objectives (estimated at 20-25 deer per square mile across Fire Island and 20-25 deer per
square mile at the William Floyd Estate) through a combination of sharpshooting, capture and
euthanasia of individual deer (where appropriate), and public hunting (within the Fire Island
Wilderness only). Once reduced, the deer population could be maintained through fertility control.
Fertility control would be implemented using a chemical reproductive control agent (when an
acceptable agent becomes available). Until an acceptable and effective reproductive control agent
becomes available, the deer population would be maintained using the same methods used for
direct reduction as described above. Deer observed approaching humans within the Fire Island
communities would be captured and euthanized to reduce the risk of negative human-deer
interactions and prevent other deer from learning this behavior through observation. Alternative D
has been identified as the NPS preferred alternative.

ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES
To focus the environmental analysis in this plan/EIS, the issues identified during scoping were used
to derive a number of impact topics, which are resources of concern that could be affected, either
beneficially or adversely, by implementing any of the proposed alternatives. The impact topics are
outlined below, and table ES-2 provides a summary of the environmental consequences.

ix

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

VEGETATION, UNIQUE VEGETATION COMMUNITIES,
AND SPECIAL-STATUS PLANT SPECIES
The Seashore contains a variety of vegetation communities such as the Northern Beach Grass Dune
and Maritime Deciduous Scrub Forest in upland areas, the maritime holly forest, and tidal marshes
along the backbay shoreline. Deer population reduction as a result of deer management actions
would promote vegetation richness and plant abundance because the impact of deer browse would
be reduced.
The following state- and federally listed plant species occur within the Seashore: the state
endangered and federally threatened seabeach amaranth (Amaranthus pumilus); the state
endangered spring lady’s tresses (Spiranthes vernalis), the state threatened marsh straw sedge
(Carex hormathodes) and swamp sunflower (Helianthus angustifolius); the state-listed rare seabeach
knotweed (Polygonum glaucum); and the state endangered dark-green sedge (Carex venusta), rough
rush-grass (Sporobolus clandestinus), golden dock (Rumex fueginus), narrow-leaf sea-bite (Suaeda
linearis), and slender marsh-pink (Sabatia campanulata).

WETLANDS
Over 800 acres of tidal marsh wetlands and 112 acres of freshwater dunal wetlands occur on Fire
Island according to Klopfer et al. (2002). Tidal systems include low marsh and high marsh found
primarily on the bay side of the Seashore and at the southern end of the William Floyd Estate.
Freshwater systems include highbush blueberry swamp, northern interdunal cranberry swale
wetlands, reed marsh dominated by the invasive species Phragmites australis, and red­
maple/blackgum swamp. White-tailed deer use these existing wetlands as a foraging source, and
may cause some impacts due to deer browse and trampling of individual plants. In addition, the
Seashore may consider the use of fences for browse control, some of which may bisect wetlands
when installed.

WHITE-TAILED DEER POPULATION
Management actions proposed in this plan/EIS have the potential to affect the abundance,
distribution, behavior, and in some cases physiology of deer at the Seashore. Management actions
could cause deer to avoid certain areas in the Seashore. This could result in higher competition for
resources in other areas and increased movement across the Seashore boundary.

OTHER WILDLIFE AND WILDLIFE HABITAT
Other wildlife, including mammals and birds, are affected by the existing deer population, primarily
as a result of the alteration of available suitable habitat or direct competition for limited food
resources. Impacts of heavy browsing on vegetation-dependent wildlife communities are apparent
and include changes in species composition, abundance, and distribution. Reductions in whitetailed deer population densities would reduce competition for food and deer browsing. This could
result in changes to feeding and nesting patterns for other wildlife within the Seashore. Noise
associated with management actions could cause temporary changes in daily movement patterns
and selection of feeding or breeding/nesting sites for other wildlife.

x

Environmental Consequences

WILDERNESS
A wilderness area is defined, in part, as “an area where the earth and its community of life are
untrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain… An area of
undeveloped Federal land retaining its primeval character and influence, without permanent
improvements or human habitation” (PL 88-577). Pursuant to Public Law 95-585, the Fire Island
Wilderness was established in the Seashore and is the only federally designated wilderness area in
New York State. Deer management efforts within wilderness have the potential to affect wilderness
character.

CULTURAL LANDSCAPES
A cultural landscape inventory has been completed at the William Floyd Estate, and evidence of
deer browse on vegetation has been documented by Seashore staff (NPS 2006b). The proposed
alternatives would be designed, in part, to reduce the impact of deer browse on the cultural
landscape at the William Floyd Estate.

VISITOR USE AND EXPERIENCE/RECREATION
The implementation of some of the proposed actions could have an impact on visitor use and
experience. Some visitors to the Seashore view deer sightings as an integral part of their visit. Deer
management actions may decrease the potential for visitors to observe deer within the Seashore,
reducing satisfaction for some visitors. Conversely, there are visitors who come to the Seashore to
enjoy other resources, such as to observe songbirds. Increased deer browse has the potential to
impact these other resources and impact the satisfaction of these visitors.
Proposed management actions within alternatives B, C, and D such as reproductive treatments or
direct reduction, or translocation may require visitors to be prohibited from certain areas of the
Seashore. Additionally, some visitors may be opposed to the proposed management actions. As the
alternatives are implemented, some visitor experiences may change as the deer population is
reduced.

FIRE ISLAND COMMUNITIES AND ADJACENT LANDOWNERS
In addition to federally owned land, the Seashore encompasses 17 private communities and towns,
Smith Point County Park, and three municipal beaches (Bellport Beach, Leja Beach/Davis Park, and
Atlantique Beach). Robert Moses State Park is adjacent to the western end of the Seashore. Many
Fire Island community residents enjoy the presence of deer and actively feed them to attract them
to their property. However, community residents also have concerns related to browse on
vegetation (i.e., private landscaping), access to trash, disease transmission (i.e., Lyme disease), and
habituation of deer. Because the deer population on Fire Island migrates between the Seashore and
Fire Island communities, deer management efforts proposed in the alternatives would likely affect
the presence of deer on adjacent properties.

PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY
Any deer management activities would be conducted in a manner that would minimize risk to the
safety of members of the public and Seashore employees; however, there are some inherent safety
risks. Tick-borne diseases pose health risks to Seashore visitors or area residents, as well as the

xi

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

larger Long Island area. Blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis) carry Lyme disease, and the
Department of Health and Human Services Center for Disease Control and Prevention has stated
that abundant deer and rodent hosts are necessary to maintain the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi,
the causative agent of Lyme disease. Though deer cannot transmit the disease to humans or ticks, a
high deer population may support an increased tick population compared to lower deer densities
(CDC 2012; Stafford 2007). In addition, deer have become habituated to human presence and have
been known to approach people, a safety concern for some community members. Deer are also
encountered on boardwalks, sometimes in confined spaces, which could present a safety risk.

SEASHORE OPERATIONS
Seashore staff and funding are used to promote the visitor experience and protect and monitor
natural and cultural resources. Past and current monitoring of the Seashore’s vegetation and deer
population have been driven by available staff and funding. Proposals made in this plan/EIS could
result in changes to staffing and funding.

CONSULTATION AND COORDINATION
INTERNAL SCOPING
Internal scoping meetings were held to provide opportunities for the NPS team to initiate the NEPA
planning process and discuss the management of white-tailed deer at the Seashore and to develop
the alternatives that are considered in this plan/EIS. The internal scoping process continued
throughout the development of the plan/EIS through regular conference calls.

PUBLIC SCOPING AND OUTREACH
The Seashore published the Notice of Intent to prepare an EIS in the Federal Register on June 17,
2011. The Seashore also issued a press release on June 17, 2011. These documents represented the
beginning of the public scoping and outreach process. In addition, the Seashore published three
newsletters (summer 2011, fall 2012, and fall 2013) that were provided to known stakeholders and
posted on the NPS Planning, Environment, and Public Comment (PEPC) website
(http://parkplanning.nps.gov/FireIslandDeerManagementPlan).

PUBLIC REVIEW OF THE DRAFT PLAN/EIS
The draft plan/EIS was available for public and agency review from July 31, 2014 through October
10, 2014. The availability of the draft plan/EIS was announced through the Seashore’s website
(www.nps.gov/fiis), through a newsletter provided to known stakeholders, and through press
releases. Public open houses were held on August 20, 2014 in Patchogue, NY and August 22, 2014 in
Ocean Beach, NY. The draft plan/EIS was made available through several outlets, including the

Consultation and Coordination

COOPERATING AGENCIES
The National Park Service invited the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation
and the US Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services to be
cooperating agencies for the plan/EIS in letters dated November 29, 2011. Each agency accepted
this offer in memoranda of understanding finalized on July 3, 2012. The cooperating agencies
participated in the monthly interdisciplinary team status calls and the development of alternatives,
provided information in their areas of technical expertise, and had the opportunity to comment on
the internal review draft plan/EIS as it was prepared.

AGENCY AND TRIBAL CONSULTATION
In addition to establishing which agencies would serve as cooperating agencies, as described above,
other agencies were consulted to aid in identification of potential issues to be addressed in the
plan/EIS. The following agencies were consulted during the planning process:


Federal Agencies
US Fish and Wildlife Service for compliance with section 7 of the Endangered Species Act
–
New York State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) for compliance with section 106 of

Impact Topic Alternative A
Vegetation,
Unique
Vegetation
Communities,
and Specialstatus Plant
Species

The adverse impacts on
vegetation/unique
vegetative communities
under alternative A would
be significant because no
comprehensive plan
would be enacted to
preserve the natural
abundances, diversities,
dynamics, and
distributions of native
plant populations,
communities, and
ecosystems. Natural
processes left to proceed
without human
intervention would allow
current adverse impacts to
continue whereas the
enabling legislation for
the Seashore calls for
conservation and
preservation of natural
features, specifically
including the unique
communities within the
Sunken Forest.

Alternative B

Alternative C

Alternative D

Ultimately, the beneficial
impacts on vegetation, unique
vegetative communities, and
special-status plant species
under alternative B are
expected to be significant
because the Seashore would
implement a comprehensive
plan to preserve the natural
abundances, diversities,
dynamics, and distributions of
native plant populations,
communities, and ecosystems.
The NPS intervention in
current natural processes
would allow Seashore
managers to conserve and
preserve the natural features,
specifically including the
unique communities within
the Sunken Forest, as called
for the Seashore’s enabling
legislation. Actions taken to
conserve listed species would
be incorporated into the
comprehensive deer
management plan. Beneficial
impacts are also considered
significant because when
considering cumulative
impacts, deer browse likely
would be the primary driver of
vegetation composition
throughout the Seashore if
left unmanaged. The adverse
impacts on vegetation could
approach significant outside
of fenced areas depending
upon how long of a delay
there is before the deer
population density is reduced.
Although a comprehensive
plan would be enacted to
preserve the natural
abundances, diversities,
dynamics, and distributions of
native plant populations,
communities, and ecosystems,
immediate vegetation
protection measures would be
limited to exclosures, allowing
a heightened risk of local
species extirpation and altered
species abundance.

Overall, the beneficial
impacts on vegetation,
unique vegetation
communities, and specialstatus plant species under
alternative C are expected
to be significant because
the Seashore would
implement a comprehensive
plan to preserve the natural
abundances, diversities,
dynamics, and distributions
of native plant populations,
communities, and
ecosystems. The NPS
intervention in the current
natural processes would
allow Seashore managers to
conserve and preserve the
natural features, specifically
including the unique
communities within the
Sunken Forest, as called for
the Seashore’s enabling
legislation. Actions taken to
conserve listed species
would be incorporated into
the comprehensive deer
management plan.
Beneficial impacts are also
considered significant in the
context of cumulative
impacts because deer
browse likely would be the
primary driver of vegetation
composition throughout
the Seashore if left
unmanaged. Adverse
impacts would not be
significant because of their
temporary, small-scale
nature.

Overall, the beneficial
impacts on vegetation,
unique vegetation
communities, and specialstatus plant species under
alternative D are
expected to be significant
because the Seashore
would implement a
comprehensive plan to
preserve the natural
abundances, diversities,
dynamics, and
distributions of native
plant populations,
communities, and
ecosystems. The NPS
intervention in the
current natural processes
would allow Seashore
managers to conserve
and preserve the natural
features, specifically
including the unique
communities within the

Beneficial impacts are
also considered

because deer browse
likely would be the
primary driver of

throughout the Seashore
if left unmanaged.

Alternative B

Alternative C

Alternative D

Under alternative A, no
actions would occur
related to deer population
management at the
Seashore that would
require encroachments
and/or impacts on
wetlands and their
functions.

The adverse impacts of
alternative B on wetlands are
not expected to be significant
because there would be no
loss of wetland functions,
wetlands would be avoided to
the extent possible, and all
minor impacts would be
consistent with policies and
regulations for the protection
of wetlands.

The adverse impacts of
alternative C on wetlands
are not expected to be
significant because there
would be no loss of
wetland functions,
wetlands would be avoided
to the extent possible, and
all minor impacts would be
consistent with policies and
regulations for the
protection of wetlands.

White-Tailed The adverse impacts on
the white-tailed deer
Deer
population under
alternative A would not
be significant because the
native deer population
and related natural
processes would be left to
proceed without human
intervention. The deer
population would
continue to be one of
many natural features
conserved and preserved
by Seashore managers per
the Seashore’s enabling
legislation.

Adverse impacts on the whitetailed deer population under
alternative B are not
significant because, although
some alteration in natural
behavior would occur, human
intervention would be part of
a comprehensive plan to
otherwise preserve and restore
natural dynamics of the native
ecosystem. Further, the NPS
intervention in the current
population dynamics would
allow Seashore managers to
conserve and preserve natural
features as called for in the
Seashore’s enabling
legislation. Beneficial impacts
would not be significant
because while a lower
population would provide a
more natural dynamic, the
deer population has been
thriving in both natural and
developed habitats without
human intervention to this
point.

Adverse impacts on the
white-tailed deer
population under
alternative C are not
significant because,
although the population
would see a rapid decrease,
human intervention would
be part of a comprehensive
plan to otherwise preserve
and restore natural
dynamics of the native
ecosystem. Further, the NPS
intervention in the current
population dynamics would
allow Seashore managers to
conserve and preserve
natural features as called
for in the Seashore’s
enabling legislation.
Beneficial impacts would
not be significant because
while a lower population
would provide a more
natural dynamic, the deer
population has been

The adverse impacts of
alternative D on wetlands
are not expected to be

wetlands would be
avoided to the extent
possible, and all minor
impacts would be
consistent with policies

The adverse impacts
associated with fence
construction would not be
significant because they would
be limited in scale and would
generally result only in
temporary disturbance.
Adverse impacts associated
with the relatively long time
period for habitat recovery
have a risk of reaching
significant levels if the delay
causes substantial shifts in
natural abundances,

however, ultimately, the
beneficial impacts on other
wildlife and wildlife habitat
under alternative B are
expected to be significant
because the Seashore would
implement a comprehensive

Impact Topic Alternative A
Wilderness The adverse impact on

wilderness has the
potential to approach the
level of significance if deer
browse pressures
increased to a point
where the natural quality
of wilderness character is
diminished; however, the
existing impacts on the
Fire Island Wilderness are
not significant. The
National Park Service
would continue to
manage wilderness areas
for the use and enjoyment
of the American people.
Ongoing management
actions may temporarily
diminish wilderness
character, but these
actions would be
implemented in order to
manage and protect
wilderness character in
the long term and would
be subject to the

Management includes the
protection of these areas
and the preservation of
their wilderness character,
and the gathering and

American people.
Management would include
the protection of these areas
and the preservation of their
wilderness character, and the
gathering and dissemination
of information regarding their
use and enjoyment as
wilderness. The adverse
impact on wilderness would
be significant because the use
of fertility control would be an
active management strategy
that would impose human
control over natural deer
biology, leave evidence of
human intervention (i.e.,
marked deer), and would
interfere intermittently with
the opportunity for solitude.
Such impacts must be
evaluated and documented as
described in the minimum
requirements decision guide.

Neither beneficial nor
adverse impacts on
wilderness would be
significant because hunting
would provide an
opportunity for unconfined
recreation for hunters while
the qualities of wilderness
character would be
preserved in the long term;
otherwise, no noticeable
change in the qualities of
wilderness character is
expected. The National Park
Service would manage
wilderness areas for the use
and enjoyment of the
American people.
Management would include
the protection of these
areas and the preservation
of their wilderness
character, and the

INTRODUCTION
Since the late 1960s, the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) population at Fire Island
National Seashore (the Seashore) has expanded, leading to severe negative impacts on vegetation
and cultural landscapes and an increase in undesirable human-deer interactions. As a result, the
National Park Service (NPS) is preparing this White-tailed Deer Management Plan and
Environmental Impact Statement (plan/EIS). The plan/EIS evaluates a range of alternative
strategies and methods for white-tailed deer management, examines existing resource conditions,
and analyzes the potential impacts on these resources as a result of the proposed management
options. The plan/EIS complies with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), its
implementing regulations (40 CFR [Code of Federal Regulations] 1500–1508), Department of the
Interior (USDI) NEPA regulations (43 CFR 46), the NPS Director’s Order 12: Conservation
Planning, Environmental Impact Analysis, and Decision-making (NPS 2011c), and the accompanying
Director’s Order 12 Handbook (NPS 2001).
The plan/EIS has been prepared in cooperation with the New York State Department of
Environmental Conservation (NYS-DEC) and the US Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Services. In addition, a team of agency scientists and subject matter experts (the
science team) assisted with the planning process by evaluating scientific literature and research on
the topics of deer management, human-deer interactions, and vegetation management; and
reviewing and recommending monitoring protocols for deer populations, vegetation, and other
Seashore resources. The National Park Service has used this information, results from public
scoping, and recommendations from individuals with professional expertise to create a full range
of alternatives to achieve the purpose, need, and objectives for the plan/EIS. The alternatives are
adaptive and dynamic, allowing the National Park Service to consider new scientific information
and make changes in management actions over time.
The “Purpose of and Need for Action” chapter explains the intent of the plan/EIS for the Seashore
and the reason the National Park Service is taking action at this time. Ultimately, upon conclusion
of the planning and decision-making process, an alternative will be selected and will guide the long­
term management of white-tailed deer at the Seashore using an adaptive management approach.

PURPOSE OF AND NEED FOR ACTION
PURPOSE OF THE PLAN/EIS
The purpose of the plan/EIS is to develop a deer management strategy that supports protection,
preservation, regeneration, and restoration of native vegetation and other natural and cultural
resources at the Seashore and reduces undesirable human-deer interactions in the Fire Island
communities. The plan/EIS is also intended to promote public understanding of the complex
relationship between deer and Seashore resources, tick-borne diseases, people, and infrastructure.

NEED FOR ACTION
Seashore staff have been working to understand and address issues linked to the deer population
on Fire Island for 30 years. Information collected as part of the research conducted at the Seashore
indicates the need for a management plan to address impacts associated with changes in whitetailed deer abundance, distribution, and behavior, including the following:

1

CHAPTER 1: PURPOSE OF AND NEED FOR ACTION





adverse impacts on native vegetation resulting from heavy browsing by white-tailed deer
adverse impacts on natural and cultural resources at the William Floyd Estate resulting
from heavy browsing by white-tailed deer
adverse interactions between deer and humans and the developed environment as a result of
–
the presence of abundant food sources (including naturally occurring vegetation,
unsecured garbage, intentional feeding, gardens, ornamental landscaping), and shelter
in the Fire Island communities
–
habituation of deer to the unthreatening presence of humans and conditioning of deer,
particularly to food sources, in the Fire Island communities and high-visitor use areas

At current levels, deer browsing in the Sunken Forest and other vegetated areas of the Seashore is
reducing the abundance and diversity of native vegetation, including important understory species.
The Sunken Forest is a globally rare ecological community on Fire Island where heavy browse
pressure from deer has clearly adversely impacted forest regeneration and the species diversity and
abundance of herbaceous vegetation. Management of this particular holly maritime forest is an
important component of the plan/EIS in keeping with the Seashore’s enabling legislation, which
specifically calls out the protection of the Sunken Forest Preserve. The relationship between the
Sunken Forest and the Sunken Forest Preserve are described later in this chapter. The vegetation
composition and structure of the Sunken Forest was documented in 1967 prior to the deer
population irruption on Fire Island. The study provides a comprehensive description of percent
herbaceous cover, shrub and tree species, and their densities (Art 1976).
Additionally, current levels of browsing by deer at the William Floyd Estate are resulting in the
degradation of elements of the cultural landscape, particularly ornamental plantings in the West
Garden and natural vegetation in the surrounding woodland. In the West Garden, deer browse
inhibits the maintenance of the gardens as they existed in the early 20th century. In the woodlands
surrounding the lower acreage, deer browse reduces natural vegetation regeneration. The high
concentration of deer at the William Floyd Estate also contributes to the perceived risk of tickborne diseases, which may affect visitation at the site.
Seventeen communities are within the Seashore boundary but are not situated on federally owned
land (figure 1). Deer reside within these communities, having established a common presence that
some residents and visitors have come to enjoy, while others consider it a nuisance (Leong and
Decker 2007). Behavioral shifts have occurred (both by deer and humans) over the years because
the deer have become habituated to humans and conditioned to human food. This has led to
human-deer interactions such as deer approaching humans, people intentionally feeding deer,
people unintentionally feeding deer via unsecured garbage or ornamental plants, and interactions
between deer and pets. These interactions are viewed as undesirable by the Seashore because they
raise the risk of injury to people and deer and increase the likelihood of property damage by deer.
In addition, research revealed a high level of public concern about these topics, and a majority of
residents on Fire Island and almost half of residents in nearby communities on Long Island either
worried about deer-related problems or did not enjoy deer at the Seashore (Siemer et al., 2007).
The higher numbers of deer and a limited understanding of the relationship between deer and tickborne diseases also promote the perception by Fire Island community residents of a higher risk of
contracting Lyme disease. Other concerns include injury to deer from fences and deer using
residential storage areas and lower house levels as shelters.

Human-deer Interaction (Photo credit: NPS)

OBJECTIVES IN TAKING ACTION
Objectives help define what must be achieved for the National Park Service to consider the plan a
success, help shape the range of alternatives for management options, and set the framework for
the analysis of alternatives. For the plan/EIS, objectives have been established for the entire
Seashore, and more specific objectives have been developed for the Sunken Forest, the Fire Island
communities, and the William Floyd Estate. The objectives for deer management at the Seashore
have been developed to achieve certain conditions throughout the Seashore as a whole and to
achieve certain resource conditions at specific areas within the Seashore, as described below:












Manage a viable white-tailed deer population in the Seashore that is supportive of the other
objectives for this plan/EIS.
Promote natural regeneration of native vegetation.
Protect special-status species/vegetation communities and their habitat from high levels of
deer browsing.
Work collaboratively with other land management agencies on issues associated with
abundance, distribution, and behavior of white-tailed deer at the Seashore.
Improve public understanding of the issues such as human-deer interactions, the impact of
white-tailed deer on the cultural and natural resources of the Seashore, and tick-borne
diseases throughout the Seashore, including the William Floyd Estate.
Continue to expand the knowledge base regarding the relationship between deer browsing
and plant communities at Fire Island National Seashore to improve management decisions.
Within the Sunken Forest, maintain the character of the globally rare maritime holly forest,
as stated in the Seashore’s enabling legislation, by fostering the regeneration of key canopy
constituent tree species and a reasonable representation (as defined in the desired
conditions description below) of herbs and shrubs that made up the Sunken Forest’s
vegetative composition when the Seashore was established.
Reduce the potential for undesirable human-deer interactions both within the Fire Island
communities and at other developed areas of the Seashore.
Manage deer browse to allow for the restoration and preservation of the cultural landscape
of the William Floyd Estate and for the regeneration of the forest within the lower acreage
of the William Floyd Estate.

CHAPTER 1: PURPOSE OF AND NEED FOR ACTION

DESIRED CONDITIONS
The National Park Service defines desired conditions as resource conditions that the National Park
Service aspires to achieve and maintain over time, and the conditions necessary for visitors to
understand, enjoy, and appreciate those resources. The National Park Service has established
different desired conditions for different portions of the Seashore influenced by how the deer herd
is impacting the natural resources and visitor experience. This section describes the desired
conditions, which provides the baseline for what the Seashore wishes to achieve in each of the
geographic areas.

FIRE ISLAND COMMUNITIES
An important component of this plan
would be improving the cooperative
effort between the Fire Island
communities and the Seashore in
addressing the behaviors of residents
and vacationers who promote food
conditioning of deer. During the
2008–2011 deer density counts,
biologists recorded instances in which
deer were being fed by humans or
foraging through unsecured garbage.
During surveys, approximately 11% of
deer were observed approaching
people (or the surveyor), and less than
2% were observed feeding from
Private residences in a Fire Island community
overturned trashcans or being fed by a
(Photo credit: VHB)
person. A desired condition of the
Seashore is to reduce these undesirable human-deer interactions within the Fire Island
communities (NPS 2011a).

SUNKEN FOREST
The vegetation composition and structure of the Sunken Forest (including percent herbaceous
cover, shrub and tree species and their densities) was documented in 1967 prior to the deer
population irruption on Fire Island (Art 1976). The science team recommended that the Seashore
use this report as a baseline to establish desired vegetation conditions for the Sunken Forest.
Therefore, the desired condition is to maintain the character of the Sunken Forest, as stated in the
Seashore’s enabling legislation, by fostering the regeneration of key canopy constituent tree species
and a reasonable representation of herbs and shrubs reminiscent of its floristic composition when
Fire Island National Seashore was established (NPS 2011b).

FIRE ISLAND NATURAL AREAS
Natural areas of local and regional importance (other than the Sunken Forest and William Floyd
Estate) occur on Fire Island. These areas include maritime forests at the Carrington Estate,
Talisman, Blue Point, and in the Otis Pike Fire Island High Dune Wilderness (Fire Island

6

Desired Conditions

Wilderness). Seashore managers wish to sustain naturally regenerating forests. While these areas
do not have defined vegetation targets, the vegetation monitoring completed before the
implementation of this plan/EIS will help Seashore mangers detect a response in the vegetation
following management. Therefore, the Seashore has set the desired condition in these areas would
be to see a positive response in vegetation an increase in species diversity.

WILLIAM FLOYD ESTATE
The 613-acre William Floyd Estate (figure 2) consists of the historic house and surrounding fields of
about 20 acres (“historic core” area), forests (“lower acreage”), small fields scattered among the
forest setting, and a broad marsh associated with Narrow Bay. The historic core area of the William
Floyd Estate experiences browsing impacts by deer at a level that causes repeated mortality of
ornamental plants. Desired conditions for landscaping would be focused primarily on the historic
core area. Specific character-defining features of vegetation at the William Floyd Estate are
identified in the cultural landscape inventory (NPS 2006b), including the lopped tree line, the West
Garden, a small orchard in the West Garden, planted trees southwest of the Mastic House, and
ornamental trees and shrubs. A desired condition is sustainable management of those same
ornamental plants or comparable alternatives and full restoration of the character of the historic
core area for aesthetics and public interpretation. The Seashore would also like to promote native
forest regeneration, particularly oaks and hickories within the William Floyd Estate forests.

Description of Fire Island National Seashore

DESCRIPTION OF FIRE ISLAND NATIONAL SEASHORE
PROJECT LOCATION
Established in 1964, the Seashore encompasses 19,579 acres of upland, tidal, and submerged lands
along a 26-mile stretch of the 32-mile barrier island–part of a much larger system of barrier islands
and bluffs stretching from New York City to the very eastern end of Long Island at Montauk Point.
The Seashore is located in Suffolk County in southeastern New York State, on the south shore of
Long Island, approximately 70 miles east-southeast of New York City. An extensive dunes system,
centuries-old maritime forests, and solitary beaches are easily accessed on Fire Island. Also on Fire
Island, within the boundary of the Seashore, are 1,381 acres of federally designated wilderness and
the Light House Annex. Nearby on Long Island, also part of the Seashore, is the William Floyd
Estate, the home of one of New York’s signers of the Declaration of Independence.
On Long Island, the Seashore’s headquarters are located in Patchogue and include administrative
offices, a maintenance facility, and a ferry terminal. The William Floyd Estate is located on the
southern coast of Long Island, in the village of Mastic Beach. Facilities at the William Floyd Estate
include structures to accommodate visitors, maintenance equipment, and curatorial storage. The
barrier island (Fire Island) is separated from Long Island by the Great South Bay and is bordered by
the Atlantic Ocean to the south, Fire Island Inlet to the west, and Moriches Inlet to the east. Upland
areas of the Seashore include 26 miles of the barrier island beginning at Moriches Inlet west to the
boundary of Robert Moses State Park, an average of less than 1 mile wide, and the approximately
613-acre William Floyd Estate (NPS 2012b). The waters of the Great South Bay account for
approximately 15,000 acres of the Seashore. The bottom lands of the Great South Bay are owned by
the towns of Brookhaven and Islip and the Nature Conservancy (NPS 2012b).
Three breaches that formed on Fire Island during Hurricane Sandy in 2012, and one still remains.
The open breach is located in an area known as Old Inlet toward the eastern portion of the Fire
Island Wilderness. This open breach migrated rapidly westward over the winter storm season of
2012–13 following Hurricane Sandy, but since then it has remained relatively stable.
On Fire Island, interspersed within the Seashore are 17 private residential communities established
before the Seashore’s authorization. Resort development on Fire Island began as early as 1855, with
a number of the communities having been established prior to the Great Depression of the 1930s.
While the Fire Island communities lie within the administrative boundary of the Seashore, the
Seashore has limited authority over the Fire Island communities and does not directly manage
them. Some Fire Island communities are legally incorporated as independent governmental entities
with elected officials, and others have legal ties to towns and other communities on Long Island.
The Seashore’s enabling legislation includes provisions for private land to be retained or developed
if zoning requirements are met. No hard-surfaced roads connect the Fire Island communities,
either to each other or to Long Island. They are accessible mainly by passenger ferry or private
boat. Off-road vehicle use is restricted within the boundary of the Seashore on Fire Island. Without
paved roads and with limited traffic, the Fire Island communities have retained much of their
original character. Some of the Fire Island communities have hotels or facilities for overnight
guests, while others are strictly residential. There are approximately 4,100 developed properties on
Fire Island with approximately 300 residents living on Fire Island year-round. The number of year
round residents has slowly and steadily declined in recent years. Vehicle access is limited to yearround residents, contractors and other service providers (telephone, fuel, garbage, etc.); all vehicles
crossing federal lands must have an NPS driving permit.

CHAPTER 1: PURPOSE OF AND NEED FOR ACTION

During the summer season, the population of Fire Island swells to approximately 30,000, with a
total of 2–3 million visitors arriving each year. Recreational visitation to sites and facilities owned or
managed by the Seashore in 2014 was approximately 384,000. The Seashore’s primary visitor
facilities located on Fire Island are the Light House Annex, Sailors Haven, Watch Hill, and the Fire
Island Wilderness. Light House Annex is maintained and operated by the Fire Island Lighthouse
Preservation Society, which offers tours and other visitor programs. Concessioners operate the
marina at Sailors Haven as well as the marina and campground at Watch Hill. The Seashore
maintains visitor services facilities at the eastern edge of the Fire Island Wilderness, Sailors Haven,
Talisman, and Watch Hill. The Seashore offers lifeguarded swimming areas at Sailors Haven and
Watch Hill. Also located on Fire Island are ranger stations, visitor contact facilities, maintenance
facilities, and several units of Seashore housing. Located at either end of Fire Island are major state
and county beaches with sizable visitation that are accessible by vehicle.

PURPOSE AND SIGNIFICANCE OF
FIRE ISLAND NATIONAL SEASHORE
Purpose
Together with the Fire Island communities, government agencies, and other partners, the Seashore
conserves, preserves, and protects for the use and appreciation of current and future generations
relatively unspoiled and undeveloped beaches, dunes, and other natural features and processes.
These include Fire Island’s larger landscape and its surrounding marine environment. These
resources possess high natural and aesthetic values to the nation as examples of great natural
beauty and wildness in close proximity to large concentrations of urban population. The Seashore
also conserves, preserves and protects the historic structures, cultural landscapes, museum
collections and archeological resources associated with the Seashore including the Fire Island Light
Station and the William Floyd Estate. Finally, the Seashore preserves the primitive and natural
character of the Otis Pike Fire Island High Dune Wilderness and protects its wilderness character.
Significance
Fire Island National Seashore is part of a barrier island system encompassing relatively unspoiled and
undeveloped beaches, dunes, marine environment and other natural features and dynamic processes
within close proximity to the largest concentration of population of any national seashore in the
United States. The dynamic barrier island environment of Fire Island has attracted and influenced a
variety of human uses over hundreds of years. It has also been shaped by this continuum of human
involvement, giving rise to the distinctive relationship between the built and natural environments.
The resources which determine the Seashore’s national significance include the following:





The Sunken Forest, a 250-300 year old American holly-shadblow-sassafras maritime forest,
is a globally rare and important habitat in the Northeastern United States.
Fire Island National Seashore provides important habitat for marine and terrestrial plants
and animals, including a number of rare, threatened and endangered species.
Situated along the Atlantic Flyway, Fire Island is a globally important area for more than
330 migratory, over wintering and resident bird species.
The Otis Pike Fire Island High Dune Wilderness, the only federally designated wilderness
in New York State, lies within the most populous metropolitan area in the United States,
offering a rare opportunity for a broad spectrum of the American public to experience
wilderness.

Scientific Background:
Deer and Vegetation Management

Owned and occupied by the Floyd Family from 1720 to 1976, the William Floyd Estate was
the home of General William Floyd, a signer of the Declaration of Independence.
Fire Island Light was constructed in 1858 and has served as a critical navigation aid for the port of
New York for more than 150 years. An active light has been at this location since 1826.


SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND:
DEER AND VEGETATION MANAGEMENT
Seashore concerns over the Fire Island deer population were initially focused around a noticeable
increase in the number of deer within the Fire Island communities and the incidence of Lyme
disease among Fire Island residents. Impacts of deer browsing on vegetation were also among the
major concerns. In the mid-1980s, researchers documented a substantial decline in the diversity
and abundance of key plant species in the Sunken Forest, one of the Seashore’s rarest plant
communities. As a result, Seashore staff along with academic and agency scientists embarked on a
series of additional investigations documenting and describing the following:







deer abundance and distribution across Fire Island
fertility control as a potential deer population management tool
browsing impacts on vegetation
the role of disturbance on the regeneration capacity of the Sunken Forest and the
likelihood of its future conservation
ecology of Lyme disease and its vector-host relationships including ticks, birds, and
mammals
the human aspects related to white-tailed deer issues on Fire Island

More recently, Seashore staff have focused on the threat posed by deer to native vegetation in other
natural zones of the Seashore and the cultural landscape of the William Floyd Estate. NPS staff have
recently initiated collection of vegetation data in some of the Seashore’s valued maritime forests to
establish baseline understory conditions, and the preliminary evaluation of the data collected thus far
indicates that deer browsing impacts have affected the ability for seedlings and saplings to develop
similar to the conditions at the Sunken Forest. In some areas, current levels of browsing appear to be
creating conditions for an increase in undesirable species. The loss of native vegetation and overall
change in the vegetation communities could result in impacts on other wildlife species, such as
ground-nesting birds and small mammals using these areas for food and shelter.

DEER AND VEGETATION MANAGEMENT ISSUES
AND RESEARCH OVERVIEW
Population and Ecological Characteristics of White-tailed Deer at the Seashore.
Prior to the establishment of the Seashore in 1964, very few deer occupied Fire Island (O’Connell
1989). It is likely that the early deer population expanded from the remote natural areas on the
eastern side of Fire Island to the western side because deer were attracted to artificial food sources
(e.g., gardens, garbage, lawns) in Fire Island communities (Underwood 2005). By the 1970s and
1980s the deer population had become established in the Fire Island communities due to high
survival rates and the availability of high-quality habitats (Underwood 1991). As a result, the
Seashore began to take steps toward better understanding the deer population and impacts on
Seashore resources.

CHAPTER 1: PURPOSE OF AND NEED FOR ACTION

Over the decades, deer abundance has been estimated using different techniques. In the mid-1980s
the Seashore initiated a program to estimate the herd size using low-level helicopter surveys. Later,
distance sampling was used to estimate deer density. The change in methodologies occurred
because individual deer could not be seen in the dense Fire Island communities from the
helicopter, and because distance sampling is ground-based and statistically accounts for not seeing
all individuals, it was considered more accurate. The deer population peaked in the mid-1990s,
when the deer density on Fire Island exceeded 257 deer per square mile in some areas
(Underwood 2005).
According to Seashore staff, few if any deer occupied the William Floyd Estate when the property
was donated to the National Park Service in 1976. Distance sampling data collected in 2012
estimated the deer population to be approximately 93 deer per square mile at the William Floyd
Estate (NPS 2015b). The latest deer density estimates (including confidence intervals) for the
Seashore are provided in table 1 below.

Little is known about individual deer movements at the Seashore. Telemetry data on 20 deer from
the 1980s documented one instance of deer moving off Fire Island and rare instances of deer
travelling long distances across Fire Island, but in general, most deer (particularly females)
remained in smaller, established home ranges, typically 1.5 miles in length (O’Connell and Sayre
1989). Although some deer may occupy a home range that includes both Fire Island

12

Scientific Background:
Deer and Vegetation Management

communities and natural areas, scientists do not know the frequency or timing of movements
between those areas.
The 1980s movement data (described above) appeared to strongly suggest a separation between
deer on the western side of the Fire Island Pines/Talisman and the deer on the eastern side.
O’Connell and Sayre (1991) found differences in behavior, population densities, and body
condition between deer populations on the western and eastern parts of Fire Island. Deer on the
western end had higher body weights from nutritional benefits within the Fire Island communities
(from artificial food sources such as ornamental plants, gardens, and intentional feeding) and were
much more habituated to humans, whereas deer on the eastern side of the Fire Island had lower
body weight, and many exhibited a flight response when approached by humans (O’Connell and
Sayre 1991; Underwood 2005).
Long-term Vegetation Monitoring and Research
Sunken Forest Vegetation. The Sunken
Forest is a globally rare, old-growth
maritime holly forest approximately 44
acres in size located within the Sailors
Haven area, just west of Sailors Haven
marina. In 1960, a +50-acre tract of land
comprising beach foredunes, backdunes,
and a portion of the Sunken Forest was
dedicated for protection as an ecological
sanctuary by a private group. Two years
after the Fire Island National Seashore
was established in 1964, this 50-acre
property was deeded to the Seashore, and
is referred to in the deed documents as
the “Sunken Forest Preserve.” The
Seashore staff monitoring vegetation plots
Sunken Forest, due to its uniqueness and
(Photo credit: NPS)
rarity as a forest ecosystem, was
highlighted in the Seashore’s enabling
legislation for preservation and protection. It should be noted that the term “Sunken Forest,” as
used throughout this document, refers to the 44-acre acre maritime holly forest, and as noted
above, this forest is only partially contained in the area designated as the Sunken Forest Preserve.
The Seashore has conducted vegetation studies in the Sunken Forest for more than 45 years,
and deer impacts on vegetation in the Sunken Forest have been observed over the last 30 years.
Researchers have observed impacts on woody seedling densities and understory species
composition attributed to heavy browsing (Art 1976, 1987, 1990; Forrester, Leopold, and Art
2007; Forrester, Leopold, and Underwood 2008; Underwood, Ries, and Raphael 2011).
In particular, scientists noted the absence of several herbaceous plants in later years (Forrester
2004) that were present during the initial studies (Schulte 1965; Art 1976). Regeneration of
important canopy constituents (trees that make up the overstory) was also absent, particularly
American holly (Ilex opaca). In comparison, more deer-resistant plants such as black cherry
(Prunus serotina) were thriving, indicating a potential shift in canopy species over time.
An additional study (Forrester, Leopold, and Underwood 2008) used exclosures to conclude that
deer are the dominant herbivore in the Sunken Forest. Past data sets compiled by the science team
indicate that changes in the density of shrub layer species correspond to changes in the deer density

13

CHAPTER 1: PURPOSE OF AND NEED FOR ACTION

for the same time interval. The data sets indicate that much of the impacts on vegetation from heavy
browsing had already occurred by the mid-1980s. These impacts from heavy browsing by whitetailed deer continue today.
The Seashore has initiated the collection of vegetation data within other maritime forests and the
William Floyd Estate forests to establish baseline conditions for future monitoring (NPS 2013d;
NPS 2013e). Although evaluation of the data is preliminary, the data suggests a species composition
shift is occurring to favor those tree species most avoided by deer (NPS 2013e), and because of deer
browse, there is not sufficient recruitment of tree seedlings to sustain natural reproduction of the
overstory canopy.

Human-Deer Interactions. Fire Island community residents and residents adjacent to the William
Floyd Estate expressed the types of deer impacts they experience, including human-deer
interactions, by participating in a study in which they were interviewed (Leong and Decker 2007)
and/or completing a mail survey (Siemer et al 2007). The primary concerns were related to impacts
associated with the deer population size and density, home range and movements, and behavior.
Impacts on residents include damage to landscaping and gardens; concerns about disease and ticks;
sanitation issues; wildlife viewing opportunities; concerns about deer health; and interactions with
pets; but also include concerns about impacts on deer such as habitat loss and behavior changes.
Seashore staff have also documented human-deer interactions when notified and when a particular
action was taken.
Previous Deer Management Efforts and Research
In 1988–89, the Seashore, in cooperation with New York State, introduced a public research hunt
as a means to lower deer numbers in response to the deer population expansion at the Seashore.
This hunt evaluated shotgun and archery hunting as methods of deer management, and collected
information on the physical condition of the deer population (O’Connell and Sayre 1991). A
questionnaire was also provided to participating hunters. Archery hunts occurred in the natural
areas on the western side of Fire Island and firearms were permitted in the Fire Island Wilderness.
Archery hunting began on December 17, 1988, and ended on December 23, 1988. Firearms hunting
began on January 9, 1989, and ended on January 18, 1989. A total of 54 deer were harvested.
However, problems with the logistics of the hunt included hunters dealing with dense vegetation,
logistics of hunters gaining access to portions of the island, and unwillingness of hunters to
disregard sex and size in harvesting deer. Body weights and reproductive rates were much lower
than deer on the rest of Long Island. Furthermore, the program quickly became unpopular with
Fire Island residents (Knoch and Lowery 1989).
The Fire Island communities funded a study through The Humane Society of the United States to
evaluate the viability of immunocontraception as a newly emerging form of deer population
control, out of concern about the linkage between deer abundance and tick-borne diseases and a
desire to use nonlethal methods. This program began in 1993 and ended in 2009, lasting 16 years.
With the assistance of Seashore staff, scientists conducted deer density counts using distance
sampling within the Fire Island communities to evaluate the effectiveness of immunocontraception
in reducing deer population density. Population surveys were performed annually during the
course of the study and are ongoing. No immunocontraception occurred east of Fire Island Pines
or at the William Floyd Estate. Population trend data showed that the population response was
varied, but certain localized Fire Island communities with the longest history of
immunocontraceptive treatments were associated with an approximate 50% decrease in
population size over the 16 year study (Underwood 2005; Rutberg and Naugle 2008).

14

Scientific Background:
Deer and Vegetation Management

In 2005, the Seashore published a technical report entitled White-tailed Deer Ecology and
Management on Fire Island National Seashore (Underwood 2005) that reviewed the subject of
white-tailed deer at the Seashore, including deer population trends and movements, impacts on
barrier island vegetation, and management recommendations. The report also included
information on the ecological impacts caused by the abundance of deer.
Management Plan for White-tailed Deer in New York State
In 2009, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation began development of a
statewide deer management plan. The plan was designed to document the components of the
state’s deer management program and provide strategic direction for deer management within the
state over a five-year period. The plan was developed with consideration of the diverse interests
and values of the public, biological needs of deer, and the ecological relationship between deer and
their environment. To that end, scientific data related to deer, public input, and the results of
associated surveys were considered and incorporated into the recommendations and management
actions included in the plan. The final Management Plan for White-tailed Deer in New York State
2012–2016 was completed in October 2011. Deer management efforts at the Seashore would be
undertaken in consideration of NYS-DEC’s plan. The primary goals of the plan are the following:








manage deer populations at levels appropriate for human and ecological concerns
promote and enhance deer hunting as an important recreational activity, tradition, and
management tool in New York
reduce the negative impacts caused by deer
foster understanding and communication about deer ecology, management, economic
aspects, and recreational opportunities while enhancing NYS-DEC’s understanding of the
public’s interest
manage deer to promote healthy and sustainable forests and enhance habitat conservation
efforts to benefit deer and other species
ensure that the necessary resources are available to support the proper management of
white-tailed deer in New York (NYS-DEC 2011)

Previous Tick Management Efforts Related to Deer
In 2011 Cornell University completed a three-year
study on the use of 4-Poster baiting stations to
treat deer with the pesticide permethrin when they
feed, with the intent of killing ticks on the deer.
The baiting stations were located on nonfederal
lands on Fire Island and used whole kernel corn as
a lure to attract the deer. In January of 2012, the
New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation registered 4-Poster Tickicide along
with assigning a special local need supplemental
labeling for the device. This resulted in two Fire
Island communities located within Fire Island
National Seashore’s boundaries requesting
deployment of a total of three devices; two devices
in the village of Saltaire and one device in Fair
Harbor. The Seashore issued a Letter of
Authorization for both communities as requested.
4-Poster Device (Photo credit: NPS)

15

CHAPTER 1: PURPOSE OF AND NEED FOR ACTION

From 2008 through 2012, deer consumed 28 tons of whole kernel corn at the Saltaire devices, with
11.2 tons distributed in 2012 alone (NPS 2013a).
The National Park Service continues to reject the use of the 4-Poster devices on federal lands
because the devices provide a regular, introduced food source for the deer population, in
contradiction of NPS Management Policies 2006. The National Park Service has concerns, policies,
and regulations against the supplemental feeding of wildlife. The Fire Island communities may
seek to continue this program.

SCOPING, ISSUES, AND IMPACT TOPICS
SCOPING
Early in the development of this plan/EIS, the National Park Service conducted meetings internally.
Cooperating agencies were invited to assist with preparation of this document, and a science team
convened to inform the planning process. The National Park Service also distributed consultation
letters to relevant agencies (appendix A) and organized groups, issued press releases and
newsletters, and solicited public comments during the scoping phase. A summary of scoping,
agency consultations, and public involvement is provided below, and a detailed description is
provided in “Chapter 5: Consultation and Coordination.”
Internal Scoping and Planning
The National Park Service held internal meetings in October 2010 to provide an opportunity for
the NPS to initiate the NEPA planning process and discuss the management of white-tailed deer
and vegetation at the Seashore. Attendees included interdisciplinary team (IDT) members from the
NPS Denver Service Center (DSC), NPS Northeast Region office, NPS Biological Resources
Management Division, US Geological Survey Patuxent Wildlife Research Center, the Seashore, and
NPS consultants. Topics discussed during the meeting included the purpose, need, and objectives;
public and agency involvement; potential issues; preliminary alternative elements; and data needs.
This group met again in December 2011, June 2012, and January 2014 to develop and refine the
alternatives that are considered in this plan/EIS. The group reviewed the purpose, need, and
objectives for the plan/EIS as well as potential constraints, potentially available management
techniques, and public and science team suggestions to compile a full spectrum of potential
alternatives. The alternatives that best met the objectives of the plan/EIS were included in
this document.
The internal scoping process continued throughout the development of the plan/EIS through
regular conference calls and meetings.
Cooperating Agencies
Two agencies have entered into an agreement with the National Park Service to be cooperating
agencies in the development of the plan/EIS: New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation and United States Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Services. Both of these cooperating agencies have special technical expertise related to the issues
under consideration in the plan/EIS and participate in regular status calls. Both agencies also
attended the June 2012 and January 2014 meetings to develop and refine the alternatives
considered in the plan/EIS.

16

Scoping, Issues, and Impact Topics

Science Team
The National Park Service assembled a science team to answer technical questions posed by the
IDT and to provide recommendations for use in the development of alternatives as part of the
plan/EIS. The team was composed of national, regional, and local experts from the National Park
Service, other agencies, and academia with expertise in the Seashore and its ecosystems, the
management of natural resources (including deer) and cultural landscapes, and related social issues
(see the List of Preparers in chapter 5). The science team participated in regular phone meetings
over an eight-month period to answer technical questions posed by the IDT and provide
information for use in development of the plan/EIS. Following the science team’s final meeting, an
internal report was prepared to document the group’s discussions. This report was used to inform
the development of the alternatives presented in “Chapter 2: Alternatives.”
Public Scoping and Outreach
The Notice of Intent to prepare the plan/EIS was published in the Federal Register on June 17, 2011,
representing the beginning of the public scoping and outreach process. In addition, a newsletter
with background information and the purpose, need, and objectives associated with the plan/EIS
was mailed to known stakeholders and posted on the NPS Planning, Environment, and Public
Comment (PEPC) website (http://parkplanning.nps.gov/fiis). The newsletter included information
about how to provide comments either through PEPC or using standard mail. The public comment
period closed on July 18, 2011. A total of 12 pieces of correspondence were received during the
public comment period, comprising approximately 90 comments. Comments received during the
public scoping process helped to inform the range of alternatives, as well as the impact topics to be
addressed by the EIS. “Chapter 5: Consultation and Coordination” of this EIS provides more details
about the public scoping activities, which were an integral part of the planning process for this EIS.
Two additional newsletters were posted during the project to update the public on project status.

IMPACT TOPICS RETAINED FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS
As a result of this scoping effort, several issues were identified as requiring further analysis in this
plan/EIS. These issues represent existing concerns as well as concerns that might arise during
consideration and analysis of alternatives. To focus the environmental analysis in this plan/EIS, the
issues identified during scoping were used to derive a number of impact topics, which are resources
of concern that could be affected, either beneficially or adversely, by implementing any of the
proposed alternatives. The impact topics are outlined below. The existing conditions associated
with each impact topic are described in “Chapter 3: Affected Environment.” The analysis of the
impacts of each alternative is presented in “Chapter 4: Environmental Consequences.”
Vegetation, Unique Vegetation Communities,
and Special-status Plant Species
The Seashore contains a variety of vegetation communities such as the Northern Beach Grass Dune
and Maritime Deciduous Scrub Forest in upland areas, the maritime holly forest, and tidal marshes
along the backbay shoreline.
Based on a review of the U. S. Fish and Wildlife (USFWS) Information, Planning, and Conservation
System and the NYS-DEC Division of Fish, Wildlife, and Marine Resources, the following stateand federally listed plant species are known to occur regionally in the Long Island area of New
York: the state endangered and federally threatened seabeach amaranth (Amaranthus pumilus); the
state endangered spring lady’s tresses (Spiranthes vernalis); the state threatened marsh straw sedge

17

CHAPTER 1: PURPOSE OF AND NEED FOR ACTION

(Carex hormathodes) and swamp sunflower (Helianthus angustifolius); the state-listed rare seabeach
knotweed (Polygonum glaucum); and the state endangered dark-green sedge (Carex venusta), rough
rush-grass (Sporobolus clandestinus), golden dock (Rumex fueginus), narrow-leaf sea-bite (Suaeda
linearis), and slender marsh-pink (Sabatia campanulata).
No taking of these species is anticipated to take place as a result of Seashore actions, and the
Seashore’s current fencing of special-status species guards against take caused by deer browse.
Should any need for take of any federally listed special-status species be identified due to
implementation of the proposed alternatives, the Seashore would consult with the USFWS.
Otherwise, the proposed alternatives would include efforts to protect native vegetation and specialstatus plant species from deer browse and support forest regeneration. Therefore, the impact topic
of vegetation, unique vegetation communities, and special-status plant species was retained for
further analysis.
Wetlands
Executive Order 11990, “Protection of Wetlands” and NPS Director’s Order 77-1: Wetland
Protection (NPS 2012a) requires an examination of impacts on wetlands. Over 800 acres of tidal
marsh wetlands and 112 acres of freshwater dunal wetlands occur on Fire Island according Klopfer
et al. (2002). Tidal systems include low marsh and high marsh found primarily on the bayside of the
Seashore and at the southern end of the William Floyd Estate. Freshwater systems include
highbush blueberry swamp, northern interdunal cranberry swale wetlands, reed marsh dominated
by the invasive species Phragmites australis, and red-maple/blackgum swamp. White-tailed deer use
these existing wetlands as a foraging source, and may cause some impacts due to deer browse and
trampling of individual plants. In addition, the Seashore may consider the use of fences for browse
control, some of which may bisect wetlands when installed. Therefore, the impact topic of
wetlands was retained for further analysis.
White-tailed Deer Population
Management actions proposed in this plan/EIS have the potential to affect the abundance,
distribution, behavior, and in some cases physiology of deer at the Seashore. Management actions
could cause deer to avoid certain areas in the Seashore. This could result in higher competition for
resources in other areas and increased movement across the Seashore boundary. Therefore, the
impact topic of white-tailed deer population was retained for further analysis.
Other Wildlife and Wildlife Habitat
Other wildlife, including mammals and birds, are affected by the existing deer population, primarily
as a result of the alteration of available suitable habitat or direct competition for limited food
resources. Impacts of heavy browsing on vegetation-dependent wildlife communities are apparent
and include changes in species composition, abundance, and distribution. Reductions in whitetailed deer population densities would reduce competition for food and deer browsing. This could
result in changes to feeding and nesting patterns for other wildlife within the Seashore. Noise
associated with management actions could cause temporary changes in daily movement patterns
and selection of feeding or breeding/nesting sites for other wildlife. Therefore, the impact topic of
other wildlife and wildlife habitat was retained for further analysis.
Wilderness
A wilderness area is defined, in part, as “an area where the earth and its community of life are
untrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain… An area of

18

Scoping, Issues, and Impact Topics

undeveloped Federal land retaining its primeval character and influence, without permanent
improvements or human habitation” (PL 88-577). Pursuant to Public Law 95-585, the Fire Island
Wilderness was established in the Seashore and is the only federally designated wilderness area in
New York State. Deer management efforts within wilderness have the potential to affect the
wilderness character. Therefore, the impact topic of wilderness was retained for further analysis.
Cultural Landscapes
As described in Director’s Order 28, a cultural landscape is “a geographic area, including both
cultural and natural resources and the wildlife or domestic animals therein, associated with a
historic event, activity, or person, or exhibiting other cultural or aesthetic values” (NPS 2002a). A
Cultural Landscape Inventory has been completed at the William Floyd Estate, and evidence of
deer browse on vegetation has been documented by Seashore staff (NPS 2006b). The proposed
alternatives would be designed, in part, to reduce the impact of deer browse on the cultural
landscape at the William Floyd Estate. Therefore, the impact topic of cultural landscapes was
retained for further analysis.
Visitor Use and Experience/Recreation
The implementation of some of the proposed actions could have an impact on visitor use and
experience. Some visitors to the Seashore view deer sightings as an integral part of their visit. Deer
management actions may decrease the potential for visitors to observe deer within the Seashore,
reducing satisfaction for some visitors. Conversely, there are visitors who come to the Seashore to
enjoy other resources, such as to observe songbirds. Increased deer browse has the potential to
impact these other resources and impact the satisfaction of these visitors.
Management activities such as reproductive treatments, direct reduction, or translocation may
require visitors to be prohibited from certain areas of the Seashore. Additionally, some visitors may
be opposed to the proposed management actions. As the alternatives are implemented, some visitor
experiences may change as the deer population is reduced. Therefore, the impact topic of visitor
use and experience was retained for further analysis.
Fire Island Communities and Adjacent Landowners
In addition to federally owned land, the Seashore encompasses 17 private communities and towns,
Smith Point County Park, and three municipal beaches (Bellport Beach, Leja Beach/Davis Park, and
Atlantique Beach). Robert Moses State Park is adjacent to the western end of the Seashore. Many
Fire Island community residents enjoy the presence of deer and actively feed them to attract them
to their property. However, community residents also have concerns related to browse on native
vegetation (i.e., private landscaping), access to trash, disease transmission (i.e., Lyme disease), and
habituation of deer. Because the deer population on Fire Island migrates between the Seashore and
Fire Island communities, deer management efforts proposed in the alternatives would likely affect
the presence of deer on adjacent properties. Therefore, the impact topic of Fire Island communities
and adjacent landowners was retained for further analysis.
Public Health and Safety
Any deer management activities would be conducted in a manner that would minimize risk to the
safety of members of the public and Seashore employees; however, there are some inherent safety
risks. Tick-borne diseases pose health risks to Seashore visitors or area residents, as well as the
larger Long Island area. Blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis) carry Lyme disease, and the
Department of Health and Human Services Center for Disease Control and Prevention has

19

CHAPTER 1: PURPOSE OF AND NEED FOR ACTION

stated that abundant deer and rodent hosts are necessary to maintain the spirochete Borrelia
burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease. Though deer cannot transmit the disease to
humans or ticks, a high deer population—in addition to the presence of rodents and small
mammals—may support an increased tick population compared to a smaller deer population
(CDC 2012; Stafford 2007). In addition, deer have become habituated to human presence and have
been known to approach people, a safety concern for some community members. Deer are also
encountered on boardwalks, sometimes in confined spaces, which could present a safety risk.
Therefore, the impact topic of public health and safety was retained for further analysis.
Seashore Operations
Seashore staff and funding are used to promote the visitor experience and protect and monitor
natural and cultural resources. Past and current monitoring of the Seashore’s vegetation and deer
population have been driven by available staff and funding. Proposals made in this plan/EIS could
result in changes to staffing and funding. Therefore, the impact topic of Seashore operations was
retained for further analysis.

ISSUES AND IMPACT TOPICS CONSIDERED
BUT DISMISSED FROM FURTHER ANALYSIS
The following impact topics were initially considered but were then dismissed from further analysis
for the reasons outlined below.
Special-status Wildlife Species
Based on information provided by the NYS-DEC Division of Fish, Wildlife, and Marine
Resources on March 5, 2012, and by the US Fish and Wildlife on March 22, 2012 (with
supplemental conversations taking place in August 2015), a variety of state- and federally listed
bird species occur within the Seashore. Identified species include the state species of concern
seaside sparrow (Ammodramus maritimus); the state threatened northern harrier (Circus
cyaneus), common tern (Sterna hirundo), and least tern (Sternula antillarum); the state protected
birds little blue heron (Egretta caerulea), snowy egret (Egretta thula), tricolored heron (Egretta
tricolor), laughing gull (Leucophaeus atricilla), and glossy ibis (Plegadis falinellus); the state and
federally endangered roseate tern (Sterna dougallii); and the state endangered and federally
threatened piping plover (Charadrius melodus). In addition, the state endangered Eastern mud
turtle (Kinosternon subrubrum), the federally threatened northern long-eared bat (Myotis
septentrionalis), and the federally threatened seabeach amaranth (Amaranthus pumilus) are
known to occur within the Seashore.
Of the bird species listed above, most all favor beaches, foredunes, and marshes as habitat for either
loafing, feeding, or nesting. The northern harrier will use marshes but can also be found utilizing
open fields (Audubon 2014). Similarly, the Eastern mud turtle is also a water dependent species,
utilizing brackish marshes, ponds, and wet ditches (NYS-DEC 2014). All of the proposed actions
are directed at improving vegetative habitats across the Seashore in the long term by controlling
heavy deer browse. None of the actions would be directed at the habitats preferred by these
special-status species. Therefore, the actions proposed in this document are unlikely to result in
long-term impacts on state- and federally listed wildlife species. Localized, temporary impacts
could occur from implementing direct reduction or fertility control to reduce deer numbers due to
the presence of humans, though the long-term impact would be less than minor. Specifically,
although only deer would be targeted by direct reduction efforts, other animals such as state- or
federally listed birds could be temporarily disturbed by the sound of firearms or the presence of

20

Scoping, Issues, and Impact Topics

humans causing a temporary flight response. Because fertility control and direct reduction would
occur during fall and winter months, this action would not impact any nesting birds.
The federally threatened northern long-eared bat (Myotis septentrionalis) was documented at the
William Floyd Estate during summer and fall mist-net surveys in 2014 and 2015. Based on
discussions with the US Fish and Wildlife Service, it was determined that proposed actions would
have no impact on northern long-eared bats. Proposed actions at the William Floyd Estate, such
as constructing a fence around the historic core and/or rotational fencing in the lower acreage,
falls under “minimal tree removal” and “forest management practices” in the 4(d) rule, which is
exempted from “take” because the actions of this plan/EIS would promote a naturally
regenerating forest and improve habitat for bats (50 CFR Part 17). In addition, fences would not
be constructed during the pup season (June 1-July 31) to avoid disturbance to possible maternity
roosts in the area.
Based on the information above, the impact topic of special-status wildlife species was
considered but dismissed from further analysis. The Seashore will provide the US Fish and
Wildlife Service with a copy of the plan/EIS and will continue to consult with the agency as the
project moves forward, as appropriate.
Prime and Unique Farmlands
Prime farmland is one of several designations made by the US Department of Agriculture to identify
important farmlands in the United States. It is important because it contributes to the nation’s
short- and long-range needs for food and fiber. In general, prime farmland has an adequate and
dependable water supply from precipitation or irrigation, a favorable temperature and growing
season, an acceptable level of acidity or alkalinity, an acceptable content of salt or sodium, few to no
rocks, and permeable soils (designated as prime farmland soils). Prime farmland soils within the
project area occur at the William Floyd Estate and are characterized by Riverhead sandy loam and
Sudbury sandy loam soil types (NRCS 2013). These soils are currently occupied by forests,
agricultural fields, and maintained meadows. Although such soils are present within the project
area, “unnecessary and irreversible conversion of farmland to non-agricultural uses” (Farmland
Protection Policy Act of 1980) is not expected under the proposed alternatives. Therefore, the
topic of prime and unique farmlands was considered but dismissed from further analysis.
Water Resources
NPS Management Policies 2006 (NPS 2006a) states that the National Park Service will “take all
necessary actions to maintain or restore the quality of surface waters and ground waters within the
parks consistent with the Clean Water Act and all other applicable federal, state, and local laws and
regulations.” The Seashore is located off the southern coast of Long Island and is bordered by the
Great South Bay to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the south, Fire Island Inlet to the west, and
Moriches Inlet to the east. However, the proposed action would not involve activities with the
potential to affect these waters or water quality over the long term. Ground and surface water
resources at the Seashore comprise a small portion of the ecosystem and are most sensitive to the
ever-changing complexes shaped by wave and wind action, storms, and human actions.
Implementation of the deer and vegetation management actions would not noticeably affect water
resources. Therefore, the impact topic of water resources was considered but dismissed from
further analysis.

21

CHAPTER 1: PURPOSE OF AND NEED FOR ACTION

Floodplains and Flood Zones
Executive Order 11988, “Floodplain Management” and NPS Director’s Order 77-2: Floodplain
Management (NPS 2003) require an examination of impacts on floodplains and flood zones and the
potential risk involved in placing facilities within floodplains and flood zones. Changes in the
white-tailed deer population would have no impact on the ability of the floodplain or flood zone to
convey or store flood waters. Therefore, the impact topic of floodplains and flood zones was
considered but dismissed from further analysis.
Historic Structures
Per the NPS Management Policies 2006, actions on historic and prehistoric structures are to be
based on “sound preservation practice to enable the long-term preservation of a structure’s historic
features, materials, and quality.” A historic structure is defined by the National Park Service in
Director’s Order 28: Cultural Resource Management (NPS 2002a) as “a constructed work, usually
immovable by nature or design, consciously created to serve some human act.” While historic
structures and features exist within the Seashore, they would not be impacted by the proposed
actions. Therefore, the impact topic of historic structures was considered but dismissed from
further analysis.
Archeological Resources
The National Park Service defines an archeological resource as any material remains or physical
evidence of past human life or activities that are of archeological interest, including the record of
the impacts of human activities on the environment. Known archeological resources have been
studied and preserved at various curatorial and storage facilities at the Seashore. Although ground
disturbing activities such as fencing installation have the potential to impact unknown
archeological resources, the implementation of the proposed action would be unlikely to impact
known or unknown archeological resources. If previously undiscovered archeological resources
are uncovered during construction, all work in the immediate vicinity of the discovery would be
halted until the resources could be identified and documented, and an appropriate mitigation
strategy would be developed in consultation with the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO).
Therefore, the impact topic of archeological resources was considered but dismissed from further
analysis.
Indian Trust Resources and Sacred Sites
Secretarial Order 3175 requires that any anticipated impacts on Indian Trust resources from a
proposed project or action by US Department of the Interior agencies be explicitly addressed in
environmental documents. The federal Indian Trust responsibility is a legally enforceable
obligation on the part of the United States to protect tribal lands, assets, resources, and treaty
rights, and it represents a duty to carry out the mandates of federal laws with respect to American
Indians, Alaskan Natives, and Native Hawaiians. During scoping, the Unkechaug Indian Nation
and the Shinnecock Indian Nation were notified via letter of the proposed action (see appendix A).
There are no known Indian Trust resources or sacred sites at the Seashore, and the lands
comprising the Seashore are not held in trust by the Secretary of the Interior for the benefit of
Indians due to their status as Indians. Therefore, the impact topic of Indian Trust resources and
sacred sites was dismissed from further analysis.

22

Related Laws, Policies, Plans, and Constraints

Environmental Justice
Executive Order 12898, “General Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority
Populations and Low-income Populations” requires all federal agencies to incorporate
environmental justice into their missions by identifying and addressing disproportionately high or
adverse human health or environmental impacts of their programs and policies on minorities and
low-income populations and communities. No minority or low-income populations are located in
or adjacent to the Seashore, including the William Floyd Estate. Therefore, since the proposed
action is confined to federal land and the Fire Island communities, the proposed management
objectives and potential actions would not affect low-income or minority populations and the
impact topic of environmental justice was dismissed from further analysis.

RELATED LAWS, POLICIES, PLANS, AND CONSTRAINTS
GUIDING LAWS, REGULATIONS, AND POLICIES
National Park Service Organic Act
By enacting the NPS Organic Act of 1916 (Organic Act), Congress directed the US Department of
Interior and the National Park Service to manage units “to conserve the scenery and the natural
and historic objects and wildlife therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such a
manner and by such a means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future
generations” (16 USC [United States Code] 1). Congress reiterated this mandate in the Redwood
National Park Expansion Act of 1978 by stating that the National Park Service must conduct its
actions in a manner that will ensure no “derogation of the values and purposes for which these
various areas have been established, except as may have been or shall be directly and specifically
provided by Congress” (16 USC 1a-1).
NPS Management Policies 2006
Several sections from the NPS Management Policies 2006 (NPS 2006a) are relevant to vegetation,
cultural landscapes, and deer management at the Seashore. If natural landscapes are disturbed by
natural phenomena, park units are to let them recover naturally unless manipulation is needed to
(1) mitigate for excessive disturbance caused by past human effects or (2) preserve cultural and
historic resources as appropriate based on park planning documents (section 4.4.2.4).
Management of “biotic cultural resources,” which include plant and animal communities
associated with the significance of a cultural landscape, is covered in section 5.3.5.2.5. NPS
Management Policies 2006 direct parks to plan with both cultural and natural resource stewardship
in mind in this case, and to have plans that are jointly acceptable to both divisions. The NPS
resource stewardship strategy is to “anticipate and plan for the natural and human-induced
processes of change. Before any major treatment of a cultural landscape is undertaken, there must
be an understanding of the degree to which change contributes to or compromises the historic
character of the landscape, and the way in which natural cycles influence the ecological processes
within the landscape. Treatment and management of a cultural landscape will establish acceptable
parameters for change and manage the biotic resources within those parameters.”
Deer management is guided by other sections of NPS Management Policies 2006. Park units are to
maintain as parts of the natural ecosystems of parks all native plants and animals. The National
Park Service is to achieve this by “preserving and restoring the natural abundances, diversities,

23

CHAPTER 1: PURPOSE OF AND NEED FOR ACTION

dynamics, distributions, habitats, and behaviors of native plant and animal populations and the Fire
Island communities and ecosystems in which they occur.” Furthermore, the National Park Service
is to “adopt park resource preservation, development, and use management strategies that are
intended to maintain the natural population fluctuations and processes that influence the dynamics
of individual plant and animal populations, groups of plant and animal populations, and migratory
animal populations in parks.” Whenever the National Park Service identifies a possible need for
reducing the size of a park plant or animal population, the decision will be based on scientifically
valid resource information that has been obtained through consultation with technical experts,
literature review, inventory, monitoring, or research (NPS 2006a).
Section 4.4.2 of NPS Management Policies 2006 also states, “Whenever possible, natural processes
will be relied upon to maintain native plant and animal species, and to influence natural
fluctuations in populations of these species. The Service may intervene to manage individuals or
populations of native species when at least one of the following conditions exists:





because a population occurs in unnaturally high or low concentration as a result of human
influences (such as loss of seasonal habitat, the extirpation of predators, the creation of
highly productive habitat through agriculture or urban landscapes) and it is not possible to
mitigate the effects of the human influences;
to protect specific cultural resources of parks;
to protect rare, threatened, or endangered species.”

Section 4.4.2.1 of NPS Management Policies 2006 allows for the management of native species to
prevent them from interfering broadly with natural habitats, natural abundances, and natural
distributions of native species and natural processes. Section 4.4.2.1 of NPS Management Policies
2006 states, “Where visitor use or human activities cannot be modified or curtailed, the Service may
directly reduce the animal population by using several animal population management techniques,
either separately or together. These techniques include translocation, public hunting on lands
outside the park or where legislatively authorized within a park, habitat management, predator
restoration, reproductive intervention, and destruction of animals by NPS personnel or their
authorized agents. Where animal populations are reduced, destroyed animals may be left in natural
areas of the park to decompose” (NPS 2006a). Additionally, the Secretary of the Interior has broad
discretion in managing wildlife. Section 4.4.2.1 of the NPS Management Policies 2006 also states that
the destruction of animals may be carried out by NPS personnel or their authorized agents.
NPS policies also require that parks “assess the results of managing plant and animal populations by
conducting follow-up monitoring or other studies to determine the impacts of the management
methods on nontargeted and targeted components of the ecosystem” section 4.4.2. This strategy is
described in this plan including specific thresholds for taking action.
Authority to Manage White-tailed Deer
The National Park Service has broad authority to manage wildlife and other natural resources
within the boundaries of units of the National Park System. According to 16 USC 3, “[The
Secretary of the Interior] may… provide in his discretion for the destruction of such animals and of
such plant life as may be detrimental to the use of any of [the parks, monuments, and reservations
under the jurisdiction of the National Park Service].”
In defining this discretion, the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, in New Mexico State Game
Commission v. Udall (410 F.2d 1197, 1201), noted that the National Park Service “need not wait
until the damage through overbrowsing has taken its toll on park plant life … before taking

24

Related Laws, Policies, Plans, and Constraints

preventative action” (10th Cir. 1969). This discretion has been reinforced over time. In United
States v. Moore, (640 F. Supp. 164, 166) the court found that Congress had given the Secretary of
the Interior great discretion in regulating and controlling wildlife within the national parks. This
discretion is further defined by NPS management policy.

OTHER FEDERAL AGENCY LAWS, REGULATIONS,
PLANS, POLICIES, AND ACTIONS
In addition to those listed above, the National Park Service is governed by other federal laws and
regulations. Based on the scope of this plan/EIS, these include the following.
Code of Federal Regulations, Title 36 and Title 43
Title 36, Chapter 1 of the Code of Federal Regulations provides the regulations “for the proper use,
management, government, and protection of persons, property, and natural and cultural resources
within areas under the jurisdiction of the NPS.” In 43 CFR 24, the US Department of the Interior is
provided with policy guidance for interagency cooperation in the preservation, management, and
use of fish and wildlife resources.

RELATED STATE LAWS, REGULATIONS, AND POLICIES
The NYS-DEC is responsible for administration and enforcement of the state’s Environmental
Conservation Law which includes the authority to administer fish and wildlife laws, carry out
sound fish and wildlife management practices, and conduct fish and wildlife research. In addition,
the NYS-DEC is the agency entrusted with administration and oversight of deer population
management in New York according to the specific policies, authorities, and responsibilities
outlined in the New York State Environmental Conservation Law Article 11.
ECL 11-0303 directs NYS-DEC to develop and carry out programs that will promote natural
propagation and maintenance of desirable species in ecological balance and lead to the observance
of sound management practices. ECL 11-0903 and 11-0907 describe NYS-DEC’s authority for
establishing open seasons, manner of take and bag limits for hunting deer in Suffolk County,
including Fire Island. As a result of these statutes, current deer hunting opportunities in Suffolk
County exist in the form of an archery season from October 1 to December 31, and a special
firearms season commencing weekdays only no earlier than the first full week in January through
January 31st (typically 15–20 hunting days).
In addition to take of deer through regulated hunting, ECL 11-0515 authorizes NYS-DEC to issue a
revocable license for the collection and possession of wildlife for scientific purposes. Similarly,
ECL 11-0521 allows for issuance of a permit for the capture, harassing, or taking of wildlife that are
a nuisance, destructive to public or private property or a threat to public health or welfare.
NYS-DEC’s current priorities and the values and issues expressed by the public for deer
management are encompassed in the Management Plan for White-tailed Deer in New York State
2012–2016 (NYS-DEC 2011). While statewide in scope, the deer plan also highlights management
options available to public and private land managers. The plan identifies a tiered system of harvest
management that allows for varying degrees of management intensity across a gradient of
landscape scales, whereby regulated hunting is recognized as the most cost effective and equitable
mechanism to manage deer populations across a broad range of geographic scales, whereas specific
deer damage permits may be used to address situations of deer-related damage at community and
25

CHAPTER 1: PURPOSE OF AND NEED FOR ACTION

property scales. The plan also describes the experimental framework through which fertility
control projects may be conducted on wild deer within New York.
The National Park Service will coordinate with the state during implementation of this plan to
ensure that mutual management goals are achieved and all pertinent regulatory and permitting
needs are met. For example, if hunting or trapping are authorized or if research programs involving
the taking or possession of fish and wildlife are implemented, these activities would conducted in
accordance with Federal and State laws as appropriate.

INTRODUCTION
This chapter describes the various actions that could be implemented for future management of
white-tailed deer at Fire Island National Seashore. It provides detailed descriptions of each
alternative (no-action and action alternatives), followed by a discussion of adaptive management
and how it could be applied to the NPS preferred alternative. The remainder of the chapter
addresses alternative elements that were considered but dismissed from detailed analysis,
consistency with sections 101(b) and 102(1) of the National Environmental Policy Act, and the NPS
preferred and the environmentally preferable alternatives.

OVERVIEW OF ALTERNATIVES
The alternatives selected for detailed analysis are summarized in table 2. The alternatives under
consideration include a no-action alternative and three action alternatives.
Action alternatives were developed by the interdisciplinary planning team, which includes the
cooperating agencies, with feedback from the public and the science team during the planning
process. These alternatives meet, to varying degrees, the management objectives for Fire Island
National Seashore and also the purpose of and need for action, as described in “Chapter 1: Purpose
of and Need for Action.”

ALTERNATIVE A: NO ACTION
Under alternative A: no action, existing deer management and monitoring efforts throughout the
Seashore would continue. These actions include continued public education/interpretation efforts,
vegetation monitoring, and deer population and behavior surveys.

ACTION ALTERNATIVES
Each of the action alternatives (alternatives B, C, and D) includes the monitoring and education
actions proposed under alternative A. In addition, all action alternatives would enhance those
education efforts and propose to work collaboratively with the Fire Island communities, New York
State Department of Environmental Conservation, New York State Parks, Suffolk County Parks,
and local environmental groups on wildlife issues within the Fire Island communities. Each
alternative would take action to further reduce undesirable human-deer interactions, protect native
plant communities and cultural plantings, promote forest regeneration, and reduce the deer
population in the Seashore. Established thresholds for taking action, target deer densities, and
target vegetation densities would guide management actions and are described in following section.

Initial Deer Density Goals to Achieve Vegetation Objectives
The Seashore’s management goal for the natural areas (Sunken Forest, Fire Island Wilderness,
Talisman, Blue Point Beach, Carrington Estate, and William Floyd Estate) is to protect and restore
native vegetation communities. Vegetation targets vary between sections of the Seashore as
described in chapter 2. To achieve the vegetation targets, the level of deer browsing must change
either through exclusion fencing or reduction in deer numbers. Deer densities, based on 2013-2014
sampling, vary widely across Fire Island on federally owned land. For instance, deer density in the
immediate vicinity of the Light House Annex was estimated to be 33 deer per square mile, whereas
at Sailors Haven (i.e., Sunken Forest), Fire Island Wilderness, and the William Floyd Estate,

27

CHAPTER 2: ALTERNATIVES

estimated densities were 112, 36, and 93 deer per square mile, respectively. By comparison,
Horsley, Stout, and deCalesta (2003) determined that a deer density exceeding 20 deer per square
mile caused noticeable impacts on forest regeneration in the Allegheny National Forest of
Pennsylvania. The science team, relying on its professional experience and the scientific literature,
recommends a similar population density (approximately 20–25 deer per square mile) as the initial
density goal across Fire Island and at the William Floyd Estate lower acreage. The initial density
target of 20–25 deer per square mile would be maintained for the first 8–10 years until vegetation is
given ample time to display a response, understanding that the deer density target can be adjusted
higher or lower through adaptive management based on monitored vegetation impacts and
whether vegetation goals are reached.
The Sunken Forest preserve is the only section of the Seashore where herbaceous plants would be
used as an indicator of achieving the desired conditions. The science team believes a small number
of deer can do great harm to the herbaceous layer within the Sunken Forest. To meet the desired
conditions for vegetation described previously, the science team recommended that no deer be
allowed to forage within the Sunken Forest, establishing a target density of zero deer to completely
protect this area from deer browse.

Thresholds for Taking Action

THRESHOLDS FOR TAKING ACTION
As described in chapter 1, the Seashore has established desired conditions for various geographic
areas of the Seashore. To reach those conditions, specific actions would be required. Actions to be
taken have specific goals for success, which are used to help shape the action alternatives presented
in this plan/EIS. Thresholds are established that indicate the point at which an action is taken
(called a “threshold for taking action” or “action threshold”) and are typically tied to a measurable
parameter. The action thresholds for the different areas of the Seashore are presented below.

FIRE ISLAND COMMUNITIES
During the course of many deer density surveys over the past decade, Seashore biologists noted
variation among individual deer in their reaction to human presence. Some deer exhibit a flight
response, some exhibit no response at all, and others were observed approaching people. Biologists
recorded the behavior of each deer during surveys to accurately identify and measure the number
of deer actively approaching people. Approximately 11% of the deer observed during the surveys
between 2008 and 2011 approached the biologists. Additionally, Seashore biologists anecdotally
noted that the deer approaching appeared to be the same individuals, suggesting that these
returning deer are the cause of many human-deer interactions, likely due to food conditioning. In
contrast, only 3% of the deer on federally owned lands that were surveyed (Light House Annex,
Sailors Haven, and Fire Island Wilderness) approached the biologists (NPS 2011a).
The National Park Service believes that eliminating all undesirable human-deer interactions is
unrealistic. Instead, the focus would be on reducing the percentage of deer that approach people,
using the behaviors noted in these surveys as a measure. The Seashore believes that a realistic target
for the Fire Island communities would be observing less than 3% of deer approaching the
biologists, which is in line with the 2008–2011 detections on federal lands (where there are fewer
food attractants) and is a benchmark for how deer behave in less developed areas on Fire Island. If
the threshold of 3% is exceeded, the Seashore would take action to reduce the number of deer that
approach people as measured by observations during the deer density surveys.

SUNKEN FOREST
The vegetation monitoring data indicates little change in the tree canopy in terms of density,
species composition, and importance values since the establishment of the Seashore (NPS 2011b).
However the primary concern is that understory regeneration of trees and shrubs needed to
replace the midstory and overstory canopy in the Sunken Forest is lacking due to heavy deer
browse. For example, in analyzing four important canopy constituents, three showed dramatic
declines in density, with blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica) and American holly (Ilex opaca) being
completely absent from sample plots in 2011 (table 3).

Notes: Data available from permanent plots in the Sunken Forest (Art 1976, 1987; Forrester 2004; NPS 2011b).
Values are means ± standard errors.

The Seashore intends to monitor stem densities in the sapling and shrub layers of those key
constituents as the targeted measure for reaching the desired condition. The 1967 stem density data
was selected as a guide for determining which species to measure and what the target densities
should be.
The Seashore has chosen four woody species (dominant canopy constituents) and two species of
understory shrubs that were relatively common in 1967 (Art 1976) as the target species: shad blow
(Amelanchier canadensis), sassafras (Sassafras albidum), blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica), American holly
(Ilex opaca), chokeberry (Aronia arbutifolia), and inkberry (Ilex glabra) (table 4). The action
thresholds for these sapling and shrub species are based on the 1967 densities and are provided
below (measured in terms of individuals greater than 3.28 feet [1 meter] in height and less than 1.2
inches [3 cm] in diameter at breast height [dbh]).

The presence or absence of species and percent cover of ground cover plants (herbaceous, woody,
and liana) were surveyed in permanent plots in 1967, 1986, 2002, and 2011. This data showed that a
number of species were present in 1967 but absent from the 2002 and 2011 surveys: Carolina rose
(Rosa carolinia), small cranberry (Vaccinium oxycoccus), wild sarsaparilla (Aralia nudicaulis),
cinnamon fern (Osmunda cinnamomea), starry false lily of the valley (Maianthemum stellatum),
seaside goldenrod (Solidago sempervirens), inkberry (Ilex glabra), and winged sumac (Rhus
copallinum). The Seashore would like to see a return of these species as part of the regeneration
effort. However, formulating target thresholds for each of these ground cover plants would prove
difficult, given the evolutionary traits of each species (i.e., seasonal growth and flowering patterns)
and other site-specific abiotic factors (i.e., degree of sunlight, soil, moisture and fertility) that
change from year to year. Furthermore, the National Park Service realizes that achieving a
32

Thresholds for Taking Action

quantifiable target might be difficult for some species that have been absent from the forest for so
long and may not be plentiful in the seed bank (Forrester 2004). Instead, the Seashore would be
satisfied with achieving a presence of those ground cover plants that were common in 1967 but are
rare or missing today. To measure this, the Seashore has elected to choose wild sarsaparilla (Aralia
nudicaulis) and starry false lily of the valley (Maianthemum stellatum) as the indicator ground cover
species, because both are imperiled within the Sunken Forest and both serve as important
indicators of browsing pressure. The Seashore would continue measuring the vegetation within the
permanent plots to record the presence or absence and percent cover of these two species.

OTHER FIRE ISLAND NATURAL AREAS
Thresholds for other forested areas on Fire Island (other than the Sunken Forest) and the William
Floyd Estate were established using a combination of actual data collected at each site (NPS 2015b,
NPS 2013d), long-term data collected in the Sunken Forest, the scientific literature, and
professional experience and opinions of science team members. Seashore staff would extend the
data collection to other maritime forests in the future. A comprehensive dataset would be useful in
fully understanding understory conditions throughout each of the natural areas, but this dataset is
not complete. For the Talisman and Blue Point maritime forests, preliminary data indicate that
regeneration of forest overstory constituents have been impacted by deer browse, and the Seashore
would like to restore forest seedling growth. Success would be determined by an understory
seedling density target of 2 seedlings per square meter (excluding black cherry) based on a
weighted scale of seedling size as described in appendix B.

WILLIAM FLOYD ESTATE
Historic House and Surrounding Landscape
The historic core area of the William Floyd Estate would require successful establishment of key
ornamental plantings for the cultural landscape to be restored. The Seashore intends to annually
monitor the condition of ornamental plantings to determine relative condition. Deer browsing heavy
enough to result in poor vegetation growth and vegetation mortality would serve as a threshold for
taking action to control deer browse. Seashore staff would assess and document the general
condition of the cultural plantings and rely upon professional judgment of qualified cultural
landscape experts to determine whether corrective action is needed. The future cultural landscape
treatment plan would identify more detailed thresholds for taking action, once completed.

William Floyd Estate Forests
The forested areas of the William Floyd Estate would be managed as natural areas separate from
the historic core area. The number of tree seedlings would be the action threshold indicator. The
Seashore selected an action threshold based on available research on forest regeneration and the
regeneration standard adopted by the Pennsylvania Regeneration Study (USDA Forest Service
2013). This standard has also been adopted by the New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation as part of their recent statewide deer management plan (NYS-DEC 2011). The
Pennsylvania Regeneration Study is a component of the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA)
Program being implemented nationwide by the US Forest Service (USDA Forest Service 2013). The
FIA program has collected data in Pennsylvania forests since the 1950s; however, sampling
occurred on a “periodic” basis every 10–15 years. Data collection has intensified with surveys being
conducted on a 5 year rotation (McWilliams et al. 2004). Based on this study, forest regeneration
targets (adequate recruitment) for the William Floyd Estate would be reached when an average of 2
seedlings (native and deer preferred species) per square meter (8,079 seedlings per acre) are
33

CHAPTER 2: ALTERNATIVES

observed (McWilliams et al. 2005). To monitor for vegetation targets, the densities of living
seedlings greater than 5 cm in height but less than 1 cm dbh are recorded within the four 1 square
meter subplots located at the corners of each 100 square meter (10 × 10 m) plot. There are four
height class categories that are surveyed, and weighting factors are applied to each seedling
according to its height class (see appendix B for details).

ALTERNATIVE A: NO ACTION
Under the no-action alternative, the Seashore would continue to implement current management
actions, policies, and monitoring efforts related to deer and their effects. Current actions within the
Seashore include limited public education/interpretation efforts, vegetation monitoring, and deer
population surveys. The actions that would continue under alternative A are described below in
detail. These actions are also common to all action alternatives.

EDUCATION/INTERPRETATION
The Seashore would continue to disseminate information related to human-deer issues using a
variety of means. Interpretive exhibits, waysides, and print media regarding natural resources and
resource issues such as keeping wildlife wild, preventing Lyme disease, and other topics would
continue to be offered at visitor contact locations and would be made available to Fire Island
communities where possible. Interpretive rangers and other members of the Seashore’s staff would
also continue to provide information on these topics at visitor contact stations, and offer
interpretive programs focused on white-tailed deer and human-wildlife issues at Seashore sites and
within Fire Island communities as feasible. Finally, relevant information would be posted on the
Seashore’s website, social media platforms, and through local news outlets.

VEGETATION MONITORING
Vegetation monitoring would continue. Only vegetation on federal tracts within the boundaries of
the Seashore is surveyed. Areas that fall within this plan/EIS are (from west to east) the Light House
Annex, Sunken Forest, Carrington Estate, Talisman, Blue Point Beach, Fire Island Wilderness, and
William Floyd Estate. Due to the variety of habitat types, different sampling protocols are established
for each area. Sampling occurs annually, with each area being sampled once every five years.

Special-Status Plant Species
The Seashore performs annual surveys across the entire length of Fire Island in search for specialstatus plants that occupy beaches and foredunes. When special-status plants are discovered
occupying these habitats, Seashore staff often place small-scale screens around individual plants or
small groups of plants to protect them from deer browse. This practice would continue under
alternative A.

DEER MONITORING
Deer Population Monitoring
Deer population monitoring, described in appendix C of this document, would continue. This
monitoring includes distance sampling surveys to estimate white-tailed deer densities as well as
deer behavior monitoring (described above). Fire Island community sites and most natural areas
(including the Sunken Forest) on Fire Island are surveyed every year, whereas the William Floyd
34

Elements Common to Action Alternatives

Estate and Fire Island Wilderness are surveyed every three years. Deer population data collected in
the field includes aspects of herd composition such as sex, age (fawn/adult), and group size.

Behavior Monitoring
Deer behavior monitoring, described in appendix C of this document, is completed in
conjunction with the deer population monitoring. Surveys are initiated either 20 minutes before
official sunrise or timed so the survey is finished just before sunset. This is to ensure sampling is
conducted when deer are most active. When conducting the survey from within a vehicle, speeds
are constrained to no more than 10 mph. Two different kinds of deer behavior are recorded: (1)
initial behaviors, including feeding behaviors and forage type (if applicable); and (2) reaction to
observers. Initial behavior refers to the behavior that the majority of the group of deer is engaged
in at the time of detection. Habituation and reactive behaviors describe response to the
observer’s presence; an individual or group of deer within a detection is considered “unaffected”
if they do not visibly react to the observer’s presence. The behaviors during the surveys could be
“affected” by the distance of the deer from the transect, and whether an individual or deer group
is aware of the observer’s presence.

Incident Reporting and Response
Seashore park rangers report wildlife-related incidents throughout the boundaries of the Seashore
while roving or when directly contacted by visitors. All deer-related incidents occurring in the Fire
Island communities are reported to the NYS-DEC’s Wildlife Reporting Hotline. Seashore park
rangers would assist with each incident as needed.

ELEMENTS COMMON TO ACTION ALTERNATIVES
In addition to continuing the elements described under alternative A (public
education/interpretation efforts, incident reporting and response, deer and vegetation monitoring),
the actions described below are common to alternatives B, C, and D. In addition to these actions, all
action alternatives incorporate adaptive management approaches, which are described in detail in
“Adaptive Management Approaches Included in the Action Alternatives.”

ENHANCED PUBLIC EDUCATION/INTERPRETATION EFFORTS
Seashore staff would enhance public education/interpretation efforts within Fire Island
communities and communities adjacent to the William Floyd Estate to raise awareness of the role
of humans in deer-related issues. Actions could include the following:








Work collaboratively with Fire Island communities, New York State Parks, Suffolk County
Parks, and local environmental groups to develop, share, and use consistent and strategic
messaging with regard to human-deer interactions and deer management on Fire Island.
Dedicate interpretive effort where feasible to conduct outreach and provide interpretive
media in the Fire Island communities on the topic of living with deer. This would include
education on deer biology and ecology, supplemental food source reduction (i.e., garbage
management), and gardening with deer-resistant native plants.
Improve use of web and social media pages to engage virtual visitors in an online discussion
on human-deer interactions and deer management. This could include developing an
interactive web-based activity on the Seashore’s “For Kids” page.
Develop a curriculum-based education program centered on the topic of deer issues on
Fire Island.





Implement a citizen-science project engaging Fire Island community residents and
residents adjacent to the William Floyd Estate in deer and vegetation research and
monitoring.
Enhance education and enforcement of existing policies related to deer management and
feeding of wildlife within NPS boundaries.

FENCING OF THE SUNKEN FOREST
The 44-acre globally rare maritime holly forest at the Seashore known as the Sunken Forest has
incurred understory impacts from heavy deer browse for decades. Scientists believe that attempts to
restore understory vegetation—herbaceous vegetation in particular—could be disrupted by a single
foraging deer, and the only way to prevent deer browsing impacts completely is the installation of
an exclusion fence. Each of the action alternatives, therefore, would include an exclusion fence
approximately 7,130 feet long and 10 feet tall surrounding the maritime holly forest type within that
portion of the Sunken Forest preserve called out in the enabling legislation (figure 3). The location
of the fence would be dictated by minimizing environmental impacts (particularly to wetlands),
minimizing structural conflicts with existing boardwalks, and the potential for long-term bayside
shoreline erosion due to increasing water levels resulting from sea-level rise. As a mitigating step to
offset impacts caused by construction of the fence, the Seashore would consider collecting desirable
herbs and shrubs and replanting those plants within the area of disturbance.

SECURING THE BOUNDARY FENCE AT THE WILLIAM FLOYD ESTATE
The outlining fence along the property boundary of the William Floyd Estate is an aging chain-link
structure. Over the years, the fence has incurred damage from vandals and storms, and animals
have burrowed under the fence creating small gaps of sufficient space for deer to freely crawl
through. To best control the deer density, each action alternative includes enhancements and/or
replacement of the property fence. In addition, when staff have approached gates at the William
Floyd Estate to unlock for vehicular passage, deer have been observed quickly passing through the
gates as soon as they are opened. As part of the deer management plan to prevent deer movements
through vehicular gates, each of the action alternatives includes provisions to install cattle gates at
each vehicular gate.

ENHANCED VEGETATION MONITORING WITHIN NATURAL AREAS
Biologists recently began an expansive monitoring program to record baseline conditions of the
vegetation within these natural areas and to observe changes in vegetation over time, as described
in appendix B. Monitoring requires permanent vegetation plots for which comparisons can be
made. Data collection would occur annually, with each natural area being sampled at least once
every three years. This enhanced vegetation monitoring would continue under all action
alternatives.

SMALL-SCALE FENCING OF SPECIAL-STATUS PLANTS
As described under alternative A, the Seashore would continue annual searches for those specialstatus plant species occupying beaches and foredunes that are vulnerable to deer browse impacts.
When special-status species plants are discovered, the Seashore would install small-scale fencing
around the plants to protect them from deer browse.

Deer Population Management Actions
Consistent with Alternatives B and D

ENHANCED DEER POPULATION MONITORING
Monitoring deer numbers is a critical element of the plan to measure deer densities relative to
observed changes in vegetation. Under each of the action alternatives, enhancement of deer
monitoring efforts would occur by increasing the monitoring events across all regions of the
Seashore to an annual basis. During deer density counts, staff would record observed deer behavior
as a means of indexing the frequency of undesirable human-deer interactions. This data would be a
key component in determining whether Seashore goals are met and any adaptive management
actions throughout the implementation of the plan. This enhanced monitoring is described in
appendix C.

MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS
NPS Management Policies 2006, section 6.3.5, “Minimum Requirement” states that all management
decisions affecting wilderness must be consistent with the minimum requirements concept. This
concept is a systematic process used to determine if administrative actions, projects, or programs
affecting wilderness character, resources, or the visitor experience are necessary, and if so, how to
minimize the resulting impacts.
The term “minimum requirements” comes from section 4 (c) of the Wilderness Act, which states
“…except as necessary to meet minimum requirements for the administration of the area for the
purpose of this Act. . .” The minimum requirement decision process involves two steps. First, to
determine if any administrative action is necessary to meet minimum requirements for
administration of the area for the purpose of the Wilderness Act, and if so, to then determine the
minimum activity (method or tool) needed to accomplish the action which would have the least
impact on the wilderness resource, character, and purposes.
The National Park Service would complete a minimum requirement analysis for the NPS preferred
alternative prior to implementation, striving to minimize the extent of adverse impact while
accomplishing the Seashore’s necessary wilderness objective.

COORDINATION WITH STATE
The NYS-DEC regulates the hunting and collection of animals by the public through the issuance
of permits. In addition, once a fertility control agent (discussed in more detail below and not
applicable to alternative C) is approved for use by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the
agent must also be registered for use in New York. Registration of any agent would include labeled
restrictions. By law, any landowner using the agent would need to comply with these labeled
restrictions. The Seashore, in implementing this plan/EIS, would work closely with NYS-DEC.
Coordination would include routine meetings with NYS-DEC staff, data sharing, public relations,
and reporting.

DEER POPULATION MANAGEMENT ACTIONS
CONSISTENT WITH ALTERNATIVES B AND D
FERTILITY CONTROL
Reproductive control in wildlife management has been assessed for several decades across multiple
species. Its use has gained more attention as the public has become more interested in wildlife
39

CHAPTER 2: ALTERNATIVES

management decisions. For reproductive control agents to effectively reduce deer population size,
they must decrease the reproductive rate to less than the mortality rate. In urban deer populations,
mortality rates are generally very low (approximately 10%). Also, to control the growth of the deer
population, it is necessary to treat 70%–90% of the female deer with a highly effective product to
successfully reduce or halt population growth in a closed population without immigration or
emigration (Rudolph, Porter, and Underwood 2000; Hobbs, Bowden, and Baker 2000). The science
and understanding of fertility control are evolving. The most updated information about fertility
control is summarized in appendix D. The terms fertility control and reproductive control are used
synonymously in this document.
Two categories of reproductive control technology were considered: chemical reproductive
control agents and surgical sterilization. Chemical reproductive control agents offer great promise
for future wildlife management (Rutberg et al. 2004), as described in appendix D. Surgical
sterilization was considered but dismissed based on the criteria established for fertility control (see
“Alternative Elements Considered but Dismissed” at the end of this chapter).
Several chemical reproductive control agents (immunological and nonimmunological) are being
developed and tested for use in deer population control (Fagerstone et al. 2010). These include the
standard porcine zona pellucida (PZP) vaccine (Kirkpatrick et al. 1992; Turner, Kirkpatrick, and
Liu 1996; Naugle et al. 2002; Miller et al. 2009); uniquely formulated PZP, such as SpayVac® (Fraker
et al. 2002) and long-acting formulations of native PZP (Rutberg et al. 2013); gonadotropin­
releasing hormone (GnRH) vaccine (Miller et al. 2000, 2001; Curtis et al. 2002; Fraker et al. 2002;
Gionfriddo et al. 2009, 2011); and Leuprolide (Baker et al. 2002, 2004). Each of these agents is
described briefly in table 5 and in more detail in appendix D.

The current research related to chemical reproductive control technologies offers highly variable
results in terms of key elements such as contraceptive efficacy and duration (appendix D). As stated
above, there are also logistical issues related to the administration of these drugs that could have
substantial implications for success and sustainability. Therefore, only when the following criteria
are met would reproductive control be implemented as a management tool. The rationale for each
criterion is noted below.
40

Deer Population Management Actions
Consistent with Alternatives B and D

1. The fertility control agent is federally approved and state-registered for application to freeranging white-tailed deer populations.
 Rationale: It is critical that all aspects of a fertility control program be consistent with
federal laws and regulations and NPS policies.
2. The agent provides multiple-year (three or more) efficacy (80%–100%) to minimize the
cost and labor required to administer the drug to a large number of deer.
 Rationale: Modeling efforts have clearly demonstrated that (1) “the efficacy of fertility
control as a management technique depends strongly on the [multi-year] persistence
of…the fertility control agent;” and (2) the only scenarios in which fertility control is
more efficient than culling at maintaining population size is when a multi-year efficacy
is achieved (Hobbs et al. 2000).
3. The agent can be administered through remote injection to avoid capturing the animal on a
regular basis and to increase the efficiency of distribution.
 Rationale: Same as criterion 2.
4. The agent would leave no harmful residual in the meat (meat would be safe for human and
non-target animal consumption).
 Rationale: Any fertility control agent applied must be safe for human consumption,
either immediately after delivery or after an established withdrawal period.
5. The agent would have minimal impact on deer behavior (e.g., reproductive behaviors,
social behaviors, out of season estrous cycling).
 Rationale: NPS Management Policies 2006, section 4.4.2, states that native species will be
maintained by preserving and restoring the natural abundances, diversities, dynamics,
distributions, habitats, and behaviors of native plant and animal populations and the
communities and ecosystems in which they occur (NPS 2006a). Reproduction is a
fundamental ecological process for deer and affects their social structure. Any fertility
control agent that significantly changes the timing or duration of the breeding season or
the social structure of the population does not meet this requirement.
The criteria included in this plan/EIS were chosen by the National Park Service to meet objectives
of NPS policy, and there are currently no fertility control agents that fulfill all of the criteria
Regardless, because Seashore staff anticipates an agent that meets all NPS criteria would be
available upon implementation or within the next 10 years (as research and development
continues), this tool has been retained as part of the range of alternatives. However, evaluation of
existing agents using criteria for an acceptable agent showed that GonaConTM met more of the
criteria than other chemical reproductive control agents (table 6).

SpayVac® has demonstrated 80%–100% efficacy for up to 5–7 years in horses and deer (Fraker, pers. comm., 2009; Miller et al.
2009; Killian et al. 2008). The term “possibly” is used because long-term studies (greater than 5 years) have been conducted
only in captive deer and had a small sample size in each treatment group (N=5) (Miller et al. 2009). The only longer term study in
free-ranging white-tailed deer did not evaluate past the third year (Rutberg et al. 2013).
Long-term pelleted PZP has not been adequately evaluated past year 2 in free-ranging deer to determine extended efficacy
(Rutberg et al. 2013).
Federally approved but not registered in New York state for use in free ranging white-tailed deer populations.
Research on one-shot, multiyear GnRH vaccine in penned/captive deer indicates GonaCon is 88%–100% effective in year 1, 47%–
100% effective in year 2, and 25%–80% effective up to 5 years post-treatment (Miller et al. 2008). The term “possibly” is used
because the 3+ year efficacy has only been demonstrated in captive deer, with small sample size, and lacks confidence intervals.
Work in free-ranging deer suggests lower efficacy rates and shorter duration of efficacy (Gionfriddo et al. 2009, 2011).
Work published in elk used dart delivery to administer the GnRH vaccine (Killian et al. 2009). However, the current label for
GonaConTM requires it to be hand injected.
Not applicable because this is a veterinary procedure rather than a product. The procedure requires general anesthesia, a
veterinarian to perform surgery, post-operative antibiotics, and is likely associated with a higher mortality rate (approximately
6%; MacLean et al. 2006) than anesthesia alone (approximately 1.5%; Rutberg et al. 2013). Results in permanent sterilization.

42

Alternative B

Under alternative B, the Seashore would not be able to initiate a reproductive control program until
a chemical reproductive control agent meeting all criteria becomes available. Prior to the
availability of an acceptable agent, all other components of alternative B would be implemented
following initiation of this plan. The availability of an acceptable agent would also limit the options
available to the park for population maintenance under alternative D (but direct reduction
methods would be available for use under this alternative).
The Seashore would monitor the status of reproductive control research on a periodic basis
through consultation with subject matter experts and review of new publications. When new
information and/or advances in the use of reproductive control agents could benefit deer
management in the Seashore and established criteria are met, the decision to use an appropriate
chemical reproductive control agent would be determined by the Seashore. This determination
would be made based on how well the criteria for an acceptable control agent are met and on
availability, cost, efficacy, duration, and safety at the time the action was implemented. The
determination of an appropriate control agent is discussed further in “Adaptive Management
Approaches Included in the Action Alternatives.”

ADMINISTRATION OF THE REPRODUCTIVE CONTROL AGENT
Application Procedures. Regardless of the reproductive control agent used, treated females would
be marked (tagged) to facilitate identification of which deer have been treated, to avoid multiple
treatments of the same individuals. For most marking techniques, each deer must be captured and
handled at least once for the first treatment. Tracking and capturing previously treated females
would require time to locate the deer or to lure it to a capture site so that it could be treated. After
deer have been handled, successfully capturing them for subsequent treatments can become
difficult (Rudolph, Porter, and Underwood 2000).
Training. Regardless of the technique implemented, qualified federal employees or contractors
with demonstrated experience in the administration of reproductive control would perform these
activities. NPS employees and contractors performing the darting would be required to
successfully complete training on the use and storage of a dart gun, as well as on the administration
of anesthesia and the fertility control agent. This training is important to ensure the safety of NPS
employees, contractors, and Seashore visitors. Federal employees or contractors also would need
to be qualified to handle live deer in order to minimize harm to the animal or the employee. If more
than one location were simultaneously used to remotely administer controls with tranquilizer darts,
these areas would be adequately separated for safety reasons.

MONITORING
Additional monitoring to document reproductive control success (pregnancy rate, and
reproductive rate) would be implemented. Data collected from monitoring would be used to test
the accuracy of modeling results to reduce modeling uncertainties. It would be expected that as the
number of females treated with a reproductive control agent increased over time, the percent of
pregnant females would decrease. Data on reproductive rates also would be used to describe the
existing deer population. Detailed monitoring plans are included in appendixes B and C.

ALTERNATIVE B
Deer browse would be managed through exclosure fencing of an area encompassing the historic
core at the William Floyd Estate (approximately 80 acres), rotational fencing of selected forest areas
43

CHAPTER 2: ALTERNATIVES

at the William Floyd Estate lower acreage (approximately 66 acres at one time), and small-scale
fencing to protect special-status species, in addition to fencing in the Sunken Forest (approximately
44 acres of maritime holly forest). The fencing would be implemented in conjunction with fertility
control of white-tailed deer to gradually reduce and then maintain the deer population at an
appropriate density to achieve the plan objectives (estimated at 20 deer per square mile across Fire
Island and 20 deer per square mile at the William Floyd Estate). Fertility control would be
implemented using a chemical reproductive control agent (when an acceptable agent, i.e., an agent
meeting criteria specified in the plan/EIS, becomes available). For the purpose of including a diverse
array of management alternatives, the plan/EIS assumes an acceptable chemical reproductive
control agent that meets all of the established criteria may be available within 10 years. Once
adequate levels of tree seedling recruitment have been reached, it may be possible to eliminate or
reduce fencing. This would be assessed using adaptive management. Deer observed approaching
humans within the Fire Island communities would be translocated to the Fire Island Wilderness.

FENCING
Fencing would be used to exclude deer from the maritime holly forest known as the Sunken Forest
(approximately 44 acres of fenced area) and the William Floyd Estate (figures 3 and 4). At the
William Floyd Estate, both an area encompassing the historic core—approximately 80 acres—and
rotational fencing in the lower acreage would be constructed. Rotational fencing would create four
defined areas, ranging in size from 8–37 acres and totaling approximately 66.5 acres in the first 10
years, then approximately 65 acres in the second 10 years. When defining exclosure locations and
the amount of fencing required, Seashore staff would consider the proposed locations in relation to
historic structures, cultural landscapes, visitor-use areas, Seashore boundaries, accessibility, known
archeological resources, the trail system, and maintenance requirements. High-use visitor areas,
areas with the potential for adverse visual impacts, and areas with high maintenance requirements
(e.g., floodplains) would be avoided as much as possible. Large fenced areas would be constructed
on Seashore property at least 100 feet from the Seashore boundary to provide adequate
construction area and minimize impacts on neighboring properties. Prior to fence construction,
archeological surveys would be conducted at fence post locations.
The fences would be a minimum of 8–10 feet high and mesh size would be sufficient to allow most
small animals to move freely through the fence. It is expected that technical details (e.g., type of
footer, post type, and spacing, etc.) would vary based on factors such as topography, geologic
substrate, access, potential visibility, and presence of archeological resources. This information
would be provided on a site-by-site basis through development of a detailed implementation plan.
Electric fencing would not be used in the Seashore based on concerns for visitor safety, potential
impacts on other native wildlife, and long-term maintenance requirements.
Deer would be driven out of the fenced areas by Seashore staff before completing the fencing.
Visitors would be allowed within the fenced areas at the Sunken Forest and the William Floyd
Estate historic core. Visitors would not be able to use the areas enclosed by rotational fences
(William Floyd Estate lower acreage) during or after construction. All fencing would be monitored
by Seashore staff and maintained by contract with a local fence company. Monitoring of all fenced
areas would consist of visual inspection for fence integrity and would be coordinated with
vegetation monitoring activities. If any deer were found within a fenced area, they would be driven
out of the fenced area by Seashore staff.

William Floyd Estate Proposed Fencing ­
Alternative B

CHAPTER 2: ALTERNATIVES

The timeline for the duration that fences would remain in place differs between the Sunken Forest
and the William Floyd Estate. For the Sunken Forest and the William Floyd Estate historic core
area, fences would be permanent. At the William Floyd Estate lower acreage, rotational fences
would be used to protect vegetation from deer browse. It is estimated that it would take at least
10-15 years to achieve an adequate level of regeneration within the rotationally fenced areas at the
William Floyd Estate (8,079 tree seedlings per acre) and for seedlings to exceed the typical deer
browsing height (approximately 60 inches) (Horsley, Stout, and deCalesta 2003). Once monitoring
within the fenced area indicated adequate regeneration and tree seedlings exceeded browse height,
the rotational fencing would be moved to immediately adjacent areas in order to reuse one side of
the previous fenced area, thus minimizing relocation and labor costs.

DEER TRANSLOCATION
The method of capturing and moving deer from one area to another would be considered in
alternative B of the plan/EIS. Translocation is not considered a long-term solution; however, it may
have applicability in the short term while human behaviors that cause and perpetuate undesirable
human-deer interactions are being reduced in the Fire Island communities to the extent possible.
Translocation would be considered only for those deer that are observed to habitually approach
humans in the Fire Island communities. Translocation may be implemented to achieve the plan’s
objective of reducing undesirable human-deer interactions. Individuals would only be captured
from Fire Island communities west of Sailors Haven. Captured females would be treated with a
fertility control agent, and all captured animals would be translocated to the Fire Island Wilderness
where the deer population density is estimated to be approximately 36 deer per square mile (62
individuals). Seashore biologists have observed natural fluctuations in the deer population density
at the Fire Island Wilderness, which has been between 36 and 88 deer per square mile (62 and 150
deer). Translocating deer to the Fire Island Wilderness would cause a slight increase in the
population density in that area. However, biologists have concluded that the density would remain
within the natural range of population variability. Biologists also have concluded that translocating
deer to the Fire Island Wilderness would cause browsing pressure to remain within the range
experienced under natural fluctuations of the population. If this alternative was selected, the park
would undertake additional planning to establish thresholds for the level of impact on vegetation at
which translocation would cease.
A detailed protocol to implement this element would be developed at a later date with coordination
with the state of New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. Deer that approach
humans would first be identified by NPS staff based on behavior observations during deer
monitoring surveys. These individual deer would be captured and/or anesthetized and then
transported to the Fire Island Wilderness, most likely by truck. This process would involve labor
costs for the capture, transportation, and release of the live animal. Trained staff would be required
for care of the live animal, including reversing and ensuring the animal’s safe release into the Fire
Island Wilderness. Decisions regarding the implementation of this method would be made based
on efficiency, the minimum requirements and tools necessary to carry out the task (in the context
of wilderness management), and safety for both the animal and the handler. All precautions would
be made to minimize stress to the animal as well as handling time. Release sites in the Fire Island
Wilderness would be identified but should be no less than 4 miles from Davis Park (the
easternmost Fire Island community). Reproductive control (as part of alternative B) would occur
before the individual deer is released into the Fire Island Wilderness.
All individuals would be marked to track their survival, movements, and behaviors after
translocation. An assessment of each translocated individual would be made every year to
46

Alternative B

determine the success of the translocation efforts. Capture and euthanasia would be considered for
translocated individuals that consistently return to Fire Island communities and/or continue to
approach humans.

REPRODUCTIVE CONTROL
Number of Females Treated at Fire Island
To effectively reduce deer population size, treatment with a reproductive control agent must
decrease the reproductive rate to less than the mortality rate. The actual deer mortality rates at Fire
Island and at the William Floyd Estate are not known; however, these rates are expected to be low
particularly on Fire Island in the absence of hunting, given that few, if any, deer die from motor
vehicle collisions, a high source of mortality in most urban deer populations. Fire Island, like many
other suburban deer populations, has a high number of artificial food sources, which could
contribute to a lower mortality rate.
Thus, under alternative B, it is assumed that it would be necessary to treat approximately 70%–90%
of the females in order to reduce deer population growth (Hobbs, Bowden, and Baker 2000;
Rudolph, Porter, and Underwood 2000). After several years of application at this rate of treatment,
a small (e.g., 5 %) reduction in the deer population could be expected (Hobbs, Bowden, and Baker
2000). However, in a deer management plan completed at Valley Forge National Historical Park, a
deer population model indicated that the reduction in the deer population using a reproductive
control agent could be more than that, possibly up to 33% after 5 years and up to 60% after 10
years (NPS 2009c). These estimates from Valley Forge National Historical Park are similar to
findings at the Fire Island communities of Kismet to Lonelyville (Rutberg and Naugle 2008). This
western segment of Fire Island has the longest history of fertility control (PZP) research, from
1993–2009. Rutberg and Naugle (2008) included population data collected using distance sampling
from 1995–2006, and deer density declined by ~58% from 1997–2006 (approximately 85–35 deer,
respectively). Alternatively, population reduction through PZP treatment was nominal in other
portions of Fire Island (Naugle et al. 2002; Underwood 2005), reflecting the logistical challenges
associated with implementing fertility control treatments.
The Seashore’s deer population on Fire Island was estimated at 229–428 deer, based on deer density
of lands surveyed (about 3.926 square miles) during 2013 and 2014. Deer density survey data
collected by the National Park Service indicate that approximately 80% of the deer in the Seashore
(183–342 deer) are females. Under alternative B, approximately 165–308 females (~90% of 183 and
342) would be treated in the first year and then every three years, assuming minimal deer population
reduction (~5%). At the other end of the spectrum, assuming a deer population reduction similar to
what was observed on Fire Island (Kismet to Lonelyville) and predicted at Valley Forge National
Historical Park, approximately 165-310 deer would be treated years 1 and 4, approximately 110-205
deer would be treated in years 7 and 10, and approximately 65-125 deer would be treated in year 13.
All numbers are approximate and would depend on how the deer population responds; therefore,
adaptive management approaches would be key to a successful program.

Number of Females Treated at the William Floyd Estate
The Seashore’s 2012 deer population at the William Floyd Estate was estimated at 66–141 deer, based
on the deer density of surveyed lands (about 0.904 square miles). Deer density survey data collected
by the National Park Service indicate that approximately 73% of the deer at the William Floyd Estate
(48–103 deer) are female. At the high range, the number of females that would be treated ranges from
45–95 (~90% of 48 and 103) for the first year and then every three years, assuming minimal deer
47

CHAPTER 2: ALTERNATIVES

population reduction (~5%). At the other end of the spectrum, assuming a deer population reduction
similar to what was observed on Fire Island (Kismet to Lonelyville) and predicted at Valley Forge
National Historical Park, approximately 45–95 deer would be treated years 1 and 4, approximately
30–60 deer treated in years 7 and 10, and approximately 20–40 deer treated in year 13. All numbers
are approximate and adaptive management is key to a successful program.

ALTERNATIVE C
Deer browse would be managed through small-scale fencing to protect special-status species and
key plants within the William Floyd Estate historic core, as well as exclosure fencing in the Sunken
Forest (approximately 44 acres of maritime holly forest). Actions would be taken to reach
vegetation recovery and forest regeneration goals by directly reducing and maintaining the deer
browsing pressure through use of direct reduction methods. These methods also would be used to
maintain the deer density at a density where vegetation can successfully regenerate (initially 20–25
deer per square mile Seashore-wide). Deer population reduction and maintenance would be
implemented through a combination of sharpshooting, capture and euthanasia of individual deer
(where necessary), and public hunting (within the Fire Island Wilderness only). Deer observed
habitually approaching humans within the Fire Island communities would be captured and
euthanized (following American Veterinary Medical Association guidelines).

FENCING
Vegetation management actions under alternative C would vary depending on the location.
Fencing of the Sunken Forest and small-scale fencing of special-status plant species island-wide
would take place as described under alternative B. At the William Floyd Estate, small-scale fencing
and/or protective barriers would be established within the historic core to protect key cultural
landscape plantings, and key species would be replanted as needed to restore the cultural
landscape. Decisions on appropriate plant species and their locations would be made in a future
cultural landscape treatment plan. Generally, proposed plantings would include a formal garden
consisting of flowers and a small fruit tree orchard adjacent to the western side of the house within
the historic core.

DEER POPULATION MANAGEMENT ACTIONS
Under alternative C, various deer management actions would be used depending on the location.
Across Fire Island, a combination of sharpshooting, capture and euthanasia, and a controlled
public hunt (at the Fire Island Wilderness only) would be used to lower the deer density to
approximately 20–25 deer per square mile. In the Fire Island communities, deer that approach
humans would be captured and euthanized (following American Veterinary Medical Association
guidelines), contributing to the number of animals that need to be removed to meet the initial deer
density target. Within the Sunken Forest, the sensitive maritime forest would be fenced, as
described under alternative B, and all deer within the fence would be removed through direct
methods (sharpshooting or capture and euthanasia). Finally, at the William Floyd Estate, direct
reduction would be used to lower the deer density to approximately 20–25 deer per square mile.
These actions are described below in more detail.

Sharpshooting
Sharpshooting would involve the use of qualified federal employees, contractors, or skilled
volunteers to remove deer within the Seashore in designated areas, generally using firearms. All
48

Alternative C

sharpshooters would be held to rigorous skill and safety standards. Methods, removal numbers,
and sex preferences are described below.
Methods. Qualified federal employees, contractors, or skilled volunteers with demonstrated
expertise and training in the implementation of successful wildlife and deer management actions—
including firearms handling, direct removal techniques, carcass processing, and wildlife capture
and handling—would be used to implement this action. They typically would be expected to work
with Seashore staff to coordinate all details related to sharpshooting actions, such as setting up bait
stations, locating deer, sharpshooting, and preparation of carcasses for disposal or donation.
Disposition of the deer (donation of meat and disposal of waste or carcasses) would be coordinated
with Seashore staff (e.g., transportation to the meat processing facility and coordination with the
meat recipient).
In most locations, high-power, small-caliber rifles would be used at close range. Nonlead
ammunition would be used in this case to meet NPS policy (NPS 2009d). Use of nonlead
ammunition also would serve to preserve the opportunity to donate the meat or to leave it in the
field for scavenging wildlife without risking dissemination of lead into the food chain. Every effort
would be made to ensure humane treatment of individual deer.
Sharpshooting would primarily occur at night (between dusk and dawn) during late fall and winter
months, when deer are more visible and there are few visitors at the Seashore. In some restricted
areas, sharpshooting may take place during the day, if needed. In this case, the areas would be
closed to Seashore visitors. In both cases, sharpshooters would be located in elevated positions
(e.g., tree stands) or in clearly marked, high-clearance government vehicles traveling on trails
and/or roads on Fire Island and within the William Floyd Estate. Spotlights would be used during
night operations. The public would be notified of any Seashore closures and deer management
activities in advance via media releases and alerts posted to the Seashore’s website and social media
venues; and with printed notification posted at Seashore visitor contact stations, Seashore bulletin
boards, and public billboards located within the Fire Island communities. Visitor access would be
limited as necessary during direct reductions, and NPS personnel would patrol public areas to
ensure compliance with Seashore closures and public safety measures. Compliant with New York
State law, sharpshooting would not occur within 500 feet of occupied residences within the Fire
Island communities. During sharpshooting activities, noise-suppression devices and night vision
equipment would be used to reduce disturbance to the public. Activities would be conducted in
compliance with all federal firearm laws administered by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
Firearms, and Explosives.
Temporary bait stations could be used to attract deer to safe removal locations. The stations would
be placed in Seashore-approved locations, away from public-use areas, to maximize the efficiency
and safety of the direct reduction program. The amount of bait placed in any one location could
range from 20–100 pounds, depending on the bait used and the number of deer in the immediate
area (DeNicola et al. 1997b).
Training. Qualified federal employees, contractors, or skilled volunteers with demonstrated
expertise and training in the implementation of successful wildlife and deer management actions—
including firearms handling, direct removal techniques, carcass processing, and wildlife capture
and handling—would perform these activities. Specific qualifications, based on state regulations,
would be developed prior to implementation. These individuals also would need to demonstrate
firearms proficiency, based on NPS firearms qualifications, on an annual basis throughout the
project. On-site training would include Seashore orientation and required safety measures to
protect visitors, NPS employees, and volunteers. Volunteers may also assist in other activities such
as the transport and processing of carcasses, maintenance of bait stations, and implementation of
49

CHAPTER 2: ALTERNATIVES

Seashore closures. Volunteer training would be provided by NPS staff to support volunteer
involvement.
Disposal. Deer carcasses would be transported by NPS staff and/or contractors to a central
location for temporary storage during removal actions and collection of biological data. Deer
removed off site would be transported by NPS staff and/or contractors on a daily basis for
processing; more than one processing facility may be used. The meat from these deer would be
provided directly from the meat processing facility to a local food bank or food pantry for the
purpose of redistribution for human consumption. In situations where access to the carcass is
difficult or not in a highly visible area, surface disposal may be acceptable. In these circumstances,
every effort would be made to reduce the visibility of the carcass to Seashore visitors.
Number of Deer Removed. Seashore staff would determine the number of deer to be removed
based on the most recent deer population survey and the initial deer density goal of approximately
20–25 deer per square mile, as well as past experience of other deer population reduction
programs, technical feasibility, and success of forest regeneration in later years of plan
implementation. Based on current deer density reports for Fire Island and the experience with
population reduction at other national park units such as Valley Forge National Historical Park, it
is estimated that the desired deer density goal could be reached at Fire Island and the William
Floyd Estate in 1–2 years if 65% of the population is initially targeted for removal. These estimates
are based on the technical, financial, and logistic feasibility of removal at both locations. It is
recognized that deer population reduction could proceed more rapidly if it is possible to remove
more deer in each year and if the deer population growth is lower than anticipated.
Table 7 provides a likely scenario for the removal actions at each location, beginning with the current
deer population numbers. The scenario assumes that direct reduction methods would be used to
remove the deer. Removal would be targeted for the six-month period from October through March.
The extent to which the three methods of direct reduction would be used is dependent on variable
factors (e.g., number of hunting permits issued, number of deer that would need to be euthanized,
etc.) which would be established upon implementation of the plan and could vary by year.
As previously noted, several factors could influence the number of years required to reach the
initial deer density goal. The numbers presented in table 7 are estimates based on current deer
density data and estimates of annual growth, as well as what experienced staff believe is reasonable.
These numbers could change over time when the plan is implemented. For example, as the deer
population numbers decrease through successful direct reduction efforts, deer might become
adapted to the direct reduction operations and become more evasive, increasing the effort
necessary to reach the removal numbers in any year. Actual reproduction and mortality rates might
differ from the estimates used in this projection. If reproduction rates were higher and mortality
lower than estimated, the population growth would be greater, and more deer would need to be
removed; this could increase the time to reach the initial density goal or call for a greater number of
deer to be removed, if feasible given available resources. The converse would be true if
reproduction rates were lower and mortality rates higher than estimated, resulting in removing
fewer deer and reaching the deer density goal in less time. Immigration of deer into the Seashore
property could also vary, and this would have an effect on the number of deer to be removed
(Porter, Underwood, and Woodward 2004). Thus, monitoring would be an essential part of this
alternative, and actions could be adjusted as described in the “Adaptive Management Approaches
Included in the Alternatives” section.
The number of deer removed in years following attainment of the desired density goal would be
adjusted as described in the “Adaptive Management Approaches Included in the Action
Alternatives” section. This number may vary annually depending on the success of previous
50

Alternative C

removal efforts, deer adaptations to removal efforts, vegetation regeneration response, and other
factors. In general, at Fire Island the number of deer to be removed annually would range from 15­
30, while at William Floyd Estate, it would range from 3–12.
The number of females in the deer population also would influence reproduction rates. Due to the
preferential removal of females, as described below, recruitment into the population should
decrease, because fewer females would be reproducing. However, as the habitat improves,
reproductive rates may increase as well.

Sex Preference. Focus on female deer is necessary to stabilize or reduce deer populations
(DeNicola et al. 2000). However, due to the size of the deer population, during the first two years of
direct reduction, both female and male deer across age classes would be removed based on
opportunity. Thereafter, at least 15 females should be taken for every 10 males (WVU 1985). There
would be a preference for removing females, because this would reduce the deer population level
more efficiently over the long term.
Records would be kept on the herd composition (i.e., age and sex) of all deer removed from the
Seashore to provide the Seashore with additional information on herd population metrics. This
information would be compared with data used in deer population models to improve model accuracy.

Capture and Euthanasia
Capture and euthanasia would be used only in circumstances where sharpshooting would not be
appropriate due to safety or security concerns, such as within the Fire Island communities or close
to occupied buildings. For this reason, this method would be used on an estimated 15% or less of
the total number of deer removed based on the experience of Seashore biologists conducting
annual deer density counts who are familiar with the Seashore setting. Activities would occur when
few people visiting the Seashore.
Captured deer would be euthanized as humanely as possible, in accordance with current veterinary
recommendations such as those published by the American Veterinary Medical Association. Most
capture methods involve using bait to attract deer to a specific area where deer could be darted
51

CHAPTER 2: ALTERNATIVES

with a tranquilizer (Schwartz et al. 1997) or captured using select trapping methods. Tranquilizing
darts could also be used without bait stations when deer are within range of darting. The method of
capture and euthanasia would be selected based on the specific circumstances (location, number of
deer, accessibility, and reasons that sharpshooting was not advised). Animals euthanized with
chemicals would be appropriately disposed of, and would not be available for consumption.
Qualified federal employees or contractors with demonstrated experience in direct (lethal) removal
actions and training in the use of methods and tools associated with humane euthanasia (firearms
and/or tranquilizer darts) would perform these actions. Training would include safety measures to
protect visitors, NPS employees, and contractors. Federal employees or contractors would also be
qualified to handle live deer in order to minimize any harm to an animal or an employee.
Appropriate safety measures would be followed when setting up the capture area.
Data would be collected on each deer removed by capture and euthanasia to include (at a minimum)
age, weight, sex, location of removal, circumstance requiring removal and capture, and method used.

Public Hunting at the Fire Island Wilderness
A controlled public hunt would be carried out in the Fire Island Wilderness, abiding by the NYS­
DEC hunting season and regulations. The Seashore would be responsible for managing the public
hunt and may limit the number of hunters and the hours available for hunting. To protect
vegetation at the Fire Island Wilderness, hunters would not be allowed to use vehicles within the
wilderness. The use of both bowhunting and firearms could be allowed, as dictated by the state
deer hunting seasons. At least one check station would be provided for the collection of biological
data (i.e., sex and age), possibly near the Fire Island Wilderness visitor center. Gut piles may be left
behind in the field for natural decomposition/scavenger use.

ALTERNATIVE D
Deer browsing management actions would include fencing of an area encompassing the historic
core at the William Floyd Estate (approximately 80 acres) and small-scale fencing to protect
special-status species, as well as exclosure fencing in the Sunken Forest (approximately 44 acres
of maritime holly forest). The deer population would be reduced to an appropriate deer density
to achieve the plan objectives (estimated at 20–25 deer per square mile) through a combination of
sharpshooting, capture and euthanasia of individual deer (where appropriate), and public
hunting (within the Fire Island Wilderness only). Once reduced, the deer population could be
maintained through fertility control in place of or to supplement use of direct reduction
methods. Fertility control could be implemented using a chemical reproductive control agent
when an acceptable agent becomes available. Until an acceptable and effective reproductive
control agent becomes available, the deer population would be maintained using the same
methods used for direct reduction as described above for alternative C. Deer observed
approaching humans within the Fire Island communities would be captured and euthanized
(following American Veterinary Medical Association guidelines).

FENCING
Vegetation management actions under alternative D would vary depending on the location. Fencing of
the Sunken Forest and small-scale fencing of special-status plant species island-wide would take place
as described under alternative B. At the William Floyd Estate, fencing of the historic core area would
occur as described for alternative B to protect from deer browse all plantings important to the cultural
landscape. The layout of fencing at the William Floyd Estate is illustrated in figure 5.

DEER POPULATION MANAGEMENT ACTIONS
Direct Reduction
Under alternative D, the direct reduction methods described under alternative C would be
implemented to quickly reduce the deer population to the initial density goal. These methods also
may be used for deer population maintenance. For instance, if monitoring indicates that the
reproductive control application has been ineffective in maintaining the deer population at the
desired density or if an acceptable reproductive control agent is not available, these could be
reasons for the continued use of direct reduction methods.

Reproductive Control
Reproductive control of female deer through the use of a chemical reproductive control agent also
could be implemented (when an acceptable chemical agent becomes available) as described under
alternative B to maintain the deer population after it has been reduced. Ideally, implementation
would begin simultaneously with direct reduction. However, for the purposes of this analysis, it is
estimated that the use of reproductive control could begin during the third year of population
reduction, if an acceptable agent is available at that time (if an acceptable agent is not available,
direct reduction methods would be used, as stated previously). The success of implementing
reproductive control on a deer population that has undergone reduction efforts for several years
would depend on advances in reproductive control agents, sensitivity of the deer population to
humans, methods used by the qualified federal employees or contractors, changes in immigration
with reduced deer density, and general deer movement behavior (Porter, Underwood, and
Woodward 2004; Naugle et al. 2002). It should be expected that getting close enough to administer
remote injections would become increasingly difficult after reduction efforts due to deer
behavioral changes in response to previous human interaction (Underwood 2005).
Assuming reproductive control was initiated when the Seashore’s deer population density reached
the range of 20–25 deer per square mile, the Seashore’s total deer population would be no more
than 220 animals on Fire Island and 24 animals at the William Floyd Estate. Assuming that the sex
ratio composition of the reduced deer population was approximately 50:50 based on selective
targeting of females during direct reduction, there would be approximately 110 females on Fire
Islands and 12 females at the William Floyd Estate. For the initial fertility control treatment, the
estimated number of adult females that may need to be treated and marked for identification would
be 90% of the females (Rudolph, Porter, and Underwood 2000; Hobbs, Bowden, and Baker 2000),
or 99 of the females on Fire Island and 11 of the females at the William Floyd Estate. The deer
population would be monitored as fertility control continues in subsequent years, and
uncertainties could be tested via modeling approaches as part of adaptive management. If the deer
population increased during the reproductive control application under this alternative, periodic
direct reduction methods could be initiated to maintain the deer population density at the
identified goal.

ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT APPROACHES
INCLUDED IN THE ACTION ALTERNATIVES
All of the action alternatives (alternatives B, C, and D) described in this chapter incorporate adaptive
management approaches to meeting the objectives of the plan. Each alternative includes a management
action followed by a period of monitoring to evaluate the results of the action. By using an adaptive
management approach, managers would be able to change the timing or intensity of management

54

Adaptive Management Approaches
Included in the Action Alternatives

treatments to better meet the goals of the plan as new information is obtained. The adaptive
management approach and its integration into the action alternatives are more fully described below.
Successful management of natural systems is a challenging and complicated undertaking. All USDI
bureaus are encouraged to “use adaptive management to fully comply” with the Council on
Environmental Quality’s guidance that requires “a monitoring and enforcement program to be
adopted . . . where applicable, for any mitigation” (516 DM 1.3 D (7); 40 CFR 1505.2). In addition,
USDI has outlined the adaptive management approach in a technical guide developed to provide
guidance to all USDI bureaus and agencies (Williams, Szara, and Shapiro 2007).
Adaptive management is based on the assumption that current resources and scientific knowledge
are limited. Nevertheless, an adaptive management approach attempts to apply available resources
and knowledge and adjusts management techniques as new information is revealed. Holling (1978)
first described the principle of adaptive management as requiring management decisions and
policies to be viewed as hypotheses change.

USING THE ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT PROCESS
Adaptive management is a systematic approach for improving resource management by learning
from management outcomes (Sexton et al. 1999). An adaptive approach involves exploring ways to
meet management objectives, predicting the outcomes of alternatives based on the current state of
knowledge, implementing one or more of these alternatives, monitoring to learn about the impacts
of management actions, and then using the results to update knowledge and adjust management
actions (Murray and Marmorek 2004). Adaptive management focuses on learning and adapting,
through partnerships of managers, scientists, and other stakeholders, who learn together how to
create and maintain sustainable resource systems (Bormann et al. 2006).
Under the approach outlined by USDI guidance, adaptive management should be used when
decisions must be made despite uncertainty and there is a commitment to using this approach. The
deer management situation at Fire Island National Seashore meets all of these conditions.
There are two phases involved in a successful adaptive management plan: the set-up phase and the
iterative phase. The set-up phase was completed concurrently with the development of this
plan/EIS. The iterative phase would commence with the implementation of an action. Adaptive
management approaches that would be included in the iterative phase are described below.

ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT APPROACH
Under this plan/EIS, the following five steps would constitute the iterative phase of the adaptive
management approach. For illustrative purposes, alternative D is used as an example for each of
these steps.
1. Monitor the conditions. These conditions would be recorded and compared against
baseline data to determine whether management actions are necessary. For much of the
Seashore, baseline data already exist. Seashore staff are currently expanding monitoring
efforts to gather additional data in areas where data on baseline conditions does not exist.
2. Apply the management action. Deer would be managed using an action alternative described
in this document; for example, alternative D could initiate removal of deer to lower the deer
population and reproductive control to maintain the deer density at the desired target range
when an agent was available and met the criteria established in this plan/EIS. Initial
thresholds for taking action for the various areas of the Seashore have been established, as
55

CHAPTER 2: ALTERNATIVES

described under the “Thresholds for Taking Action” section in chapter 1, and these
thresholds will be adjusted if necessary in the future.
3. Monitor for the effectiveness of each management action. Monitoring would determine
whether the management actions were achieving the desired outcome. For example, is
there a reduction in the number of human-deer contacts within the Fire Island
communities, or is forest regeneration occurring in the lower acreage of the William Floyd
Estate as the initial deer density goal is achieved? Is reproductive control maintaining the
deer population within the targeted deer density range?
4. If monitoring indicates that the goal of forest regeneration is not at an adequate level
because of deer browsing pressure, reconsider the management actions. For example, under
alternative D, this could result in establishing a lower deer density goal and using a
combination of removal methods to reduce the population to achieve the new density.
5. If the management action is effective, and the forest is regenerating, consider modifications to
the intensity of the action. For example, if forest regeneration is successfully occurring, consider
whether deer density be raised (i.e., remove fewer deer) while still producing the same effect.
The adaptive management approach would be used in the following areas.

Undesirable Human-Deer Interactions
The plan incorporates several tools to reduce undesirable human-deer interactions. Methods of
education/interpretation and coordination with community officials and boards, landowners, and
vacationers would be important to the success of the plan. The Seashore would establish methods
for reaching out to the Fire Island communities, and results of the education/interpretation efforts
would be monitored via direct communication with visitors, questionnaires/surveys, and
observations of direct feeding of deer and exposed garbage during deer distance sampling counts.
It would take time for the Seashore’s efforts at education/interpretation to effectively change the
human behaviors that promote undesirable human-deer interactions. Modifications to actions
would be based on these monitored results over time and compared to baseline conditions.
Adjustments may be required in communication techniques such as the use of social media sites,
printed materials, and public hearings. If the Seashore experiences little decrease in feeding of deer
by the public, and deer are continuously feeding in exposed garbage, the Seashore would
investigate additional methods for public outreach.
In addition, actions would be required to remove deer that approach humans. A detailed protocol
to identify the individual deer that approach humans would be developed at a later date with
coordination with the state of New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. It is
expected that decreases in negative human-deer interactions would occur within the second year
after the majority of those deer (as observed during monitoring) are removed. The Seashore would
annually monitor the deer population to determine the estimated deer density and to observe deer
behavior. In the initial years of the plan, the goal would be to observe fewer deer approaching
biologists during monitoring compared to the previous year, and ultimately reach less than 3% (as
described in the thresholds for taking action). If removal of deer that approach humans does not
reduce the incidence of human-deer interactions, additional actions could be developed to manage
other factors which encourage human-deer interactions.

Vegetation Management
Actions are needed to improve vegetation conditions within the Sunken Forest, other maritime
forests, and the William Floyd Estate. The action thresholds differ for each area, and the proposed
actions could be modified based on the best available data for forest regeneration, results of
monitoring plot data, and deer density changes. The Seashore expects little changes in planned
56

Adaptive Management Approaches
Included in the Action Alternatives

actions would be needed for the Sunken Forest since all deer would be removed within a protected
fenced area. Nonetheless, monitoring data would be compared with expectations (that herbaceous
and woody vegetation would increase as deer density decreased) for each of the other areas of the
Seashore. It is expected that it would take at least 8–10 years after the initial deer density goal was
achieved until vegetation results would be seen in the monitored plots within the maritime forests
and the William Floyd Estate. If results after 10 years did not meet the objectives and goals of the
plan, or ongoing monitoring indicated that there were other factors limiting forest regeneration,
additional vegetation management actions would be considered, and additional compliance may be
necessary.

Deer Density Goal
The number of deer to be removed annually throughout Fire Island and at the William Floyd Estate
would be adjusted based on the results of the previous year’s removal effort, the monitoring of
forest regeneration, deer population surveys, and deer population growth projections. The
approximate number of deer to be removed would be defined by the difference between the
estimated deer population density and the initial density goal selected (e.g., 20–25 deer per square
mile). This density goal would be achieved within two years, after which annual removal objectives
would be based on the number of deer remaining in the population after each year’s removal
actions and factoring in an annual growth rate in order to maintain the population at the target
level. This process of determining the number of deer to be removed would be repeated each year.
A primary objective of this plan is to achieve the successful regeneration of vegetation at the
Seashore. Thus, vegetation monitoring results would be the key parameter for determining success,
and not deer density. If monitoring indicated that vegetation was not regenerating, management
actions would be adjusted. The following are examples of how this adaptive management approach
could be implemented based on different outcomes:








If vegetation regeneration is observed prior to meeting the initial deer density goal, the
initial deer density target may be adjusted upward to the density that would still allow
regeneration to occur.
If the initial deer density goal of 20–25 deer per square mile was not reached within the first
six years of the plan, additional efforts may be made to reach the desired density through
the use of other methods of removal, such as increasing the use of capture and euthanasia in
areas where sharpshooting was not effective.
If vegetation regeneration proved to be insufficient within eight to 10 years after the initial
deer density goal was reached, then the deer density goal could be lowered by five
additional deer per square mile, with a 6-year monitoring period before further reductions
were made in density goals.
In addition, if insufficient vegetation regeneration occurred after the deer density goal was
reached, methods and protocols would be reviewed to identify the variables that were
limiting expected results, and the methods used may be adjusted as necessary to correct for
such factors.

Reproductive Control
Using alternative D as an example, reproductive control via a chemical reproductive control agent
is one of the proposed measures to maintain the deer density once the target density was reached
via direct reduction. The Seashore has gained knowledge and experience at controlling deer
numbers using contraception from a multiyear study on the Fire Island. However, questions
remain regarding its effectiveness as a tool for long-term management of deer at the Seashore. As
the need for deer management methods increases, additional agents could be developed and tested
57

CHAPTER 2: ALTERNATIVES

for reproductive control on free-ranging deer. The Seashore could review the science at that time
to determine if other agents are appropriate for the Seashore. The size, scale, and location of the
application would depend on the specifications and efficacy of the drug. Furthermore, success of
reproductive control using a contraceptive agent is dependent on the Seashore’s methods and skill
to capture animals for administering the chemical agent. The Seashore may find that modifications
in capturing techniques would be needed to increase success.

Implementing Elements of the Plan/EIS
A number of the elements of the plan/EIS are based on recent vegetation monitoring, the current
deer density at the Seashore, existing technology, and knowledge of deer population dynamics. As
the plan/EIS is implemented, it is assumed that knowledge and experience with these issues would
increase at the Seashore, within the state, and across the National Park Service. Improved
knowledge and experience may result in adjustments being made to the timing of direct reduction,
the implementation of reproductive controls, or any of the other elements included in the plan/EIS.
Changes in timing would be made in cooperation with the state and only when there was scientific
evidence to support such an action.

ALTERNATIVE ELEMENTS CONSIDERED BUT DISMISSED
The following alternative elements were considered but dismissed from further detailed analysis as
explained below.

CAPTURE AND RELOCATION OFF OF FIRE ISLAND
Live-capture and relocation as an alternative may have limited success in controlling a small,
isolated population, or in removing animals from one area to augment populations in other areas
where the deer population is below desired levels (Coffey and Johnston 1997). Whereas
translocation of deer on the same property would be allowed by New York State, state regulations
do not support capture and relocation of white-tailed deer between separate land parcels within
the state. Therefore, capture of deer on Fire Island for relocation on Long Island was dismissed as a
management option.

REVERSING DEER BEHAVIOR TO REDUCE
UNDESIRABLE HUMAN-DEER INTERACTIONS
The science team evaluated potential actions that could possibly reverse the behavior of those deer
most habituated to the human presence (i.e., aversive conditioning) in an effort to reduce
undesirable human-deer interactions. To change actual deer behavior, scientists believe that deer
would need to have dramatic negative experiences in order to break their habituation (Stankowich
2008). Suggested actions were discussed, such as cues of predators, hunting, dispersal of negative
scents, visual or audible devices, or the use of dogs to chase deer, but these actions are impractical
on private lands within the Fire Island communities. Scientists believe direct negative human
interactions that provide deer the fear of harm, termed as “hazing,” would be the only approach
that may change deer behavior, but the likelihood of success is very low in the scientists’ opinion.
Deer movements or behavioral patterns are difficult to modify once they have been established
(DeNicola et al. 2000). Furthermore, hazing would need to be consistent, around the clock, and
perpetual, which is problematic because it would require participation by all humans, even nonSeashore individuals, which is unrealistic as part of a NPS deer management plan. For these
reasons, aversive conditioning of deer at the Seashore was dismissed from further consideration.
58

Alternative Elements Considered but Dismissed

AREA-SPECIFIC TARGET DEER DENSITIES
Public comments were received during the review of the draft plan/EIS suggesting the National
Park Service should use area-specific deer density targets instead of an island-wide target. The
science team initially developed varying target deer densities for forest regeneration within
different areas of the Seashore. However, this idea was dismissed from further consideration by the
interdisciplinary team which instead opted to use a target deer density of 20 deer per square mile,
the highest recommended density in the science team’s various target ranges, because of the lack of
site-specific information available for how the lowered deer density would affect Seashore
resources. The Seashore-wide target density was intended to balance anticipated benefits
associated with a reduced deer population with consideration for available resources and the cost
of implementation. The National Park Service could establish area-specific targets for use in the
future, if desired, but such a change could be subject to additional environmental compliance.

SURGICAL STERILIZATION
Surgical sterilization of females is an effective method of controlling reproduction and has been
used extensively in domestic animal medicine. However, implementation requires capture, general
anesthesia, and surgery conducted by a veterinarian, which is generally considered labor intensive
and costly (Boulanger, et al. 2012) and calls into question the long-term sustainability of
sterilization as a wildlife management tool, except under very limited circumstances. Boulanger and
others (2012) note that surgical sterilization is a costly but effective technique for reducing
suburban deer herds if 80% or more of the female deer in a population are sterilized and that
proportion is maintained over time. Overall success was greatest for closed populations. Only in
rare circumstances is physical sterilization reversible. At this time these techniques are still in the
experimental stages and the long-term ecological effects of permanent sterilization in a mostly
closed deer population are unknown. At this time the potential negative side-effects such as
limiting the ability of natural selection pressures to act on the population, consequences of altering
reproductive and social behaviors, and altering demographic structure of the population are not
fully understood and require further investigation before implementation of this as a management
technique. This option would involve administering a tranquilizing agent to female deer via dart by
qualified personnel. Once the tranquilizing agent had taken effect, surgery in the field would be
performed by a qualified veterinarian to remove or disconnect select reproductive organs, affecting
permanent infertility. Overall, this option would take a substantial amount of time per deer. Based
on these reasons, surgical reproductive control was dismissed as a management option.
Depending on the method of sterilization, this procedure may have behavioral effects on both male
and female deer. If gonads are removed, then the source of important reproductive hormones
would be removed. This is likely to change deer social interactions. If gonads are not removed,
females would continue to ovulate and show behavioral signs of estrus and consequently may
extend the breeding season.
There is a general understanding in white-tailed deer biology that managing the female component
of the population is more important than managing the male component. Based on the
polygamous breeding behavior of white-tailed deer, treating males with reproductive control (in
this case, surgical sterilzation), would be ineffective when the goal is population management
(Warren 2000; Garrott and Siniff 1992).
The potential use of surgical sterilization in combination with other deer population management
actions was also reviewed. Discussion focused on the potential number of deer that would require
treatment; the length of time required to achieve the deer density goal if implemented in
59

CHAPTER 2: ALTERNATIVES

combination with direct reduction; mortality of treated females; available research on population
level effects particularly for large, free-ranging deer populations; baseline data on Seashore deer
required to fully develop a combined alternative involving surgical sterilization; and potential
implications of using a nonreversible management action. Surgical reproductive control was
dismissed as an element of a combined alternative because there is little available research on
population level effects. Therefore, the use of an irreversible management action based on
population parameters that could potentially change greatly in the future was not recommended.

SUPPLEMENTAL FEEDING
Providing supplemental food to deer is often suggested as a way of reducing damage to natural or
ornamental vegetation. However, the NPS Management Policies 2006, section 4.4.1, “General
Principles for Managing Biological Resources,” and section 4.4.2, “Management of Native Plants
and Animals,” are aimed at allowing natural processes to occur whenever possible (NPS 2006a) and
would not support supplemental feeding. For this reason, the use of supplemental feeding was
dismissed as a management option.

PREDATOR REINTRODUCTION
Relationships between predators and prey are complex, and the impact of predators on herbivore
populations is variable (McCullough 1979). Coyotes (Canis latrans) are deer predators present
throughout much of North America but are currently not found in or near the Seashore. However,
this species appears to be opportunistic, taking advantage of specific periods of deer vulnerability
and has not demonstrated a consistent ability to control deer populations. Even though coyote
populations have increased and the coyote’s range has expanded over the past 20 years, both deer
and coyote populations have increased simultaneously in many areas (NYS-DEC and CCE 1991).
Biologists believe that coyotes are partly responsible for declining deer numbers in some areas, but
changes in deer populations in other areas appear unrelated to coyote density. Coyotes hunt
individually and are territorial, so large deer are generally not taken by individual coyotes.
Wolves are efficient deer predators, but they have been eliminated from much of the United States.
Introducing wolves to the Seashore is not feasible due to a lack of suitable habitat. Wolves have
home ranges averaging 30 square miles when deer are the primary prey (Mech 1990), which is
much larger than the Seashore’s 8.8 square miles. Also, most of the Seashore is surrounded by, or
includes, an urban or suburban environment, in particular at the William Floyd Estate and in the
Fire Island communities, making it impractical for predators such as wolves or coyotes to be
reintroduced. There are issues with possible adverse effects on residents, especially the safety of
pets and children.
Due to reasons described above relating to effectiveness, habitat limitations, and human safety
concerns, the use of predators to manage the deer population was dismissed from further analysis.

REPELLENTS, PLANTINGS, AND OTHER DETERRENTS
Chemical repellents and the selection of plants that are not palatable to deer are good options for
individual homeowners to discourage deer from destroying residential yards and gardens. These
repellents can be sprayed on or attached to nearby vegetation, thus protecting individual plants or
larger areas (Coffey and Johnston 1997). However, repellents are removed by rainfall, requiring
repeated applications. At high deer densities, repellents may be completely ineffective (Maryland
DNR 2002). Therefore, it would be impractical to effectively manage deer through the use of
repellents in a large park setting. Visual and sound deterrents also are available to scare deer away
60

Consistency with Sections 101(b) and 102(1)
of the National Environmental Policy Act

from areas (API 2000). However, visual and sound deterrents and planting of unpalatable plants
would be impractical in a large park setting and could have impacts on visitor experience. Therefore,
using repellents, select plantings, and other deterrents was dismissed as a management option.

CONSISTENCY WITH SECTIONS 101(B) AND 102(1)
OF THE NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT
Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations (40 CFR 1500.2) require that the EIS include
an analysis of how each alternative meets or achieves the purposes of NEPA, as stated in sections
101(b) and 102(1). This section describes how each of the alternatives under consideration in this
plan/EIS meets or achieves these policies.
1. Fulfill the responsibilities of each generation as trustee of the environment for succeeding
generations.
2. Ensure for all Americans safe, healthful, productive, and esthetically and culturally pleasing
surroundings.
3. Attain the widest range of beneficial uses of the environment without degradation, risk of
health or safety, or other undesirable and unintended consequences.
4. Preserve important historic, cultural, and natural aspects of our national heritage and
maintain, wherever possible, an environment that supports diversity and variety of
individual choice.
5. Achieve a balance between population and resource use that would permit high standards
of living and a wide sharing of life’s amenities.
6. Enhance the quality of renewable resources and approach the maximum attainable
recycling of depletable resources.

ALTERNATIVE A (NO ACTION)
Alternative A would meet the purpose of NEPA to some extent because limited protection of
certain rare species and habitats would be continued. Under alternative A, the Seashore would
continue to attain a wide array of beneficial uses (criterion 3), although there would be continued
degradation of natural and cultural resources. Damage to vegetation, unique vegetation
communities, and special-status plant species; white-tailed deer population; other wildlife and
wildlife habitat; wilderness; cultural landscapes; Fire Island communities and adjacent landowners;
public health and safety; and Seashore operations would continue, as a result of excessive browsing
by high numbers of deer. The continued degradation of natural features and cultural landscapes
would not maintain a balance between the deer population and the surrounding resources
(criterion 5). Additionally, this alternative would neither fulfill the responsibilities of each
generation as the trustee of the environment for succeeding generations nor preserve important
aspects of our national heritage (criteria 1 and 4, respectively), because of the degradation of
natural features and cultural landscapes. Alternative A would not enhance the quality of renewable
vegetation resources (criterion 6). The expected adverse impacts would not ensure healthful,
productive, or esthetically pleasing surroundings (criterion 2).

ALTERNATIVE B
This alternative would meet some of the criteria within the life of the plan, primarily in the latter
years, as fencing and reproductive controls took effect. Members of the planning team noted that the
fencing would protect part of the environment without requiring the reduction of the deer
population. However, it would provide only limited direct protection for vegetation, unique
61

CHAPTER 2: ALTERNATIVES

vegetation communities, and special-status species. This alternative would also rely heavily on a
technology (fertility control) that might not be available for a number of years. The gradual progress
this alternative provides would not fully achieve all six criteria. In particular, the exclosures would
detract from esthetics of the cultural landscapes (criterion 2), and reproductive control methods
could have other unintended consequences. The installation and movement of fencing could result in
additional damage of resources (e.g., wetlands), an undesirable consequence (criterion 3). Alternative
B also raises concern about unintended consequences (criterion 3) because it would rely on
technology (fertility control) that has not been proven in free-ranging deer as a population
management tool. Fencing would not limit the choices available to the public (criterion 4) because
access to the William Floyd Estate and to the trails within the Sunken Forest would be provided
through gates in the fences. The lack of protection for a large percentage of the Seashore, and the
time it would take any reproductive control to be effective, would mean that succeeding generations
might not see desired results for some time (criterion 1). Incorporating adaptive management
principles would help achieve some balance between population and resource use (criterion 5), but
the limited history of reproductive control success and the limits on how much vegetation would be
included in exclosures means that it would not be possible to completely approach the maximum
attainable recycling of resources (criterion 6).

ALTERNATIVE C
Alternative C would succeed in meeting all of the criteria within the life of the plan. By immediately
reducing deer browsing pressure, this alternative would allow vegetation in the Seashore to
regenerate for the benefit of future generations faster than alternative B (criterion 1). The
immediate reduction in the deer population and subsequent improvements in the natural
environment would provide a great deal of benefit. There would be some safety concerns
associated with direct reduction methods used to implement alternative C; however, by
implementing proper controls, these concerns could be minimized. The result would be safer
conditions throughout the Seashore and Fire Island communities because of lower incidence of
human-deer interactions. However, the small-scale fencing would detract from esthetics of the
cultural landscapes (criterion 2). Alternative C would require temporary closures of some areas of
the Seashore during direct reduction implementation, which would limit the use of these areas.
However, these closures would occur at times and places that are not high visitation periods and
would take place to maximize public safety. This alternative would avoid undesirable conditions by
immediately reducing deer browsing. Alternative C would avoid unintended consequences
associated with direct reduction actions through implementing regular Seashore closures,
scheduled closures of certain areas of the Seashore, and public outreach and communication
(criterion 3). The closures within the Seashore would limit individual choice, but only for limited
periods. These closures would allow for the reduction of the deer population, which would protect
the Seashore’s natural and cultural resources and provide greater choices in the future (criterion 4).
This alternative also would achieve a balance between the deer population and the surrounding
Seashore resources (criterion 5). Finally, by immediately reducing the deer browsing pressure and
promoting forest regeneration, this alternative would enhance the quality of renewable resources
(criterion 6).

ALTERNATIVE D
Alternative D is similar to alternative C in the extent to which it would meet the intent of NEPA. The
evaluation of these alternatives shows that both would fulfill the responsibilities of each generation
as a trustee of the environment for succeeding generations (criterion 1) to a large degree because
both would immediately reduce deer numbers, thereby reducing browsing pressure and promoting
regeneration. The exclosures would detract from esthetics of the cultural landscapes (criterion 2).
62

NPS Preferred Alternative

Both alternatives also would help achieve a balance between population and resource use (criterion
5). Although they may approach the criteria in a slightly different manner, both alternatives would
approach the maximum attainable regeneration of depletable resources (i.e., vegetation) by reducing
and maintaining the deer population density (criterion 6). Implementation of alternative D would
avoid unintended consequences (criterion 3) associated with direct reduction actions through
implementing regular Seashore closures, scheduled closures of certain areas of the Seashore, and
public outreach and communication, and could cause some concern about unintended
consequences because it would use technology that has not been proven in free-ranging deer as a
maintenance tool. Risks to health and safety (criterion 3) associated with the reproductive control
method would be less than alternative B because fewer deer would be treated with a fertility control
agent. Although the planning team recognized the uncertainties associated with reproductive control
agents, it was recognized that this technology is developing rapidly and would provide additional
information in the near future. Any safety concerns would be reduced through proper safety
controls. Finally, alternatives C and D both would preserve important historic, cultural, and natural
aspects of the Seashore in the long term (criterion 4), because the smaller deer population would
reduce browse pressure on vegetation in natural areas, the Fire Island Wilderness, and the cultural
landscapes at William Floyd Estate.

ENVIRONMENTALLY PREFERABLE ALTERNATIVE
In accordance with the Director’s Order 12 Handbook, the National Park Service identifies the
environmentally preferable alternative in its NEPA documents for public review and comment
(section 4.5 E[9]). The environmentally preferable alternative is the alternative that causes the least
damage to the biological and physical environment and best protects, preserves, and enhances
historical, cultural, and natural resources. The environmentally preferable alternative is identified
upon consideration and weighing by the responsible official of long-term environmental impacts
against short-term impacts in evaluating what is the best protection of these resources. In some
situations, such as when different alternatives impact different resources to different degrees, there
may be more than one environmentally preferable alternative (43 CFR 46.30).
Based on the analysis of environmental consequences of each alternative presented in chapter 4
and summarized in table 9 below, alternative C has been identified as the environmentally
preferable alternative because it is the alternative that would best protect the biological and
physical environment by ensuring an immediate reduction in deer population, thereby reducing
browsing pressure and promoting regeneration over the life of the plan. Alternatives C and D
would best protect, preserve, and enhance the historic, cultural, and natural processes that support
the Seashore’s cultural landscape and vegetation through various management options to maintain
low deer numbers. Although alternatives C and D are very close in meeting the goal that identifies
the environmentally preferable alternative, alternative C was identified as the environmentally
preferable alternative primarily because it would more naturally simulate top-down control of wild
ungulate populations.

NPS PREFERRED ALTERNATIVE
The preferred alternative is the alternative which would fulfill the National Park Service’s statutory
mission and responsibilities (CEQ 1981). The preferred alternative was identified with
consideration to the likelihood of meeting the objectives, flexibility and management options
available for use in order to meet the objectives, timeframe in which desired conditions would be
met, public concerns regarding safety and resource management, and feasibility of implementing
the plan given uncertain economic conditions. The NPS has identified alternative D as the agency
63

CHAPTER 2: ALTERNATIVES

preferred alternative because immediate reduction of the deer population would provide the
greatest protection of the Seashore’s resources while imposing a minimal risk during
implementation of carefully managed direct reduction actions. Additionally, under this alternative,
Seashore managers would have the widest range of options available for the purpose of managing
both deer browse and the deer population levels (i.e., fencing, direct reduction, and/or fertility
control). Having this flexibility would allow Seashore managers to implement whichever methods
best balance resource protection with public safety and the level of effort needed for Seashore staff
to implement the management activities.

HOW ALTERNATIVES MEET OBJECTIVES
As stated in chapter 1, all action alternatives selected for analysis meet all objectives to a large
degree. The action alternatives must also address the stated purpose of taking action and resolve
the need for action; therefore, the alternatives were individually assessed in light of how well they
would meet the objectives for this plan/EIS, which are listed in chapter 1 of this document.
Alternatives that did not meet the objectives were not analyzed further (see the section “Alternative
Elements Considered but Dismissed” previously in this chapter).
Table 4 compares the alternatives by summarizing the elements being considered, while table 8
compares how each of the alternatives described in this chapter would meet the plan objectives.
“Chapter 4: Environmental Consequences” describes the effects of each alternative on each impact
topic. These impacts are summarized in table 9. The significance of the impacts is described in
chapter 4 and summarized in table ES-1.

How Alternatives Meet Objectives

TABLE 8. HOW ALTERNATIVES MEET OBJECTIVES
Objective
Manage a viable white-tailed deer population in
the Seashore that is supportive of the other
objectives for this plan/EIS.

Alternative A (No Action)
Does not meet the objective. No actions would be
taken to manage the white-tailed deer
population.

vegetation.

Does not meet the objective. No reduction in deer
browsing pressure, resulting in inhibition of
natural regeneration.

Protect special-status species/vegetation
communities and their habitat from high levels of
deer browsing.

currently fences individual special-status species
plants when discovered, no plan would be
implemented to reduce the deer browsing
pressures from the communities as a whole.

Work collaboratively with other land management
agencies on issues associated with abundance,
distribution, and behavior of white-tailed deer at
the Seashore.

Does not meet objective. While the Seashore

land management agencies, there would be no
comprehensive plan in place to address issues
associated with abundance, distribution, and
behavior of white-tailed deer at the Seashore.

Improve public understanding of the issues such
as human-deer interactions, the impact of whitetailed deer on the cultural and natural resources
of the Seashore, and tick-borne diseases
throughout the Seashore, including the William
Floyd Estate.

Does not meet objective. The Seashore would not
implement a comprehensive
education/interpretation effort to improve public
understanding of the issues such as human-deer
interactions, the impact of white-tailed deer on
the cultural and natural resources of the
Seashore, and tick-borne diseases throughout the
Seashore, including the William Floyd Estate.
Partially meets the objective. The Seashore would

regarding the relationship between deer browsing
and plant communities at Fire Island National
Seashore to improve management decisions.

Alternative B
Meets the objective. Manages the white-tailed
deer population in a way that would support
other objectives following a relatively long period
(approximately 13 years) to achieve deer density
targets.
Meets the objective. Fencing of the Sunken Forest
and rotational fencing at the William Floyd Estate
would offer immediate protection from deer
browsing pressures in those exclosures. Deer
browsing pressures would be reduced throughout
the rest of the Seashore, promoting natural
regeneration after the initial 13 years of fertility
treatment.
Meets the objective. Fencing of the Sunken Forest
and rotational fencing at the William Floyd Estate
would offer immediate protection for specialstatus species/vegetation communities and their
habitat from deer browsing pressures in those
exclosures. Deer browsing pressures would be
reduced throughout the rest of the Seashore,
promoting natural regeneration after the initial 13
years of fertility treatment.
Meets the objective. Seashore staff would
implement enhanced education/interpretation
efforts as part of a comprehensive deer
management plan in collaboration with other
land management to address issues associated
with abundance, distribution, and behavior of
white-tailed deer at the Seashore.
Meets the objective. Seashore staff would
implement enhanced education/interpretation
efforts to improve public understanding of the
issues such as human-deer interactions, the
impact of white-tailed deer on the cultural and
natural resources of the Seashore, and tick-borne
diseases throughout the Seashore, including the
William Floyd Estate.
Meets the objective. Current deer and plant
monitoring efforts would be enhanced as part of
the plan to expand the knowledge base regarding
the relationship between deer browsing and plant
communities at the Seashore.

CHAPTER 2: ALTERNATIVES

TABLE 8. HOW ALTERNATIVES MEET OBJECTIVES (CONT’D)
Objective
Within the Sunken Forest, maintain the character
of the globally rare maritime holly forest by
creating conditions for the regeneration of key
canopy constituent tree species and a reasonable
representation (as defined in the desired
conditions description below) of herbs and shrubs
that made up the Sunken Forest’s vegetative
composition when the Seashore was established.
Reduce the potential for undesirable human-deer
interactions both within the Fire Island
communities and at other developed areas of the
Seashore.

Manage deer browse to allow for the restoration
and preservation of the cultural landscape of the
William Floyd Estate and for the regeneration of
the forest within the lower acreage of the William
Floyd Estate.

Alternative A (No Action)
Does not meet objective. Deer browse pressure
would continue to inhibit regeneration of
vegetation within the Sunken Forest’s globally
rare maritime holly forest.

Alternative B
Meets the objective. Deer would be excluded
from the Sunken Forest to eliminate browsing
pressure that could inhibit regeneration of
vegetation within the Sunken Forest’s globally
rare maritime holly forest.

Alternative C
Meets the objective. Same as alternative B.

Alternative D (NPS Preferred)
Meets the objective. Same as alternative B.

Does not meet objective. No comprehensive
program would be implemented to reduce the
potential for undesirable human-deer interactions
within Fire Island communities and at other
developed areas of the Seashore.

Meets the objective. The Seashore would reduce
the potential for undesirable human-deer
interactions through the implementation of
enhanced education/interpretation within the Fire
Island communities and at other developed areas
of the Seashore. Additionally, the Seashore would
reduce this potential through reduction of the
local deer population over approximately 13
years.
Meets the objective. Deer browse would be
reduced immediately through the use of fencing
and would otherwise be reduced over
approximately 13 years, allowing for the
restoration and preservation of the cultural
landscape of the William Floyd Estate and for the
regeneration of the forest within the lower
acreage of the William Floyd Estate.

Meets the objective. Same as alternative B, except
that the deer population would be reduced more
rapidly, over a 2-year period.

Meets the objective. Same as alternative C.

Meets the objective. Deer browse would be
rapidly reduced over a 2-year period, allowing for
the restoration and preservation of the cultural
landscape of the William Floyd Estate and for the
regeneration of the forest within the lower

Meets the objective. Same as alternative C.

Does not meet the objective. The current level of
deer management does not reduce deer browse
at sufficient levels to allow for the restoration and
preservation of the cultural landscape of the
William Floyd Estate and for the regeneration of
the forest within the lower acreage of the William
Floyd Estate.

Impact Topic
Vegetation,
Unique
Vegetation
Community,
and Specialstatus Species

Alternative A (No-action)
Fire Island Natural Areas
 Existing deer population would not be reduced,
causing continued high levels of deer browse islandwide.
 Browsing pressure would lead to a lack of forest
regeneration, low survivorship of herbaceous plants,
and the eventual dominance of unpreferred and
browse-resistant plants, several of which are
nonnative.
 Heavy deer browse would continue to alter understory
species composition and densities within maritime
forests.
Sunken Forest
 Species composition would change over time to
species not preferred by deer, such as black cherry.
Eventual loss of oak-hickory community type could
occur over time.
 Native seedlings positioned to replace canopy stems
would continue to be impacted by heavy deer browse.
 Native plant constituents present in the 1960s would
be locally extirpated within the Sunken Forest.
 Goals for managing vegetation at the Sunken Forest as
mandated by enabling legislation would not be
achieved over the long term.
William Floyd Estate
 Continued high level of deer browse would impact
forests’ ability to regenerate native overstory species
due to understory shifts in species composition caused
by deer browse.
Special-status Species
 Special status species susceptible to deer browse and
trampling with no control of deer numbers.
 Continued seasonal fencing of special-status species
from deer would benefit these plants

Alternative B
Fire Island Natural Areas
 Gradual reduction in deer density across the island would
reduce browsing pressures on native vegetation. Reduction
to initial target density would require up to 13 years.
 Vegetation is expected to recover from current browse
levels approximately 8 to 10 years following deer
population reduction. Therefore, vegetation recovery would
require up to 23 years to be fully realized.
 If an acceptable fertility control agent is not available for up
to 10 years following implementation of this plan,
vegetation recovery would require up to 33 years to be
fully realized.
 Reduced deer browse on understory herbs, shrubs, and
seedlings in maritime forests.
 Translocation of deer may cause a localized increase in deer
browse of native vegetation at the Fire Island Wilderness
until the deer density is lowered.

Alternative C
Fire Island Natural Areas
 Rapid reduction in deer density across the island
would reduce browsing pressures on native
vegetation. Reduction to initial target density
would require approximately two years.
 As under alternative B, vegetation is expected to
recover from current browse levels approximately
8 to 10 years following deer population
reduction. Therefore, under alternative C,
vegetation recovery would require up to 12 years
to be fully realized.
 Other impacts on vegetation would be the same
as described under alternative B but on the
accelerated timeline described above.

Sunken Forest
 Deer exclusion from this area would remove deer browsing
pressures native seedlings, allowing for recovery of
understory vegetation.
 Vegetation would be removed and/or relocated during
installation of fencing, totaling 7,130 linear feet or 1.31
acres.
 Vegetation could be trampled during the deer drive to
remove deer from the fenced area.
 Vegetation monitoring and implementation of adaptive
management would benefit vegetation due to growing
understanding and knowledge of the rare holly maritime
forest ecosystem.

William Floyd Estate
 Small-scale fencing/protective barriers around
target species would protect select vegetation.
 Understory forest vegetation restoration would
occur due to the rapid deer reduction described
above.

William Floyd Estate
 Vegetation would be removed and/or relocated during
installation of fencing (rotational fencing and core fencing)
totaling 30,300 linear feet or 5.6 acres.
 Forest understory vegetation would recover with exclosure
fencing.
 Exclusion of deer from fenced areas would cause higher
browse pressure in surrounding areas until the overall deer
density is reduced.
Special-status Species
 Translocation of deer to the Fire Island Wilderness may
cause a localized increase in deer browse of special-status
species until the deer density is lowered; however, impacts
would continue to be mitigated through use of fencing.

Alternative D

Fire Island Natural Areas
 Same vegetation recovery as described under
alternative C, with deer density reduced along the
same timeline.
Sunken Forest
 Same as alternative B.
William Floyd Estate
 Deer would be excluded from this historic core, as
described under alternative B.
 Rapid deer reduction would provide lower browsing
pressure and recovery of understory forest vegetation,
even in areas where deer exclusion fencing is not
installed.
Special-status Species
 Same as alternative B.

Alternative A (No-action)

White-tailed
Deer
Population



Under alternative A, no actions would occur related to
deer population management at the Seashore that
would require encroachments and/or impacts on
wetlands and their functions.



If deer numbers grow higher with no mechanisms for
population control, increased competition for
resources could result in malnutrition resulting in
weight loss, lower reproductive rates, and higher fawn
mortality.
Deer would continue to be at risk of ingestion of
harmful substances from foraging in garbage.

Alternative B
 Temporary disturbance to 273 linear feet of wetland
vegetation during removal of vegetation needed for
construction
 Temporary disturbance from sidecasted soil from post
holes
 Temporary disturbance to wetland vegetation in later
years during fence maintenance.
 Permanent displacement of vegetation where displaced
by the fence.
 Wetland functions would remain intact.
 The white-tailed deer population density would be
reduced through use of an acceptable fertility control
agent and would then be maintained at that density
using the same method. The population would decline
gradually over approximately 13 years as it reached the
target density.
 Across the Seashore, fewer deer would be competing
for resources, resulting in overall better population
fitness.
 The population may experience unintended mortality of
deer during handling needed for tagging deer treated
with a fertility agent.
 The population may experience behavioral changes due
to application of a fertility control agent.
–
Late season fawning possible by treated females.
–
Longer rutting period causing more energy
exertion by adults, particularly bucks.
 In areas surrounding newly constructed deer exclosures,
deer density would increase, resulting in increased
competition for resources, until density is reduced
through use of fertility control.
 The population may lose access to artificial food
supplies with better refuse management and public
information provided in the Fire Island communities and
other lands adjacent to the Seashore.



The white-tailed deer population density would be
reduced through a variety of direct reduction
methods, including sharpshooting, capture and
euthanasia, and hunting, and would then be
maintained at that density using the same methods.
The population would decline rapidly over
approximately two years as it reached the target
density.
As under alternative B, reduced deer numbers would
result in improved habitat quality from lower
browsing pressure and better deer population fitness.
However, this fitness improvement would be realized
more quickly that under alternative B.
Deer exclosures would have the same localized
increase in population density as described under
alternative B; however, the density would be reduced
much more rapidly.
Same loss of artificial food supplies as under
alternative B.




The white-tailed deer population density would be
reduced using the same methods described under
alternative D, with the same impacts taking place
along the same timeline; however, the Seashore would
consider use of an acceptable fertility control agent in
addition to or in place of the direct reduction methods
for population density maintenance.
Should the Seashore implement use of a fertility
control agent, the related impacts described under
alternative B would apply.
Same loss of artificial food supplies as under
alternative B.

How Alternatives Meet Objectives

TABLE 9. SUMMARY OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES (CONT’D)
Impact Topic
Other Wildlife
and Wildlife
Habitat

Alternative A (No-action)
 Deer overbrowsing would continue to negatively
impact food and shelter availability for other wildlife
species. Forests species such as songbirds, insects, and
small mammals would be particularly impacted by
competition for remaining habitat.
 Residents of Fire Island communities may not
understand the impacts of the plants they use for
landscaping have. They may continue to propagate
nonnative invasive species adjacent to natural areas,
which could decrease habitat quality within the
Seashore.

Wilderness

Fire Island Wilderness
 Untrammeled, natural, and undeveloped qualities of
wilderness diminished somewhat by existing
management and monitoring activities; however,
these actions would move the Fire Island Wilderness
ecosystem towards desired conditions in the long
term.
 Fire Island Wilderness would continue to offer
opportunities for solitude and a primitive and
unconfined type of recreation.
 The natural quality of the wilderness character could
be diminished if deer density reaches a point where
overgrazing causes an ecosystem imbalance.

Cultural
Landscapes
(William Floyd
Estate)

Historic Core
 Loss of character-defining features/landscape plantings
would continue.
 The Seashore would remain unable to replant/maintain
the gardens due to ongoing high levels of deer
browsing.
 Small-scale fencing within the historic core would
continue to impose a non-character defining feature
within the cultural landscape.
 Lack of historically present vegetation inhibits visitor
understanding of the cultural landscape.
Lower Acreage
 The forest/field pattern may be altered over time due
to the potential for forest regeneration to be inhibited
by deer browse.

Alternative B
 Lower deer density would reduce deer browse of
vegetation that provides food and shelter for other
species. Forests species such as songbirds, insects, and
small mammals would be particularly benefited by
removal of competition for and by recovery of habitat.
Deer density would be reduced gradually, reaching a
density that would allow vegetation recover in
approximately 13 years.
 Where exclosures are installed, wildlife would benefit
from immediate removal of deer browsing; however,
competition for resources and habitat alteration would
continue at increased levels outside the exclosure until
the deer density is effectively reduced.
 Wildlife would be disturbed during fencing installation,
and fencing may disrupt natural movement patterns of
some other wildlife species.
 A list of non-native invasive species to avoid along with
a list of species encouraged to plant would be provided
to the residents of Fire Island communities. This could
help reduce the propagule pressure and spread of non­
native invasive species to adjacent natural areas.
Fire Island Wilderness
 Same impacts from ongoing resource management as
described under alternative A.
 Untrammeled quality and opportunities for solitude
would be diminished by use of fertility control (i.e., use
of a chemical agent to alter deer biology).
 Opportunities for solitude could be further diminished
by marking of translocated deer.

Alternative C
 Impacts would be the same as under alternative B
with the following differences:
–
Deer density would be reduced more quickly,
reaching a density anticipated to allow vegetation
recovery over the course of approximately 2
years.
–
Less exclusion fencing would be installed, and
where fencing is installed, the deer density
outside it would be reduced rapidly (over
approximately 2 years).

Alternative D

Fire Island Wilderness
 Same impacts from ongoing resource management as
described under alternative A.
 Opportunities for solitude would be diminished for
non-hunting visitors in the Fire Island Wilderness, but
opportunities for solitude for hunters would be
expanded by the establishment of deer hunting in Fire
Island Wilderness.

Historic Core
 Exclusion fencing within the historic core would add a
non-character defining feature within the cultural
landscape, altering views into and out of the historic
core slightly; however, the fencing would be
camouflaged within the tree line to minimize visual
intrusion to the extent possible.
 Character-defining vegetation could be replanted (trees
and garden) and would be able to flourish within the
deer exclosure. This would also allow for enhanced
visitor understanding of the cultural landscape.
 The west garden would be replanted and would
flourish most as compared to the other alternatives.

Historic Core
 Small-scale fencing may allow the enhancement of
select plantings within the historic core for visitor
interpretation purposes, but the enhanced plantings
would necessarily be limited in scope. Gardens
outside of fencing would remain vulnerable to deer
browse, albeit at lower levels than current conditions.
 Small-scale fencing within the historic core would
continue to impose a non-character defining feature
within the cultural landscape.

Fire Island Wilderness
 Same impacts from ongoing resource management as
described under alternative A.
 Impacts would be similar to both alternatives B and C
because this alternative includes use a combination of
population control methods:
–
Untrammeled quality and opportunities for
solitude would be diminished by use of fertility
control (i.e., use of a chemical agent to alter deer
biology)
–
Opportunities for solitude would be diminished
for non-hunting visitors in the Fire Island
Wilderness, but opportunities for solitude for
hunters would be expanded by the establishment
of deer hunting in Fire Island Wilderness.
Historic Core
 Same as alternative B.

Lower Acreage
 Forested vegetation to recover and regenerate through
use of two phases of rotational fencing. The forest/field
patterns would be maintained.

69

Lower Acreage
 Once the deer population density decreases, the
lower acreage forested vegetation could recover and
regenerate. Over long-term, forest/field patterns
maintained (a beneficial impact). This would allow
recovery of regeneration more quickly than under
alternative B.

Same as alternative C.

Lower Acreage

Impact Topic
Visitor Use
and
Experience/
Recreation

Alternative A (No-action)
 Clear presence of deer in the Seashore. Deer viewing is
frequent. Deer population could continue to grow,
making viewing opportunities more frequent. This
impact could be beneficial or adverse, depending on
preference of the visitor.
 An increase in the deer population could reduce
habitat and/or food sources for other wildlife species
(other than deer). This would reduce the viewing
potential for those other species.
 Deer are browsing vegetation at the William Floyd
Estate, affecting the cultural landscape and, therefore,
the associated visitor experience of this resources.
 Continued trampling of vegetation could reduce the
overall experience for visitors.



Public Health
and Safety




Human-deer interactions would continue because of
ongoing provision of artificial food sources, including
presence of unsecured garbage.
Deer would continue to use Fire Island communities
for foraging habitat and for shelter.
Deer would continue to browse on gardens and other
plantings within the communities.
Deer would continue to spill and/or feed from
unsecured garbage cans.

Deer may continue to approach humans because of
ongoing food-conditioning of deer.
Visitors would continue to be concerned over the
perceived risk of tick-borne illness.

Alternative B
 Enhanced education about deer management would
make visitors aware of why the park is taking action
and better educate them on how to avoid negative
interactions.
 Deer population would be reduced gradually, reaching
more sustainable densities in approximately 13 years
through use of fertility control.
–
Reduced opportunities to view deer could be
beneficial or adverse, depending on visitor
preferences.
–
Could enhance viewing opportunities for other
wildlife species.
 Visitors could be aware of the deer treatment activities
occurring, which could reduce their overall experience.
 Visitors would no longer have the opportunity to view
deer in the Sunken Forest, due to the exclusion of deer
by fencing.
 Fencing could intrude on existing natural viewsheds,
island-wide (including within the Sunken Forest) and at
William Floyd Estate.
 Fencing could limit visitor access to some areas,
especially during fence construction/installation;
however, visitors would retain access to the Sunken
Forest and the William Floyd Estate historic core.
 Visitors would benefit from an improved understanding
of the cultural landscape at the William Floyd Estate
due to restoration within fenced areas.
 Negative interactions would be reduced through public
education to reduce feeding of deer and properly
secure garbage.
 Reduced deer browse (decreased gradually over
approximately 13 years) would improve
condition/appearance of community vegetation.
 Reduced deer viewing opportunities may improve or
diminish community member experience, depending on
individual sentiments toward particular species.
 Targeted removal of food-conditioned deer from the
communities would reduce negative human-deer
interactions
 Reduced chance of deer approaching humans because
of educational outreach to reduce food-conditioning of
deer. Fencing of the historic core of the William Floyd
Estate would further reduce the perceived risk of tickborne illness.
 Visitors concerned over the perceived risk of tick-borne
illness would decrease due to educational outreach.
 Reduced negative human-deer interactions due to deer
population density (decreased gradually over
approximately 13 years).

70

Alternative C
 Enhanced education about deer management would
be the same as under alternative B.
 Deer population would be reduced more quickly than
under alternative B, in approximately 2 years.
Following reduction, impacts on visitor use and
experience/recreation would be the same as under
alternative B.
 Some visitors may be upset by the use of direct
reduction methods; other visitors may appreciate the
more efficient method of reduction.
 The Seashore would permit deer hunting in the
wilderness, which would provide an additional
recreational opportunity.
 Small fencing/protective barriers would remain
installed within the William Floyd Estate. The fencing
may detract from visitor experience but may allow
some restoration of vegetation that would improve
visitor understanding of the historic setting/cultural
landscape at the William Floyd Estate.
 Same impacts of fencing of the Sunken Forest as
described under alternative B.

Alternative D
 Enhanced education about deer management would
be the same as under alternative B.
 This alternative combines impacts described under
alternatives B and C. The same methods used to
quickly reduce the population under alternative B
would be used under this alternative. Fertility control
methods may be used to maintain population levels
following the initial reduction. As such, impacts would
be the same as described under those alternatives.
 Same impacts from fencing of the William Floyd Estate
and Sunken Forest, both described under alternative B.



Negative interactions would be reduced through
public education, as under alternative B.
Reduced deer browse would have the same impacts
as described under alternative B; however, these
impacts would be realized more quickly because the
deer population would be decreased more rapidly
(over approximately 2 years).



The same educational outreach as alternative B would
reduce the risk of deer approaching humans.
Reduced deer population density would have the
same impacts as described under alternative B;
however, these impacts would be realized more
quickly because the deer population would be
decreased more rapidly (over approximately 2 years)

Seashore
Operations

Alternative A (No-action)
 Seashore staff would continue to spend approximately
270–300 hours annually on deer-related community
outreach. Case Incident Reports would continue to
require approximately 185 hours annually.
 Deer monitoring would continue annually on Fire
Island in general, requiring approximately 120 hours
for three staff. Additionally, monitoring would take
place every 3 years within the Fire Island Wilderness
and at the William Floyd Estate. Monitoring in the
wilderness would require approximately 25 hours of
time from two staff every 3-year cycle. Monitoring at
the William Floyd Estate requires 25 hours from three
staff every 3-year cycle.
 Staff time related to maintenance and repair of
fencing would be limited, requiring approximately 4
hours per year at the William Floyd Estate and 32
hours (16 hours each for 2 staff) on Fire Island. The
vegetation monitoring program would continue to be
conducted every 5 years, requiring five dedicated staff
for 4 months (460 hours).

Alternative B
 Same as alternative A, with an additional 180 hours for
developing lesson plans for local schools and additional
programs/interpretation.
 Time needed for Case Incident Reports may decrease
due to a decreased deer population.
 A long-term increase in staff and budget would be
required to implement application of an acceptable
fertility control agent and maintenance of deer
exclusion fencing. Costs are uncertain at this time and
would be determined at a later date depending upon
the agent that becomes available.

71

Alternative C
 Implementation of additional education programs and
interpretation would require the same level of effort
as alternative B.
 Use of sharpshooting and hunting would require a
substantial increase in effort at the Seashore.
 The level of effort needed for maintenance of fencing
would be less than required under alternative B.

Alternative D
 Implementation of additional education programs and
interpretation would require the same level of effort as
alternative B.
 Reducing the deer population using a combination of
the methods described under alternatives B and C
would require a substantial increase in effort at the
Seashore. The costs to implement this alternative
would be similar to those described under alternative
C; however, the cost to use fertility control would be
less than described under alternative B because its use
would be limited to population maintenance (a less
intensive use than when using it as the only method of
population reduction).
 The level of effort associated with fencing would be
greater than under alternative C but less than under
alternative B.

INTRODUCTION
The “Affected Environment” chapter describes existing conditions for those elements of the
natural, cultural, and social environment that could be affected by implementation of the actions
considered in this plan/EIS for Fire Island National Seashore. Relevant impact topics were selected
based on agency and public concerns, regulatory and planning requirements, and known or
expected resource issues. The impact topics addressed in this plan/EIS are vegetation, unique
vegetation communities, and special-status plant species; wetlands; white-tailed deer population;
other wildlife and wildlife habitat; wilderness; cultural landscapes; visitor use and
experience/recreation; Fire Island communities and adjacent landowners; public health and safety;
and Seashore operations. The information provided in this chapter is used as a basis for comparing
the potential impacts of each alternative presented in “Chapter 4: Environmental Consequences.”

VEGETATION, UNIQUE VEGETATION COMMUNITIES,
AND SPECIAL-STATUS PLANT SPECIES
A description of the vegetation at the Seashore can be subdivided into community types on Fire
Island and at the William Floyd Estate located on Long Island. Barrier islands, such as Fire Island,
offer unique geomorphic and vegetative complexes driven by natural forces including tidal cycles,
salt spray, coastal winds, storm surges, overwashes, sand accretion/erosion, and topographic
modifications (Art 1976; Erenfeld 1990; Forrester, Leopold, and Art 2007). Often, the vegetation
types are arranged in a linear fashion from ocean to bay. Schulte (1965) describes the basic
landforms in simple generic terms such as dune, marsh, and forest. Forrester (2004) uses similar
broad categories in describing communities from ocean to bay such as beach, dune, swale, maritime
forest, and marsh. Vegetation on the Seashore is the product of those natural forces as well as
human influences. Human influences, such as development and sand renourishment projects,
affect species composition, abundance, and spatial patterns (Klopfer et al. 2002).

Interdunal swale in Sailors Haven (Photo Credit: VHB)

The Seashore is composed of public and private lands that include 17 private communities and
towns, Smith Point County Park, and three municipal beaches (Bellport Beach, Leja Beach/Davis
Park, and Atlantique Beach). The natural areas are prime examples of formations resulting from
sand deposition, coastal winds and storms, salt spray, and other natural forces. Anthropogenic
disturbances, artificial plantings, and the spread of invasive plant species in and around the Fire
Island communities are factors that contribute to vegetation patterns within the Seashore. The
73

CHAPTER 3: AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT

portion of Fire Island west of the Fire Island Wilderness contains the highest degree of such
human-caused vegetative influences, where nonnative or introduced species are intermixed with
undisturbed federal tracts of native vegetative communities. Sections of the federally owned land
also contain rare maritime vegetative communities that are described in more detail below. The
majority of the eastern half of the Seashore comprises natural lands associated with the Fire Island
Wilderness and Smith Point County Park. Situated on the south shore of Long Island, the William
Floyd Estate contains vegetative community types that, though typical of those on Long Island, are
dramatically different from those found on Fire Island. Figures 6 through 6e depict the vegetation
types found on Fire Island and are described in more detail below.

FIRE ISLAND COMMUNITIES
Seventeen private communities occupy 916 acres of Fire Island (NPS 2012c) and contain over 4,100
residential/vacation homes, several businesses, worship centers, and schools. Each of the Fire
Island communities has its own unique character, but in terms of vegetative cover and habitats, the
Fire Island communities all possess similar qualities. In general, houses within the Fire Island
communities occupy relatively small lots that collectively span across the entire profile of Fire
Island (oceanside primary dunes, secondary dunes, and bayside maritime forests). Native
vegetation includes species commonly found throughout the Seashore such as eastern red cedar
(Juniperus virginiana), shadblow (Amelanchier canadensis), American holly (Ilex opaca), bayberry
(Myrica pensylvanica), pitch pine (Pinus rigida), black cherry (Prunus serotina), and the nonnative
Japanese black pine (Pinus thunbergii). Landscape ornamentals are popular in the Fire Island
communities and include a host of woody and herbaceous native and nonnative species. Some
ornamentals plantings such as bamboo (Phyllostachys spp.) have escaped to become invasive
species in the area vegetation. Public boardwalks, one-lane drives, and maintained footpaths
between rows of houses provide public pathways for homeowners and visitors to move about the
communities. Many of the homeowners have installed fences along property lines and public
walkways to prevent deer from entering their properties, protecting personal landscaping and
ornamental plantings from deer browsing.

NATURAL AREAS
The first detailed vegetative mapping effort for the Seashore was completed in 1975 (McCormick
and Associates 1975). In 1999, mapping and classification of the vegetative communities for the
entire Seashore were updated using the National Vegetation Classification System (Klopfer et al.
2002) (table 10). The information provided in this section is taken primarily from the Klopfer et al.
2002 report as the most comprehensive and current of its kind. It should be noted, however, that
changes constantly occur at the barrier island as exemplified by the impacts of Hurricane Sandy in
2012, and that the expanse of any changes since the Klopfer et al. 2002 publication have yet to be
analyzed. Thus, the summary of vegetation below is based on the best available information but
should not be considered an accurate or precise description of the current conditions because this
information is not updated.
Five broadly categorized groups were identified: salt marshes, dune grasslands, dune shrublands,
interdunal swales, and forests/shrublands. Klopfer et al. (2002) further separates these groups into
27 vegetation associations, three of which are too small to map. Table 10 is a summary of the
dominant vegetative community types and a listing of the common plants found in each.

CHAPTER 3: AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT

Fire Island
The most common upland vegetative community types, each making up 15% of the total, are the
Northern Beach Grass Dune and Maritime Deciduous Scrub Forest. Northern Dune Shrubland is
the third most common type at 11%. The Northern Beach Grass Dune, Maritime Deciduous Scrub
Forest, Northern Dune Shrubland, and Low Salt Marsh account for approximately 51% of the
vegetative cover on the Seashore (Klopfer et al. 2002). When combining the Low Salt Marsh and
the High Salt Marsh cover types, salt marsh is the most dominant cover type at approximately 852
acres. The smallest vegetative community at the Seashore, 0.7 acres, is the Maritime Post Oak
Forest found on the William Floyd Estate. Some of the most common plant species at the Seashore
include American beach grass (Ammophila breviligulata), found on the foredunes of Fire Island,
and beach plum (Prunus maritima), bayberry (Myrica pensylvanica), seaside goldenrod (Solidago
sempervirens), and beach heather (Hudsonia tomentosa), commonly found on the leeward side of
the primary dunes.
The Seashore just recently began monitoring vegetation within several Maritime Forests on Fire
Island to determine potential browsing impacts of the high deer density on understory vegetation
composition (NPS 2013d).Two maritime forests were selected for the study, one located within the
Talisman area and the other at Blue Point. Preliminary data suggests that deer browsing has
affected understory species diversity and density. The dominant forest canopy at Blue Point is
shadblow (Amelanchier canadensis), black gum (Nyssa sylvatica), and sassafras (Sassafras albidum)
while the overstory at Talisman is dominated by shadblow (Amelanchier canadensis), American
holly (Ilex opaca), and various species of oak (Quercus spp.). The most common herbs and lianas
occupying the ground include Virginia creeper (Parthenocissus quinquefolia), poison ivy
(Toxicodendron radicans), and starflower (Trientalis borealis). The most common woody species
found are black huckleberry (Gaylussacia baccata), shadblow (Amelancheir canadensis), and black
cherry (Prunus serotina). The Seashore found that these two forests contain few seedlings from the
overstory canopy, and instead black cherry (Prunus serotina), a deer resistant species, dominates
the sapling and seedling layers mixed with heavy vine cover. Based on these results, the Seashore
speculated that the future canopy of Blue Point and Talisman could see reductions in the current
species mix from natural mortality and could one day be replaced by deer tolerant species such as
black cherry.

William Floyd Estate
A comprehensive vegetation study of the William Floyd Estate was performed by Clark (1986), who
found that many of the vegetative communities at the William Floyd Estate are primarily the result
of historic land uses such as farming, artificial plantings, orchards, and land clearing. Fire also
influenced vegetation at the William Floyd Estate. Overall, Clark (1986) found that “spatial and
temporal patterns in forests were determined by information on disturbance frequency, dispersal,
generation times, and rates of change in the physical environment.” Clark (1986) also found
evidence through a study of pollen and tree-ring data that tree populations are migrating upslope at
the William Floyd Estate in response to sea-level rise. Eleven broad forest, shrub, and herbaceous
vegetative community types were identified at the William Floyd Estate (see figure 6e), which
Klopfer et al. (2002) confirmed. Clark (1986), however, categorized many of the forested areas into
subgroups based on dominant species, whereas Klopfer et al. (2002) grouped most of the upland
forests into two associations: the Coastal Oak Heath Forest and Pitch Pine-Oak Forest.
Salt marsh habitat dominates the southern end of the William Floyd Estate, with salt bush (Baccharis
halimifolia) and marsh elder (Iva frutescens) along the upper marsh fringe. Open fields still remain from
the Colonial period; however, Clark (1986) recognized that successional forests have developed from

84

Vegetation, Unique Vegetation Communities,
and Special-Status Plant Species

areas once farmed which are largely occupied by black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia), black cherry
(Prunus serotina), shadblow (Amelanchier canadensis), red maple (Acer rubrum), pitch pine (Pinus
rigida), and blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica) in the overstory; and greenbriar (Smilax rotundifolia), highbush
blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum), and eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana) in the understory.
Older, more mature forest stands are characterized by white oak (Quercus alba), black oak (Quercus
velutina), and hickory (Carya spp.). Scattered evergreen stems of red spruce (Picea rubens) and eastern
white pine (Pinus strobus) are also present.
The Seashore has initiated the collection of
vegetation data within the William Floyd
Estate forests to establish baseline conditions
for future monitoring similar to the studies
being conducted at Talisman and Blue Point
(NPS 2013e). Just as noted by Clark (1986), a
clear forest canopy gradient exists from the
southern end of the William Floyd Estate to
the northern end (i.e., lower elevations to
higher elevations). Black gum (Nyssa
sylvatica) is dominant within the southern
portion of the lower acreage with a strong
component of shadblow (Amelanchier
canadensis), while scarlet oak (Quercus
coccinea) is the dominant tree species in the
Deer in the William Floyd Estate Lower Acreage
northern reaches of the property with a
(Photo credit: NPS)
mixture of white oak (Quercus alba), black
oak (Quercus velutina), hickory (Carya tomentosa, C. glabra), and red maple (Acer rubrum). A look at
the understory has revealed similar species gradient for shrubs. Among the four most common shrubs,
black huckleberry (Gaylussaia baccata) is the most dominant shrub in the northern portion; spice bush
(Lindera benzoin) and arrowwood (Viburnum dentatum) dominate central section, and highbush
blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum) dominates the shrub layer in the southern section. The most
striking discovery is that black cherry (Prunus serotina), black gum (Nyssa sylvatica), and sassafras
(Sassafras albidum) are the dominate seedlings/saplings throughout most of the property, even in areas
where these species are not common in the overstory, suggesting a species composition shift is
occurring to favor those tree species most avoided by deer (NPS 2013e). Furthermore, because of deer
browse, there is not sufficient recruitment of tree seedlings to sustain natural reproduction of the overstory
canopy (NPS 2013e).

UNIQUE VEGETATION COMMUNITIES
NatureServe, a nonprofit conservation organization, has established a ranking system for
identifying ecosystems, plants, and animals considered to be rare or imperiled. The conservation
status of a species or ecosystem is designated by a number from 1–5, preceded by a letter reflecting
the appropriate geographic scale of the assessment, in this case G = Global. The designations have
the following meaning:
G1: critically imperiled
G2: imperiled
G3: vulnerable
G4: apparently secure
G5: secure

85

CHAPTER 3: AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT

The New York Natural Heritage Program ranks rare ecosystems using the following designations (S = State):
S1: Typically five or fewer occurrences, very few remaining individuals, acres, or miles of
stream, or some factor of its biology making it especially vulnerable in New York
S2: Typically 6–20 occurrences, few remaining individuals, acres, or miles of stream, or
factors demonstrably making it very vulnerable in New York
S3: Typically 21–100 occurrences, limited acreage, or miles of stream in New York
S4: Apparently secure in New York
S5: Demonstrably secure in New York
As a barrier island that is an uncommon geologic formation, the Seashore is host to a number of
rare ecological communities related to sand dunes and maritime forests. Those communities
identified as having global designations are listed in table 11 below.

The maritime holly forest community type, known to only occur on Fire Island and Sandy Hook,
New Jersey (Forrester, Leopold, and Underwood 2006), is the rarest ecosystem at the Seashore
with a global ranking of G1/G2 and New York State ranking of S1. Three other maritime forests are
present on the Seashore at the Carrington Estate, Talisman, and Blue Point Beach. These forests are

86

Vegetation, Unique Vegetation Communities,
and Special-Status Plant Species

generally located on the bay side of the Seashore where major secondary dune formations covered
with shrub vegetation provide protection from wind, oceanic salt spray, and erosional forces.
The Sunken Forest is the best example of a rare, well-formed, old-growth maritime holly forest and
is believed to have been part of Fire Island for several thousand years (Sirkin 1972). This virgin
forest contains American holly specimens over 300 years old. The rarity and uniqueness of this
vegetation community prompted Congress to specifically call out the Sunken Forest for protection
in the Seashore’s enabling legislation. The Seashore manages approximately 44 acres of this
maritime holly forest as what is generally referred to as the Sunken Forest, although it should be
noted that the tract designated formally as the Sunken Forest Preserve includes only a portion of
this 44 acres. The Sunken Forest takes place within the wider area known as Sailors Haven, west of
the Sailors Haven marina.

Local environmental enthusiasts recognized the Sunken Forest as a unique community long before
establishment of the Seashore in 1964. Soon after the Sunken Forest came into federal
management, opportunities were open to study and examine the vegetative composition and
ecology of the system (Schulte 1965; Art 1976). The work by Art (1976) is a comprehensive look at
the condition of the forest from data collected in 1967 through the early 1970s. Vegetation
sampling was conducted using permanently marked plots, some of which are still being sampled
today. Over the course of the following decades, scientists recognized changes in the forest
understory due to heavy deer browse (Art 1987, 1990, 1995; Forrester, Leopold, and Underwood
2006). For instance, in 1967 black huckleberry (Gaylussacia baccata), ink berry (Ilex glabra), and
highbush blueberry were common shrubs. Sarsaparilla (Aralia nudicaulus), Canada mayflower
(Maianthemum canadense), Solomon’s seal (Maianthemum stellatum), bracken fern (Pteridium
aquilinum), and starflower (Trientalis borealis) were
frequently associated with the herb layer (Art 1976, 1987,
1992). Today, these species have dramatically declined in
abundance or have been altogether extirpated from the
area by deer browse (Art 1990; Underwood, Ries, and
Raphael 2011). Other than American holly, the Sunken
Forest contains blackgum, shadblow, sassafras, red maple,
oak species (Quercus spp.), black cherry, and pitch pine.
Shadblow and highbush blueberry are the common shrubs,
while poison ivy (Toxicodendron radicans) and greenbriar
are common ground and climbing vine species.

CHAPTER 3: AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT

SPECIAL-STATUS PLANT SPECIES
Seven species of rare plants have been identified at the Seashore. A list of these species, their
preferred habitats, and listing/ranking is provided in table 12. A survey for state and federally listed
plants within the Seashore is performed annually. Results from 2012 documented 26 seabeach
amaranth (Amaranthus pumilus) plants and 50 seabeach knotweed (Polygonum glaucum) plants
occupying the lower foredunes. Seabeach amaranth is the only federally listed plant species on the
Seashore. Although the numbers of seabeach amaranth and seabeach knotweed were higher in
2012 than in 2007, overall both populations have been in decline since 2003 (Trocki 2008). This
survey was conducted prior to impacts from Hurricane Sandy which occurred in October 2012.
Survey updates should indicate the level of impact that Hurricane Sandy had on the most
vulnerable listed species.
Seashore staff have observed evidence of deer foraging on seabeach amaranth. Results from the
2012 survey indicated that approximately 50% of seabeach amaranth plants were browsed to the
extent that plant reproduction was prevented (NPS 2012d). Starting in 2013, seabeach amaranth
plants found during annual surveys are being screened to protect them from browsing when and
where feasible.

Wetlands

WETLANDS
The federal government has defined waters of the US to include a wide variety of aquatic systems
(33 CFR 328.3). Two sections of this definition that apply to Fire Island are
All waters which are currently used, or were used in the past, or may be susceptible to use in
interstate or foreign commerce, including all waters that are subject to the ebb and flow of the tide;
All other waters such as intrastate lakes, rivers, streams (including intermittent streams),
mudflats, sandflats, wetlands, sloughs, prairie potholes, wet meadows, playa lakes, or
natural ponds, the use, degradation or destruction of which could affect interstate or
foreign commerce including any such waters.
Wetlands, as separately classified ecosystems, are designated as a special aquatic site under section
404 of the Clean Water Act and are therefore a subset to waters of the US The identification of
wetlands and other waters of the US within the project area is necessary to ensure their protection in
accordance with federal laws (section 404 of the Clean Water Act and the Rivers and Harbors Act of
1899) and state laws. Wetlands are defined under the section 404 program as:
“Areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and
duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a
prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions.” (33 CFR
328.3[b]; 40 CFR 230.3[t])
The US Fish and Wildlife Service has developed a wetland definition that is more comprehensive
than the section 404 definition, recognizing that physical or chemical conditions such as wave action,
currents, or high salinity may prevent development of hydric soils or hydrophytic vegetation in some
wetland types (Cowardin et al. 1979). Therefore, some unvegetated and/or nonhydric soil sites, such
as mudflats or high-energy shorelines, may not exhibit all attributes described in the section 404
definition, but are still classified as wetlands. Nonetheless, all unvegetated mudflats, marshes,
shorelines and subtidal aquatic systems below the ordinary high tide elevation are regulated as
waters of the US
US Fish and Wildlife Service uses the following definition of wetlands:
“Lands transitional between terrestrial and aquatic systems where the water table is usually at
or near the surface or the land is covered by shallow water. For purposes of this
classification, wetlands must have one or more of the following three attributes: (1) at least
periodically, the land supports predominantly hydrophytes; (2) the substrate is
predominantly undrained hydric soil; and (3) the substrate is nonsoil and is saturated with
water or covered by shallow water at some time during the growing season of each year.
“The term wetland includes a variety of areas that fall into one of five categories; (1) areas
with hydrophytes and hydric soils, such as those commonly known as marshes, swamps, and
bogs; (2) areas without hydrophytes but with hydric soils – for example flats where drastic
fluctuation in water level, wave action, turbidity, or high concentration of salts may prevent
the growth of hydrophytes; (3) areas with hydrophytes but nonhydric soils, such as margins
of impoundments or excavations where hydrophytes have become established but hydric
soils have not yet developed; (4) areas without soils but with hydrophytes such as the
seaweed-covered portion of rocky shores; and (5) wetlands without soil and without hydrophytes,
such as gravel beaches or rocky shores without vegetation.” (Cowardin et al. 1979)

CHAPTER 3: AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT

In 1977, President Carter issued Executive Order 11990, “Protection of Wetlands,” for all federal
agencies. As a result, the National Park Service issued Director’s Order 77-1: Wetland Protection to
establish “NPS policies, requirements, and standards for implementing Executive Order 11990”
(NPS 2002b). This order instructs the National Park Service to use the US Fish and Wildlife Service
determination outlined in Cowardin et al. (1979) as the standard for defining, classifying, and
inventorying wetlands and determining when NPS actions have the potential to adversely
impact wetlands.
One proposed action would take place
within jurisdictional wetlands: the
installation of the exclusion fence
around the Sunken Forest. The fence
would be installed in wetlands between
the Sunken Forest and shoreline of
Great South Bay. Wetland types in this
area include the Reed Grass Marsh and
Highbush Blueberry Shrub Swamp
Associations (figure 7). Using the US
Fish and Wildlife Service wetland
classification system (Cowardin et al.
1979), the Reed Grass Marsh wetland is
classified as Estuarine Intertidal
Persistent Emergent, Irregularly
Flooded. Several Reed Grass Marsh
Wetlands in the Sunken Forest (Photo credit: VHB)
wetlands are present north of the
Sunken Forest that are influenced by a high water table of freshwater and occasional tidal
fluctuations creating a mixohaline (i.e., salt concentration less than 30 parts per thousand)
hydrologic regime. The dominant plant within these marshes is a thick bed of reed grass
(Phragmites australis) mixed with salt bush (Baccharis halimifolia) and wax myrtle (Myrica
cerifera). The Highbush Blueberry Shrub Swamp wetland is classified as Palustrine Broad-leafed
Deciduous Scrub-Shrub, Seasonally Flooded/Saturated. These freshwater wetlands occur slightly
landward from the Reed Grass Marshes within saturated soils driven by a high groundwater table
and are dominated by highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum), salt bush (Baccharis
halimifolia), swamp azalea (Rhododendron viscosum), and reed grass (Phragmites australis).

WHITE-TAILED DEER POPULATION
Very few if any white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) inhabited Fire Island or the William Floyd
Estate at the time the Seashore was established (Art 1995; Underwood 2005). By the early 1970s,
scientists began to observe deer on Fire Island. Biologists theorize that a small population of deer on
the eastern side of Fire Island in the 1970s expanded to the western part of Fire Island and into the
Fire Island communities where, starting around the mid-1980s, the population rapidly grew. By 1995,
the deer density had exceeded 207 deer per square mile in some portions of the Seashore, raising
concern for human health and safety, impacts on native vegetation, and the overall condition of the
deer herd (Underwood 2005). In addition to issues with deer numbers, the absence of hunting and
natural predators has allowed deer to become accustomed to living unthreatened, not only within the
natural environment but in many portions of the human environment (i.e., the Fire Island
communities and Seashore facilities). Today, deer population control, deer habituation to humans,
and food-conditioning have become major issues facing Seashore managers.
The Seashore has undertaken several studies
to understand the population dynamics of
deer on Fire Island and the William Floyd
Estate. The Seashore’s first examination of the
number of deer on Fire Island occurred from
1983 through 1988 by O’Connell and Sayre
(1989) using aerial helicopter surveys. This
methodology was continued until 1998.
Results from aerial surveys found that by
1991, the deer population increased annually
between 11% and 43% for areas on the
western side of Fire Island near the Fire Island
communities, while the population in the Fire
Island Wilderness on the eastern side of Fire
Adult female deer and fawn (Photo credit: NPS)
Island remained relatively unchanged (table
13). During this same study, 20 deer (11 males, 9 females) were fitted with radio-telemetry collars to
track and analyze their movements across the Seashore. In general, deer maintained high fidelity to
home ranges with an average of 1.5 miles (2.4 km) movement distance across the Seashore, with longer
movements attributed to young males. During a study on vector hosts of Lyme disease, one marked
deer was found to travel 3.1 miles (5 km) from the lighthouse to Point O’Woods (Underwood 2005).

CHAPTER 3: AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT

As the Seashore contemplated options for controlling deer numbers, an experimental research hunt
was conducted during the winter of 1988--89 in cooperation with the NYS-DEC. The hunt included
archery within natural areas in close proximity to the Fire Island communities, and firearms in the
more remote areas of Sailors Haven, Talisman, and the Fire Island Wilderness. A total of 60 deer were
harvested during the hunt (6 archery, 54 firearms). While the hunt may have been successful in terms
of the established goals, it was very unpopular with the public (Knoch and Lowery 1989).
Deer management began a new phase in
the 1990s as private citizens residing in the
Fire Island communities began funding an
exploratory study looking at
immunological contraception to control
deer numbers. The first five years of the
study were designed to examine the
biological effectiveness of the newly
developed contraceptive PZP in blocking
fertilization of individuals. The data
showed positive results (Naugle et al.
2002), and in 1998 the study turned
toward determining whether the overall
deer population could be lowered using
the PZP vaccine primarily within the Fire
Island communities on the western side of
the Seashore. The Seashore assumed
Deer in pedestrian corridor (Photo credit: NPS)
partial funding and carried out the
program during the last several years of the study. This study continued until 2009, with
approximately 100 female deer treated each year. Underwood (2005) concluded, “In areas with the
longest treatment history, the longest record of monitoring and the best access to breeding-aged
females, the deer population has declined by almost 50% since 1998 (Naugle et al. 2002). In other
treatment areas, population responses have been much less dramatic.”
While the PZP immunocontraceptive study was ongoing, the methodology of conducting deer
counts shifted from aerial surveys to distance sampling (Buckland et al. 1993) along ground transects
where more emphasis could be placed on populations within the Fire Island communities
(Underwood 2005). Biologists began performing distance sampling counts in 1995 at the Seashore
(including the William Floyd Estate) and have continued with the practice annually. Several areas
were surveyed every year between 2003 and 2010, while two locales, Sailors Haven and Davis Park,
were not surveyed during one of those years. The remaining locales were periodically surveyed over
the same time period (Underwood, Ries, and Raphael 2011).
Approximate deer densities (including confidence intervals) from the most recent surveys in 2013
and 2014 are presented in table 14 and depicted on figure 8. Densities were found to vary widely
across the Seashore, particularly between natural areas and Fire Island communities. Long-term
trends show relatively stable population densities at Robert Moses State Park, the Light House
Annex area, the Fire Island Wilderness, and the William Floyd Estate. Wider year-to-year
fluctuations in deer numbers occur within the Fire Island communities, with Kismet – Lonelyville
exhibiting the highest density of any locale on the Seashore possibly due to baiting at 4-Poster
devices installed and operated by certain Fire Island communities to control ticks.

CHAPTER 3: AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT

In terms of the number of individuals in current deer density data (table 14), the Seashore estimates
that approximately 62 deer reside in the Fire Island Wilderness, and 250 deer occupy areas west of
the Fire Island Wilderness, including Robert Moses State Park. Approximately 84 deer reside at the
William Floyd Estate.
With the termination of the immunocontraceptive study in 2009, the Seashore has experienced
resumption of population increases within the western half of Fire Island. Population densities at
the larger natural areas of Fire Island Wilderness and William Floyd Estate, which are outside of
the immunocontraceptive study area, have remained relatively stable with normal year-to-year
fluctuations (NPS 2015b).
O’Connell and Sayre (1989) performed deer
counts and examined the movements of 20
deer on the Seashore. From these data, they
suggested that a dichotomy existed in the
dynamics of the deer herd between the
eastern and western halves of the Seashore.
Underwood (2005), based on population
trend data from the immunocontraceptive
studies and deer density surveys, made
similar conclusions. Underwood (2005)
observed a relatively stable deer population
at the Fire Island Wilderness and a rapidly
increasing population in western areas of
Fire Island, confirming O’Connell and
Sayre’s observations. Scientists have found
Deer within Fire Island communities (Photo credit: NPS)
that deer residing in the Fire Island
Wilderness rely on natural food sources with few coming in contact with humans, and these deer
generally exhibit a flight response to humans. In contrast, many of the deer on the western side of
the Seashore use the Fire Island communities as part of their home range; exploit artificial food
sources from human refuse, handouts, and 4-Poster devices; and are thus more habituated to
human presence and conditioned to human food (Underwood 2005).

OTHER WILDLIFE AND WILDLIFE HABITAT
The Seashore contains a mosaic of natural habitats situated in close proximity to intensively
developed suburban areas of Fire Island and Long Island. The ocean, bay, beaches, dunes, estuaries,
tidal mudflats, scrub, and forested areas found on Fire Island and at the William Floyd Estate
provide habitat for a diverse population of fish and wildlife species, which are described below.

MAMMALS
In 1974, 17 species of terrestrial mammals were recorded at the Seashore (McCormick and
Associates, Inc 1975). Published reports documenting species ranges (Whitaker and Hamilton
1998) reviewed in combination with the Seashore species list from the 1970s identified 28 species of
mammals likely to occur within the Seashore across a broad spectrum of habitat types. Species
common to the Seashore and William Floyd Estate include white-tailed deer, eastern cottontail
rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus),
meadow vole (Microtus pennsylvanicus), raccoon (Procyon lotor), Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus),
eastern gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis), muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus), shrews (Sorex cinereus,
Blarina brevicauda), weasel (Mustela spp.), mink (Neovison vison), and a variety of bats (Myotis
spp., Lasiurus spp., and others).

REPTILES
The most recent and comprehensive inventories of reptiles at the Seashore were performed by
Cook, Brotherton, and Behler (2010a, 2010b). Species recorded included those confirmed by
anuran calls, visual encounters, including records of recent observation by others, and trapping.
While five sea turtles are migrants to the ocean shorewaters of Fire Island (Trocki 2008), the
loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) and leatherback sea turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) were most
recently recorded in the area. In addition, ten resident species of reptiles were found using Fire Island
(Cook, Brotherton, and Behler 2010a). Resident species surveyed include the Fowler’s toad (Bufo
fowleri), American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus), snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina), eastern
box turtle (Terrapene carolina), northern diamond back terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin terrapin),
spotted turtle (Clemmys guttata), eastern mud turtle (Kinosternon subrubrum), eastern hog-nosed
snake (Heterodon platirhinos), eastern garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis), and northern black racer
(Coluber constrictor constrictor). No salamanders were recorded. The Fowler’s toad, northern
diamond-backed terrapin, and northern black racer were the most frequently recorded species of the
taxonomic groups. The American bullfrog, snapping turtle, eastern mud turtle, spotted turtle,
northern diamondback terrapin were observed inhabiting wetlands and riparian areas. In contrast,
the eastern box turtle, eastern hog-nosed snake, eastern garter snake, and northern black racer were
recorded within forests, scrub thickets, and developed areas.
Eleven species were recorded at the William Floyd Estate, including two salamander, one frog, four
turtle, and four snake species (Cook, Brotherton, and Behler 2010b). Most observations were
associated with the O’Dell and Home Creeks, upland woodlands, and fields. Species include the
eastern red-backed salamander (Plethodon cinereus), four-toed salamander (Hemidactylium
scutatum), spring peeper (Pseudacris crucifer), snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina), painted turtle
(Chrysemys picta), eastern box turtle (Terrapene carolina), northern diamondback terrapin
(Malaclemys terrapin terrapin), eastern garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis), northern brown snake
(Storeria dekayi dekayi), northern black racer (Coluber constrictor constrictor), and eastern milk
snake (Lampropeltis triangulum triangulum).

BIRDS
Habitats within the Seashore are important refuges for a wide variety of migratory and resident
birds. A total of 333 avian species have been observed within the Seashore, 67 of which have been
documented to breed at the Seashore (Mitra and Putnam 1999; Trocki 2008). The Seashore is
within the Atlantic Flyway, a major North American migratory bird route that spans the northern

99

CHAPTER 3: AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT

habitats of the Arctic islands, coastal Greenland, and Canada to as far south as Jamaica and South
America (Bird Nature 2013). The Seashore provides a resting and feeding area for migratory birds
traveling along this route.
Tidal marshes and mudflats provide habitat for thousands of migratory birds, such as dowitcher
(Limnodromus spp.), plover (Pluvialis spp., Charadrius spp.), sanderling (Calidris alba) and other
sandpipers (Calidris spp.), red knot (Calidris canutus), and dunlin (Calidris alpina) (Trocki 2008).
Birds that breed in or near Fire Island’s salt marshes include American black duck (Anas rubripes),
clapper rail (Rallus longirostris), and willet (Catoptrophorus semipalmatus) (Mitra and Putnam 1999;
Niedowski 2000). Seaside sparrow (Ammodramus maritimus), sharp-tailed sparrow (Ammodramus
caudacutus), and marsh wren (Cistothorus palustris) nest directly in the salt marsh. The marsh wren
also nests in the cattail-dominated brackish tidal marsh. Red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius
phoeniceus) commonly nest in the taller shrubs along the upper salt marsh margin. Other birds
often seen and heard in the salt marsh include barn and tree swallows (Hirundo rustica, Tachycineta
bicolor), gray catbird (Dumetella carolinensis), common yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas), and
yellow-rumped warbler (Dendroica coronata). Other birds using area marshes and estuaries as a
food source (e.g., cordgrass, insects, invertebrates, small fishes, etc.) include the glossy ibis (Plegadis
facinellus), great egret (Ardea alba), green heron (Butorides striatus), laughing gull (Larus atricilla),
snowy egret (Egretta thula), osprey (Pandion haliaetus), and terns (Sterna spp.) (Trocki 2008).
The Seashore also is a valuable habitat source for wintering and nesting waterfowl. During the
winter, tidal creeks and the bay are frequently used by a wide variety of migrating diving ducks such
as the greater scaup (Aythya marila), lesser scaup (Aythya affinis), red-breasted merganser (Mergus
serrator), bufflehead (Bucephala albeola), and common goldeneye (Bucephala clangula). Openwater ponds at the William Floyd Estate, created decades ago for waterfowl hunting, provide
refuge for waterfowl during harsh winter weather. These areas are also used by snow geese (Chen
caerulescens), Canada geese (Branta canadensis), brant geese (Branta bernicla), and dabbling ducks
such as the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), black duck (Anas rubripes), American wideon (Anas
americana), green-winged teal (Anas crecca), gadwall (Anas strepera), and northern pintail (Anas
acuta), some of which use the ponds as nesting sites.
Dense shrub thickets and forests within the back dunes and swales within the Seashore are home to
several songbirds such as the song sparrow (Melospiza melodia), gray catbird (Dumetella carolinensis),
brown thrasher (Toxostoma rufum), mourning dove (Zenaida macroura), northern cardinal
(Cardinalis cardinalis), northern mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos), redwing blackbird, rufous-sided
towhee (Pipilo erythrophthalmus), white-throated sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis), yellow-rumped
warbler (Dendroica coronate), and yellow warbler (Dendroica petechia) (Trocki 2008).
Migrating and wintering birds of prey also are inhabitants of the Seashore. The northern harrier
(Circus cyaneus) may use marsh habitats on Fire Island for nesting, while short-eared owls (Asio
flammeus), long-eared owls (Asio otus), and snowy owls (Nyctea scandiaca) are occasional winter
inhabitants. Other birds of prey using the Seashore may include the red-tailed hawk (Buteo
jamaicensis), broad-winged hawk (Buteo platypterus), and the bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus)
(Trocki 2008).

TICKS AND OTHER INVERTEBRATES
Fire Island is host to several tick species including the lone star tick (Amblyomma americanum), the
American dog tick (Dermacentor variabilis), and the blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis), also
known as the deer tick. Ticks occur in high numbers across the Seashore and are a particular

100

Wilderness

concern as vectors of diseases to humans. Such diseases include anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis,
babesiosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and Lyme disease (CDC 2013).
The most prevalent tick found at the Seashore is the lone star tick, which has been shown to carry
ehrlichiosis and possibly other tick-borne diseases. Blacklegged ticks have been identified as
carriers for Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, and babesiosis. Ticks become carriers for diseases from
the hosts they feed on. For example, the blacklegged tick acquires the Lyme disease pathogen,
Borrelia burgdorferi, primarily from the white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) and other small
mammals. White-tailed deer do not carry the Lyme disease pathogen but serve as an important host
for all tick lifestages, especially the adult stage, helping to perpetuate the tick population.
In addition to hosts, habitat and climatic conditions are important for tick survival. On Fire Island,
blacklegged ticks were found in higher numbers (i.e., greater survivorship) within deciduous and
coniferous wooded habitats where relative humidity is higher compared to open habitats (Ginsberg
and Zhioua 1996). Lone star ticks are common in most habitat types and can tolerate more open
habitats unlike blacklegged ticks.
In a study in 1996, B. burgdorferi was isolated from one-third of adult blacklegged ticks collected
from Fire Island (Ecohealth, Inc. 1998). Since then, other diseases like ehrlichiosis have been
isolated from other ticks and animals. The threat of these diseases has affected levels of visitation,
particularly at the William Floyd Estate where boardwalks cannot be constructed to keep visitors
out of tick habitat due to the cultural landscape the Seashore must maintain.
Hundreds of species of insects occur on the Seashore that are ecologically valuable as pollinators
for plant reproduction and food sources for birds, reptiles, and amphibians (Opler, Lotts, and
Naberhaus 2013; NPS 2014). The Seashore offers important habitats for migrating monarch
butterflies (Danaus plexippus) and odonates (e.g., dragonflies and damselflies), and various beetles,
flies, mosquitos, and ants utilize the wetlands, beaches, and shorelines. An inventory of
invertebrates by the US Army Corps of Engineers (2005) found shore flies (Ephydridae), turfgrass
ants (Lasius neoniger), and muscid flies (Muscidae) are most common on the bayside shorelines,
and shoreflies (Ephydridae) and ground beetles (Clivinia sp.) occur along the oceanside beaches.
The most common taxonomic groups in the US Army Corps of Engineers (2005) study were
Coleoptera, Diptera, Amphipoda, and Hymenoptera. Twenty seven species of odonates were
inventoried at Fire Island, primarily near wetlands and ponds such as the freshwater pond at
Kismet (Briggs et al. 2010).

WILDERNESS
The Wilderness Act of 1964 established the National Wilderness Preservation System to “secure for
the American people of present and future generations the benefits of an enduring resource of
wilderness.” The purpose of the Act was to forever preserve the wildness of certain lands by
restricting land-use activities. On December 23, 1980, under the Otis Pike Fire Island High Dune
Wilderness Act (Public Law [PL] 96-585), Congress established approximately 1,363 acres of
wilderness and 18 acres of potential wilderness within the Seashore. Subsequently, in October
1999, 17 of the 18 acres designated as potential wilderness were deemed in full compliance with
wilderness standards and officially designated as wilderness. Approximately 1 acre within the
Seashore remains designated potential wilderness and the Seashore is now pursuing the
designation of this last remaining acre as wilderness. (Note that in this document, the term
“wilderness” refers to federally designated wilderness.)

101

CHAPTER 3: AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT

At fewer than 1,400 acres, the Fire Island
Wilderness is the smallest wilderness area
managed by the National Park Service and is
the only federally designated wilderness in
New York State (Wilderness.net 2012). This
is one of only a few barrier islands and
locations along the eastern seaboard
designated as wilderness. The extent of the
wilderness, including the newly formed
breach caused by Hurricane Sandy, and
other landmarks described below are shown
on figure 9.

Fire Island Wilderness visitor center (Photo credit: VHB)

The Fire Island Wilderness spans approximately 8 miles along the barrier island between Watch
Hill and the Wilderness Visitor Center at Smith Point (figure 9). The Fire Island Wilderness is split
into eastern and western portions by the ocean-to-bay parcel of nonfederally owned land, Bellport
Beach, a village-owned property excluded from Wilderness designation which lies roughly in the
middle of the wilderness. The wilderness boundary on the north side of the island coincides with
the mean high water elevation of Great South Bay, and the southernmost boundary reaches the toe
of the primary dunes along the beach facing the Atlantic Ocean. The entire length of Atlantic Ocean
beach adjacent to the southern wilderness boundary is the area designated as Seashore
backcountry. The eastern boundary of the Wilderness extends along the western boundary of
Smith Point County Park, except that it excludes the existing Wilderness Visitor Center and the
100 feet of land surrounding the perimeter of the building. The westernmost boundary extends
along the edge of the Watch Hill Campground and nature trail.
Due to the dynamic nature of the shifting dunes and salt marshes and barrier island shorelines,
both the southern and northern boundaries are subject to frequent fluctuation. Where there is an
overwash, break in the dunes, breach, etc., the Fire Island Wilderness boundary is extended to the
toe of the dunes on either side of the break. For instance, Hurricane Sandy recently breached the
wilderness west of the Wilderness Visitor Center. The National Park Service has marked where the
toe of the dune was estimated to be prior to the breach on either side of the breach and continues
to manage the area upland of those markers as wilderness.
The Fire Island Wilderness exemplifies an undisturbed stretch of barrier island ecosystem
characterized by massive primary dunes, interdunal swales of grasses and shrubs, freshwater
cranberry marshes, and tidal marshes but does not include the Atlantic Ocean beach south of the
toe of the dune. The southern boundary of the Fire Island Wilderness is characterized by massive
primary dunes, some nearly 40 feet high, which are thickly blanketed with beach grass. Beyond
these dunes lies the island swale and, in some areas, a line of secondary dunes is apparent. A variety
of plant communities is found in the dune and swale zones including scrub and grasslands, high
thickets, pine woodlands, and occasional patches of broadleaf forest. Interspersed among the
dunes are unique freshwater cranberry marshes and interdunal grassy marshes. Vast expanses of
reedgrass marshes and tidal marsh stretch beyond the swale and secondary dunes, extending into
Great South Bay (NPS 1983). A variety of mammals, reptiles, amphibians, insects, and birds inhabit
the area. White-tailed deer also reside within this area. Additional information on the vegetation
and wildlife of the Seashore can be found in their respective sections of this chapter.

The Interagency Wilderness Character Monitoring Team, which represents the Bureau of Land
Management, US Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service, US Geological Survey, and US
Forest Service, offers an interagency strategy to monitor trends in wilderness character across the
National Wilderness Preservation System in the handbook Keeping It Wild: An Interagency Strategy
to Monitor Trends in Wilderness Character across the National Wilderness Preservation System
(Landres et al. 2008). Based on the statutory language of the Wilderness Act, the interagency team
identified four qualities of wilderness character that should be used in wilderness planning,
stewardship, and monitoring. The National Park Service also has developed an agency-specific
guide to managing wilderness called Keeping it Wild in the National Parks (NPS 2013b), which
includes a fifth quality. All five qualities are used to describe the condition of the wilderness
character and are as follows:







untrammeled—Wilderness is essentially unhindered and free from modern human control
or manipulation.
natural—Wilderness ecological systems are substantially free from the effects of modern
civilization.
undeveloped—Wilderness retains its primeval character and influence and is essentially
without permanent improvement or modern human occupation.
solitude or a primitive and unconfined type of recreation—Wilderness provides
outstanding opportunities for solitude or primitive and unconfined recreation.
other features of value—Wilderness preserves other tangible features that are of scientific,
educational, scenic, or historical value; this quality captures important elements of
wilderness that may not be covered in the other four qualities.

The National Park Service prepared a wilderness management plan for the Fire Island Wilderness
in 1983 that outlined management goals and objectives, potential expansion areas, wilderness use,
and permitted management activities (NPS 1983). The Fire Island Wilderness provides outstanding
opportunities for solitude and primitive, unconfined recreation. The area provides excellent
backcountry camping opportunities and hiking along the old Burma Road, which runs the full
length of the Fire Island Wilderness. Typical day use of the Fire Island Wilderness is the primary
form of visitor use, though waterfowl hunting and overnight primitive camping is allowed via
permits issued by the Seashore as described in the Seashore's backcountry camping plan.
Management activities conducted by Seashore staff within the Fire Island Wilderness are limited to
the general maintenance and upkeep of the existing boardwalk, including reconstruction following
recent storm damage, signs for regulating visitors, fencing of sensitive species, an experimental deer
exclosure (13 feet by 13 feet), removal of invasive species, and vegetation monitoring plots. These
management actions impose modern human control over ecological systems and interfere with the
primeval quality and/or influence of natural resources. As such, the untrammeled, natural, and
undeveloped qualities of wilderness may be somewhat diminished; however, such uses are
consistent with wilderness stewardship policies and practices, and over the long term, these uses
enhance natural resources. When relevant, a minimum tool analysis is conducted for management
actions that have the potential to impact wilderness resources or character. In accordance with the
management plan, restrictions have been established to protect the Fire Island Wilderness from
new roads, unauthorized dune crossings, motorized equipment, utility installations, and other
human actions that could harm its natural integrity.
In addition to setting aside wilderness area, PL 96-585 also specifically excluded two areas from
wilderness designation: Bellport Beach and the Wilderness Visitor Center (NPS 1983). The 1,800­
square-foot Wilderness Visitor Center supports the Seashore’s seasonal programs, ranger-led tours
and programs, wilderness camping, and recreational and permitted driving. It also provides
105

CHAPTER 3: AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT

restrooms, exhibits, and unique views of the Fire Island Wilderness. A short, universally accessible
boardwalk extends from the visitor center into the south section of the Fire Island Wilderness.

CULTURAL LANDSCAPES
The natural landscape of Fire Island has been altered or manipulated through natural events, human
use, and engineering. Several thousand years before European contact and settlement, both Fire
Island and southern Long Island were the scene of human occupation. Today, the Seashore serves to
fulfill the recreational, economic, social, and scientific needs of a diverse regional population.
Fire Island became a stabilized landform around 10,000 years ago, and by 8,000 years ago the
landscape on the island was characterized by much the same landscape as today. Human inhabitants
moved between Fire Island and Long Island, exploiting the resources of the bay, Fire Island, and the
Atlantic Ocean, similar to the hunters and fisherman in more recent historic periods. Fishing,
hunting, and limited agriculture continued at Fire Island and the bays by the American Indians and
the Colonial settlers, but by the early 1800s demand for Fire Island’s agricultural goods decreased.
Development on Fire Island focused on residential construction and tourism. In 1827, a federal
lighthouse was constructed on the west end of Fire Island near the Fire Island Inlet and later, the US
Life-Saving Service built station houses along the length of Fire Island to assist mariners. There are
currently 17 separate communities on Fire Island, as well as the Robert Moses State Park, established
in 1908 and later renamed. The National Park Service has within its boundaries Smith Point County
Park, three municipal beaches, and the 17 distinct preexisting residential communities.
Cultural landscape inventories have been completed within the Seashore for the William Floyd
Estate and the Light House Annex. Due to the long history of human occupancy on Fire Island and
southern Long Island, there are many cultural landscapes within the Seashore boundaries.
However, for the plan/EIS, the landscape associated with the William Floyd Estate is the most
notably impacted; therefore, it is described below.

WILLIAM FLOYD ESTATE
The William Floyd Estate is the historic home of the Floyd family and William Floyd, an American
Revolutionary War general and signer of the Declaration of Independence. Family heirs continued
to live at the estate until 1976 when the property was donated to the National Park Service. In 1980,
the William Floyd Estate was listed in the National Register of Historic Places (National Register).
This property comprises a 613-acre tract that includes the 34.5-acre historic core encompassing the
Old Mastic House, the Floyd Family Cemetery, and 10 agricultural buildings. Also included in the
nomination are the museum collections associated with the William Floyd Estate.
The Seashore initially performed a cultural
landscape inventory for the William Floyd
Estate and Fire Island in 1998 and revised
the inventory in 2006. Based on the
inventory completed in 2006, the New
York SHPO concurred with the NPS
findings that the period of significance for
the property ended in 1975. Two
additional resources, the windmill and the
cistern/wells, were determined eligible for
listing in the National Register in 1996.

Visitor Use and Experience/Recreation

The northern boundary of the William Floyd Estate runs parallel to Washington Avenue. The
property is additionally bounded by Home Creek on the east, Narrow Bay on the south, and
Lawrence Creek on the west. This property includes the Old Mastic House and its associated
structures and landscape features. In general, the landscape may be characterized as a series of
agricultural fields historically maintained for the harvesting of wildlife, although presently hunting
is not permitted, garden areas, managed turf, specimen trees, a vista, ditches, lopped tree lines,
water control devices, wooded areas, salt marshes, and human-made ponds.
Historically, the William Floyd Estate’s spatial organization and circulation were oriented to water
access via Home Creek and Narrow Bay. Beginning in 1724, as the estate developed as an
agricultural plantation, circulation came to include a dirt road and a log road called Corduroy
Road. Later, as trains and automobiles became dominant modes of transportation, estate roads
were developed to provide access to nearby railroad stations and highways on Long Island. A
variety of land uses specific to different portions of the tract shaped the placement of characteristic
landscape features. Important character-defining features were developed on the property, such as
the Great Ditch which was constructed to keep
cattle from straying into the marshes. More
aesthetic elements like the ornamental lawn, the
rough-cut known as the Pightle, and the vista to
Narrow Bay, were set in an area closer to the
main house where they might be enjoyed as
amenities. Other features associated with the
plantation, such as agricultural outbuildings and
a system of trails, roads, and fences, were placed
as required for use of the property. Features that
began as functional elements but later acquired
picturesque associations, such as the lopped tree

line that delineated fields, are sited as their

original purpose dictated.

VISITOR USE AND EXPERIENCE/RECREATION
The natural environs of Fire Island has made it an especially popular location for recreation and
residential resort development. Since the Seashore was established in 1964, the National Park
Service and its partners have worked to provide for a high quality visitor experience and to
maintain and enhance the recreational opportunities that have always been a part of Fire Island.
The porous nature of the Seashore boundary, with numerous points of entry, makes it difficult to
accurately measure visitation. In addition to the federally owned lands, the Seashore’s boundary
encompasses a county park, three community beaches, 17 private residential communities, and
nearly 17,000 acres of bay and ocean waters. Current visitation tracking does not fully account for
visitor use in these areas, but it is estimated that a total of approximately 2.2 million people visit Fire
Island annually, including visits to the Seashore, Fire Island communities, or the waters
surrounding the Seashore (NPS 2012c). The Seashore by itself has visitation counts which are much
lower than the total Seashore-wide estimate, as derived from observations at a number of Seashore
facilities. Recreational visitation to sites and facilities owned or managed by the Seashore in 2014
was approximately 384,000 (NPS 2015a).
The Seashore offers a wide variety of recreational activities, some of which are regulated by the
Seashore to provide equal opportunities and a safe environment for all visitors, while protecting the

107

CHAPTER 3: AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT

Seashore’s vast resources. Some activities, such as kite flying, camping, and picnicking are restricted
to certain areas and times of year. Other activities, such as backcountry camping and private events,
require NPS permits. The more regulated activities at the Seashore include recreational driving,
fishing, and hunting.
Along with the driving restrictions, fishing and
waterfowl hunting regulations are in place to protect
the natural, scenic, and recreational resources in the
Seashore. Hunting, fin fishing, and shellfishing are
important recreational pastimes in the local area, and
the Seashore is one of the few units of the National Park
System in which public hunting is allowed through its
enabling legislation. Waterfowl hunting is permitted at
Fire Island with a permit issued by Seashore staff, a
valid New York State (NYS) hunting license, a signed
federal duck stamp, a driving license, and a
confirmation number from the Migratory Bird Harvest
Visitors feeding a deer (Photo credit: NPS)
Information Program. No hunting is allowed at the
William Floyd Estate. Hunting/fishing seasons and limits are established and regulated by the New
York State Department of Environmental Conservation. The Seashore’s park rangers have the
policing authority to enforce state hunting and fishing laws in the Seashore.
Currently the Seashore only allows limited opportunities for waterfowl hunting in two designated
areas, the East End Hunting Area and the West End Hunting Area. The East End Hunting Area is
adjacent to the Fire Island Wilderness and extends from Long Cove east to Hayhole Point, north of
the Burma Road. The West End Hunting Area is restricted to shoreline waterfowl hunting from the
bay islands of East Fire Island, West Fire Island, and Sexton Island. In the 2013-14 season, a total of
56 hunting permits were issued. The majority of these permits (48) were issued for the East End
Hunting Area. Rabbit hunting used to be allowed in the Fire Island Wilderness, but sometime
between 1987 and 1988, the Seashore ceased the issuance of permits for rabbit hunting because of
safety issues and conflicts with hunting dogs and other users such as backcountry campers.
According to a 2008 survey of Seashore visitors, approximately
50% of the respondents felt that close contact with deer or other
wildlife added to their Seashore experience, 20% felt the presence
of deer or other wildlife had no effect on their experience, and 2%
felt the deer detracted from their experience. An additional
29% of visitors reported no contact with deer or other
wildlife (NPS 2009b).
Educational/interpretive activities occur at several locations on
Fire Island. One of the primary destinations for
Deer feeding on garbage
educational/interpretive programming is the Light House Annex,
(Photo credit: NPS)
which provides specialized educational programs to over 7,000
local elementary school children each year. The Sunken Forest also hosts several thousand school
children a year. The Fire Island Wilderness, via access from the Wilderness Visitor Center, and, to a
lesser extent, Watch Hill, also are host to school groups. All beach sites are popular attractions for
many of the Seashore's recreational visitors.
The William Floyd Estate is open to the public from late May through mid-November. During
these months, visitors may take guided tours of the house and discuss the history of the family and

108

Fire Island Communities and Adjacent Landowners

the 613-acre site with park rangers and interpreters. The house reflects a continuum of historical
use by William Floyd’s family, with structural and furnishings modifications over more than two
centuries. The main interpretive themes of this continuum of use is “The Land, The House, and
The Family.” To support this story, Seashore staff conduct cultural landscape tours and tours of the
archival collection that is housed in a facility located on the estate. The collections include items
related to the Floyd family, as well as the general history of the region.

FIRE ISLAND COMMUNITIES AND ADJACENT LANDOWNERS
The Seashore is composed of public and private lands, including the 17 private communities and
towns, Smith County Park, and three municipal beaches, Bellport Beach, Leja Beach/Davis Park,
and Atlantique Beach. In total, nonfederal lands within the Seashore encompass approximately
13,338 acres, 12,423 acres of which are public lands (NPS 2012c). The 17 private communities,
which occupy 916 acres of Fire Island, had been developed before the establishment of the
Seashore (NPS 2012c). These communities currently include over 4,100 homes. When the Seashore
was established in 1964, its enabling legislation stated that these communities and preexisting
commercial uses would be allowed to remain, as long as development was consistent with zoning
ordinances established by the Secretary of the Interior (NPS 1977).
In May 2010, a Character Study was
prepared for the Fire Island communities.
Nearly all participants, 95%, identified that
they are either satisfied or highly satisfied
with the general quality of life on Fire Island
(Nelessen 2012). In addition to
demographics questions, the project website
presented viewers with various images from
Fire Island that portrayed a range of features
and characteristics that define Fire Island’s
built environment and larger landscape.
Images of the natural beaches and dunes,

naturalized portions of the bay shore all
scored positively in the natural environment category (Nelessen 2012). Boardwalks with loose
landscaped or natural edges, well-designed entrances and fencing associated with private
residences, and naturalized, beach tolerant landscape treatments all elicited positive responses
(Nelessen 2012).
In many residential settings near protected areas, such as the Fire Island communities within the
Seashore, deer cause year-round damage to suburban landscaping, which can be costly to replace.
The vegetation composition in the Fire Island communities is described in detail under the
“Unique Vegetation Communities” section above. Suburban landscaping includes planted gardens,
ornamental plantings, woodlots, orchards, and nurseries, which provide deer with a combination
of shelter and food (McDonald and Hollingsworth 2007). As natural habitat dwindles due to

109

CHAPTER 3: AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT

development pressure and as deer populations grow, deer
may turn to surrounding residential areas for food,
particularly in late fall, winter, and early spring, when
other natural food sources may be scarce. Deer damage
shrubs and landscape vegetation by eating the buds,
leaves, flowers, and twigs and by rubbing on the bark of
trees. In home gardens, deer eat leaves, flowers, stems, and
other plant parts. An average adult deer consumes
approximately 6–10 pounds of food per day during late
spring, summer, and fall (McDonald and Hollingsworth
2007). Deer may also trample plants as they move through
the landscape. Browse damage typically extends as high as
6 feet, which is the highest an average deer can reach.

In addition to causing damage to vegetation within local
communities, some people consider deer a nuisance. Trash
cans that are not properly secured can be knocked over by
deer, spilling garbage. Some deer have been foodconditioned and seek food by approaching humans.
A separate interview-based survey conducted in 2005
found that community resident concerns related to deer
included both physical and emotional impacts on
residents. An example of a physical impact would be a
response such as, “There used to be the most beautiful
ferns out here… That’s all gone.” An example of an
emotional response is, “I feel blessed to be surrounded by
this wildlife… They are a joy” (Leong and Decker 2007).

PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY
The National Park Service is committed to providing appropriate, high-quality opportunities for
visitors to enjoy parks in a safe and healthy environment. A visitor accident or incident is defined as
an accidental event affecting any non-NPS employee that results in serious injury or illness
requiring medical treatment, or in death. As described in the “Visitor Experience and Recreation”
section, because there is no central entrance or orientation point in the Seashore, it is important to
the National Park Service that information sources be readily available to the public. Park rangers
and employees post public notices on bulletin boards at key locations around the Seashore and on
the Seashore website to ensure that visitors to Fire Island are properly informed regarding safety
concerns. For example, visitors arriving by ferry boat to NPS facilities are presented with staffed
visitor contact stations and signage that includes Seashore maps and other information such as
safety bulletins on tick-borne diseases, as well as prevention and identification, and protection
from ticks.
The potential for the transmission of Lyme disease is often cited as a safety concern by both
Seashore visitors and employees. The perceived threat of these diseases has affected levels of
visitation, particularly at the William Floyd Estate where potential impacts to the cultural landscape
have prevented the Seashore’s ability to install gravel walkways or pedestrian boardwalks to protect
visitors from tick infested areas. A 2007 study found that Lyme disease was one of the main deerrelated concerns for residents of the Fire Island communities (Siemer et al. 2007). As described in

110

Seashore Operations

chapter 1, the Seashore has an extensive tick monitoring and management program in place to
manage the risk of tick-borne illness at the William Floyd Estate.
Some deer in the Fire Island communities and adjacent lands have become habituated to human
presence and have been food-conditioned by community members feeding them. These deer have
been known to approach people, a safety concern for some community members. Additionally,
people sometimes encounter deer on boardwalks. Some boardwalks are bordered on both sides by
fencing or dense stands of bamboo, and there is potential for people to startle deer on the boardwalk,
which could lead to safety risks.

SEASHORE OPERATIONS
The facilities, roads, buildings, and utilities currently used for Seashore operations and by the
visiting public are a mix of structures that existed prior to the establishment of the Seashore and
new infrastructure installed by the National Park Service. Operations at the Seashore are divided
into five functional areas: visitor and resource protection, education/interpretation, resource
management, maintenance, and administration. In total, in fiscal year (FY) 2012, the Seashore
employed approximately 40 full-time equivalent positions (FTE) and had an operational budget
of approximately $4.8 million (NPS 2012c). The permanent staff is augmented by a seasonal or
temporary workforce, which changes from year to year with available funding. In addition to fulltime staff, the Seashore also maintains up to 60 seasonal and intern staff during the summer months.
Overall, the Seashore estimates that operations related to white-tailed deer and vegetation
require $25,195 annually, although some costs recur every three or five years. These costs are
split between the functional areas of visitor experience and enjoyment and resource
management, as described below.

VISITOR AND RESOURCE PROTECTION
The visitor and resource protection functional area represents the personnel and budgetary
resources that go toward protecting Seashore natural resources and ensuring visitor safety. In FY
2011, there were a total of 18.3 FTE available to address the responsibilities under this functional
area. The total annual budget for this area was approximately 27% of the Seashore’s total budget
(NPS 2013c).
Park rangers and ocean lifeguards
protect Seashore visitors,
resources, and property through
professional services in law
enforcement, emergency medical
services, search and rescue, beach
safety, and community assistance.
Park rangers patrol the Seashore
by all-terrain vehicle, boat, and
automobile. Due to the unique
Fire Island communities and
resources within the Seashore’s
Sign on health and safety relating to deer (Photo credit: NPS)
boundary, park rangers at the
Seashore are among the National Park Service’s most diverse in terms of necessary skills. Seashore staff
manage reports of negative human-deer interactions and spend an estimated 185 hours annually

111

CHAPTER 3: AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT

completing Case Incident Reports related specifically to these incidents. Time spent on these reports is
almost 0.4% of the budget for visitor and resource protection.

EDUCATION/INTERPRETATION
The education/interpretation functional area is represented by educational/interpretive program staff
include Seashore interpretive rangers and guides who provide visitor information, develop and
deliver public and educational programming, operate visitor centers, design and develop
nonpersonal media (e.g., exhibits, signage, publications, social media, etc.), and oversee the volunteer
program. In FY 2011, there were a total of 9.7 FTE available to undertake the responsibilities
associated with this functional area. The total annual budget for this area was approximately 13% of
the Seashore’s total budget (NPS 2013c).
Staff currently spend approximately 270–300 hours per year on deer-related community outreach.
This outreach is conducted by two staff members at a GS-9 and GS-5 level, respectively, and their
efforts include planning, correspondence, transportation, Junior Ranger programming, public
programming, informal interpretation, publications, and implementation of deer-related programming.
These activities combined cost approximately 1% of the education/interpretation budget.

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
Operations in the resource management division include the monitoring, management, protection,
and preservation of natural and cultural resources. The Seashore is charged with the protection of
miles of ocean and bayside shoreline, uplands, wetlands, maritime forests, and endemic, migratory,
and endangered species. In addition to natural resources, the Seashore is charged with protecting
41 historic structures, three of which are listed on the National Register: the William Floyd Estate,
the Carrington House and Cottage, and the Light House Annex. Resource management is one of
the smallest functional areas of the Seashore, with only 7.4 FTE in FY 2011. Expenditures in this
area accounted for approximately 13% of the total Seashore (NPS 2013c).
The Seashore uses limited amounts of fencing to protect sensitive
species and landscapes and monitors vegetation and deer
populations. Staff time related to maintenance and repair of
fencing is relatively small, requiring approximately 4 hours per
year at the William Floyd Estate and 32 hours (16 hours each for
two staff) on Fire Island. The Seashore’s current vegetation
monitoring program includes annual plot sampling at one or
more of the Seashore natural areas until each natural area is
surveyed at least once every five years, requiring five dedicated
staff for four months (460 hours each).
Deer monitoring takes place annually Seashore-wide, requiring
approximately 200 hours for three staff. Additionally,
monitoring takes place every three years within the Fire Island
Wilderness and at the William Floyd Estate. Monitoring in the
Seashore staff monitoring
Fire Island Wilderness requires approximately 25 hours of
vegetation (Photo credit: NPS)
time from two staff every three-year cycle. Monitoring at the
William Floyd Estate requires 25 hours from three staff every three-year cycle.
The total estimate of time, not including materials, spent on items related to deer management under
this division is approximately 2% of the division’s annual budget.

Seashore Operations

MAINTENANCE
Maintenance operations consist of activities that prolong the life of the Seashore’s numerous assets,
such as buildings, fleet, trails, utilities, roads, and water channels, many of which are more than 40
years old and were not built for current visitation levels. In FY 2011, 17.6 FTE were available for
recurring maintenance, including facilities operations staff, accounting for 34% of the Seashore’s
budget (NPS 2013c).
Facility operations are included in the maintenance division and consist of the activities necessary
to manage the Seashore’s infrastructure efficiently and safely on a day-to-day basis, as well as to
complete extensive opening and closing procedures before and after the peak summer season
(June--September). Current maintenance staff effort on deer management is limited to support of
natural resource staff when needed (e.g., for fencing installation and repairs).

MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
The management and administration division is directed by the superintendent’s office in
cooperation with the division chiefs. This team must address internal issues as well as focus on all
external commitments. Administrative staff provide essential support to all Seashore operations.
Park planning is part of the duties of this management team, which provides support on issues
related to building and zoning within the communities, as well as limited geographic information
system support. Combined expenditures for these activities in FY 2011 included 7.9 FTE and
approximately 20% of total Seashore funding, excluding investments (NPS 2013c). Management
and administration of the items summarized above would be very difficult to quantify, but it can be
assumed that the order of magnitude is similar to the divisions described above.

INTRODUCTION
This chapter analyzes both beneficial and adverse impacts that would result from implementing any
of the alternatives considered in this plan/EIS. This chapter also includes methods used to analyze
direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts. A summary of the environmental consequences for each
alternative is provided in table 7, which can be found in “Chapter 2: Alternatives.” The resource
topics presented in the current chapter and the organization of the topics correspond to the
resource discussions in “Chapter 3: Affected Environment.”

METHODOLOGY FOR ASSESSING IMPACTS
In accordance with the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations, direct, indirect, and
cumulative impacts are described under each impact topic (40 CFR 1502.16), and the impacts are
assessed in terms of context and intensity (40 CFR 1508.27). Where appropriate, mitigating
measures for adverse impacts are also described and incorporated into the evaluation. The specific
methods used to assess impacts for each resource may vary; therefore, these methodologies are
described under each impact topic.

TYPE OF IMPACT
Impacts are discussed by type, as follows (the terms “impact” and “effect” are used interchangeably
throughout this document):
Direct:
Indirect:
Adverse:
Beneficial:

Impacts that would occur as a result of the proposed action at the same time and
place of implementation (40 CFR 1508.8).
Impacts that would occur as a result of the proposed action but later in time or
farther in distance from the action (40 CFR 1508.8).
Impacts that cause an unfavorable result to the resource when compared to the
existing conditions.
Impacts that would result in a positive change to the resource when compared to the
existing conditions.

ASSUMPTIONS
The analysis of impacts incorporates several important assumptions, listed below.
 The following assumptions apply to all action alternatives:
–
Vegetation is expected to have recovered within approximately 8–10 years once target
density of deer is reached or following exclosure of deer from an area.
–
The Seashore would incorporate the practice of adaptive management during
implementation of the NPS preferred alternative. For additional information on the
concept of adaptive management, see chapter 2.
–
A minimum requirements decision guide would be completed prior to implementation
of any actions potentially affecting wilderness, including translocation of deer into the
Fire Island Wilderness to determine suitability and appropriate mitigation strategies.
 The following assumption apply to alternatives B and D:
–
Because an acceptable reproductive control agent that meets all of the established
criteria does not currently exist, the plan/EIS analyzes the impacts based on a generic
agent that would meet all criteria.

115

CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES






The following assumption applies to alternatives C and D:
–
Target deer density would be reached in approximately two years using direct reduction
methods to reduce initial deer density.
The following assumptions apply to alternative B:
–
The impacts described in this chapter are written to capture two potential scenarios
regarding the availability of an acceptable fertility control agent (as described in chapter
2) as a tool to reduce the deer population to the target density. The impact analyses first
describe the impacts of each alternative under the assumption that an acceptable fertility
control agent is available immediately; however, an acceptable agent may not be available
realistically for approximately 10 years from the drafting of this document. Therefore, the
impact analyses also describe how impacts under each alternative would differ if an
acceptable fertility control agent does not become available for another 10 years.
–
Use of an available fertility control agent would result in target deer density being
reached in approximately 13 years.
–
Fencing at the William Floyd Estate would be put up in one configuration, remain in place
for at least 10 years, and then be moved to a second configuration for another 10 years.
The following assumption applies to alternative D:
–
The Seashore could use fertility control and/or direct reduction methods to maintain
the deer population at or below the target density. Although the same 10 year delay in
availability of an acceptable fertility control method as described under alternative B
would be possible, such a delay may not cause a noticeable difference in impacts
because direct reduction methods could be used in the interim. The difference in
impacts, where applicable, is described under each topic below.

CUMULATIVE IMPACT ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY
Cumulative impacts are defined as “the impact on the environment which results from the
incremental impact of the action when added to other past, present, or reasonably foreseeable
future actions regardless of what agency (federal or nonfederal) or person undertakes such other
actions” (40 CFR 1508.7). Cumulative impacts are considered for all alternatives.
Cumulative impacts were determined for each resource by combining the impacts of the alternative
being analyzed with the impacts of unrelated actions that affect the same resource. Because some of
these unrelated actions are in the early planning stages, the evaluation of the cumulative impact is
based on a general description of the projects. These actions were identified through the internal
and external project scoping processes and are summarized below.

Past, Present, and Reasonably Foreseeable Future Actions
Tick Monitoring and Management Program. The National Park Service would continue to
monitor tick issues at the William Floyd Estate and provide education to visitors and staff regarding
ticks, tick-borne illnesses, preventive measures that visitors can take to avoid exposure to ticks, and
proper responses to tick bites. This program has the potential to impact vegetation, unique
vegetation communities, and special-status plant species; other wildlife and wildlife habitat; visitor
use and experience/recreation; public health and safety; and Seashore operations.
4-Poster Deer Treatment Devices. In 2011 Cornell University completed a three-year study on the
use of 4-Poster devices to treat deer with the pesticide permethrin when they feed, with the purpose
of killing ticks on deer. The devices were located on nonfederal lands on Fire Island and Shelter
Island and used whole kernel corn as a lure to attract the deer. The study was a condition of the New

116

Methodology for Assessing Impacts

York State Special Local Need Registration (SLN NY-07005) for the 4-Poster Tickicide (EPA
Registration Number 39039-12) to investigate control of ticks and human and wildlife associated
risks. In January of 2012, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation registered
4-Poster Tickicide along with assigning a Special Local Need Supplemental Labeling for the device.
This resulted in two Fire Island communities located within the Seashore’s boundaries requesting
deployment of a total of three devices: two devices in the village of Saltaire and one device in Fair
Harbor. The National Park Service issued a Letter of Authorization for both communities, as
requested. However, the National Park Service has concerns regarding policies and regulations
against the supplemental feeding of wildlife, specifically white-tailed deer on Fire Island. The
National Park Service continues to reject the use of the 4-Poster Tickicide on federal lands because
the devices provide a regular, introduced food source for the deer population, which contradicts
NPS Management Policies 2006 and NPS efforts to reduce human-deer interactions and lower the
abundance of deer throughout the Seashore. The registration of 4-Poster Tickicide and the
continued use of these devices on Fire Island has the potential to impact vegetation, unique
vegetation communities, and special-status plant species; the white-tailed deer population; other
wildlife and wildlife habitat, visitor use and experience/recreation, Fire Island communities and
adjacent landowners, and public health and safety.
Waterfowl Hunting. Fire Island National Seashore provides limited opportunities for waterfowl
hunting. Hunters must first obtain a hunting permit from the Seashore. Fire Island National
Seashore's East End Hunting Area is adjacent to the Fire Island Wilderness. A sportsman's
recreational vehicle driving permit may be used to access the beach on the Atlantic Ocean side of the
Fire Island Wilderness from September 15 through December 31. Access to the bay side of Fire
Island is by foot or shallow-draft vessel only. Waterfowl hunting is permitted only from Hayhole
Point, west of the Wilderness Visitor Center, to Long Cove, east of Watch Hill. No hunting is
allowed from the small bay islands north of Fire Island in this area. A portion of the Pattersquash
Gun Club's hunting rights are within the boundaries of Fire Island National Seashore. Fire Island's
West End Hunting Area is restricted to shoreline waterfowl hunting from East Fire Island, West Fire
Island, and Sexton Island. All areas are designated as “Carry-In/Carry-Out.” Waterfowl hunting has
the potential to impact other wildlife and wildlife habitat, wilderness, visitor use and
experience/recreation, and Seashore operations.
Deer Hunting and Deer Damage Permits. Deer may be hunted in the Fire Island communities and
on lands adjacent to the William Floyd Estate in accordance with state regulations guiding hunting
and state-issued deer damage permits, which allow for removal of nuisance deer outside of the
regular hunting season. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, Division
of Fish, Wildlife, and Marine Resources, publishes annual state-wide deer harvest reports. The
number of deer harvested in Suffolk County on Long Island was reported to be 2,873 deer in 2013
(NYS-DEC 2013a). The potential removal of deer by hunting and deer damage permits in the Fire
Island communities and on lands adjacent to the William Floyd Estate have the potential to impact
vegetation, unique vegetation communities, and special-status plant species; the white-tailed deer
population; other wildlife and wildlife habitat; cultural landscapes; visitor use and
experience/recreation; and Seashore operations.
William Floyd Estate Cultural Landscape Report and Treatment Plan. The National Park Service
anticipates preparing a cultural landscape report and treatment plan for the William Floyd Estate in
the reasonably foreseeable future. Consistent with the recommendations of the plan, once
completed, the lower acreage would continue to be managed as a cultural resource and would be
monitored to retain its natural resource values. Implementation of this plan has the potential to
impact vegetation, unique vegetation communities, and special-status plant species; cultural

117

CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES

landscapes; the white-tailed deer population; other wildlife and wildlife habitat; visitor use and
experience/recreation; and Seashore operations.
Enhanced Monitoring and Management of Invasive Plant Species. The National Park Service
would continue work to control nonnative invasive plant and animal species that pose a specific
threat to native species and other natural resources within the Seashore. The spread of invasive
species is recognized as one of the major factors contributing to ecosystem change and instability
throughout the world. An invasive species is “a nonnative species whose introduction does, or is
likely to cause, economic or environmental harm or harm to human, animal, or plant health”
(Executive Order 13112, “Invasive Species”). These species have the ability to displace native
species, alter fire regimes, damage infrastructure, and threaten human livelihoods. The National
Park Service is working to manage invasive species on Seashore lands through a suite of national
and local programs that use the following strategies: cooperation and collaboration, inventory and
monitoring, prevention, early detection and rapid response, treatment and control, and
restoration. In the foreseeable future, the National Park Service would develop a comprehensive
invasive species management plan for the Seashore that addresses prevention, surveillance, and
management priorities. Consistent with the Seashore’s overall management approach, educational
programs, media, incentive programs, and other outreach methods would be used to garner
assistance in this effort from Fire Island communities and other private and public entities. These
efforts have the potential to impact vegetation, unique vegetation communities, and special-status
plant species; the white-tailed deer population; other wildlife and wildlife habitat; cultural
landscapes; visitor use and experience/recreation; and Seashore operations.

ASSESSING IMPACTS USING CEQ CRITERIA
The impacts of the alternatives are assessed using the CEQ definition of “significantly” (40 CFR
1508.27), which requires consideration of both context and intensity:
a) Context – This means that the significance of an action must be analyzed in several contexts
such as society as a whole (human, national), the affected region, the affected interests, and
the locality. Significance varies with the setting of the proposed action. For instance, in the
case of a site-specific action, significance would usually depend upon the effects in the locale
rather than in the world as a whole. Short- and long-term effects are both relevant.
b) Intensity – This refers to the severity of impact. Responsible officials must bear in mind that
more than one agency may make decisions about partial aspects of a major action. The
following should be considered in evaluating intensity:
1. Impacts that may be both beneficial and adverse. A significant effect may exist even if the
federal agency believes that on balance the effect would be beneficial.
2. The degree to which the proposed action affects public health or safety.
3. Unique characteristics of the geographic area such as proximity to historic or cultural
resources, parklands, prime farmlands, wetlands, wild and scenic rivers, or ecologically
critical areas.
4. The degree to which the effects on the quality of the human environment are likely to be
highly controversial.
5. The degree to which the possible effects on the human environment are highly uncertain
or involve unique or unknown risks.
6. The degree to which the action may establish a precedent for future actions with
significant effects or represents a decision in principle about a future consideration.

118

Impacts on Vegetation, Unique Vegetation Communities,
and Special-status Plant Species

7. Whether the action is related to other actions with individually insignificant but
cumulatively significant impacts. Significance exists if it is reasonable to anticipate a
cumulatively significant impact on the environment. Significance cannot be avoided by
terming an action temporary or by breaking it down into small component parts.
8. The degree to which the action may adversely affect districts, sites, highways, structures,
or objects listed in or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places or may
cause loss or destruction of significant scientific, cultural, or historical resources.
9. The degree to which the action may adversely affect an endangered or threatened species
or its habitat that has been determined to be critical under the Endangered Species Act
(ESA) of 1973.
10. Whether the action threatens a violation of federal, commonwealth, or local law or
requirements imposed for the protection of the environment.
For each impact topic analyzed, an assessment of the potential significance of the impacts according
to context and intensity is provided in the “Conclusion” section that follows the discussion of the
impacts under each alternative. Resource-specific context is presented in the “Methodology”
section under each resource topic and applies across all alternatives. Intensity of the impacts is
presented using the relevant factors from the list in (b) above. Intensity factors that do not apply to a
given resource topic or alternative are not discussed.

IMPACTS ON VEGETATION, UNIQUE VEGETATION COMMUNITIES,
AND SPECIAL-STATUS PLANT SPECIES
METHODOLOGY
The analysis of vegetation impacts for each alternative within this section is based on best available
vegetation and deer density data collected by scientists and Seashore staff, a review of the scientific
literature, best professional judgment by NPS staff and outside experts, and noted observations by
biologists working at the Seashore. The most comprehensive set of vegetation data comes from
monitoring permanent plots at the Sunken Forest, the rarest and most sensitive vegetative
community at the Seashore. Over a 45-year period, scientists have observed vegetative changes at
the Sunken Forest due to a high density of deer. This historic data set is helpful in analyzing
potential impacts from the proposed alternatives. Until recently, scientists have not performed
vegetation sampling within other natural areas of the Seashore. In 2012 and 2013, the first such
analysis was conducted at Talisman and Blue Point on Fire Island and the deciduous forests at the
William Floyd Estate. These recent data provide baseline conditions for understanding current
impacts and directing future management decisions. Vegetation thresholds for the Sunken Forest
are based on documented plot sampling results from 1967 prior to impacts from high deer densities.
Thresholds for other forested areas on Fire Island (other than the Sunken Forest) and the William
Floyd Estate were established using a combination of actual data collected at each site (NPS 2013d,
NPS 2013e), long-term data collected in the Sunken Forest, the scientific literature, and professional
experience and opinions.
Analyzing the impacts on vegetation at the Seashore is important to determine whether actions
proposed under any alternative would comply with specific NPS policies and enacted legislation.
The Seashore has evaluated impacts in this section in the context of complying with the following
policies and laws:

119

CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES








NPS directives for managing vegetation and unique vegetation communities include
“preserving and restoring the natural abundances, diversities, dynamics, distributions,
habitats, and behaviors of native plant and animal populations and the communities and
ecosystems in which they occur; restoring native plant and animal populations in parks
when they have been extirpated by past human-caused actions; and minimizing human
impacts on native plants, animals, populations, communities, and ecosystems, and the
processes that sustain them.”(NPS 2006a, section 4.4.1).
The enabling legislation of 1964 established Fire Island National Seashore “for the purpose
of conserving and preserving for the use of future generations certain relatively unspoiled
and undeveloped beaches, dunes, and other natural features within Suffolk County, New
York, which possess high values to the Nation as examples of unspoiled areas of great
natural beauty in close proximity to large concentrations of urban population.”
The enabling legislation specifically addresses management of the Sunken Forest with the
directive that it “shall be preserved from bay to ocean in as nearly its present state as
possible.”
The ESA mandates all federal agencies to consider the potential impacts of their actions on
listed threatened or endangered species to protect the species and preserve their habitats.
Specifically, section 7 of the Endangered Species Act states that federal agencies must use
their authority to conserve listed species and ensure that their actions do not jeopardize
their continued existence. NPS policies require that Seashore actions consider effects on
state-listed species (NPS 2006a).

For ease in reviewing this section, the narrative below begins with a discussion of general vegetative
impacts Seashore-wide for each alternative, followed by specific vegetation impacts for Fire Island
natural areas, the Sunken Forest, and the William Floyd Estate. Impacts on vegetation within the
Fire Island communities are discussed under the impact topic of “Fire Island Communities and
Adjacent Landowners.”

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE A
Impact Analysis
Alternative A includes public education/interpretation, vegetation monitoring, and deer population
surveys continued at current levels. Under this alternative, no measures would be implemented to
control deer numbers at the Seashore.
Fire Island Natural Areas. Preliminary vegetation sampling has begun in areas of the Seashore to
analyze the characteristics of the vegetation across areas of the Seashore in addition to the Sunken
Forest (NPS 2013d, 2013e). These include the natural area surrounding the Light House Annex, the
Fire Island Wilderness, the William Floyd Estate, and maritime forests at the Seashore (Carrington
Tract, Talisman, and Blue Point). Under this alternative, the Seashore would continue the collection
of vegetation data across all natural areas in order to better understand deer foraging behavior,
browsing preferences, and vegetation impacts across different regions of the Seashore. Continued
vegetation monitoring would provide important information for the management of vegetation Fire
Island-wide over decades.
The substantial amount of vegetation data collected at the Sunken Forest (Art 1976, 1987; Forrester
2004; Underwood 2005; Forrester, Leopold, and Underwood 2006) and other natural areas (NPS
2013d, 2013e) of the Seashore clearly point to a decline in tree seedlings, shrubs, herbaceous annuals,
and perennials due to browsing from a high density of deer. Because alternative A would not reduce

120

Impacts on Vegetation, Unique Vegetation Communities,
and Special-status Plant Species

deer numbers as a management action and the deer density would remain at the current levels or
continue to increase across Fire Island, this trend of vegetation impacts from deer browse would
continue. Although trees above the reach of deer would not be affected, browsing pressure would be
directed at the shrub and herbaceous layers, leading to a lack of forest regeneration (Collins and
Carson 2003; Stout 1999), low survivorship of herbaceous plants, and the eventual dominance of
unpreferred and browse-resistant plants (Mosbacher and Williams 2009; NPS 2015b), several of which
are nonnative (Russell, Zippin, and Fowler 2001; Eschtruth and Battles 2008; Duguay and Farfaras
2011). Furthermore, heavy browsing would likely result in changes in vegetative structure, particularly
in forest understories, by reducing species richness and densities, promoting plants avoided by
foraging deer such as black cherry (Prunus serotina), and eventually altering ecological succession and
structure in these areas (Stout 1999; Rawinski 2008; NPS 2015b, 2013d).
Vegetation at the Fire Island Wilderness has not yet been sampled to the extent that current effects
of deer browsing on plant physical condition and species composition can be determined. Yet,
studies elsewhere have shown that heavy deer browse at population densities near those currently
present at the Fire Island Wilderness (36 deer per square mile) inhibits forest regeneration
(Tilghman 1989; Stout 1999; Horsley, Stout, and deCalesta 2003; White 2012) and results in the near
extirpation of certain herbs and shrubs (Art 1990; Southgate 2002). It is likely, therefore, that some
degree of vegetation impact from deer browse is occurring, and would continue to occur under this
alternative. Impacts may include loss of newly sprouted growth and terminal buds from woody
shrubs and vines, and the consumption of herbs and forbs beyond the ability for plants to flower
and reproduce. The Seashore would monitor the condition of vegetation at the Fire Island
Wilderness to better measure the degree that browsing impacts may be occurring. However, this
alternative would offer no actions that would lower the deer density, and the deer browsing
pressure would remain.
The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority prepared a synthesis report on
climate change with the opinion that, “major changes to ecosystems including species range shifts,
population crashes, and other sudden transformations could have wide-ranging impacts” on natural
ecosystems (Rosenzweig et al. 2011). With a projected increase of 4º-9º in average temperature by
the year 2080, sea levels are projected to rise 8–23 inches by the year 2080, making large portions of
the Seashore highly vulnerable to sea-level rise (Pendleton, Williams, and Thieler 2004). These
predicted changes in temperature and sea levels are expected to impact vegetation across the
Seashore, and include the loss of marsh vegetation due to inundation, vegetation community shifts
as dryer areas become wet, vegetative stress from saltwater intrusion, and loss of vegetation from
wind damage and overwashes caused by more intense storms. Actions proposed by the Seashore
within the Fire Island natural areas under this alternative would likely add to the impacts caused by
these effects. The deer browsing pressure is expected to remain high, thus affecting vegetation.
Those impacts would be exacerbated with the impacts of climate change. Natural areas such as the
Fire Island Wilderness could experience increased frequency of severe wind storms and flooding
causing the loss of vegetation from overwashes. In addition, habitats along the bay side of Fire Island
would incur shifts from rising water elevations that could diminish vegetative communities. This
alternative is not expected to contribute to climate change through greenhouse emissions. However,
vegetation die offs, vegetative community shifts, and increased frequency of overwashes from sealevel rise, in addition to the browsing pressure under this alternative, would have adverse impacts on
vegetation at the Fire Island natural areas.
Sunken Forest. Heavy browsing by deer can have profound effects on forest ecosystems. Under this
alternative, since deer numbers would be unmanaged at the Sunken Forest, the deer density would
remain high, currently estimated at 112 deer per square mile, and the deer would continue to have
full range and access to the Sunken Forest as foraging habitat. Similarly, alterations to vegetation at

121

CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES

the Sunken Forest due to deer browse have been occurring for decades (Art 1976, 1990; Forrester
2004; Forrester and Leopold 2005; Forrester, Leopold, and Underwood 2006, 2008). Scientists have
determined that certain understory herbaceous plants once common during the 1960s have either
decreased substantially in numbers or have been locally extirpated (Art 1990; Underwood 2005;
Forrester, Leopold, and Art 2007). In addition, prevalent overstory species identified as key
characterizing features of this rare habitat type are unable to contribute to the seedling and sapling
layers due to deer browsing (Art 1990; Forrester, Leopold, and Art 2007; NPS 2015b). Instead,
undesirable seedling and sapling constituents disliked by deer as a food source (Wakeland and
Swihart 2009; NYS-DEC 2013b) are growing in numbers (NPS 2013d), and the resulting long-term
trend is the slow conversion of the dominant holly/shadblow/sassafras canopy to something other
than a rare holly maritime forest (Forrester, Leopold, and Art 2007; NPS 2015b). As mortality in the
old-growth forest canopy creates forest gaps, those gaps would be overcome by woody vines (lianas)
(Forrester, Leopold, and Underwood 2006) and undesirable woody species such as black cherry
(Forrester, Leopold, and Underwood 2008; NPS 2015b). Overstory species such as American holly,
sassafras, oaks, and shadblow would not be able to contribute to the seedling and sapling layer
because of deer browse, and trend towards long-term canopy conversion would continue
(Forrester, Leopold, and Underwood 2008).
Other studies implicate high deer densities as the cause of imbalanced size distribution of woody
recruitment (Harlow and Downing 1970; Anderson and Loucks 1979; Marquis 1981; Tilghman
1989; Trumbull, Zielinski, and Aharrah 1989; Healy 1997; Horsley, Stout, and deCalesta 2003), as
well as impacts on herbs and forbs (Augustine and Frelich 1998). Heckel et al. (2010) suggested that
a high density of deer caused a cascading decline of forest species in a Pennsylvania study area. The
data collected at the Sunken Forest, as well as other studies, point towards a long-term continuous
change in species composition caused by deer browsing. These changes resulting from heavy deer
browsing would be combined with predicted changes from sea-level rise and climate change as
described for the Fire Island natural areas. At the Sunken Forest, vegetation would be vulnerable to
dramatic vegetative shifts from a lack of forest regeneration and heightened erosion and loss of
forested vegetation from higher water elevations along the bay shoreline. As a result, the
requirement in the 1964 enabling legislation to protect and sustain the Sunken Forest “to as nearly
its present state as possible” would be jeopardized. These adverse impacts on the vegetation under
this alternative would continue for decades at the Sunken Forest.
William Floyd Estate. The William Floyd Estate is an important national cultural feature that can
also be affected by heavy deer browsing as described for the Sunken Forest. Management of
vegetation at the William Floyd Estate is essential in maintaining the cultural landscape of this
resource. Current actions consist of maintaining ornamental plantings surrounding the historic
house, maintaining the patchwork of existing fields, and protecting the natural forests in the area
known as the “lower acreage.” Deer browse is currently impacting these vegetative areas. Heavy
deer browse in natural forests hinders understory development, forest regeneration, and natural
vegetative processes to such a degree that a browse line is observable in many areas. Under this
alternative, the deer population would not be managed, and a high density of deer, estimated at 93
deer per square mile, would continue. Key forest canopy constituents would be unable to naturally
reproduce in perpetuity because of browse impacts on seedlings and saplings. Over time, the forests
would eventually be subjected to a shift in species composition (Stout 1999; Horsley, Stout, and
deCalesta 2003; Pedersen and Wallis 2004; Long, Pendergast, and Carson 2007; Miller et al. 2009),
native understory forbs could experience local extirpation, and invasive species avoided by
browsing deer could expand. Forested areas, dominated by oak in the northern portion of the
property and blackgum in the southern section, could eventually convert to species less preferred by
foraging deer such as black locust, black cherry, and sassafras (NPS 2013e). In addition to predictive
vegetative changes caused by deer browse, Clark (1986) has documented vegetative changes that are

122

Impacts on Vegetation, Unique Vegetation Communities,
and Special-status Plant Species

already occurring at the William Floyd Estate due to sea-level rise. From historical accounts, pollen
counts, and tidal gauge data, Clark (1986) has determined that the forests have been migrating
northward (i.e., landward) as soil moisture levels have increased in the southern part of the property
closest to the bay. These changes, coupled with alterations to forest species composition caused by
deer, would continue under this alternative.
Special-status Plant Species. Special-status plant species include six state-listed species and one
federally listed species (see chapter 3). Six of the plants can be found at Fire Island and one plant is
known to occur at the William Floyd Estate. Under this alternative, the deer population density
would remain uncontrolled, creating maximum browsing pressure on these listed plants. These
plants prefer beaches, foredunes, or wetland habitats, which are systems most vulnerable to sealevel rise and a higher risk of overwashes caused by climate change. Deer browsing impacts would
be in addition to potential loss of habitat from climate change. Seashore staff perform annual
searches for special-status plants, and have directly observed browse impacts when plants are
discovered. Once plants are found, management actions at Fire Island have included minimal
fencing or netting to prevent deer from reaching individual plants. Alternative A would include the
continuation of the same management actions to protect these special-status species with no
expectation of a decline in browsing pressure. These listed plants remain highly vulnerable to
damage from deer browse before Seashore staff can implement any protective measures, which
could limit reproductive capacity and the long-term viability of sustainable plant populations.

Cumulative Impact Analysis
Past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions at the Seashore affecting vegetation under
alternative A would include the following activities: the tick monitoring and management program,
the use of 4-Poster devices, deer hunting and deer damage permits, a William Floyd Estate cultural
landscape report and treatment plan, and enhanced monitoring and management of invasive plant
species. Collectively, these actions have resulted or may result in adverse and beneficial impacts on
vegetation. For instance, the enhanced monitoring and management of invasive plant species and
deer hunting on private lands and deer damage permits would provide beneficial impacts on native
vegetation for habitat throughout the Seashore for decades. By monitoring for invasive plants, the
Seashore would be able to observe and treat new infestations before invasive species become
dominant constituents and overtake native plant habitats. In addition, deer hunting and the issuance
of deer damage permits help to reduce deer population growth and ultimately the browsing pressure
on native vegetation in the region. Conversely, the setup of the 4-Poster devices would require the
clearing of vegetation that would continue for as long as the 4-Poster devices are permitted. The
impact of these past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions would generally be long
term and both beneficial and adverse. When combining the impacts of these projects with the
impacts of alternative A, the cumulative impact would be adverse. Alternative A would contribute
an appreciable increment to the cumulative adverse impact on vegetation because deer browse
likely would be the primary driver of vegetation composition throughout the Seashore.

Conclusion
Under alternative A, the Seashore would continue to experience adverse impacts on vegetation,
unique vegetative communities, and special-status plant species due to ongoing heavy browsing
pressure from a high deer population. Impacts on vegetation would include loss of vegetation, a
reduction in plant diversity, introduction of more opportunities for invasive species to become
established and proliferate, inhibited natural regeneration of maritime forests, and long-term shifts
in species composition at the Sunken Forest and William Floyd Estate. Impacts on vegetation would
be heightened due to climate change under this alternative. In addition to sea-level rise and the

123

CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES

potential for the increased frequency of storm overwashes, the resulting impacts from deer would
include a decline in the understory species richness and density of herbs, forbs, shrubs, and woody
seedlings within maritime forests on Fire Island, the Sunken Forest, and deciduous forests at the
William Floyd Estate. The rate of browse would continue to place desirable native plant species at a
competitive disadvantage against invasive or undesirable species less preferred by deer. With no
management of deer browsing, this alternative would also contribute to the continued impacts of
the understory within the Sunken Forest. The heavy deer browse would cause a decline of this
globally rare holly maritime forest, which would impact the Seashore’s ability to meet the
obligations of its legislative mandate. Impacts would also be significant at the Sunken Forest under
this alternative due to its importance as a unique scientific resource. The Seashore would also
experience a species shift in the forests at the William Floyd Estate from deer browse. As canopy
specimens are lost to natural mortality, the absence of natural regeneration due to deer browsing
would change the character of the forest, promote invasive species in the understory, and thereby
result in adverse impacts on the vegetative community.
Special-status plant species would continue to experience browsing pressure, potentially affecting
the ability of individual stems to mature, flower, and establish seeds necessary for recovery. Under
this alternative, special-status plants would be most vulnerable to deer browse, risking the local
extirpation of these rare species. Adverse impacts on special-status plants from heavy deer
browsing pressure under this alternative would continue in perpetuity. If impacts were to rise to
the level that take of federally-listed species becomes a concern, the Seashore would re-initiate
consultation with the US Fish and Wildlife Service.
Alternative A would contribute an appreciable increment to the cumulative adverse impact on
vegetation. The above adverse impacts on vegetation, unique vegetative communities, and specialstatus plant species under alternative A would be significant because no comprehensive plan would be
enacted to preserve the natural abundances, diversities, dynamics, and distributions of native plant
populations, communities, and ecosystems. Natural processes left to proceed without human
intervention would allow current adverse impacts to continue, whereas the enabling legislation for the
Seashore calls for conservation and preservation of natural features, specifically including the unique
communities within the Sunken Forest. Actions taken to conserve listed species would take place
outside of a comprehensive deer management plan. Impacts are also considered significant because
when considering cumulative impacts, deer browse likely would be the primary driver of vegetation
composition throughout the Seashore.

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE B
Impact Analysis
Alternative B would include a gradual reduction in the deer population at the Seashore using
reproductive control techniques to promote natural vegetation recruitment and recovery. Female
deer would be treated with an immunocontraceptive as described in chapter 2 to reach the target
deer density across Fire Island of 20–25 deer per square mile within an adaptive management
framework. Analysis of impacts is based on the immediate availability of a fertility control agent or
the possibility that it may take up to 10 years before a fertility control agent meeting the NPS
requirements becomes available. This alternative assumes it would take a minimum of 13 years, and
potentially longer, to achieve the target deer density once treatment is initiated.
The target population density is expected to allow the recovery of vegetation impacted by heavy
browsing (Horsley, Stout, and deCalesta 2003). However, special management actions would be

124

Impacts on Vegetation, Unique Vegetation Communities,
and Special-status Plant Species

needed at the Sunken Forest and William Floyd Estate to protect and restore vegetation from any
browsing impacts. Thus, this alternative would include the installation of rotational and
permanent exclusion fences. This alternative also calls for the capture of deer causing negative
human-deer interactions within the Fire Island communities and translocating those deer to the
Fire Island Wilderness.
Fire Island Natural Areas. Under alternative B, a gradual reduction in the deer population using
fertility control would occur over an assumed period of a minimum of 13 years with the immediate
availability of a fertility control agent. Once fertility control is started, the resulting effect across the
natural areas of the Seashore, other than the Sunken Forest where specialized actions would occur,
would be a gradual reduction in browsing pressure on herbs, seedlings, saplings, and shrubs. The
reduction in browsing pressure would provide beneficial impacts on vegetation once the target deer
density is reached. After this point, the Seashore estimates it would take an additional 8–10 years for
forest seedlings, shrubs, saplings, and herbaceous plants to recover within the framework of an
adaptive management program based on continued vegetation monitoring. Therefore, upon the
immediate availability of a fertility control agent, vegetation recovery would occur in approximately
21–23 years (i.e., minimum 13 years for effective reduction in deer population plus 8–10 years for
forest vegetation recovery).
Under this alternative, natural areas would continue to experience vegetation impacts similar to
alternative A for the first 13 years of the plan. The lowering of the deer population would result in
the gradual reduction in browsing pressure until fertility control has lowered the deer density to the
target density. For the maritime forests at the Carrington Estate, Talisman, and Blue Point Beach, a
gradual increase in the recruitment of native shrubs and canopy species should occur once the deer
density is incrementally lowered to the target deer density of 20–25 deer per square mile (Horsley,
Stout, and deCalesta 2003). It is expected to take approximately 8–10 years beyond the deer density
target for the effects of the lower browsing pressure to result in successful vegetation recruitment.
Several forms of beneficial impacts would be realized. Beneficial impacts would include the natural
propagation of native tree seedlings, forbs, and herbaceous plants trending towards ecosystem
recovery where deer browsing damage has previously occurred. Tree seedlings would be available to
replace overstory canopy stems in the event of canopy tree mortality from insects, disease, or a
catastrophic storm event; native shrubs once common to the area would return in larger numbers;
and herbaceous coverage and species richness would increase. These beneficial impacts would help
to offset predicted impacts on vegetation from sea-level rise and climate change as described for
alternative A. Through a monitoring program, the Seashore would consider other actions to
encourage vegetation establishment using an adaptive management approach, such as the hand
removal of undesirable plants or the planting of desirable species. It should be noted that additional
compliance may be required for adaptive management actions which are not fully analyzed in this
impacts assessment.
This alternative includes the capture of deer known to approach humans within the Fire Island
communities west of Sailors Haven and translocating them to the Fire Island Wilderness. The
removal of these animals would immediately lower the deer density within the home ranges of the
translocated deer at the Fire Island communities and adjacent federal lands. Natural vegetation
impacted by deer would incur less browsing pressure, providing opportunities for native plants to
mature and reproduce.
The deer population at the Fire Island Wilderness is estimated to be approximately 62 individuals,
or 36 deer per square mile. For the first year under this alternative, an estimated 20–25 deer within
the Fire Island communities would be translocated, assuming no mortality during the translocation
process. This estimate is based on deer behavior observations by biologists during the most recent

125

CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES

deer distance sampling count, in which approximately 11% of the deer were observed approaching
humans (NPS 2011a). The addition of up to 25 deer to the Fire Island Wilderness population is
expected to slightly and temporarily increase the browsing pressure on the vegetative communities
in that region. Adverse impacts would include the increased consumption of herbaceous plants and
woody browse causing a reduction in individual stem numbers and potential decrease in species
richness and diversity. Assuming the translocated deer claim the Fire Island Wilderness as their
home range and remain in the area, the collective deer population would grow from approximately
62 to approximately 87 the first year, an increase in density from 36 to 51 deer per square mile.
Seashore biologists have observed natural fluctuations in the deer population at the Fire Island
Wilderness, which ranges between 62 and 150 deer. To the extent that an increase of 25 deer due to
translocation would remain within the natural range of population variability, biologists have
concluded that impacts on vegetation from deer browse at the Fire Island Wilderness, although
slightly higher than antecedent conditions, would be within the range experienced under natural
fluctuations of the population. Nonetheless, assuming translocated deer and resident female deer
would be immediately treated with a reproductive control agent, the deer population would
experience a gradual lowering of deer numbers over the next 13 years as adults experience natural
mortality, resulting in beneficial impacts on vegetation at the Fire Island Wilderness from lower
browsing pressure. For each subsequent year of translocation activity, the number of deer
translocated is expected to decrease as fewer deer that approach humans exist in the Fire Island
communities. Thus, the projected adverse impacts on vegetation at the Fire Island Wilderness from
translocated deer are expected to be the highest during the first year as more deer would be present
to consume herbaceous plants and woody shrubs. In future years as the population reaches the
target density, beneficial impacts would occur from lower deer browsing pressure on native herbs,
seedlings, saplings, and shrubs at the Fire Island Wilderness.
Alternative B would require the establishment and maintenance of bait stations to lure deer for
administering reproductive control treatments. Such stations may incur localized adverse impacts
on vegetation for a few months of the year as a result of hand clearing vegetation to create open
areas for bait stations. In addition, vegetation impacts are likely to occur from trampling of ground
plants by deer in concentrated numbers as they feed at the bait stations. Because bait stations would
be manned during the fall season, impacts on vegetation would be seasonal. Impacts would not
interfere with flower or seed maturation and dispersal for most plants, and vegetation recovery
would be expected during the following spring season as woody stems grow new branches and
annual/perennial herbs grow after the dormant season.
When assuming a fertility control agent is not available for up to 10 years, impacts on vegetation due
to heavy deer browse within the natural areas would persist during the 10-year delay period and
during the additional 13 years the fertility control agent is applied to reduce the deer population to
the target density. Adverse impacts on vegetation during this 23-year period would be compounded
by the effects of climate change such as vegetation shifts due to inundation from rising sea levels,
tidal flooding, and a higher frequency of major storms that could cause overwashes. Impacts would
include the loss of native herbaceous ground cover, shrubs, and understory regeneration similar to
those described for alternative A. Invasive species would become more dominant in the understory
of the maritime forests as the palatable native plants are lost from browsing with no deer population
control for up to 10 years. Once fertility control is implemented, the vegetation recovery period
would be10 years after the target deer density is reached, which is approximately 31–33 years into
the plan under this alternative. During the approximately 23 year period before the deer density is
reached, the Seashore would continue to experience potential losses of native herbaceous plants
from heavy deer browse to the point that some plants may be extirpated altogether. During this
same time period, invasive species would also have the opportunity to gain foothold, spread, and
become dominant vegetative constituents in the absence of native species competition due to heavy

126

Impacts on Vegetation, Unique Vegetation Communities,
and Special-status Plant Species

deer browse. With more invasive species dominating the Seashore ecosystems, it would be more
difficult for the Seashore to restore native vegetation. Adverse impacts on vegetation at the Fire
Island Wilderness would increase slightly for 10 years as translocated deer add to the browsing
pressure until the fertility control agent begins to gradually lower deer numbers. After the initial
translocation effort during the first year, it is expected that the number of translocated deer would
amount to two to three deer per year. As described earlier, scientists believe this increase in deer
numbers would fall within the normal range of population fluctuation at the Fire Island Wilderness
such that impacts on vegetation would not be noticeable. Once fertility control lowers the deer
population to the target density, vegetation recovery would begin, resulting in beneficial impacts
from increased growth of herbaceous ground cover, shrubs, seedlings, and saplings.
Sunken Forest. To reach desired conditions for this 44-acre, globally rare holly maritime forest
known as the Sunken Forest, this alternative would erect a permanent 8-foot-tall (VerCauteren et al.
2010) exclusion fence totaling approximately 7,127 linear feet around the entire forest. The fence
would require the clearing of a path with a maximum width of 8 feet of vegetation (4 feet on each
side) to provide workspace for installation resulting in 1.31 acres of vegetative disturbance. Clearing
would be accomplished by hand using hand tools such as machetes, pruning shears, and chain saws.
Shrubs and herbaceous plants would be removed within the immediate location of the fence, and
Seashore staff would select alignments for the fence that would minimize removal of overstory trees.
Desirable shrub and herbaceous plants could be collected by Seashore staff and replanted
immediately in other areas of the Sunken Forest. Localized ground cover vegetation would
experience impacts from contractors as they trample on plants during fence installation. Vegetation
would be allowed to recover along the edge of the fence where construction impacts occurred,
resulting in impacts being temporary. Vegetative recovery is expected within one to two growing
seasons after fence installation. Impacts on vegetation would occur during maintenance and repair
of the fence. Staff may need to clear vegetation that has fallen and damaged the fence. In doing so,
vegetation impacts would occur as crews access areas for maintenance, including trampling by
workers bringing equipment and supplies, or trimming to provide a pathway to damaged fence.
Vegetative impacts due to sea-level rise, predicted to be 8–23 inches by 2080 (Pendleton, Williams,
and Thieler 2004), are expected along the bay shoreline of the Sunken Forest where the fence
would be installed. Sea-level rise impacts include shoreline erosion, plant inundation, and salt
water intrusion. These actions, combined with the vegetation impacts in this area caused by
installation of the exclusion fence, would add to the intensity of the adverse impacts on vegetation
at the Sunken Forest.
Once the fence is installed, the Seashore would remove all deer from the Sunken Forest by
implementing a drive (i.e., a line of pedestrians making noise) to scare deer through a fence opening.
Temporary impacts on vegetation would occur as people and deer trample vegetation during the
deer drive. Other vegetation impacts may include the cutting of branches and vines with a machete
by people walking through the fenced area to drive the deer to the fence opening. Deer that
routinely use the Sunken Forest as part of their home range would be forced to reside in the outer
perimeter habitats. This may slightly increase the deer density on surrounding lands, with a
concurrent increase in browse pressure on adjacent vegetative communities until the deer density is
reduced by fertility control. Once the deer are removed from the Sunken Forest, vegetation recovery
would begin inside the fence. The Seashore would expect tree and shrub seedling recruitment from
existing stems, as well as herbaceous species reproduction from the seed bank, resulting in the
recovery of multiple layers of vegetation within 8–10 years. These actions under alternative B are
expected to result in beneficial impacts on vegetation at the Sunken Forest.

127

CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES

If a fertility control agent is not available for up to 10 years, the higher deer density caused by deer
being displaced from the Sunken Forest exclosure to the surrounding habitat would be persist up to
an additional 10 years before the population reduction efforts began. During this period, the
browsing pressure on vegetation would increase above current levels causing extreme losses of
native understory vegetation. With the added 13-year delay before fertility control reduces the deer
population to the target density (up to 23 years following implementation of the plan), native species
of herbs and shrubs would be adversely impacted to the degree that species could possibly face
localized extirpation outside of fenced areas. In addition, virtually no forest seedlings would become
established within the forest understory outside of fenced areas because of the increased browsing
pressure. Under this scenario, the use of a fertility control agent would reduce the deer density to
the initial target of 20–25 deer per square mile within 23 years and vegetative recovery would occur
within 33 years.
William Floyd Estate. Alternative B includes the use of rotational fences in the lower acreage to
exclude deer within designated areas of the forests until desired seedling counts are met and
saplings grow to a height beyond the reach of foraging deer (figure 4). In addition, the Seashore
would install a fence to protect the northern third of the William Floyd Estate from deer browse in
perpetuity. This area is the core cultural resource on the property where the historic structures are
located. Once the core area fence is installed, Seashore staff would drive the deer out of the northern
section of the property. As rotational fencing is installed, deer would be removed from those areas
as well. Meanwhile, deer population reduction would be accomplished using fertility control.
Vegetation would be monitored within rotational fences, and each rotational fence would be
removed once vegetation targets are met.
Adverse impacts on vegetation would occur under this alternative during the installation of the
fences. Approximately 2,400 linear feet of permanent fence would be installed to protect the historic
core area, and 29,700 linear feet of rotational fencing would be installed in two rotations. An
approximate 8-foot-wide area would be cleared to provide contractors sufficient space for
installation resulting in a total disturbance area of approximately 5.6 acres. Assuming a spacing of 10
feet between each fence post, an estimated total of 3,030 posts would be installed. The Seashore
would attempt to align all fences in a manner that avoids the removal of trees such as along woods
trails. In addition, lopped trees - culturally important landmarks - would be protected from damage
by fencing. Overhanging branches and individual shrubs would be cut using hand tools such as
machetes, pruning shears, or chain saws to clear away woody vegetation for construction. Herbs and
vines would be cleared at the locations of posts, and a narrow linear strip would be cleared for the
actual wire mesh fence. Soil excavated from each post hole would be sidecast next to each hole,
which would result in approximately 10 square feet of area potentially inhabited by herbaceous
vegetation that could be covered with soil. Within the cleared area for the fence, herbaceous
vegetation would be trampled by construction workers as they travel back and forth along the fence
line bringing supplies and tools. This would cause damage to vegetation until such time that the
construction is completed and herbaceous vegetation would return. Once the permanent core fence
and the rotational fences are installed, disturbed vegetation would be allowed to recover; therefore,
impacts on vegetation from fence installation would be temporary.
The installation of the core area fence is intended to exclude deer from the principal cultural
resource area in order to restore and protect plantings important to the cultural landscape. The core
area, however, would also exclude deer from approximately 40 acres of a natural hardwood forest
intermixed with evergreen species. The elimination of deer from this area would provide beneficial
impacts on the understory in this forested area as trees would be allowed to regenerate without the
threat of deer browsing. With no deer residing in this area, the forest system of ground cover,

128

Impacts on Vegetation, Unique Vegetation Communities,
and Special-status Plant Species

seedlings, vines, and shrubs would fully recover in approximately 8–10 years resulting in beneficial
impacts on vegetation.
After the historic core area fence is installed, a deer drive would be necessary to move deer out of
the fenced area. Similar to the process as described for the Sunken Forest, vegetation impacts would
be expected as humans walk through the historic core area driving deer to an exit point in the fence.
Impacts on vegetation would include the trampling of ground cover and the potential cutting of
vines and branches using a machete during the deer drive. These impacts would be adverse and
temporary. Disturbed vegetation would be expected to return once the deer drive is finished.
During the first year of the plan, the fence protecting the core historic area and the first round of
rotational fencing in the lower acreage would be installed. Deer would be displaced from these
fenced areas, resulting in deer being forced to reside in a smaller area and increasing the deer
density. Assuming a fertility control agent is immediately available, the deer density would remain
high where deer have free roam for approximately 13 years or longer until fertility control reduces
the population density to the desired target. Where deer are forced into smaller areas, browsing
pressure would increase, resulting in the continued loss, or increased loss, of native herbs, seedlings,
saplings, and shrubs, further restricting the ability of those forests to regenerate. Undesirable
seedling/sapling constituents and invasive species disliked by deer as a food source (Wakeland and
Swihart 2009; NYS-DEC 2013b) would likely grow in higher numbers as the more palatable native
species are heavily browsed. These impacts would gradually decline with the lowering of browsing
pressure as the deer density is reduced using fertility control.
For areas that are fenced, beneficial impacts on vegetation would occur as browsing is completely
removed and plants begin a recovery period lasting an estimated 8–10 years until the forest seedling
target is reached and seedlings have grown in height above the reach of foraging deer. These
protected forested areas are expected to experience increases in herbs, shrubs, and overstory
recruitment at the target rate of 1,200 seedlings per acre within multiple layers. Monitoring would
occur during the recovery period to measure vegetation growth (see appendix B). Once the
vegetation targets are met with the first round of rotational fencing (assumed to be 10 years), the
fencing would be moved to provide protection to other areas of the forest, and deer would gain
access to the previously fenced area while use of a fertility control agent continues to reduce deer
numbers to the desired target. Vegetation impacts would resume from deer browse within the
previously fenced areas; however, the lower browsing intensity from the lower deer density is
expected to facilitate forest seedling and sapling establishment sufficient to replace overstory trees.
As described for the area surrounding the Sunken Forest deer exclosure, if a fertility control agent is
not available for up to 10 years, deer displaced to smaller areas of the William Floyd Estate due to
exclosure fencing would maintain higher densities compared to current conditions for the first 10
years of the plan under this alternative. During this period, impacts on vegetation in these areas
would be the same as described for areas surrounding the Sunken Forest exclosure.
Inside the first rotational fencing exclosure, however, once the seedling/sapling target is reached
and saplings have grown above the deer browsing height (assumed to be an approximately 10-year
recovery period), the fence would be moved to exclude deer from heavily browsed forested areas to
allow vegetation recovery in new areas resulting in beneficial impacts on vegetation. Deer would be
allowed to enter the previously fenced area, which would cause adverse impacts on herbs and
shrubs in those areas as the deer resume browsing at a high population density until fertility control
is started; however, tree saplings having 10 years of growth would have grown tall enough to survive
the deer browse. Impacts would continue until either the fence is rotated back to the area after
another 10-year rotational period or the target density is reached using fertility control. In summary,

129

CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES

a 10-year delay in obtaining a fertility control agent under this alternative would place higher
numbers of deer into smaller areas for longer periods of time at the William Floyd Estate causing
browsing impacts on native understory vegetation, increased competition from invasive plants, and
a loss of forest regeneration where deer are free to roam. The recovery of native vegetation across
the lower acreage from fencing would also require a longer time.
Under this alternative, the use of a fertility control agent would reduce the deer density to the initial
target of 20–25 deer per square mile is estimated to require up to 13 years and vegetative recovery
would occur in an additional 10 years, for a total of 23 years. If a fertility control agent is not
available for up to 10 years, vegetation recovery would be delayed by an additional 10 years for a
total of 33 years following implementation of the plan.
Special-status Plant Species. In the initial years under this alternative, special-status plant species
would be subjected to similar adverse impacts from deer browse as described under alternative A
until population reduction is achieved. An exception may be those special-status plants residing
within the Fire Island Wilderness, which may be exposed to a slightly higher risk of deer browse the
first year with the translocation of deer from the Fire Island communities. As deer numbers across
the Seashore begin to decrease via fertility control, however, browsing pressure on these species
would decline, and the risk of deer browse to special-status plants would be reduced, although
direct impacts on plants from deer trampling would remain a possibility. This alternative would
provide beneficial impacts on special-status species in future decades as the deer browsing pressure
is reduced, allowing more opportunities for special-status plants to mature, regenerate, and increase
in numbers. These actions would help to offset any potential impacts caused by climate change such
as damage to habitat from overwashes or sea-level rise.
If a fertility control agent is not available for up to 10 years, adverse impacts on special-status species
from deer browse would continue for the 10-year duration as described for alternative A. Staff
would continue annual searches for special-status plants and provide netting or fencing around
plants to protect them from deer browse. As the deer density is reduced to the target level within
approximately 23 years (or 33 years if an acceptable fertility control agent is not available for another
10 years), beneficial impacts on special-status plants would occur because of the lower deer
browsing pressure.

Cumulative Impact Analysis
Past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions at the Seashore affecting vegetation under
alternative B would include the following activities: the tick monitoring and management program,
use of 4-Poster devices, deer hunting and deer damage permits, a William Floyd Estate cultural
landscape report and treatment plan, and enhanced monitoring and management of invasive plant
species. Collectively, these actions have resulted or may result in adverse and beneficial impacts on
vegetation. For instance, the enhanced monitoring and management of invasive plant species would
provide beneficial impacts on vegetation as new infestations are discovered and treated, protecting
native vegetation across the Seashore. In addition, deer hunting and the issuance of deer damage
permits contribute to the reduction of deer numbers and impacts on vegetation regionally due to a
corresponding reduction on browsing. Conversely, the actions from maintaining the 4-Poster
devices would require that vegetation be cleared in the immediate vicinity of the 4-Poster device
resulting in impacts on vegetation. The impact of these past, present, and reasonably foreseeable
future actions would be both beneficial and adverse. When combining the impacts of these projects
with the impacts of alternative B, the cumulative impact would be long term and beneficial.
Alternative B would contribute an appreciable beneficial increment to the cumulative beneficial
impact on vegetation.

130

Impacts on Vegetation, Unique Vegetation Communities,
and Special-status Plant Species

Conclusion
Alternative B would result in beneficial impacts on vegetation across Fire Island, within the Sunken
Forest, other maritime forests, and at the William Floyd Estate as the deer population is lowered and
maintained using fertility control. The timing of the beneficial impacts would vary depending on
whether a fertility control agent is immediately available or available within 10 years. If an agent is
available immediately, beneficial impacts related to lower deer population would be realized within
23 years; alternately, the timeline could be up to 33 years if an agent does not become available
before 10 years. Natural vegetative communities impacted by heavy deer browse would recover,
providing increased populations of native herbaceous plants, increased forest seedlings, and
increased species diversity. Compared to the other action alternatives, this alternative would take
the longest to reach the targeted vegetative success criteria. For the federally owned maritime forests
other than the Sunken Forest (which would be fenced), vegetation impacts from a high deer density
would continue to be adverse until the decline in browsing pressure begins from a reduced deer
population using fertility control. The impacts expected during the 22–23 year period would include
the continued spread of invasive species and the growing dominance of undesirable native plants
such as black cherry (Prunus serotina) avoided by deer that, established in higher numbers,
management actions to control these species would become more intensive and restoration of
vegetative communities more difficult. Once the target deer density is reached, vegetation recovery
is expected to occur over time within natural areas of the Seashore resulting in beneficial impacts.
Regardless of the availability of an acceptable fertility control agent, fencing would be installed
immediately at the Sunken Forest and the William Floyd Estate to protect vegetation from deer
browse while fertility control reduces the deer population to the target density, resulting in
vegetation recovery in these areas. Direct adverse impacts on vegetation would occur during
installation of fences. Permanent fences would be installed at the Sunken Forest and the William
Floyd Estate historic core area, and rotational fencing would occur at the William Floyd Estate
lower acreage lasting an estimated 8–10 years. During the time rotational fencing is protecting
vegetation, there would likely be direct adverse impacts on understory vegetation outside of fenced
areas because of an initial increase in deer density and browsing pressure until the fertility program
is implemented. However, impacted vegetation would be restored at the William Floyd Estate
within all fenced areas providing beneficial impacts on forest understory vegetation from the
absence of deer browse. Within the context of an adaptive management program, rotational fencing
would eventually be removed as a management tool once vegetation and the deer density targets are
reached, and as fertility control is applied to maintain the deer density at the target level, resulting in
beneficial impacts on vegetation at the William Floyd Estate.
Localized plants would be either trampled or cut to make room for the installation of posts and the
wire mesh fence at the Sunken Forest and William Floyd Estate, and localized ground vegetation
would be trampled again during the removal of rotational fences after approximately 20 years
causing adverse impacts on vegetation. It is expected that disturbed herbaceous vegetation from
fence installation and removal would be reestablished within one growing season, and shrubs would
begin to reestablish within two or three growing seasons. Impacts on localized vegetation at the
Sunken Forest would be long term and adverse in the immediate area of the posts and wire mesh
fence since the fence would remain a permanent fixture. At the William Floyd Estate, impacts on
vegetation at the locations of the posts and wire mesh fence from the first rotation are expected to
last approximately 20 years until deer targets are met, vegetation is allowed to recover within the
exclosure, and the fence is removed.
The addition of translocated deer to the Fire Island Wilderness deer population is not expected to
noticeably detract from the overall health of the vegetative community. Scientists have concluded

131

CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES

that the additional number of deer that approach humans from the Fire Island communities,
estimated at 20–25 deer the initial year, would not cause the population at the Fire Island Wilderness
to exceed the existing average year-to-year population range. Impacts on vegetation from deer
browse would be very small at the start of the plan with the addition of the translocated deer. As
fertility control across Fire Island reduces the deer population at the Fire Island Wilderness,
vegetation impacts due to deer browse would be decreased, providing indefinite beneficial impacts
in this area.
Impacts on special-status plant species under alternative B would be similar to alternative A at the
initiation of the plan. If a fertility control agent is not available for 10 years, those adverse impacts would
continue until the agent becomes available and is in use. Once fertility control begins to reduce the deer
numbers, the risk of deer browse impacts on special-status plants would also be reduced. Plant species
would have greater opportunities for expansion and ultimate recovery under this alternative.
Management actions to protect special-status species from deer as described under alternative A would
continue to be employed by Seashore staff under this alternative. Seashore staff would continue to
inventory and protect known plants from deer browse using small fencing or screening.
Alternative B would contribute an appreciable beneficial increment to the cumulative beneficial
impact on vegetation, unique vegetation communities, and special-status plant species. Although
there is a risk of continued adverse impacts, similar to those described under alternative A,
especially in the case that an acceptable fertility control method is not available immediately, the
Seashore would undertake fencing and expects to reduce the deer population to a point at which
vegetation can successfully regenerate after approximately 23–33 years. Ultimately, the beneficial
impacts on vegetation, unique vegetative communities, and special-status plant species under
alternative B are expected to be significant because the Seashore would implement a comprehensive
plan to preserve the natural abundances, diversities, dynamics, and distributions of native plant
populations, communities, and ecosystems. The NPS intervention in current natural processes
would allow Seashore managers to conserve and preserve the natural features, specifically including
the unique communities within the Sunken Forest, as called for the Seashore’s enabling legislation.
Actions taken to conserve listed species would be incorporated into the comprehensive deer
management plan. Beneficial impacts are also considered significant because when considering
cumulative impacts, deer browse likely would be the primary driver of vegetation composition
throughout the Seashore if left unmanaged. The adverse impacts on vegetation could approach
significant outside of fenced areas depending upon how long of a delay there is before the deer
population density is reduced. Although a comprehensive plan would be enacted to preserve the
natural abundances, diversities, dynamics, and distributions of native plant populations,
communities, and ecosystems, immediate vegetation protection measures would be limited to
exclosures, allowing a heightened risk of local species extirpation and altered species abundance.

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE C
Impact Analysis
Alternative C would use direct reduction methods (i.e., sharpshooting, capture and euthanasia, and
hunting) to reduce and maintain the deer population. Small-scale fencing would be used around
selected plants within the historic core area. In addition, this alternative would involve the capture
and removal of deer the approach humans within the Fire Island communities rather than capture
and translocation.

132

Impacts on Vegetation, Unique Vegetation Communities,
and Special-status Plant Species

Fire Island Natural Areas. Under this alternative, the deer population would decrease as deer
would be directly removed via direct reduction methods to reach the target density of 20–25 deer
per square mile. Vegetative communities on Fire Island such as the maritime forests at Talisman,
Carrington Estate, and Blue Point Beach would experience fewer deer and lowered browsing
pressure as described under alternative B, but within a much shorter timeline of approximately two
years. These vegetative communities would move towards recovery as described under alternative
B, but along a much shorter timeframe, approximately 10–12 years sooner. The more immediate
reduction of deer browse would reduce the chance that species would be locally extirpated and
would also reduce the chance that less natural species abundances (including both invasive species
and native species not preferred by deer) would become established.
Hunting would be an available action to help control deer numbers at the Fire Island Wilderness.
Consistent with the Seashore guidelines, hunters would not be allowed to use motorized vehicles in
the Fire Island Wilderness.
As described for alternative B, this alternative is not expected to contribute to the predicted climate
change-induced vegetation impacts from inundation or salt water intrusion such as vegetation die
offs and community shifts along the upland/wetland transitions of the Seashore. However, with
lower deer numbers and lower browsing pressure under this alternative, benefits gained in
vegetation growth and establishment would likely help to offset impacts from climate change, such
as the vegetative recovery of future erosion and overwashes caused by severe storms.
Special-status plant species would experience long-term beneficial impacts with a reduction of the
deer population as described under alternative B. The benefits, however, would be realized much
sooner with population reduction, within two years, compared to fertility control taking 13 years or
longer. The reduction of the deer population would lessen the browsing pressure on special-status
plants giving them the opportunity to mature, reproduce, and expand in numbers.
Sunken Forest. In keeping with the management objective that the Sunken Forest should be
completely free from deer browse as described in alternative B, this alternative would also erect an
exclusion fence around this globally rare holly maritime forest. Impacts associated with this action
would be the same as those described for alternative B.
William Floyd Estate. Under alternative C, the Seashore would implement sharpshooting to reduce
deer numbers at the William Floyd Estate. This would result in an immediate decline in the deer
density with the expectation that the target population density would be reached within one to two
years. Beneficial impacts on vegetation would be the same as described under alternative B but
would begin earlier because deer target density would be reached within two years compared to 13
years or longer for alternative B. Forest seedlings, saplings, shrubs, and herbaceous ground cover are
expected to increase with lower deer browsing pressure. The Seashore would monitor vegetation
establishment within the forested areas in the context of an adaptive management program to
determine if the vegetation response reaches planned targets.

Cumulative Impact Analysis
Past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions at the Seashore affecting vegetation under
alternative C would include the following activities: the tick monitoring and management program,
use of 4-Poster devices, deer hunting and deer damage permits, a William Floyd Estate cultural
landscape report and treatment plan, and enhanced monitoring and management of invasive plant
species. Collectively, these actions have resulted or may result in adverse and beneficial impacts on
vegetation. For instance, a William Floyd Estate cultural landscape report and treatment plan and

133

CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES

the enhanced monitoring and management of invasive plant species would provide long-term
beneficial impacts on vegetation as a cultural landscape resource in the core area of the William
Floyd Estate and native vegetation for habitat across the Seashore. Conversely, the actions from the
tick monitoring and management program may require treatment of vegetation such as mowing to
manage tick populations causing adverse impacts on vegetation. The impact of these past, present,
and reasonably foreseeable future actions would be both beneficial and adverse. When combining
the impacts of these projects with the impacts of alternative C, the cumulative impact would be
beneficial. Alternative C would contribute an appreciable beneficial increment to the cumulative
beneficial impact on vegetation.

Conclusion
Vegetation at the Seashore under alternative C would experience a recovery from heavy deer
browse resulting in beneficial impacts in perpetuity, similar to those described for alternative B. The
rapid removal of deer to reach the desired deer density would cause beneficial impacts from
vegetation recovery to be realized within a shorter timeframe compared to alternative B. Beneficial
impacts would include the recovery of native vegetation within the Fire Island natural areas, Sunken
Forest, and William Floyd Estate. The Seashore would experience a return of native forest
regeneration, growth and expansion of native herbs, and the recovery of once common shrub
species. The growth and recovery of vegetation is expected to offset predicted impacts from climate
change due to sea-level rise and damage from a higher frequency of storm events. Beneficial impacts
on vegetation would occur at the Sunken Forest with the installation of an exclusion fence to keep
all deer out as described for alternative B. Once the fence is installed, vegetation would recover,
providing beneficial impacts in perpetuity necessary for meeting the enabling legislative mandate
regarding protection of the Sunken Forest. Important canopy constituents such as American holly
(Ilex opaca) and shadblow (Amelanchier canadensis) would regenerate, become established, and
grow to be key components of the sapling layer. Adverse impacts on vegetation would occur at the
Sunken Forest in order to clear for the installation of the exclusion fence. Because the fence would
remain in perpetuity, impacts on vegetation would be long term to maintain the fence as described
for alternative B. Temporary impacts on vegetation at the Sunken Forest would also occur as
construction workers trample and disturb vegetation during the fence installation process.
Disturbed vegetation from fence installation and maintenance would be expected to return in one
or two growing seasons. Alternative C would also lower the deer browsing pressure on specialstatus plant species and on vegetation at the William Floyd Estate. Special-status plants would have
greater opportunities to mature, propagate, and increase in numbers.
Alternative C would contribute an appreciable beneficial increment to the cumulative beneficial
impact on vegetation, unique vegetation communities, and special-status plant species. Overall, the
beneficial impacts on vegetation, unique vegetation communities, and special-status plant species
under alternative C are expected to be significant because the Seashore would implement a
comprehensive plan to preserve the natural abundances, diversities, dynamics, and distributions of
native plant populations, communities, and ecosystems. The NPS intervention in the current natural
processes would allow Seashore managers to conserve and preserve the natural features, specifically
including the unique communities within the Sunken Forest, as called for the Seashore’s enabling
legislation. Actions taken to conserve listed species would be incorporated into the comprehensive
deer management plan. Beneficial impacts are also considered significant in the context of
cumulative impacts because deer browse likely would be the primary driver of vegetation
composition throughout the Seashore if left unmanaged. Adverse impacts would not be significant
because of their temporary, small-scale nature.

134

Impacts on Vegetation, Unique Vegetation Communities,
and Special-status Plant Species

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE D
Impact Analysis
Deer population reduction would initially be performed using direct reduction methods (i.e.,
sharpshooting, capture and euthanasia, and hunting) to quickly lower deer numbers, and the
population density would be maintained using direct reduction and/or a NPS approved fertility
control agent. If an agent is not available, direct reduction methods would be used to maintain the
deer population at the desired level. Fencing would be used at the Sunken Forest the same as under
alternatives B and C. Permanent fencing would be installed to protect the historic core area of the
William Floyd Estate as in alternative B.
Alternatives C and D call for the rapid reduction of the deer population and the installation of an
exclusion fence around the Sunken Forest. Alternative D differs from alternative C in that the
Seashore may choose to use fertility control methods to maintain the deer population at the target
density in addition to or in place of direct reduction. The method of deer density maintenance used
is not expected to affect vegetation differently. Thus, beneficial impacts on vegetation would be the
same as those described under alternative C.

Cumulative Impact Analysis
Past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions at the Seashore affecting vegetation under
alternative D would include the following activities: the tick monitoring and management program,
use of 4-Poster devices, deer hunting and deer damage permits, a William Floyd Estate cultural
landscape report and treatment plan, and enhanced monitoring and management of invasive plant
species. Collectively, these actions have resulted or may result in adverse and beneficial impacts on
vegetation, the same as those described for alternative C. The impact of past, present, and
reasonably foreseeable future actions would be both beneficial and adverse. When combining the
impacts of these projects with the impacts of alternative D, the cumulative impact would be
beneficial. Alternative D would contribute an appreciable beneficial increment to the cumulative
beneficial impact on vegetation.

Conclusion
Vegetation at the Seashore would experience beneficial impacts under alternative D, the similar
those described for alternatives B and C. Beneficial impacts would be realized within 2 years as deer
are rapidly removed to reach the target deer density. Recovery of native herbs, seedlings, saplings,
and shrubs would be expected within about 8 to10 years in natural areas, the Sunken Forest, and the
William Floyd Estate. Adverse impacts on vegetation would occur at the Sunken Forest and the
William Floyd Estate historic core area in order to install the exclusion fence as described for
alternative B, and vegetation recovery is expected within the forest providing long-term beneficial
impacts on vegetation at the Sunken Forest. Benefits include the growth and expansion of native
herbaceous plants in the forest understory, the establishment of native shrubs, and the
establishment of forest seedlings and saplings regenerated from key overstory tree species. The
reproductive capacity of the maritime forests would be increased to ensure canopy replacement in
the event of tree mortality from disease or storm damage. Beneficial impacts on special-status plant
species would occur as deer browsing pressure is reduced Fire Island-wide. Seashore staff would
continue to implement screens and fencing around special-status plants to protect them from deer
browse as described under alternative A. Benefits would occur regardless of the method of deer
density maintenance chosen by Seashore managers (i.e., direct reduction and/or fertility control).

135

CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES

Alternative D would contribute an appreciable beneficial increment to the cumulative beneficial
impact on vegetation, unique vegetation communities, and special-status plant species. Overall, the
beneficial impacts on vegetation, unique vegetation communities, and special-status plant species
under alternative D are expected to be significant because the Seashore would implement a
comprehensive plan to preserve the natural abundances, diversities, dynamics, and distributions of
native plant populations, communities, and ecosystems. The NPS intervention in the current natural
processes would allow Seashore managers to conserve and preserve the natural features, specifically
including the unique communities within the Sunken Forest, as called for the Seashore’s enabling
legislation. Actions taken to conserve listed species would be incorporated into the comprehensive
deer management plan. Beneficial impacts are also considered significant in the context of
cumulative impacts because deer browse likely would be the primary driver of vegetation
composition throughout the Seashore if left unmanaged. Adverse impacts would not be significant
because of their temporary, small-scale nature.

IMPACTS ON WETLANDS
METHODOLOGY
Map locations of wetlands were compared with locations of proposed development and
modifications of existing facilities. Predictions about site impacts were based on previous studies of
impacts on wetlands from similar projects and recent scientific data.
Resource-specific context for the evaluation of impacts on wetlands includes the following:











Executive Order 11990, which directs the National Park Service to avoid to the extent
possible the long- and short-term adverse impacts associated with the destruction or
modification of wetlands and to avoid direct or indirect support of new construction in
wetlands wherever there is a practicable alternative.
Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (33 USC 1344), which prohibits the discharge of dredge
or fill material into waters of the United States, including wetlands, except as permitted by
the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). Rules for implementing section 404 of the Clean
Water Act are found in 33 CFR 320-330. The state of New York also regulates wetlands
under the authority of Chapter X, Part 660-663 of the state code of regulations. The New
York State Department of Environmental Conservation is the regulatory agency that
oversees state water quality certification under section 401 of the Clean Water Act.
The Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA), administered by the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management (OCRM),
provides for management of the nation's coastal resources and balances economic
development with environmental conservation.
NPS Procedural Manual 77-1 (NPS 2012a) adopts a goal of “no net loss of wetlands”; in
addition, the National Park Service will strive to achieve a longer-term goal of net gain of
wetlands.
Wetlands have unique functions and values (e.g., groundwater recharge; stormwater storage
and discharge; unique habitats; etc.) that are intrinsic to wetlands and cannot be easily
duplicated or replaced.
Wetland functions and values have a direct effect on the quality of the associated wetland systems.

The assessment of impacts on wetlands near the Sunken Forest is based on a review of existing
vegetative studies and mapping (Klopfer et al. 2002); interpretation of recent aerial photographs;

136

Impacts on Wetlands

knowledge and familiarity of wetland systems from experience working in the field at the Sunken
Forest; and, basic assumptions regarding fence installation.
The geographic area of analysis for this impact topic is limited to a linear corridor in the Sunken
Forest where the installation of fencing has the potential to impact wetlands.

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE A
Impact Analysis
Alternative A would continue with the current actions to manage the deer density at the Seashore.
This alternative would not include any actions that would impact wetlands.

Cumulative Impact Analysis
No past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions may affect wetlands in the area of
analysis. Additionally, alternative A would have no impacts on wetlands in the area of analysis.
Consequently, there would be no cumulative impacts on wetlands under alternative A.

Conclusion
Under alternative A, no actions would occur related to deer population management at the Seashore
that would require encroachments and/or impacts on wetlands and their functions.

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE B
Impact Analysis
Impacts on wetlands under alternative B would include the construction of a fence surrounding the
44-acre Sunken Forest to provide protection to vegetation from deer browse (figure 10). The fence
would remain in place in perpetuity. Emergent and scrub-shrub wetlands occur north of the Sunken
Forest, and the fence is expected to bisect these wetlands for a total distance of 273 linear feet.
Approximately 21 linear feet of emergent marsh wetlands would be bisected, and 252 linear feet of
the blueberry shrub wetland type would be bisected. Construction of the fence would involve
disturbances to wetlands by clearing an 8-foot-wide path that would require wetland vegetation to
be cut near the soil surface and laid aside to make room for contractors to get the equipment and
fencing material into the work areas and install the wooden posts and wire mesh fence. A 0.05-acre
area of wetlands would be impacted. Posts holes would be created either by hand or by a hand-held
motorized auger to an estimated depth of 4 feet. Soil excavated from the post holes would be
sidecast into wetlands resulting in small discharges of soil material into the wetlands. Temporary
impacts on the wetlands may occur from sediment suspension within the water column in those
areas with surface water. The sidecast soils from the post holes would be of insufficient volume to
cause a conversion of the wetland type, and vegetation is expected to return within the first growing
season. Sea-level rise, projected to be between 8 and 23 inches by the year 2080 (Pendleton,
Williams, and Thieler 2004), would collectively add to the impacts on wetlands as a result of this
alternative. The placement of the fence near the bay shoreline could exacerbate shoreline erosion
and soil instability because of a rising water level. However, the fence is not expected to alter
wetland functions such as habitat for aquatic species, water filtration, and storm
attenuation/buffering.

137

CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES

Cumulative Impact Analysis.
No past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions may affect wetlands in the area of
analysis. Consequently, there would be no cumulative impacts on wetlands under alternative B.

Conclusion
Under alternative B, a fence would be installed to protect vegetation in the Sunken Forest from deer
browse. The fence is expected to bisect jurisdictional wetland marsh and scrub-shrub areas causing
adverse impacts on wetlands. Impacts include the clearing of approximately 0.05 acre of wetland
vegetation (273 linear feet at a width of 8 feet) to make room for installing the fence, the excavation
of soil for the posts holes, and the sidecasting of the soils extracted from the post holes into
wetlands. Wetland vegetation is expected to return in the cleared areas within the first growing
season, and wetland functions would not be impaired from the placement of the fence. As bayside
shoreline erosion is expected to occur as sea-level rise causes the shoreline to encroach towards the
Sunken Forest, the permanent fence may exacerbate erosion causing impacts on wetland vegetation.
There would be no cumulative impacts on wetlands under alternative B. These adverse impacts of
alternative B on wetlands are not expected to be significant because there would be no loss of
wetland functions, wetlands would be avoided to the extent possible, and all minor impacts would
be consistent with policies and regulations for the protection of wetlands.

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE C
Alternative C also includes the placement of a fence around the Sunken Forest at the same location
as described under alternative B. Therefore, impacts on wetlands under this alternative would be the
same as those described under alternative B.

Cumulative Impact Analysis
No past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions may affect wetlands in the area of
analysis. Consequently, there would be no cumulative impacts on wetlands under alternative C.

Conclusion
Impacts under alternative C would be the same as those described under alternative B. There would
be no cumulative impacts on wetlands under alternative C. These adverse impacts of alternative C
on wetlands are not expected to be significant because there would be no loss of wetland functions,
wetlands would be avoided to the extent possible, and all minor impacts would be consistent with
policies and regulations for the protection of wetlands.

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE D
Alternative D includes the placement of a fence around the Sunken Forest at the same location and
in the same manner as described under alternative B. Therefore, impacts on wetlands under this
alternative would be the same as for alternative B.

Cumulative Impact Analysis
No past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions may affect wetlands in the area of
analysis. Consequently, there would be no cumulative impacts on wetlands under alternative D.

Conclusion
Adverse impacts under alternative D would be the same as those described under alternative B.
There would be no cumulative impacts on wetlands under alternative D. These adverse impacts of
alternative D on wetlands are not expected to be significant because there would be no loss of
wetland functions, wetlands would be avoided to the extent possible, and all minor impacts would
be consistent with policies and regulations for the protection of wetlands.

IMPACTS ON THE WHITE-TAILED DEER POPULATION
METHODOLOGY
Years of deer count data related to the immunocontraception study, the professional experience
and deer observations of researchers and Seashore staff, and scientific literature were used to
evaluate impacts on the deer population described in this section. Data generally include deer
population estimates from distance sampling and sex ratios that continue to be collected annually.
Data on actual physical condition are unavailable at the Seashore, except via personal observations
(Underwood 2005). This discussion primarily focuses on the impacts on the population as a whole,
with limited discussion about the impacts on individual animals as a result of action treatments.
Resource-specific context for the white-tailed deer population is as follows:







The absence of hunting and natural predators on Fire Island has allowed what was originally
a very small deer population in the 1970s to reach a density of over 207 deer per square mile
in some areas of the Seashore by 1995, not only within the natural environment but in
many portions of the human environment (i.e., the Fire Island communities and Seashore
facilities).
Directives include “preserving and restoring the natural abundances, diversities, dynamics,
distributions, habitats, and behaviors of native plant and animal populations and the
communities and ecosystems in which they occur; restoring native plant and animal
populations in parks when they have been extirpated by past human-caused actions; and
minimizing human impacts on native plants, animals, populations, communities, and
ecosystems, and the processes that sustain them” (NPS 2006a, section 4.4.1).
The enabling legislation of 1964 established Fire Island National Seashore “for the purpose
of conserving and preserving for the use of future generations certain relatively unspoiled
and undeveloped beaches, dunes, and other natural features within Suffolk County, New
York, which possess high values to the Nation as examples of unspoiled areas of great
natural beauty in close proximity to large concentrations of urban population.”

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE A
Impact Analysis
Under alternative A, the deer population would remain uncontrolled resulting in high densities
across Fire Island and the William Floyd Estate as described in chapter 3. Seashore staff would

141

CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES

continue monitoring deer numbers using distance sampling techniques (Buckland et al. 1993) within
the Fire Island communities, Sailors Haven, Fire Island Wilderness, and William Floyd Estate; and,
the Seashore would continue providing technical guidance to Fire Island community residents on a
limited basis through public outreach and education about deer management, reducing artificial
food supplies, and offering information about gardening with deer-resistant native plants.
Under this alternative, deer would continue to reside at the Seashore in high numbers and to
compete for available resources. Continued increases in the population may affect overall deer
condition and reproductive patterns of the herd if nutrition becomes a limiting factor (Verme 1969).
As an example, data collected from the Seashore deer hunt of 1988-89 showed differences in
pregnancy rates between deer residing in the Fire Island Wilderness (50%) and those residing in the
Fire Island communities (100%) (Underwood 2005), likely due to the availability of food supplies in
the communities. In addition, body weights of fawns at the Seashore were found to be less than
those harvested on Long Island, which was attributed to the high population densities on Fire Island
at the time (Underwood 2005).
Adverse impacts on the deer population would continue due to deer that approach humans having
established home ranges in the Fire Island communities, Sailors Haven, and Smith Point County
Park. Future generations of deer would also become conditioned to humans in the absence of
predation and harassment (Underwood 2005) and as offspring remain with their mothers (Porter,
Mathews, and Underwood 1991) resulting in the continuation of negative human-deer interactions.
While deer would continue to be attracted to the Fire Island communities for the food sources
offered (household garbage, browsing on private ornamental plants and landscaping, approaching
humans for food handouts), deer would continue to be susceptible to harm from unintentional
ingestion of harmful substances (Stone et al. 1999), as well as accidental injuries caused by cracks in
boardwalks and jumping fences.
In the absence of any population control, deer numbers at the 613-acre William Floyd Estate have
ranged between 84 and 140 individuals in recent years, which equates to a deer density of 93–155
deer per square mile. The high deer density results in many individuals competing for limited
foraging resources. Although no noticeable decline in deer health has been observed in recent years,
malnutrition resulting in weight loss, lower reproductive rates, and higher fawn mortality could
occur if deer numbers grow higher with no mechanisms for population control. Deer currently
cross through gaps in the William Floyd Estate property fence to expand their foraging range into
adjacent suburban neighborhoods, and this activity would continue where deer can gain access
through fences.
The effects of climate change and sea-level rise could greatly impact the habitat quality for the deer
herd at the Seashore. Tree cover could be lost, herbaceous vegetation could die from salt water
intrusion, and vegetation growing on backdunes could be completely lost from intense storms and
overwashes. Without any mechanism to control deer numbers under this alternative, events that
destroy forage available to deer could add stress to an already overpopulated deer herd causing
malnutrition and mortality.

Cumulative Impact Analysis
Past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions at the Seashore affecting deer under
alternative A would include the following activities: the tick monitoring and management program,
use of 4-Poster devices, deer hunting and deer damage permits, a William Floyd Estate cultural
landscape report and treatment plan, and enhanced monitoring and management of invasive plant
species. Collectively, these actions have resulted in adverse and beneficial impacts on deer.

142

Impacts on the White-tailed Deer Population

Enhanced monitoring and management of invasive plant species would provide long-term beneficial
impacts on deer through improvements to deer habitat. Additionally, deer hunting and deer damage
permits on nonfederal lands may remove some deer that also partially inhabit federal lands. As a
result, additional habitat may be available for the remaining deer population and competition for
resources may be reduced at a local scale. Conversely, the Seashore anticipates the continued use of
4-Poster devices by the private communities on Fire Island as described in chapter 3. Currently, two
Fire Island communities deploy a total of three devices: two devices in the village of Saltaire and one
device in Fair Harbor. Last measured in 2014, the deer density in this region was approximately 264
deer per square mile, one of two highest at the Seashore (Davis Park had approximately 265 deer per
square mile in 2014). As an artificial food source of several tons each year, the 4-Posters would
continue to attract large numbers of deer to this localized area, thereby increasing the chance of
negative human-deer interactions by luring deer into the Fire Island communities, resulting in long­
term adverse impacts on deer. Deer that use the 4-Poster devices would experience a beneficial
impact from reduced parasite loads and an abundant available food source.
The impact of these past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions would generally be both
beneficial and adverse. When combining the impacts of these cumulative actions with the impacts of
alternative A, alternative A would contribute appreciably to an overall adverse cumulative impact on
the white-tailed deer population.

Conclusion
Alternative A would continue the current deer management at the Seashore with no planning
mechanism to control the deer population. This would result in adverse impacts on the deer
population due to overpopulation, reduced overall physical condition of the population, and higher
mortality. Negative human-deer interactions and negative deer behavior would continue as deer
within the Fire Island communities continue to approach humans for food handouts and forage
through household garbage. Alternative A would contribute appreciably to an overall adverse
cumulative impact on the white-tailed deer population.
The above adverse impacts on the white-tailed deer population under alternative A would not be
significant because the native deer population and related natural processes would be left to proceed
without human intervention. The deer population would continue to be one of many natural features
conserved and preserved by Seashore managers per the Seashore’s enabling legislation.

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE B
Impact Analysis
Alternative B would implement several actions to reduce deer numbers and human-deer
interactions across the Seashore. The Seashore would control deer numbers using fertility control,
personnel would be added to the Seashore staff to serve as a liaison between the Seashore and the
Fire Island communities, and coordination efforts would increase with the Fire Island communities
to assist with reducing food handouts by people and also better manage garbage placed outside for
pickup. Deer that approach humans from the Fire Island communities would be translocated to the
Fire Island Wilderness. Fencing would be implemented to exclude deer from the Sunken Forest and
portions of the William Floyd Estate until desired deer density and vegetation conditions are met.
To control deer numbers across the Seashore, alternative B would rely on the use of a fertility
control agent. As summarized in chapter 2, the National Park Service has established criteria for the
use of a fertility agent that includes the following:
143

CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES

1. There is a federally approved and state registered fertility control agent for application to
free-ranging white-tailed deer populations.
2. The agent provides multiple-year (three or more) efficacy (80%–100%) to minimize the
labor required to administer the drug to a large number of deer annually.
3. The agent can be administered through remote injection to avoid capturing the animal on a
regular basis and to increase the efficiency of distribution.
4. The agent would leave no harmful residual in the meat; meat would be safe for human and
non-target animal consumption.
5. The agent would have minimal impact on deer behavior (e.g., reproductive behaviors, social
behaviors, out of season estrous cycling).
This alternative would require that female deer be first captured and tagged for identification and
then administered the fertility control agent. Options available to capture animals include cannon
nets (Hawkins, Martoglio, and Montgomery 1968), clover traps (Clover 1956; VerCauteren,
Beringer, and Hygnstrom 1999), or tranquilizing darts. Future treatments of tagged animals would
be accomplished remotely without having to handle animals. Approximately 70%-90% of the
females would need to be treated the first year and each subsequent third year of the plan in order to
reduce deer population growth (Hobbs, Bowden, and Baker 2000; Rudolph, Porter, and
Underwood 2000) depending on the efficacy of the agent, the success of capture for the first
treatment, and the ease of remote delivery during subsequent treatments. This equates to
approximately 615-1155 treatments over the first 15 years of the plan on Fire Island (assuming the
immediate availability of a fertility control agent) and between 170-350 treatments to females at the
William Floyd Estate. Details on the number of females to be treated are provided in chapter 2.
One of the NPS criteria for an approved fertility control agent is to have minimal impact on deer
behavior (e.g., reproductive behaviors, social behaviors, out of season estrous cycling). Yet, some
behavior responses are to be expected when eliminating or altering estrus cycles in females. For
some treated individuals, out of season breeding behavior is possible since reproductive hormones
which are responsible for estrous cycling are not suppressed (Miller et al. 2009; McShea et al. 1997;
Fraker et al. 2002; McShea and Rappole 1997). Repeated estrous cycling has the potential to extend
the population breeding season and rutting behaviors. Additionally, extended estrous seasons may
result in late pregnancies if the vaccine fails (Fraker et al. 2002; McShea et al. 1997) causing fawns to
be born later in the summer or fall, which may lead to higher fawn mortality as winter ensues. In
addition, increased activity during rut can be energetically costly for both sexes. While this is likely
offset by the lack of pregnancy demands in female deer, it may have cumulative effects on energy
expenditures in male deer (Walter, Kilpatrick, and Gregonis 2003; McShea et al. 1997). Alternately,
treated females may experience increased body condition and a longer lifespan compared to
untreated individuals as a result of reduced energetic costs of pregnancy and lactation (Warren
2000; Hone 1992). Details on the current science of fertility control are provided in appendix D.
Deer within high urban populations tend to have small home ranges (O’Connell and Sayre 1989;
DeNicola et al. 2000), and in order for the Seashore to annually administer fertility control to the
proper number of females under this alternative, the Seashore would need to manage trapping and
darting locations throughout Fire Island and the William Floyd Estate. This would require that bait
stations be maintained to attract deer for maximum success. Such stations would introduce artificial
food sources that would promote the undesirable food conditioning behavior of deer and result in
alterations in deer foraging behavior for several weeks as staff use the stations to treat deer. Impacts on
the population would include the disruption of normal deer behavior in the wild by administering
artificial food supplies. Once the treatments are completed, baits at the stations would be removed.

144

Impacts on the White-tailed Deer Population

Actions taken by the Seashore under this (and all) action alternatives would include increased
staffing to assist with implementing this plan, increasing efforts to better coordinate with Fire Island
communities, improved outreach to educate the public about negative human-deer interactions, and
increasing enforcement (ticketing) of people who provide food handouts to deer. These actions
would reduce negative human-deer interactions at the Fire Island communities and Seashore
facilities. Adverse impacts on the deer would include a reduction in human food supplies that deer
currently exploit, potentially causing impacts on deer condition within the Fire Island communities.
Beneficial impacts, however, include reversing the incidences of human-deer contact from visitors
and residents directly feeding deer with human food, reducing the availability of exposed garbage as
a food source for deer through improved garbage management, altering deer behavior to accord
more with the natural environment and not the human environment, and a reduction in the
attractiveness of the Fire Island communities to deer because of artificial food sources that
ultimately lead to cases of deer injuries from fencing and boardwalks.
Alternative B would include the use of exclusion fencing at the Sunken Forest and portions of the
William Floyd Estate. This action would cause temporary disturbances to deer during the
installation of the fences. Once fences are installed, deer would be subject to hazing via human
drives to force deer out of fenced areas, which could cause short-term stress and potential injury to
deer when encountering the fence. While fences are erected, disruptions would occur to deer
movements and home ranges resulting in impacts on local populations. Deer injury could occur as
individuals with the strongest fidelity to their original home range may attempt to jump fences
(VerCauteren et al. 2006). Furthermore, deer excluded from their normal home ranges would be
forced to rely on less land space per animal causing higher concentration of animals competing for
natural food resources. This could create nutritional stress, or ultimately cause malnutrition during
the initial stages of the management program until a fertility control agent lowers the population.
The fence at the Sunken Forest would remain in perpetuity. However, the fencing at the William
Floyd Estate would include a perpetual fence to shield the core historic area from deer and
rotational fencing lasting longer than 20 years to promote the recovery of understory forest
vegetation in the lower acreage. Once the rotational fences are removed, deer would be allowed to
return to the excluded areas, the deer density level would be achieved through fertility control, and
impacts on the resident deer population would be long term and beneficial due to lower deer
numbers competing for resources and improvements to habitat from a recovered forest understory.
Under this alternative, deer that approach humans within the Fire Island communities would be
captured, anesthetized, radio collared, and translocated to the Fire Island Wilderness. Translocated
deer would be tracked to monitor and understand their movements post-release. Because whitetailed deer generally exhibit strong fidelity to established home ranges (Marchington and Hirth
1984; Jones and Witham 1990; DeNicola et al. 2000; Underwood 2005; Campbell et al. 2004) and
philopatric behavior (i.e., remain near area of birth) (Porter, Mathews, and Underwood 1991;
Henderson et al. 2000), individuals translocated to the Fire Island Wilderness would experience the
stress of establishing fidelity to a new home range and interacting with unfamiliar resident deer
(Miller 1997; Porter, Mathews, and Underwood 1991). Deer have been known to travel far distances
across Fire Island (O’Connell and Sayre 1989), and translocated deer would exhibit some degree of
dispersal from the release site (Jones, Mathews, and Porter 1997), leaving the possibility that
individuals may leave the Fire Island Wilderness altogether as they seek out a new home range.
Alternately, they may attempt to return to their original home range. Beringer et al. (2002) found that
translocated white-tailed deer exhibited broader home range sizes compared to resident deer,
implying that, for translocated deer, ranges may extend beyond the boundaries of the Fire Island
Wilderness into developed areas of the neighboring Davis Park towards the west and Smith Point
County Park towards the east. Jones, Mathews, and Porter (1997) found no differences in the social
behavior and home range sizes of resident deer in reaction to translocated deer, which suggests that

145

CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES

measurable adverse impacts on resident deer may not occur at the Fire Island Wilderness from the
introduction of translocated deer.
The increase in deer numbers at the Fire Island Wilderness from the translocated deer, however,
would cause a slight, temporary increase in deer browsing pressure in that area, potentially affecting
the availability of browse and overall habitat quality for deer. Biologists have concluded that the
slight population increase at the Fire Island Wilderness from the added translocated deer would fall
within the range of natural population fluctuations. Impacts on the deer population at the Fire
Island Wilderness may be adverse due to the added competition for food sources. Nonetheless,
those impacts, however small, would occur until the translocated and resident female deer are
treated with a fertility control agent and a reduction in the overall population density would occur.
Overall, the translocation of deer to the Fire Island Wilderness is not expected to have adverse
impacts on the Seashore deer population. In time as those translocated deer with the highest
propensity to approach humans die from natural causes, the deer population would begin to
comprise individuals more inclined to behave as part of the natural environment rather than the
human environment. Accidental injury to deer during capture is possible, as well as unintended
mortality from myopathy. Assuming proper capture techniques are used, a 2%–6% mortality rate
from handling deer would be expected (Peterson et al. 2003; Mathews, Paul-Murphy, and Frank
2005; Kreeger and Armeno 2012). Studies demonstrate that post-release mortality of translocated
deer is consistently higher than mortality rates of resident deer (O’Bryan and McCullough 1985;
Jones and Witham 1990; Jones, Mathews, and Porter 1997; Beringer et al. 2002; Parker et al. 2007),
particularly the first year. Mathews, Paul-Murphy, and Frank (2005) found a mortality rate of 6.1%
during capture and release associated with a capture-sterilization-release project at an urban park in
Illinois. In addition to these losses, under this alternative, post-release mortality can be expected for
deer translocated to the Fire Island Wilderness.
Future changes to the natural environment at the Seashore from climate change and sea-level rise
are expected to impact habitat used by deer. Because alternative B would reduce deer numbers
resulting in less competition for resources and improved overall deer condition, the deer population
would better withstand stresses from habitat damage caused by dramatic weather occurrences
attributable to climate change such as a higher frequency of storm events, higher storm intensity,
and storm flooding and overwashes. The lower deer browsing pressure on the vegetation would also
allow faster vegetation recovery after storm damage, which would benefit deer habitat.
If an acceptable fertility control agent does not become available for the first 10 years, the impacts
related to use of such an agent would also be delayed. This includes alterations in deer behavior
described above caused by the agent and use of baiting and trapping for inoculation. Other
operational improvements to enhance educational outreach would begin immediately, resulting in
lower incidences of negative human-deer interactions such as hand feeding of deer as described
earlier. At the William Floyd Estate, a 10-year delay in implementation of fertility control would
require deer to be moved out of the fenced areas. Deer removed from the fenced areas then would
have been displaced in smaller areas for a longer period of time (23 years or longer) before
population density could be decreased, potentially causing severe nutritional stress, low fawn
survival rates, and malnutrition. Once the population density is reached in approximately 23 years,
the fencing would be removed, and the deer would have the freedom to roam through the improved
habitat throughout the lower acreage. This would result in beneficial impacts on the deer population
at the William Floyd Estate beyond the 23-year timeframe.

146

Impacts on the White-tailed Deer Population

Cumulative Impact Analysis
Past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions at the Seashore with the potential to impact
white-tailed deer include the following activities: the tick monitoring and management program, use
of 4-Poster devices, deer hunting and deer damage permits, a William Floyd Estate cultural
landscape report and treatment plan, and enhanced monitoring and management of invasive plant
species, as described under alternative A. The impact of these past, present, and reasonably
foreseeable future actions would be both beneficial and adverse. When combining the impacts of
these actions with the impacts of alternative B, alternative B is expected to contribute appreciably to
the overall beneficial cumulative impact on the white-tailed deer population.

Conclusion
Alternative B would include operational changes at the Seashore (hiring new personnel,
coordination with Fire Island communities, public education/interpretation) intended to reduce the
instances of negative human-deer interactions. These actions would provide beneficial impacts on
the deer population by managing deer as part of the natural environment rather than the human
environment. This alternative would reduce deer density throughout the Seashore using an agent
with criteria established by National Park Service. The initial target deer density would be 20–25
deer per square mile for the entire Seashore.
Fertility control would be expected to have both adverse and beneficial impacts on deer behavior.
Baiting of deer for inoculation during the fall season would be required resulting in adverse impacts
on the deer population by promoting artificial feeding and causing alterations in deer foraging
behavior. Because of fertility control, males would experience an increased rutting period causing
higher energy exertion through the fall and winter months, and females would see an overall
improvement in health and longevity with the absence of pregnancy. Treating female deer with a
fertility control agent would require multiple treatments on nearly all females in the population.
Adverse impacts on female deer would be expected resulting in stress and injury from capturing and
treating animals with the fertility control agent, potential infection from treatments, and
unintentional mortality during handling and post-release. If an acceptable fertility control agent is
not available, these impacts could be delayed for up to 10 years (until an agent becomes available for
implementation).
Reduction in the population density is expected to provide beneficial impacts on the deer herd with
fewer individuals competing for resources and an improvement in overall deer condition. In
addition, during the first year, this alternative would capture approximately 20–25 deer that
approach humans and reside in the Fire Island communities, and translocate those deer to the Fire
Island Wilderness. This would cause a slight impact on the deer at the Fire Island Wilderness due to
increased competition for food sources. Translocated deer may experience stresses of being placed
in an unfamiliar area, and would need to establish new and familiar home ranges, resulting in
adverse behavior impacts on those deer. However, adverse behavior impacts are not expected to
deer already residing at the Fire Island Wilderness.
Fencing would be used to protect vegetation at the Sunken Forest and portions of the William Floyd
Estate. Rotational fencing at the William Floyd Estate would continue until vegetation and deer
density targets have been met. Adverse impacts are expected on deer from fencing because of
disruptions to deer movements and home ranges and potential nutritional stress where animals are
concentrated until the deer density is lowered via fertility control. Until fertility control lowers the
density, impacts on the deer population at the William Floyd Estate would occur because of the
smaller space per animal, higher competition for resources, and the potential depletion of natural

147

CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES

food supplies causing malnutrition. Beneficial impacts would eventually occur once the vegetation
and density targets are met because fewer deer would be residing at the William Floyd Estate
competing for resources, and habitat quality would improve with the recovery of understory
vegetation available for foraging. This alternative would take the longest time to reach the desired
population target but would have beneficial impacts on the overall deer herd in perpetuity from a
reduced population size. When combining the impacts of these cumulative actions with the impacts
of alternative B, alternative B would contribute appreciably to the overall beneficial cumulative
impact on the white-tailed deer population by improving habitat quality and greater food resources
available per capita, decreasing frequency of human-deer interactions but maintaining adverse
biological and behavioral impacts associated with fertility control treatments.
Adverse impacts on the white-tailed deer population under alternative B are not significant because,
although some alteration in natural behavior would occur, human intervention would be part of a
comprehensive plan to otherwise preserve and restore natural dynamics of the native ecosystem.
Further, the NPS intervention in the current population dynamics would allow Seashore managers
to conserve and preserve natural features as called for in the Seashore’s enabling legislation.
Beneficial impacts would not be significant because while a lower population would provide a more
natural dynamic, the deer population has been thriving in both natural and developed habitats
without human intervention to this point.

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE C
Impact Analysis
Alternative C would reduce deer numbers at the Seashore using direct reduction methods (i.e.,
sharpshooting, capture and euthanasia, and hunting). The initial target density would be 20–25 deer
per square mile for Fire Island and the William Floyd Estate with the expectation of reaching
vegetation targets within 8–10 years. If vegetation recovery does not occur as planned based on the
target deer density, the Seashore would implement adaptive management to further reduce the deer
population in order to proportionally reduce deer browsing pressure until vegetation recovery
occurs. This alternative would achieve the targeted population density at a rapid rate. Bait stations
would be placed at various locations across the Seashore to attract deer for removal and to ensure
that the removal rate is relatively uniform throughout all areas. Deer that approach humans within
the Fire Island communities would be captured and euthanized. An exclusion fence would be
erected around the Sunken Forest similar to alternative B to provide permanent protection from
deer browse.
Deer mortality would be expected to increase greatly the first two to three years under alternative C
due to implementation of direct reduction methods. Deer would be removed regardless of age or
sex, but the overall balance of age classes and sex ratio would remain. To reach the target deer
density, alternative C would remove approximately 163-395 deer the first two years of the plan at
Fire Island, and approximately 52-134 deer would be removed from the William Floyd Estate over
the course of the first two to three years. This equates to an annual mortality rate of 65% in year 1
and 15%-60% in year 2 at Fire Island. By comparison, the harvest rate from hunting of the statewide
deer population in New York was estimated at 21%–26% between 2003 through 2007 (USDA 2009).
When adding the unreported mortality from vehicle collisions and deer damage permits to the
hunting harvest rate, the statewide mortality rate would be higher than the reported 21% to 26%.
Nevertheless, alternative C would result in a higher than normal deer population mortality rate,
estimated to be 2–3 times greater than the statewide mortality rate from hunting, resulting in adverse

148

Impacts on the White-tailed Deer Population

impacts on the deer population during the first two years of the plan compared to other deer
populations across the state of New York.
Once the initial reduction is achieved, however, annual removals would occur at a rate of
approximately 30 individuals for Fire Island and 15 individuals at the William Floyd Estate to
maintain the population in the range of 20–25 deer per square mile. This represents an annual
mortality rate of 23% for Fire Island and 13% for the William Floyd Estate, which is lower or within
the range of the mortality rate for the deer population across the state of New York. Thus, after year
2, no adverse impacts on the overall deer population would be expected to result from deer removal
for target density maintenance. In perpetuity, the continued removal of deer would maintain the
lower deer density necessary for vegetation recovery, create improved habitat quality, and ultimately
lead to the beneficial impacts on deer due to less competition among individuals, improved forage
availability, and improved deer health conditions.
Under this alternative, changes in deer behavior are possible as a result of implementing deer
removal, particularly with hunting. For sharpshooting and capture/euthanasia, increased deer
movement may result as Seashore staff travel to and from bait sites, occupy shooting areas, discharge
firearms, and conduct trapping activities. These actions are expected to take place across a relatively
small area at any one time and be of short duration, several weeks each year. Furthermore, hunting
may alter deer movements in the Fire Island Wilderness. Williams, DeNicola, and Ortega (2008)
studied deer behavior responses when subjected to a controlled hunt and found that deer exhibited
an increase in home range size during the hunting season as deer seek refuge from hunters. Based on
this study, deer exposed to hunting at Fire Island Wilderness may broaden their movements and
seek refuge outside the limits of hunting, towards Davis Park and Smith Point County Park,
potentially causing deer to move into populated areas and resulting in adverse impacts on deer as
more human-deer interactions may occur in those areas.
Alternative C would include the same actions and impacts on the deer population as described for
alternative B related to hiring additional staff, coordination with the Fire Island communities, public
education/interpretation related to deer access to human food, higher level of enforcement, and
improved garbage management. In addition, this alternative would include capture and euthanasia
of deer that approach humans within the Fire Island communities. By removing those deer, this
alternative would reduce the incidences of negative human-deer interactions resulting in beneficial
impacts on the deer population. Deer not removed from the population would be less attracted to
the Fire Island communities because of lower human food availability, and the number of deer
injuries from boardwalks and fence-jump attempts would be reduced within the Fire Island
communities.
Under alternative C, vegetation recovery and habitat improvements would be realized from reduced
deer browsing pressure with the rapid reduction in deer numbers. This action would provide
beneficial impacts on the deer population by promoting the growth of native vegetation available for
foraging, and thus improving the physical condition of the deer herd. These actions would help to
offset any future impacts on the deer herd resulting from damage to habitats caused by sea-level rise
and increased frequency of storm events from higher temperatures due to climate change. The
Seashore would expect increases in native understory density and species richness within the
maritime forests on Fire Island and the deciduous forests at the William Floyd Estate, providing
increased habitat quality for deer.
Erection of a fence around the Sunken Forest would have similar adverse impacts on deer, including
noise during construction and loss of habitat, as described in alternative B.

149

CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES

Cumulative Impact Analysis
Past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions at the Seashore with the potential to impact
white-tailed deer include the following activities: the tick monitoring and management program, use
of 4-Poster devices, hunting and nuisance permits, a William Floyd Estate cultural landscape report
and treatment plan, and enhanced monitoring and management of invasive plant species, as
described under alternative A. The impact of these past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future
actions would generally be both beneficial and adverse. When combining the impacts of these
actions with the impacts of alternative C, alternative C is expected to contribute appreciably to the
overall beneficial cumulative impact on the white-tailed deer population.

Conclusion
Alternative C would include the rapid reduction of deer numbers at the Seashore through use of
direct reduction methods. Once the target deer density is reached, the deer population also would
be maintained using direct reduction methods. The mortality rate of the deer population during the
first two to three years of this alternative would be higher than normal, resulting in adverse impacts
on the Seashore deer population. However, once the target deer density is reached, the expected
rate of deer removal (mortality rate) would be less than or near the same as other deer populations
across the state of New York. Beneficial impacts would occur on the Seashore deer population
because the population reduction would provide a recovery of heavily browsed vegetation
throughout the Seashore that would enhance the overall habitat value for deer.
As with all action alternatives, alternative C would implement park operation actions (hiring new
personnel, coordination with Fire Island communities, public education/interpretation) intended to
reduce the instances of negative human-deer interactions. These actions would provide beneficial
impacts on the deer population by managing for deer as part of the natural environment rather than
the human environment. While deer may be subjected to fewer human food sources resulting in
impacts on deer health within the Fire Island communities, deer health Fire Island-wide would be
expected to improve as deer gain access to improved habitat quality and experience less competition
for resources. These benefits would be realized more rapidly than alternative B. Alternative C would
result in beneficial impacts on the deer populations within the Fire Island communities by removing
those deer that approach humans and thereby reducing undesirable human-deer interactions. At the
Fire Island Wilderness, deer are expected to alter movement patterns and increase their home range
sizes in reaction to hunting as a means to seek refuge from hunters. This may result in adverse
impacts on the deer population in that region of the Seashore as deer exert more energy seeking
refuge. Furthermore, deer seeking refuge from hunting may wander into unfamiliar areas such as the
neighboring Davis Park or Smith Point County Park causing increased human-deer interactions.
When combined with the cumulative impacts of alternative C, alternative C is expected to
contribute appreciably to the overall beneficial cumulative impact on the white-tailed deer
population.
Adverse impacts on the white-tailed deer population under alternative C are not significant because,
although the population would see a rapid decrease, human intervention would be part of a
comprehensive plan to otherwise preserve and restore natural dynamics of the native ecosystem.
Further, the NPS intervention in the current population dynamics would allow Seashore managers
to conserve and preserve natural features as called for in the Seashore’s enabling legislation.
Beneficial impacts would not be significant because while a lower population would provide a more
natural dynamic, the deer population has been thriving in both natural and developed habitats
without human intervention to this point.

150

Impacts on the White-tailed Deer Population

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE D
Impact Analysis
Alternative D would include the use of direct reduction methods (i.e., sharpshooting and/or
hunting) to rapidly reduce deer numbers to the target density, and Seashore managers would use the
same direct reduction methods and/or fertility control to maintain the target density. Capture and
euthanasia of deer that approach humans in the Fire Island communities would take place to reduce
human-deer interactions. The intent of this alternative is to rapidly reduce the deer density to allow
for the recovery of native vegetation impacted by deer browse and to reduce human-deer
interactions. An exclusion fence would be installed around the Sunken Forest to eliminate all deer
for vegetation recovery as described in alternatives B and C. The historic core at the William Floyd
Estate would be protected from deer using a fence as described for alternative B.
Impacts on deer under alternative D would be the same as those described for alternative C with
regard to the use of direct reduction methods. The number of deer estimated to be removed is the
same as for alternative C. Impacts include initial high mortality rates the first few years of the
population reduction period and potential behavior changes such as broadened home range
movements as described for alternative C. Bait stations would be established across the Seashore to
attract deer to areas for removal, which may cause adverse impacts on the population from
disturbances by Seashore staff to create, maintain, and travel to and from stations. Once the
population is stabilized at or below the target density, the same fertility control techniques described
in alternative B could be implemented to replace or supplement direct reduction methods. If fertility
control is implemented, deer would be captured, tagged, and inoculated for the first chemical
treatment, and treatments would continue indefinitely approximately every three years for each
female. Adverse impacts on the deer population from fertility control would be the same as those
described under alternative B, including the possibility of extended breeding seasons and late
fawning. Assuming a fertility control agent is not available for up to 10 years after plan
implementation, use of direct reduction methods would continue to be used as the primary tools for
maintaining the population at the desired density level.
As in alternative C, deer that approach humans within the Fire Island communities would be subject
to capture via an anesthetic and euthanized under this alternative. In addition, the Seashore would
enhance operations such as hiring new staff, and expanding public education/interpretation within
the Fire Island communities and at federal areas of high visitation (e.g., Sailors Haven and Watch
Hill) to reduce undesirable human-deer interactions. By reducing the incidences of negative humandeer interactions, this alternative would result in beneficial impacts on the deer population.

Cumulative Impact Analysis
Past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions at the Seashore with the potential to impact
white-tailed deer include the following: the tick monitoring and management program, use of 4­
Poster devices, deer hunting and deer damage permits, a William Floyd Estate cultural landscape
report and treatment plan, and enhanced monitoring and management of invasive plant species, as
described under alternative A. The impact of these past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future
actions would be long term and both beneficial and adverse. When combining the impacts of these
actions with the impacts of alternative D, alternative D is expected to contribute appreciably to the
overall beneficial cumulative impact on the white-tailed deer population.

151

CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES

Conclusion
Similar to alternative C, alternative D also would result in beneficial impacts on the deer population
at the Seashore. The population reduction would provide for the recovery of heavily browsed
vegetation and would enhance the overall habitat value for deer resulting in long-term beneficial
impacts on the deer population. Overall, deer condition would be expected to improve as habitat
quality improves and deer have access to higher quality forage. Deer condition also would improve
as a result of less competition for resources as the population density is lowered. Adverse impacts on
the deer population would occur in the initial two to three years of this alternative due to the higher
than normal mortality from the rapid population control. However, the beneficial impacts described
above would continue indefinitely as the population is maintained at the target deer density using
direct reduction methods and/or fertility control (once an agent is available). Deer that approach
humans residing within the Fire Island communities would be captured and euthanized resulting in
fewer undesirable human-deer interactions, and the Seashore would expand operations to promote
changes in negative human behaviors affecting deer such as feeding deer by hand and leaving
garbage open and available for deer to easily access. These actions would result in beneficial impacts
on the deer population because it would incur lower incidences of negative human-deer encounters,
and deer would become more habituated to the natural environment rather than the human
environment. When combining the impacts of the cumulative actions with the impacts of alternative
D, alternative D is expected to contribute appreciably to the overall beneficial cumulative impact on
the white-tailed deer population
Impacts on the white-tailed deer population under alternative D are not significant because,
although the population would see a rapid decrease, human intervention would be part of a
comprehensive plan to otherwise preserve and restore natural dynamics of the native ecosystem.
Further, the NPS intervention in the current population dynamics would allow Seashore managers
to conserve and preserve natural features as called for in the Seashore’s enabling legislation.
Beneficial impacts would not be significant because while a lower population would provide a more
natural dynamic, the deer population has been thriving in both natural and developed habitats
without human intervention to this point.

IMPACTS ON OTHER WILDLIFE AND WILDLIFE HABITAT
The Seashore is an important source of wildlife habitat for area birds, mammals, and reptiles set
against a backdrop of suburban sprawl throughout Long Island. Habitats include oceanfront
beaches and dunes, maritime forests, freshwater wetlands, tidal marshes, and deciduous hardwood
forests. The Seashore is particularly important as habitat for migratory birds along the Atlantic
flyway accommodating numerous species of passerines, shorebirds, and waterfowl. The alternatives
being reviewed in this plan would result in varying degrees of impacts on other animal species and
their habitats. This section compares those impacts between the no-action alternative and the three
action alternatives.

METHODOLOGY
This section analyzes impacts on other wildlife and wildlife habitat as a result of the alternatives.
General information about wildlife at the Seashore is provided in chapter 3 of this document. The
assessment in this section is based on a qualitative evaluation of wildlife presence, habitat quality,
and how those habitats would be impacted negatively or positively by proposed actions. Impact
assessments were made using professional experience, an understanding of the natural processes at
the Seashore, and the scientific literature.

152

Impacts on Other Wildlife and Wildlife Habitat

Resource-specific context for other wildlife and wildlife habitat is as follows:







Directives include “preserving and restoring the natural abundances, diversities, dynamics,
distributions, habitats, and behaviors of native plant and animal populations and the
communities and ecosystems in which they occur; restoring native plant and animal
populations in parks when they have been extirpated by past human-caused actions; and
minimizing human impacts on native plants, animals, populations, communities, and
ecosystems, and the processes that sustain them.” (NPS 2006a, section 4.4.1).
The enabling legislation of 1964 established Fire Island National Seashore “for the purpose
of conserving and preserving for the use of future generations certain relatively unspoiled
and undeveloped beaches, dunes, and other natural features within Suffolk County, New
York, which possess high values to the Nation as examples of unspoiled areas of great
natural beauty in close proximity to large concentrations of urban population.”
The Seashore is particularly important as habitat for migratory birds along the
Atlantic flyway.

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE A
Impact Analysis
Under alternative A, the deer population would remain uncontrolled resulting in high densities
across Fire Island and the William Floyd Estate as described in chapter 3. Seashore staff would
continue monitoring deer numbers using distance sampling techniques (Buckland et al. 1993) within
the Fire Island communities, Sailors Haven, Fire Island Wilderness, and William Floyd Estate; and
the Seashore would continue providing technical guidance to Fire Island community residents on a
limited basis through public education/interpretation about deer management, reducing artificial
food supplies, and offering suggestions for planting native ornamental species.
High deer densities have been documented as negatively affecting other wildlife. In a Pennsylvania
study, deCalesta (1994) determined that deer densities reaching 64.5 deer per square mile caused a
27% reduction in avian richness and abundance of intermediate canopy nesting species and a 37%
decline in species abundance. Species such as the eastern wood pewee (Contopus virens), indigo
bunting (Passerina cyanea), least flycatcher (Empidonax minimus), yellow-billed cuckoo (Coccyzus
americanus), and the cerulean warbler (Dendroica cerulea) were not observed when deer density
exceeded 20.5 deer per square mile, and the eastern phoebe (Sayornis phoebe) and American robin
(Turdus migratorius) were not observed at 64.5 deer per square mile. McShea and Rappole (2000) in
northern Virginia similarly found that bird usage of deer exclosure areas was higher where
vegetative layers and structure were protected from deer browse compared to foraged areas of high
deer density where vegetative structure and density were lower. Avian species richness did not
change to a large extent following erection of deer exclosures because some species were replaced
by other species over time as vegetation underwent successional changes. In Delaware, Tymkiw,
Bowman, and Shriver (2013) found that areas of high deer density (i.e., >51 deer per square mile or
20 per square kilometer) had fewer species of shrub nesting birds, low-canopy foraging birds, and
neotropical migrants compared to areas with deer densities lower than 25.9 deer per square mile (10
per square kilometer). The authors concluded that areas in Delaware with deer densities less than 51
deer per square mile (20 per square kilometer) have the greatest avian richness and abundance.
Changes in habitat structure from deer can also lead to impacts on invertebrates. Allombert,
Stockton, and Martin (2005) measured an eightfold decrease in insect abundance and a sixfold
decrease in species density within a forested community experiencing heavy deer browse compared

153

CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES

to an area without deer. Vegetation-dwelling insects were most affected due to the removal of
habitat by deer.
Heavy browsing by deer can also cause adverse impacts on habitat used by small mammals. Byman
(2011) erected deer exclosures in heavily browsed habitats in Pennsylvania and began capturing
small mammals over 10 years. The author found higher numbers of southern red-backed vole
(Myodes gapperi), woodland vole (Microtus pinetorum), and the northern short-tailed shrew
(Blarina brevicauda) using the exclosure areas, concluding that deer browse was affecting habitat
quality for these small mammals.
Cook and others (2010a, 2010b) documented a decline in the reptile populations at the Seashore
since the 1970s, particularly at the William Floyd Estate. Exact reasons for the decline are unknown,
but the authors speculated that the use of DDT pesticides during the 1950s, saltwater intrusion, and
development on adjacent properties were potential causes. Browsing impacts on vegetation caused
by the high deer density were not examined by Cook et al. (2010b) as a reason for decline in reptile
populations. Most amphibians reside within or adjacent to aquatic habitats and impacts by deer
under this alternative are not expected to occur to these species.
Alternative A would continue current management actions for deer at the Seashore. Under this
alternative, no mechanism would be in place that would reduce deer numbers, and the high density
of deer would continue. Impacts on other wildlife most likely began decades ago as deer reached
high densities and began impacting understory vegetation across the Seashore. Under this
alternative, heavy browsing by deer would continue to cause degradation to the understory of
natural areas at Fire Island and the William Floyd Estate resulting in ongoing changes to vegetation
(Underwood 2005) that would have long-lasting adverse effects on wildlife and wildlife habitat at
the Seashore. These impacts would be exacerbated by effects on wildlife habitats from climate
change, such as increased frequency of overwashes, shoreline erosion, and vegetation inundation.
Vegetation density would be reduced from deer browse within forested areas resulting in an
anticipated decline in shrub nesting and foraging use by songbirds, as well as impacts on insect
populations reliant upon vegetation as a key element to their habitat. Similarly at the William Floyd
Estate, small mammals (e.g., voles and shrews, and herbivores such as the cottontail rabbit) and
possibly reptiles using the deciduous hardwood forests would experience habitat degradation
resulting from heavy deer browsing, which in turn would cause decreased survival rates among
these species due to low food supplies and loss of protective cover from predators.
With the perpetuation of high deer numbers within the Fire Island communities under this
alternative, residents would continue to use fencing as the major technique to protect property and
ornamental plants or landscaping from deer. Fencing would fragment habitats available for use by
other wildlife and impede the ability of some species to freely move about in search of habitats to
sustain their needs, including natural migration and daily movements (VerCauteren, et al 2006).
Another way in which deer could impact habitat value for other species includes the heavy browsing
of native species, opening habitats for invasive plants to proliferate. Knight et al. (2009) observed an
abundance of invasive plants outside of exclosure fences in a Pennsylvania forest. Their data
support the hypothesis that invasive species success is due in part to preferential foraging of native
herbs and the creation of open patches from deer browse. Eschtruth and Battles (2009) also found
that browsing was important in contributing to the success of invasive species. William, Ward, and
Ramakrishnan (2008) found that deer were a key dispersal agent of consumed seeds from nonnative
invasive plants. Based on these studies, it is expected that alternative A would contribute to the
spread of invasive species caused by deer browse over the long term, resulting in adverse impacts on
habitat for other wildlife. The high density of deer under this alternative would place noticeable

154

Impacts on Other Wildlife and Wildlife Habitat

stress on Seashore ecosystems that would in turn provide means for invasive species to spread
aggressively beyond the Seashore’s ability to control, resulting in long-term adverse impacts on
other wildlife.

Cumulative Impact Analysis
Past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions at the Seashore affecting other wildlife
under alternative A would include the following: the tick monitoring and management program, use
of 4-Poster devices, deer hunting and deer damage permits, waterfowl hunting, a William Floyd
Estate cultural landscape report and treatment plan, and enhanced monitoring and management of
invasive plant species. Collectively, these actions result in adverse and beneficial impacts on other
wildlife species and their habitats. Beneficial impacts on other wildlife include deer hunting and deer
damage permits, a William Floyd Estate cultural landscape report and treatment plan, and the
enhanced monitoring and management of invasive plant species. These actions would provide long­
term beneficial impacts on other wildlife by reducing deer density, decreasing invasive species plant
populations, and improving local habitats as part of the cultural landscape, respectively.
For each alternative, 4-Poster devices would continue to be used in Saltaire and Fair Harbor. As an
artificial food source that exceeds several tons per year, the 4-Poster devices attract wildlife species
other than deer, potentially causing adverse impacts on these species due to the insecticide reaching
unintentional recipients (i.e., birds and small mammals). The 4-Poster devices would also continue
attracting pest species (e.g., rats, mice, and other rodents) to feeding stations in concentrated
numbers, a factor that may impact nearby residents.
The impact of these past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions would be both
beneficial and adverse. When combining the impacts of these actions with the impacts of alternative
A, alternative A would contribute noticeably to the overall adverse cumulative impact on other
wildlife and wildlife habitat.

Conclusion
Under alternative A, high deer populations and heavy browsing would continue to cause reductions
in vegetation richness and plant abundance needed to supply food, cover, and nesting habitat for
many songbirds and insects. Climate change-induced sea-level rise and projected increases in flood
damage from major storm events would collectively add to the impacts on wildlife. Alternative A
would likely cause a decline in invertebrates and bird populations at the Seashore that rely on
intermediate forest layers as habitat for foraging and nesting. Heavy browsing from high deer
densities would also cause vegetation voids at the Seashore that would impact small mammals and
possibly reptiles. Preferential foraging by deer would reduce native plant regeneration and provide a
competitive advantage to nonnative invasive plants resulting in reduction of habitat quality for other
wildlife. Alternative A would contribute noticeably to the overall adverse cumulative impact on
other wildlife and wildlife habitat.
The adverse impacts on other wildlife and wildlife habitat under alternative A would be significant
because no comprehensive plan would be enacted to preserve the natural abundances, diversities,
dynamics, and distributions of native animal populations, communities, and ecosystems. Natural
processes left to proceed without human intervention would allow current adverse impacts to
continue, whereas the enabling legislation for the Seashore calls for conservation and preservation
of natural features. Efforts to maintain quality habitat for migratory birds along the Atlantic flyway
would take place outside of a comprehensive deer management plan.

CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE B
Impact Analysis
Alternative B would use fertility control to reduce and maintain deer numbers and human-deer
interactions across the Seashore indefinitely. This alternative assumes the use of an available fertility
control chemical agent for the Seashore that meets NPS criteria. Deer that approach humans within
the Fire Island communities would be captured and translocated to the Fire Island Wilderness. This
alternative would reduce deer numbers slowly with an expectation that the target density would not
be reached until 13 years or longer after implementation. Fencing would be implemented to exclude
deer from the Sunken Forest in perpetuity, and portions of the William Floyd Estate would be
fenced until desired deer density and vegetation conditions are met.
With the exception of the Sunken Forest and portions of the William Floyd Estate under a fencing
regime, this alternative would result in the continuation of impacts on other wildlife and wildlife
habitat similar to those described under alternative A until such time that the deer density would be
reduced by fertility control (approximately 13 years) and vegetation recovery could begin. The
expected period for achieving vegetative recovery would be approximately 8–10 years past the time
the deer density target is reached, assuming a fertility control agent is immediately available. In total,
this would take approximately 21 to 23 years. During the 21 to 23–year fertility control and vegetation
recovery period, unfenced habitat at other natural areas on Fire Island would be subjected to the loss
of understory vegetation from heavy browsing by deer. Impacts would include the loss of native
understory vegetation palatable to deer and the spread of unpalatable invasive species making it
difficult to manage for native vegetation recovery in later years. These impacts would affect songbird,
invertebrate, and small mammal habitat (deCalesta 1994; Byman 2011; Allombert, Stockton, and
Martin 2005; Tymkiw, Bowman, and Shriver 2013) by removing key vegetation constituents important
to other wildlife as food sources, protective cover from predators, and reproduction.
Under this alternative, the 44-acre Sunken Forest and approximately 145 acres of forest at the
William Floyd Estate (80 acres of forest at the historic core area and 65 acres in the lower acreage)
would immediately be fenced to exclude deer, resulting in beneficial impacts on habitat for other
wildlife within the fenced areas. Vegetation recovery to herbs, forbs, shrubs, and tree saplings would
occur that would be used as habitat for ground and shrub nesting songbirds, insects reliant upon
vegetation for their life cycle, and mammalian herbivores.
Adverse impacts on other wildlife due to fencing are expected under this alternative. Installation of
fencing would cause noise disturbance and vegetation removal necessary to erect the fences. Once
installed, fencing could interrupt movements by other mammals such as foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and
raccoons (Procyon lotor), as well as flight movements by birds that prefer ground and shrub layers.
Other animals would be disturbed and/or frightened during the deer drive to remove all deer from
the Sunken Forest once the fence is installed. By excluding deer from portions of the William Floyd
Estate, deer densities would increase elsewhere as deer are congregated outside of fenced areas. The
increase in deer densities would cause higher browsing pressure on vegetation and impact habitat
for other wildlife species in perimeter areas until the deer density is lowered using fertility control. If
a fertility control agent is not available for up to 10 years, damage to habitat caused by the increased
deer density outside of the exclusion fencing would continue for an additional 10 years, resulting in
loss vegetation and a decline in habitat quality for other wildlife.
This alternative would include the capture of deer that approach humans within the Fire Island
communities, and the subsequent release of those animals at the Fire Island Wilderness. An
expected 20–25 deer would be moved in the first year of the plan, and fewer deer that approach

156

Impacts on Other Wildlife and Wildlife Habitat

humans would remain within the Fire Island communities in subsequent years resulting in fewer
translocations. Deer numbers would slightly rise at the Fire Island Wilderness from the
translocation of deer, thereby increasing deer browsing pressure during the first 5–6 years of the
plan. During this time, nesting and foraging songbirds, as well as insects reliant upon vegetation,
would incur slight decreases in habitat quality from deer browse. Once fertility control begins to
lower the deer population, impacts on habitat for other wildlife caused by deer would diminish
providing beneficial impacts on other wildlife for years.
The Seashore would implement a vegetation monitoring plan that would measure the scale of
vegetation and habitat recovery efforts after the target deer density is reached. If habitat
improvements are not satisfactorily realized 8–10 years into the plan, adaptive management would
be implemented to incrementally lower the deer population further until vegetation recovery goals
are met. This action would provide beneficial impacts on wildlife and other wildlife habitats.

Cumulative Impact Analysis
Past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions at the Seashore affecting other wildlife
under alternative B would include the following: the tick monitoring and management program, 4­
Poster device, deer hunting and deer damage permits, waterfowl hunting, a William Floyd Estate
cultural landscape report and treatment plan, and enhanced monitoring and management of
invasive plant species, as described under alternative A. The impact of these past, present, and
reasonably foreseeable future actions would generally be long-term and both beneficial and adverse.
When combining the impacts of these actions with the impacts of alternative B, alternative B would
contribute noticeably to the beneficial cumulative impact on other wildlife and wildlife habitat.

Conclusion
Alternative B would reverse the trend in habitat decline for other wildlife species caused by heavy
deer browsing, resulting in beneficial impacts on other wildlife and wildlife habitat. These actions
may help to offset projected impacts on wildlife habitats from climate change and sea-level rise such
as loss of wetlands and dunes from storm overwashes. Intermediate forest layers at the Seashore
would experience increases in plant species abundance and richness that would be used by
songbirds for nesting, foraging, and cover. Small mammals would benefit from this alternative by
increases in vegetation at the forest floor as deer browse is reduced. This alternative would take the
longest time, up to 22 to 33 years, for habitat recovery to occur because of the lag time for fertility
control to reduce deer numbers and the time it would take for the recovery of vegetation once the
deer target is reached. Fencing would be used at the Sunken Forest and William Floyd Estate to
protect areas from deer browse indefinitely, and that fencing would be installed immediately upon
implementation of the plan regardless of availability of a fertility control agent. Although there is a
risk of continued adverse impacts, similar to those described under alternative A, especially in the
case that an acceptable fertility control method is not available immediately, the Seashore would
undertake fencing and expects to reduce the deer population to a point at which habitat for other
wildlife can successfully regenerate after approximately 23 years (or up to 33 years if an acceptable
fertility control agent is not available immediately). Temporary impacts on other wildlife species
would occur during the installation of the fences, and wildlife would experience disruptions to
natural movement behavior caused by fencing. Alternative B would contribute noticeably to the
overall cumulative beneficial impact on other wildlife and wildlife habitat.
The adverse impacts associated with fence construction would not be significant because they
would be limited in scale and would generally result only in temporary disturbance. Adverse impacts
associated with the relatively long time period for habitat recovery have a risk of reaching significant

157

CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES

levels if the delay causes substantial shifts in natural abundances, diversities, diversities, dynamics,
and distributions of native plant populations, communities, and ecosystems; however, ultimately,
the beneficial impacts on other wildlife and wildlife habitat under alternative B are expected to be
significant because the Seashore would implement a comprehensive plan to preserve the natural
abundances, diversities, dynamics, and distributions of native plant populations, communities, and
ecosystems. The NPS intervention in the current natural processes would allow Seashore managers
to conserve and preserve the natural features as called for in the Seashore’s enabling legislation.
Actions taken to conserve habitat incorporated into the comprehensive deer management plan
would be especially important for migratory birds using the Atlantic flyway.

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE C
Impact Analysis
Alternative C proposes the use of direct reduction methods (i.e., sharpshooting, capture and
euthanasia, and hunting) to rapidly reduce deer numbers and maintain the population at the desired
level. Fencing would be used to protect the vegetation at the Sunken Forest until desired conditions
are reached. Once the vegetation and deer density targets are met, the fence would be removed.
Only small-scale fencing around specific plants important to the cultural landscape would be
implemented at the William Floyd Estate under this alternative.
The rapid reduction in deer numbers across the Seashore would cause immediate beneficial
responses to vegetation critical for other wildlife. Understory herbs, forbs, shrubs, and saplings
would begin a recovery process, which in turn would provide enhanced vegetative layers for
songbird nesting, foraging, and cover. Increases in ground cover would also improve habitat for
insects and small mammals similar to alternative B, but at a faster rate. Fencing of the Sunken Forest
would also benefit other wildlife as described in alternative B. Since rotational fencing is not being
used under this alternative at the William Floyd Estate, recovery of understory habitat for other
wildlife may take a slightly longer period of time compared to alternative B where rotational fences
would be used to provide complete and immediate protection to vegetation.
The rapid reduction in deer numbers would also provide an immediate reduction in the potential
for spread of invasive species caused by deer browsing (Williams, Ward, and Ramakrishnan 2008;
Eschtruth and Battles 2009; Knight et al. 2009). With lower deer numbers and the reduction in deer
preferential browsing pressure, native species would not experience as much of a competitive
disadvantage with invasive species and would begin to recover providing improvements to habitats
for other wildlife and wildlife habitat.
This alternative would use sharpshooting on federally owned lands across the Seashore in
combination with hunting in the Fire Island Wilderness. Sharpshooting and hunting would
introduce a level of human intervention in the natural areas causing disturbances to natural behavior
of other wildlife from noise and the human presence. This alternative would rely on bait stations
designed to attract deer for sharpshooting. Bait stations would serve as an artificial food source to
other wildlife species such as birds and rodents that would result in food-conditioning behaviors as
animals learn that bait is a reliable food supply. Disturbance impacts on other wildlife from bait
stations, sharpshooting, and hunting would be temporary, occurring only a few weeks each year.

Cumulative Impact Analysis
Past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions at the Seashore affecting other wildlife
under alternative B would include the following: the tick monitoring and management program, 4­
158

Impacts on Other Wildlife and Wildlife Habitat

Poster device, deer hunting and deer damage permits, waterfowl hunting, a William Floyd Estate
cultural landscape report and treatment plan, and enhanced monitoring and management of
invasive plant species, as described under alternative A. The impact of these past, present, and
reasonably foreseeable future actions would be both beneficial and adverse. When combining the
impacts of these actions with the impacts of alternative C, alternative C would contribute noticeably
to the overall beneficial cumulative impact on other wildlife and wildlife habitat.

Conclusion
Alternative C calls for the use of direct reduction methods to reduce the deer population to the
initial target 20–25 deer per square mile. These methods would continue to be used to maintain the
deer population at or below the target density. This alternative is expected to have long-term
beneficial impacts on other wildlife and wildlife habitats including insects, songbirds, small
mammals, and predator species due to improved habitat quality in the absence of high deer browse.
This benefit would be realized in a short timeframe, 8–10 years, since the target deer density is
expected to be reached within 2 years. An exception would be the Sunken Forest where exclusion
fencing would begin an immediate recovery of vegetation and wildlife habitat. At the William Floyd
Estate where the deer population would be reduced and vegetation allowed to recover, habitat
improvements would benefit invertebrates and migratory and resident songbirds that use the forest
understory for nesting, foraging, and protective cover. The reduction in deer numbers would also
promote native species regeneration and decrease the potential for the spread of invasive species.
Adverse impacts on other wildlife may include disturbances by humans during sharpshooting and
hunting, as well as the placement of artificial food sources at bait stations. Alternative C would likely
help to offset projected impacts on other wildlife from climate change and sea-level rise at the
Seashore. Alternative C would contribute noticeably to the cumulative beneficial impact on other
wildlife and wildlife habitat.
Adverse impacts would not be significant because they would be limited in scale and would
generally result only in temporary disturbance. Beneficial impacts on other wildlife and wildlife
habitat under alternative C are expected to be significant because the Seashore would implement a
comprehensive plan to preserve the natural abundances, diversities, dynamics, and distributions of
native plant populations, communities, and ecosystems. The NPS intervention in the current natural
processes would allow Seashore managers to conserve and preserve the natural features as called for
in the Seashore’s enabling legislation. Actions taken to conserve habitat incorporated into the
comprehensive deer management plan would be especially important for migratory birds using the
Atlantic flyway.

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE D
Impact Analysis
As described for alternative C, alternative D includes the removal of deer using direct reduction
methods to reach the initial target of 20–25 deer per square mile density. However, alternative D
includes the option to use fertility control in conjunction with or in place of direct reduction
methods to maintain the population at or below the target density. The expected timeline for
achieving the target deer density is two years. If no fertility control agent is available after the target
deer density is reached, sharpshooting and hunting would continue as the technique for maintaining
the deer population. An exclusion fence would be placed around the Sunken Forest to enable this
area to remain free from all deer until the vegetation has recovered, and a fence would be installed to
protect the historic core area at the William Floyd Estate. This alternative would not employ
rotational fencing at the William Floyd Estate.
159

CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES

Impacts on other wildlife and wildlife habitat would generally be the same as those described under
alternative C. Habitats for other wildlife species would experience improvements once the target
deer density is reached after a two-year deer reduction period. The Sunken Forest would be fenced,
and habitat improvements for other wildlife would be expected from the absence of deer browse.
Impacts on other wildlife from fencing the Sunken Forest would include disturbances to vegetation
for the installation of the fence, noise disturbance from humans during the fence installation, and
disruptions to natural animal movement patterns as described for alternatives B and C. Similarly, the
reduction in deer numbers and deer browse is expected to promote the recovery of native
understory vegetation at the William Floyd Estate as described for alternative C resulting in long­
term benefits to other wildlife, such as songbirds, reptiles, insects, and small mammals, and their
habitats. Furthermore, the competitive advantage of invasive species due to heavy browsing of
native understory vegetation would be reduced thereby facilitating the recovery of native plants.
This would also provide long-term beneficial impacts on other wildlife and wildlife habitats.

Cumulative Impact Analysis
Past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions at the Seashore affecting other wildlife
under alternative D would include the following activities: the tick monitoring and management
program, 4-Poster device, deer hunting and deer damage permits, waterfowl hunting, a William
Floyd Estate cultural landscape report and treatment plan, and enhanced monitoring and
management of invasive plant species, as described under alternative A. The impact of these past,
present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions would be both beneficial and adverse. When
combining the impacts of these actions with the impacts of alternative D, alternative D would
contribute noticeably to the beneficial cumulative impact on other wildlife and wildlife habitat.

Conclusion
Alternative D calls for the direct reduction of the deer population to meet the initial target 20–25
deer per square mile, and the use of direct reduction methods and/or fertility control to maintain the
deer population at or below the target density. As described for alternative C, improvements to
wildlife habitat would be realized in a short timeframe since the target deer density is expected to be
reached within two years. An exception would be the Sunken Forest where exclusion fencing would
begin an immediate recovery of vegetation and wildlife habitat. At the William Floyd Estate where
the deer population is reduced and vegetation is allowed to recover, habitat improvements would
benefit invertebrates and migratory and resident songbirds that use the forest understory for
nesting, foraging, and protective cover. The reduction in deer numbers would also promote the
regeneration of native species and decrease the potential for the spread of invasive species. Benefits
would occur regardless of the method of deer density maintenance chosen by Seashore managers
(i.e., direct reduction and/or fertility control). Indirect adverse impacts on other wildlife may
include disturbances by humans during use of direct reduction and/or fertility control methods, as
well as the placement of artificial food sources at bait stations. Alternative D would contribute
noticeably to the cumulative beneficial impact on other wildlife and wildlife habitat.
Adverse impacts would not be significant because they would be limited in scale and would generally
result only in temporary disturbance. Beneficial impacts on other wildlife and wildlife habitat under
alternative D are expected to be significant because the Seashore would implement a comprehensive
plan to preserve the natural abundances, diversities, dynamics, and distributions of native plant
populations, communities, and ecosystems. The NPS intervention in the current natural processes
would allow Seashore managers to conserve and preserve the natural features as called for in the
Seashore’s enabling legislation. Actions taken to conserve habitat incorporated into the comprehensive
deer management plan would be especially important for migratory birds using the Atlantic flyway.

Impacts on Wilderness

IMPACTS ON WILDERNESS
METHODOLOGY
The impact analysis for wilderness assumes that actions conducted in connection with this plan
would adhere to applicable federal, state, and local laws and policies, including the following:





The Wilderness Act (PL 88-577)
Otis Pike Fire Island High Dune Wilderness Act (PL 96-585)
NPS Management Policies 2006 (NPS 2006a)

Any action proposed to take place in congressionally designated wilderness is subject to a minimum
requirement analysis as described in the minimum requirements decision guide (developed by the
interagency Arthur Carhart National Wilderness Training Center and available on wilderness.net)
and NPS Management Policies 2006 (NPS 2006a, section 6.3.5). This concept is applied as a two-step
process that determines (1) whether or not the proposed action is appropriate or necessary for
administration of the area as wilderness and does not cause significant impact on wilderness
resources and character, in accordance with the Wilderness Act, and (2) the techniques and types of
equipment needed to ensure that impacts on wilderness resources and character are minimized
(NPS 2006a).
The Interagency Wilderness Character Monitoring Team, which represents the Bureau of Land
Management, US Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service, US Geological Survey, and US
Forest Service, offers an interagency strategy to monitor trends in wilderness character across the
National Wilderness Preservation System in the handbook Keeping It Wild: An Interagency Strategy
to Monitor Trends in Wilderness Character across the National Wilderness Preservation System
(Landres et al. 2008). Based on the statutory language of the Wilderness Act, the interagency team
identified four qualities of wilderness character that should be used in wilderness planning,
stewardship, and monitoring. The National Park Service also has developed an agency-specific
guide to managing wilderness called Keeping it Wild in the National Parks (NPS 2013b), which
described a fifth quality. These five qualities were used to describe impacts of the alternatives on
wilderness character and are as follows:







Untrammeled—Wilderness is essentially unhindered and free from modern human control
or manipulation.
Natural—Wilderness ecological systems are substantially free from the effects of modern
civilization.
Undeveloped—Wilderness retains its primeval character and influence and is essentially
without permanent improvement or modern human occupation.
Solitude or a primitive and unconfined type of recreation—Wilderness provides outstanding
opportunities for solitude or primitive and unconfined recreation.
Other features of value—Wilderness preserves other tangible features that are of scientific,
educational, scenic, or historical value. This quality captures important elements of
wilderness that may not be covered in the other four qualities.

These five qualities are used in this EIS to evaluate the extent to which wilderness values are either
preserved, restored, or diminished under each alternative.

161

CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES

In addition to assessing the impacts on the five wilderness qualities described above, the following
resource-specific context was considered when assessing the impacts of the alternatives on wilderness:





The National Park Service will manage wilderness areas for the use and enjoyment of the
American people. Management will include the protection of these areas and the
preservation of their wilderness character, and the gathering and dissemination of
information regarding their use and enjoyment as wilderness.
The Wilderness Act allows wilderness managers to impact a wilderness resource and/or
character if such an impact is necessary to preserve one or more qualities of wilderness
character. Such impacts must be evaluated and documented as described in the minimum
requirements decision guide.

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE A
Impact Analysis
Under the no-action alternative, existing vegetation and deer management and monitoring efforts
throughout the Fire Island Wilderness would continue. These existing management and monitoring efforts
with the potential to impact the Fire Island Wilderness include fencing of sensitive species, an experimental
deer exclosure (13 feet by 13 feet), and vegetation monitoring plots. These actions may result in a
temporary reduction in qualities of wilderness character. While management actions are being undertaken,
Seashore managers would be imposing modern human control over ecological systems. Seashore
managers would interfere with the primeval quality and/or influence of the natural resources within the
Fire Island Wilderness. As long as Seashore managers continue these efforts, the untrammeled, natural, and
undeveloped qualities of wilderness would be diminished. The presence of these management activities
within the Fire Island Wilderness also would diminish opportunities for solitude. As Seashore management
moves the Fire Island Wilderness ecosystem towards the desired conditions, the natural wilderness quality
would be restored over the long term.
Recreational uses of the Fire Island Wilderness, such as camping and hunting, would continue. This
offers visitors opportunities for solitude and a primitive and unconfined type of recreation. Other
features of value such as scientific, educational, scenic, or historical values would be retained. There
are no impacts on other features of value expected under this alternative.
Under the no-action alternative, no deer density targets would be established. No comprehensive
deer management plan would be implemented. As discussed under the “Vegetation, Unique
Vegetation Communities, and Special-status Plant Species” and “Other Wildlife and Wildlife
Habitat” impact topics, deer population density within the Fire Island Wilderness could diminish
the natural quality if population density grows to the point where heavy browsing may cause an
ecological system imbalance. Such an imbalance is imposed by modern civilization in that conditions
surrounding the Fire Island Wilderness provide deer with manmade routes by which to access the
wilderness (namely, Smith Point Bridge) and supply artificial food sources that prevent otherwise
natural population reduction during food shortage caused by overbrowsing.

Cumulative Impact Analysis
Past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions have the potential to impact the Fire Island
Wilderness. These actions include waterfowl hunting. Waterfowl hunting takes place annually and
allows the use of firearms, with restrictions. During this season, use of firearms may diminish
opportunities for solitude within the Fire Island Wilderness, but it also provides an avenue for

162

Impacts on Wilderness

hunters to experience an unconfined type of recreation. Hunters are encouraged to follow “Leave
No Trace” policies. As such, the other qualities of wilderness character remain relatively intact.
The impact of these past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions would generally be
beneficial. When combining the impacts of these projects with the impacts of alternative A, the
cumulative impact would be beneficial. Alternative A would contribute a noticeable adverse
increment to the cumulative impact on the Fire Island Wilderness.

Conclusion
Overall, the qualities of wilderness character would remain unchanged under alternative A;
however, alternative A could eventually result in an adverse impact on the Fire Island Wilderness
due to diminished natural quality of wilderness character if the deer density within the Fire Island
Wilderness reaches a point that deer browse causes vegetation regeneration to be noticeably
inhibited. Such an impact would reflect an ecosystem imbalance; however, NPS mandates to manage
wilderness would call for measures to correct this imbalance when possible. Alternative A would
contribute noticeably to the cumulative impact on the Fire Island Wilderness. The adverse impact
on wilderness has the potential to approach the level of significance if deer browse pressures
increased to a point where the natural quality of wilderness character is diminished; however, the
existing impacts on the Fire Island Wilderness are not significant. The National Park Service would
continue to manage wilderness areas for the use and enjoyment of the American people. Ongoing
management actions may temporarily diminish wilderness character, but these actions would be
implemented in order to manage and protect wilderness character in the long term and would be
subject to the minimum requirement decision guide. Management includes the protection of these
areas and the preservation of their wilderness character, and the gathering and dissemination of
information regarding their use and enjoyment as wilderness.

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE B
Impact Analysis
Under alternative B, the management activities to protect special-status species described under
alternative A (i.e., fencing of sensitive species) would continue to diminish the undeveloped, natural,
and untrammeled qualities temporarily. These management actions may also diminish opportunities
for solitude within the Fire Island Wilderness. As Seashore management moves the Fire Island
Wilderness ecosystem towards the desired conditions, the natural wilderness quality would be
restored over the long term. Some additional permanent fencing may be established under
alternative B for vegetation monitoring; however, the impacts described under alternative A would
still apply to alternative B.
In addition to the monitoring and education actions included under alternative A, alternative B
would incorporate fertility control actions to gradually reduce the deer population in the Seashore.
Deer that approach humans observed within the Fire Island communities would be targeted for
translocation to the Fire Island Wilderness as long as additional deer would not result in heavy
browsing of the wilderness vegetation. The minimum requirement decision guide would be
completed prior to implementation of the plan and would be used to determine whether this activity
is appropriate and what mitigation methods might be warranted prior to it taking place. As discussed
under the “Vegetation, Unique Vegetation Communities, and Special-status Plant Species” and
“Other Wildlife and Wildlife Habitat” impact topics, deer population density within the Fire Island
Wilderness could diminish the natural quality if population density grows to the point where heavy
browsing may cause an ecological system imbalance. If this point is reached, it would be a temporary
163

CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES

condition that would be remedied over the long term due to the use of fertility controls to reduce
and/or maintain the deer population at a sustainable density.
The fertility control actions to be used within the Fire Island Wilderness include the use of a
chemical reproductive control agent, which would gradually reduce and then maintain the deer
population at an appropriate density. The use of a chemical reproductive control agent would
impose modern human control over the deer population and would therefore diminish the
untrammeled quality of the Fire Island Wilderness on a recurring basis. Use of these methods would
require that animals that have undergone some type of treatment be marked and/or tracked in some
way (e.g., radio collars, ear tags, or dye markings). Translocated animals also would be marked
and/or tracked. Use of such visible evidence of human-imposed management of the deer population
could reduce opportunities for solitude within the Fire Island Wilderness. Although these qualities
would be diminished, the natural quality of wilderness would be maintained or restored over the
long term through maintenance of the deer population.
This alternative is not expected to noticeably detract from other features of value within the Fire
Island Wilderness.
If an acceptable fertility control agent is not available for up to 10 years following implementation of
this plan, other actions such as translocation may take place, but no deer population reduction steps
would be taken until such a time as an acceptable agent became available. Without a method of deer
population control within the Fire Island Wilderness, the risk for ecosystem imbalance is higher, but
deer not treated with a fertility agent would not need to be marked and would continue to have
natural reproductive cycles.

Cumulative Impact Analysis
Past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions have the potential to impact the Fire Island
Wilderness. These actions include waterfowl hunting, as described under alternative A. The impact
of these past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions would generally be beneficial.
When combining the impacts of these projects with the impacts of alternative B, the cumulative
impact would be long-term beneficial. Alternative B would contribute a noticeable adverse
increment to the cumulative impact on the Fire Island Wilderness.

Conclusion
Overall, alternative B management actions would have an adverse impact on the Fire Island
Wilderness due to the potential to diminish the four primary qualities of wilderness character to
some extent; the fifth would not be impacted. However, these actions would be part of a
comprehensive plan to manage the potential for deer overpopulation within the Fire Island
Wilderness. Although deer management actions (i.e., use of a chemical reproductive control agent)
may temporarily diminish wilderness character on a recurring basis, these actions would be
implemented in order to manage and protect wilderness character in the long term and would be
subject to the minimum requirements decision guide. In the case that an acceptable fertility control
agent is not available for up to 10 years following implementation of this plan, the natural quality of
wilderness would be at risk, as described under alternative A, but the untrammeled quality would be
less diminished. Alternative B would contribute noticeably to the cumulative impact on the Fire
Island Wilderness.
The beneficial impact on wilderness would not be significant because the qualities of wilderness
character would be preserved in the long term. The National Park Service would manage wilderness

164

Impacts on Wilderness

areas for the use and enjoyment of the American people. Management would include the protection
of these areas and the preservation of their wilderness character, and the gathering and
dissemination of information regarding their use and enjoyment as wilderness. The adverse impact
on wilderness would be significant because the use of fertility control would be an active
management strategy that would impose human control over natural deer biology, leave evidence of
human intervention (i.e., marked deer), and would interfere intermittently with the opportunity for
solitude. Such impacts must be evaluated and documented as described in the minimum
requirements decision guide.

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE C
Impact Analysis
Under alternative C, the management activities to protect special-status species described under
alternative A (i.e., fencing of sensitive species) would continue to diminish the undeveloped, natural,
and untrammeled qualities temporarily. These management actions may also diminish opportunities
for solitude within the Fire Island Wilderness. As Seashore management moves the Fire Island
Wilderness ecosystem towards the desired deer density, the natural wilderness quality would be
restored over the long term. Additionally, if management goals for special-status species protection
are attained and management actions are no longer necessary, all wilderness qualities would be
restored in the long term. As under alternative B, some additional permanent fencing may be
established under alternative C for vegetation monitoring; the impacts described under alternatives
A and B also would apply to alternative C.
The primary difference between alternatives B and C is the use of direct reduction methods of deer
management under alternative C. Instead of translocating deer that approach humans to the Fire
Island Wilderness as proposed under alternative B, these deer would be targeted for capture and
euthanasia, taking place outside of the wilderness. Use of sharpshooting would be expected to
control the deer population much more quickly than fertility control methods such as those
proposed under alternative B. Direct reduction would more quickly reduce the chance that deer
density would grow to a point where heavy browsing may cause an ecological system imbalance.
Therefore, it is less likely that the natural quality of wilderness character would be diminished due to
deer browse under this alternative than under alternative B.
Population reduction and maintenance would be implemented through a combination of
sharpshooting, capture and euthanasia of individual deer, and hunting within the Fire Island
Wilderness. The use of these methods would impose modern human control over the deer
population and would therefore diminish the untrammeled quality of the Fire Island Wilderness.
Use of visible and audible evidence of human-imposed management of the deer population also
could reduce opportunities for solitude within the Fire Island Wilderness for visitors not
participating in the hunt. If vehicles are used along the beach (outside wilderness), this could
indirectly diminish opportunities for solitude by introducing vehicles and their associated noises
into the viewshed and soundscape, respectively. However, the hunt is likely to take place during a
time when visitation is very low, during winter months; therefore, impacts on opportunities for
solitude for other visitors would be minimized. On the other hand, hunters would have an improved
opportunity for solitude during the hunt within the wilderness.
Although some of the above qualities of wilderness would be diminished, the natural quality of
wilderness would be maintained or restored over the long term through maintenance of the deer

165

population. This alternative is not expected to noticeably detract from other features of value within
the Fire Island Wilderness.

Cumulative Impact Analysis
Past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions have the potential to impact the Fire Island
Wilderness. These actions include waterfowl hunting, as described under alternative A. The impact
of these past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions would generally be beneficial.
When combining the impacts of these projects with the impacts of alternative C, the cumulative
impact would be long-term beneficial. Alternative C would contribute a noticeable adverse
increment to the cumulative impact on the Fire Island Wilderness.

Conclusion
Overall, alternative C management actions would have an adverse impact on the Fire Island
Wilderness due to the potential to diminish the four primary qualities of wilderness character to
some extent; however, these actions would be part of a comprehensive plan to manage the potential
for deer overpopulation within the Fire Island Wilderness, which would strive to sustain the natural
distribution, numbers, population composition, and interaction of indigenous species within the
Fire Island Wilderness. Although deer management actions (e.g., sharpshooting and hunting) may
temporarily diminish wilderness character on a recurring basis, these actions would be implemented
in order to manage and protect wilderness character in the long term and would be subject to the
minimum requirements decision guide. Alternative C would contribute noticeably to the cumulative
impact on the Fire Island Wilderness.
Neither beneficial nor adverse impacts on wilderness would be significant because hunting would
provide an opportunity for unconfined recreation for hunters while the qualities of wilderness
character would be preserved in the long term; otherwise, no noticeable change in the qualities of
wilderness character is expected. The National Park Service would manage wilderness areas for the
use and enjoyment of the American people. Management would include the protection of these
areas and the preservation of their wilderness character, and the gathering and dissemination of
information regarding their use and enjoyment as wilderness.

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE D
Impact Analysis
Alternative D would combine management efforts discussed under the other alternatives. The
management activities to protect special-status species described under alternative A (i.e., fencing of
sensitive species) would continue to diminish the undeveloped, natural, and untrammeled qualities
temporarily. These management actions may also diminish opportunities for solitude within the Fire
Island Wilderness. As Seashore management moves the Fire Island Wilderness ecosystem towards
the desired conditions, the natural wilderness quality would be restored over the long term.
Additionally, if management goals for special-status species protection are attained and
management actions are no longer necessary, all wilderness qualities would be restored in the long
term. As under alternatives B and C, some additional permanent fencing may be established under
alternative D for vegetation monitoring; the impacts described under alternatives A, B, and C would
apply to alternative D.
Deer management actions would include use of direct reduction methods to directly reduce the
deer population and could also use fertility control to maintain the deer population at an
166

Impacts on Wilderness

appropriate deer density. The same methods of population reduction would be used under this
alternative as described under alternative C (i.e., sharpshooting and hunting), and the fertility
control methods described under alternative B could also be used (in conjunction with or in place of
direct reduction methods) for population maintenance. As described under alternative C, deer that
approach humans would be targeted for capture and euthanasia, as opposed to the alternative B
proposal of translocation to the Fire Island Wilderness.
The impacts on qualities of wilderness characters from the actions described above would be
roughly the same as those described under alternative C, although if the Seashore chooses to
implement fertility control measures for population maintenance, impacts related to these action
would be the same as described under alternative B. Using direct reduction methods would control
the deer population within two years (much more quickly than using fertility control for initial
population reduction). Use of direct reduction methods would lower the chance that deer density
would grow to a point where heavy browsing may cause an ecological system imbalance. Therefore,
it is less likely that the natural quality of wilderness character would be diminished due to deer
browse under this alternative than under alternative B.
The use of the methods described above would impose modern human control over the deer
population and would therefore diminish the untrammeled quality of the Fire Island Wilderness.
Use of visible and audible evidence of human-imposed management of the deer population also
could reduce opportunities for solitude within the Fire Island Wilderness. Vehicles along the beach
would cause another indirect reduction in opportunities for solitude by introducing vehicles and
their associated noises into the viewshed and soundscape, respectively. Although these qualities
would be diminished, the natural quality of wilderness would be maintained or restored over the
long term through maintenance of the deer population.
This alternative is not expected to noticeably detract from other features of value within the Fire
Island Wilderness.

Cumulative Impact Analysis
Past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions have the potential to impact the Fire Island
Wilderness. These actions include waterfowl hunting, as described under alternative A. The impact
of these past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions would generally be beneficial.
When combining the impacts of these projects with the impacts of alternative D, the cumulative
impact would be long-term beneficial. Alternative D would contribute a noticeable adverse
increment to the cumulative impact on the Fire Island Wilderness.

Conclusion
Overall, alternative D management actions would have adverse impacts on the Fire Island Wilderness
due to the potential to diminish the four primary qualities of wilderness character to some extent;
however, these actions would be part of a comprehensive plan to manage the potential for deer
overpopulation within the Fire Island Wilderness, which would strive to sustain the natural
distribution, numbers, population composition, and interaction of indigenous species within the Fire
Island Wilderness. Although deer management actions (i.e., sharpshooting, hunting, and/or a fertility
control agent) may temporarily diminish wilderness character on a recurring basis, these actions
would be implemented in order to manage and protect wilderness character in the long term and
would be subject to the minimum requirements decision guide. These actions would be undertaken to
correct influences originating outside of wilderness boundaries. Alternative D would contribute
noticeably to the cumulative impact on the Fire Island Wilderness if fertility control is used.

167

CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES

The beneficial impact on wilderness would not be significant because the qualities of wilderness
character would be preserved in the long term. The National Park Service would manage wilderness
areas for the use and enjoyment of the American people. Management would include the protection
of these areas and the preservation of their wilderness character, and the gathering and
dissemination of information regarding their use and enjoyment as wilderness. The adverse impact
on wilderness would be significant if fertility control is used because the use of fertility control
would be an active management strategy that would impose human control over natural deer
biology, leave evidence of human intervention (i.e., marked deer), and would interfere
intermittently with the opportunity for solitude. Such impacts must be evaluated and documented as
described in the minimum requirements decision guide.

IMPACTS ON CULTURAL LANDSCAPES
METHODOLOGY
Potential impacts on cultural landscapes, topography, landforms, and vegetation were analyzed in
terms of potential changes resulting from implementation of the alternatives. These potential
impacts include anticipated changes to land use, vegetation patterns, circulation systems, and smallscale features such as the High Board Fence and graveyard markers. As described in “Chapter 3:
Affected Environment,” the impact analysis focuses only on the cultural landscape at the William
Floyd Estate. Although other cultural landscapes exist in the Seashore, only the cultural landscape at
the William Floyd Estate is potentially affected by the proposed actions.
The resource-specific context for assessing impacts on cultural landscapes is:



The ability of the Seashore to preserve a landscape indicative of the 240 years during which
the Floyd family managed the William Floyd Estate. This includes human-induced changes
to the landscape over time for the purposes of agriculture, ornamentation, and conservation,
which have created historic patterns of vegetation growth that should be preserved.

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE A
Impact Analysis
Under alternative A, monitoring efforts and existing vegetation and deer management would
continue; however, the current effort is limited to monitoring and some limited fencing. Deer
presence within the William Floyd Estate would continue unabated, because the current perimeter
fence is not deer-proof. The well-established locust, basswood, and beech trees planted around the
main house would be maintained and monitored for general health and integrity. Ornamental and
orchard tree and shrub plantings around the main house, which reflect the period during which the
Floyd family used the estate for seasonal vacation and recreational use, would continue to be
adversely affected by heavy of deer browse. Deer browse would also continue to affect the dwarf
Crabapple trees and plant varieties that were planted in the West Garden and orchard during the
1960s, replacing an early 20th century garden. The continual loss of the ornamental plants that are
important features of the garden makes it difficult to fully interpret the landscape because the
features are missing. Even though plantings would be continually monitored and replaced as
necessary and feasible, the recurring loss of vegetative features would result in an adverse impact on
the cultural landscape. The current garden restorative and expansion efforts, including those for the
well-documented West Garden, would continually be thwarted by browsing. Although not directly

168

Impacts on Cultural Landscapes

impacted by deer, the Brick Walk and High Board fence would be maintained and repaired as
needed, as would the trails and pathways that currently traverse the William Floyd Estate grounds.
In the lower acreage, the vista, which was pruned back to its historic edge in 2003 under the
guidance of the Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, would continue to be maintained in
order to preserve the historic view. The open fields used by the Floyd family during the 20th century
for hunting would be mowed on at least an annual basis in order to control woody successional
growth. In the surrounding woodland, regeneration of the natural forest and shrub understory
layers would be hindered by the repeated browsing of the tender oak and hickory saplings. The
reduction in growth of the native oak and hickory constituent species would lead to the growing
abundance of exotic invasive species, as has been witnessed by Seashore staff. This combination of
factors would impede the ability of the woodland to sustain the natural vegetative forest
stratification, and as such, alternative A would have an adverse effect on the cultural landscape.
Eventually the characteristic oak forest that largely contributes to the historic character of the lower
acreage would become less recognizable, as growing invasive species become more prominent and
change the nature of the vegetation.

Cumulative Impact Analysis
Past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions have the potential to impact cultural
landscapes. These actions include the issuance of deer hunting and deer damage permits,
implementation of a William Floyd Estate cultural landscape report and treatment plan, and
enhanced monitoring and management of invasive plant species.
Issuance of hunting and deer damage permits in areas adjacent to the William Floyd Estate are
expected to remain fairly constant. Such activities would help keep the deer population somewhere
near the current levels, thereby preventing an increased level of damage to the vegetative landscape
features by deer browsing in this localized area.
The National Park Service anticipates preparing a cultural landscape report and treatment plan for
the William Floyd Estate in the reasonably foreseeable future. Preparation of a cultural landscape
report and implementation of a treatment plan would provide a comprehensive approach to
restoring and maintaining the cultural landscape. The ability to implement the treatment plan fully
may be limited however, when combined with alternative A, because the unabated deer browse
would result in a continuous loss of garden plantings in the historic core of the William Floyd Estate
and discourage more ambitious treatment options, such as the restoration of the West Garden.
In the foreseeable future, the National Park Service would also develop a comprehensive invasive
species management plan that would enhance work to control nonnative invasive plant and animal
species that pose a specific threat to native species and other natural resources within the Seashore.
Enhanced efforts towards invasive species control may reduce the risk of invasive species spreading
and becoming established at the William Floyd Estate, which would reduce the chance that
undesirable species would interfere with the cultural landscape of the William Floyd Estate.
The impact of these past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions would generally be
beneficial. When combining the impacts of these actions with the impacts of alternative A, however,
the overall cumulative impact would be adverse. The issuance of hunting and damage permits would
likely reduce the risk of additional damage to the cultural landscape vegetative features. A William
Floyd Estate cultural landscape report and treatment plan would benefit the Seashore, although if
no action is taken to get the deer browsing under control, the ability to fully implement the
recommendations would be limited. Efforts to control nonnative plant species would be beneficial

169

CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES

by preserving the native cultural landscape of the lower acreage. Alternative A, though, would
contribute an appreciable adverse increment to the cumulative impact on cultural landscapes as no
action would be taken to control the deer population size.

Conclusion
Under alternative A, maintenance of current cultural landscape elements would continue. The
recently restored vista would provide a view from the Mastic House to the water, and the fields
added by the Floyd family to the lower acreage would continue to be mowed in order to maintain
the field and forest pattern as much as possible. However, deer browse would continue to decimate
the ornamental and formal garden plantings around the Mastic House, resulting in the loss of
important elements of the landscape. This would severely limit the interpretation possibilities of this
important, well-documented landscape area and discourage the restoration of the West Garden. In
addition, the natural forest of the lower acreage continues to be susceptible to nonnative species
because of deer feeding preferences. The relative effectiveness of the anticipated William Floyd
Estate cultural landscape report and treatment plan would be constrained in its implementation by
current deer browse conditions. Alternative A would contribute an appreciable adverse increment
to the overall cumulative impact on cultural landscapes. Alternative A would have an adverse
significant impact on the cultural landscape of the William Floyd Estate because deer browse of
vegetation would hinder the ability of the Seashore to preserve a landscape indicative of the 240
years during which the Floyd family managed the William Floyd Estate.

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE B
Impact Analysis
Under this alternative, the existing perimeter fence would be deer-proofed as much as possible by
the use of cattle guards at the gates. An additional fence would roughly follow the south boundary of
the historic core, running the entire width of the William Floyd Estate and following a straight
northeast/southwest line approximately 200 feet southeast of the Pightle (refer to figure 4).
Excluding deer from the historic core would allow augmented planting and maintenance of the
garden areas surrounding the main house, which are currently subject to heavy deer browse and
require continuous replanting. The exclusion of deer would have a beneficial impact on the
interpretation of the historic core by facilitating the establishment, growth, and maintenance of
these ornamental plantings. Circulation routes and small-scale features within the historic core
would be unaffected. However, there would be an adverse impact associated with the installation of
the fence in the cultural landscape of the William Floyd Estate. This would introduce a large-scale
nonhistoric feature into the cultural landscape of the historic core, creating a physical and visual
boundary that did not exist during the Floyd family residence and management of the estate. In
addition, this fence would stretch across the vista, intruding into a character-defining feature of the
landscape that was established and is maintained to provide an uninterrupted view of the bay from
the main house. Although circulation within the historic core would be preserved, the circulation
between the core and the lower acreage, via paths southeast and southwest of the Pightle, would be
interrupted. The adverse impact of fencing the historic core could potentially be minimized by
considering a selection of colors and materials that help camouflage its visibility from portions of the
estate, though alternative B would still introduce an extensive permanent barrier, which could affect
the integrity of the landscape established by the Floyd family during its residence.
Under alternative B, approximately 130 acres of the lower acreage would be fenced in two phases,
each expected to last approximately 10 years depending on the rate of forest regeneration. Each
phase would enclose approximately 65 acres, in four fenced areas. Access to fenced areas would be
170

Impacts on Cultural Landscapes

limited to Seashore staff when necessary for monitoring, excluding visitors during the
approximately 10 years each area is enclosed. Efforts would be made to avoid areas with
archaeological features and recognizable Lopped Tree Line remnants, and fence lines would be
routed around the perimeter of the fields established by the Floyd family, limiting visual impact.
Eliminating the potential for deer browse would allow healthy saplings of oak and hickory to
become established and grow above the height of deer browsing, greatly enhancing the long-term
viability and health of the existing forest. The vitality of the forest is important to the pattern of
fields and woodland in the lower acreage, a character-defining feature of the cultural landscape. The
beneficial impact of successful forest regeneration would be accompanied by the adverse impact of
the extensive fencing on circulation and sight lines. During the approximately 20–30 years that
large-scale fencing is anticipated in the lower acreage, the fence would be visible along the vista, and
potentially visible from the trails and the borders around the open space fields. This would create a
multiple-decade introduction of wire fencing into an area prized and enhanced by the Floyd family
for open space and recreation. As in the historic core, the visibility of the fencing may be minimized
by the choice of colors and materials, but the potential for up-close viewing of the fences is high in
the lower acreage, which is traversed by the vista and crisscrossed by recreational trails. In addition,
the deer population is expected to decrease to preferred levels over a course of 13 years (although
this decrease may be delayed by up to 10 years if an acceptable fertility control agent is not available
immediately), and during that period, fencing the historic core and lower acreage would force the
deer population into a smaller area. An initial increase in deer browsing in unfenced areas is
possible, extending the length of time needed for the recovery of the characteristic vegetation of the
cultural landscape.

Cumulative Impact Analysis
Past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions have the potential to impact cultural
landscapes. These actions include deer hunting and deer damage permits, a William Floyd Estate
cultural landscape report and treatment plan, and enhanced monitoring and management of
invasive plant species as described under alternative A. The addition of exclusionary fencing of the
historic core and within the lower acreage of the William Floyd Estate introduces long-term physical
and visual barriers that did not exist during the Floyd family ownership and operation of the
property, affecting the integrity of the historic landscape. However, it also greatly increases the
potential reach of the landscape maintenance and restoration efforts, allowing for the expansion of
the Mastic House gardens and the long-term viability of the lower acreage woodlands. The impact
of these past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions would generally be beneficial.
When combining the impacts of these actions with the impacts of alternative B, the cumulative
impact would be beneficial. Alternative B would contribute a noticeable beneficial increment to the
cumulative impact on cultural landscapes.

Conclusion
Alternative B would result in beneficial impacts on the cultural landscape of the William Floyd
Estate. The historic core fencing included under alternative B would allow for a broader, more
comprehensive interpretive program at the William Floyd Estate, including more of the welldocumented gardens enjoyed by the Floyd family during their use of the property as a recreational
retreat. With the removal of the threat of deer browse, current plantings could be better maintained,
and the restoration of the West Garden could be considered as an immediate, feasible initiative as
part of the planned William Floyd Estate cultural landscape report and treatment plan. In addition,
rotating exclusionary fencing in the lower acreage would allow the regeneration and viability of the
native woodland, assisted by a decrease in the deer population that would benefit the unfenced

171

CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES

areas of the lower acreage over the long term. Benefits associated with deer exclosure fencing would
take place regardless of availability of an acceptable fertility control agent.
Fencing included in alternative B would also introduce physical and visual large-scale elements into
the cultural landscape that were not a part of the property as the Floyd family experienced it.
However, these visual elements could be largely mitigated by camouflaging the fencing within the
tree line and by the avoidance of cultural landscape elements such as the Lopped Tree Lines during
installation and monitoring. By enhancing the fencing around the historic core, the landscape within
this area could be kept free of new, visually intrusive plants. The addition of fencing also invites an
educational opportunity to explain its purpose to visitors.
Alternative B would contribute a noticeable beneficial increment to the overall beneficial cumulative
impact on the cultural landscape of the William Floyd Estate. The beneficial impacts of alternative B
would be significant because reduction of deer browse of vegetation (primarily through
exclusionary fencing) would improve the ability of the Seashore to preserve a landscape indicative
of the 240 years during which the Floyd family managed the William Floyd Estate. Adverse impacts
would not be significant because they would not prevent such preservation.

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE C
Impact Analysis
Alternative C would include the reduction of the deer throughout Fire Island National Seashore in
order to meet density goals. This alternative also involves efforts to deer-proof the perimeter fencing
at the William Floyd Estate as well as the introduction of fencing around select areas on the William
Floyd Estate. Under this alternative, small-scale fencing would be installed around specific cultural
landscape elements in the historic core of the William Floyd Estate in order to protect them from deer
browsing. This fencing would be used seasonally in order to minimize visual intrusion. Although the
specific locations for this fencing have not yet been established, it is anticipated they would be
concentrated in the ornamental landscape associated with the main house. When the Floyd family
used the property as a seasonal home during the late 19th century and into the 20th century, formal
gardens were established around the house for the family to enjoy. Efforts would be made to avoid
physically impacting archeological features and small-scale and circulation character-defining features
located in the vicinity of the house, including the Brick Walk and the High Board Fence.
The targeted use of seasonal fencing would be beneficial to the cultural landscape in that it would
allow a portion of the garden area to be sustainably managed, while successfully allowing the
Seashore to preserve a landscape indicative of the period of use of the gardens by the Floyd family.
Seasonally introduced fence within the historic core landscape would allow some small-scale
expansion of the formal and ornamental garden landscape around the Mastic House. However, the
restoration of the garden area would be limited, as even a reduced deer population presents a risk to
ornamental and garden plantings. The fencing would also have an adverse indirect impact, in that
nonhistoric visual components would disrupt the integrity of the landscape surrounding the house.
In addition, isolated disruptions of the circulation pattern within the targeted areas may occur.
The lower acreage forest suffers from a lack of forest regeneration at least partially due to deer
browsing. In addition, deer browsing facilitates the spread of exotic invasive species, which further
affects forest regeneration. Therefore, deer browsing has the potential to directly and indirectly
adversely affect the forest and field patterns established by the Floyd family for hunting in the mid­
20th century by diminishing the contrast between the dense woods and the open fields as the forest

172

Impacts on Cultural Landscapes

is reduced in vitality. Under alternative C, the deer population would be subjected to direct
reduction until the density target is reached. Regeneration of the forest under this alternative would
take 8–10 years, but the decrease in deer browsing would immediately allow regeneration to
commence at the beginning of the life of this plan. This would have a beneficial impact on the lower
acreage, as it would encourage the long-term viability of the forest and the pattern of forest and
fields could be maintained into the future.

Cumulative Impact Analysis
Past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions have the potential to impact cultural
landscapes. These actions include deer hunting and deer damage permits, a William Floyd Estate
cultural landscape report and treatment plan, and enhanced monitoring and management of
invasive plant species, as described under alternative A. The impact of these past, present, and
reasonably foreseeable future actions would generally be beneficial. While the William Floyd Estate
would certainly benefit from the development of a cultural landscape report, the actions
implemented would be limited to those likely to succeed under continual from deer browsing. The
ability to manage nonnative species would benefit from the enhanced viability of the native forest in
the lower acreage, largely facilitated by control of the deer population. When combining the impacts
of these projects with the impacts of alternative C, the cumulative impact would be beneficial.
Alternative C would contribute a noticeable beneficial increment to the cumulative impact on
cultural landscapes.

Conclusion
Alternative C would result in beneficial impacts on the cultural landscape of the William Floyd
Estate. The use of selective fencing within the historic core of the William Floyd Estate would
protect small areas of the formal gardens that have been preserved and/or restored. In addition, the
use of deer population controls to reach target density early in the plan allows regeneration of the
entire lower acreage forest to begin sooner than under alternative B. There would be adverse
impacts as well, because the selective fencing introduces visual intrusive elements into the landscape
of the historic core even as it protects portions of it from deer. This can be mitigated by seasonal use
of this fencing, but its selective nature also would limit the potential scope of planned future
initiatives at the William Floyd Estate, including the possible restoration of the West Garden.
Unprotected areas of the gardens would still be vulnerable to deer browse, and even a reduced
number of deer can decimate formal plantings. Alternative C would contribute a noticeable
beneficial increment to the overall beneficial cumulative impact on the lower acreage. The beneficial
impacts of alternative C likely would be significant because reduction of deer browse of vegetation
in conjunction with some small-scale fencing would noticeably improve the ability of the Seashore
to preserve a landscape indicative of the 240 years during which the Floyd family managed the
William Floyd Estate. Adverse impacts would not be significant because they would not prevent
such preservation.

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE D
Impact Analysis
Alternative D is similar to alternative B, with the major difference being the methods of deer control.
Under alternative D, direct reduction would be employed in order to quickly reduce the deer
population to the initial target density for vegetation regeneration, after which reproductive control
also could be used (in conjunction with or in place of) to maintain the population at the desired

173

CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES

level. In addition, while fencing of the historic core is the same as under alternative B, rotational
fencing of the lower acreage is excluded from alternative D.
The improvements to the existing perimeter fencing within the historic core of the William Floyd
Estate, and the addition of a new historic core fence would be the same as in alternative B, with the
same anticipated impacts. However, the deer density targets would be reached more quickly than in
alternative B, in 2 years compared to 13 years, which would not require rotational fencing in the
lower acreage. Faster reduction in the deer population is anticipated to have a correlative increase in
forest regeneration, which would begin more quickly than under alternative B. Threats to the oak
and hickory forest, which characterized the lower acreage during the latter portion of the Floyd
family’s use of the estate, would be removed more quickly than under alternative B. This would have
a beneficial impact on preservation of the characteristic forest and field pattern, regardless of the
method(s) used for population density maintenance.

Cumulative Impact Analysis
Past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions have the potential to impact cultural
landscapes. These actions include deer hunting and deer damage permits, a William Floyd Estate
cultural landscape report and treatment plan, and enhanced monitoring and management of
invasive plant species, as described under alternative A. Enhanced fencing of the historic core would
allow for an ambitious planting and interpretation program to be explored in a cultural landscape
report, including the restoration of the West Garden. Controlling the deer population immediately
promotes regeneration of the lower acreage forest. The impact of these past, present, and reasonably
foreseeable future actions would generally be beneficial. When combining the impacts of these
projects with the impacts of alternative D, the cumulative impact would be beneficial. Alternative D
would contribute a noticeable beneficial increment to the cumulative impact on cultural landscapes.

Conclusion
Alternative D would have many of the same benefits of alternative B. Removal of deer from the
historic core and protection of this area by fencing encourages large-scale, enterprising plans for the
restoration of the gardens around the Mastic House. The adverse impacts of the introduction of
extensive fencing at the south end of the historic core could be largely mitigated by careful
placement of the fence within existing tree lines. Use of this fence presents an opportunity to
educate the public about the impacts of deer browse. In addition, deer population controls that
allow the target density to be reached in a short amount of time eliminate the need for rotational
fencing in the lower acreage, greatly limiting the introduction of new fencing elements into the
visual landscape while restoring the long-term viability of the native forest. This would allow the
planned William Floyd Estate cultural landscape report and treatment plan to explore a wider range
of restoration and interpretation options and supplement the effects of the invasive species control
program. Alternative D would contribute a noticeable beneficial increment to the overall cumulative
beneficial impacts on the cultural landscape. The beneficial impacts of alternative D would be
significant because reduction of deer browse of vegetation would improve the ability of the Seashore
to preserve a landscape indicative of the 240 years during which the Floyd family managed the
William Floyd Estate. Adverse impacts would not be significant because they would not prevent
such preservation.

174

Impacts on Visitor Use and Experience/Recreation

IMPACTS ON VISITOR USE AND EXPERIENCE/RECREATION
METHODOLOGY
The area of analysis for visitor use and experience/recreation is the boundary of the Seashore. This
section summarizes the impacts on visitor use and experience/recreation from the actions that
would potentially occur in the area of analysis under each alternative. The potential for changes to
visitor use and experience/recreation was evaluated by assessing the limitations and assumed
changes to visitor access and associated visitor uses related to the proposed alternatives, and
determining whether these projected changes would affect the visitor experience and/or
recreational opportunities. Past visitor use data and comments from the public also were used to
estimate the effects of the alternative actions on visitors.
Resource-specific context for assessing impacts of the alternatives to visitor use and
experience/recreation includes:







Visitors come to the Seashore for a variety of reasons and value Seashore resources
differently. According to a 2008 survey of Seashore visitors, approximately 50% of the
respondents felt that close contact with deer or other wildlife added to their Seashore
experience, 20% felt the presence of deer or other wildlife had no effect on their experience,
and 2% felt the deer detracted from their experience (NPS 2009b).
The Seashore was established “for the purpose of conserving and preserving for the use of
future generations certain relatively unspoiled and undeveloped beaches, dunes, and other
natural features. . . which possess high values to the Nation as unspoiled areas of great
natural beauty in close proximity to large concentrations of urban population” (PL 88-587).
One of the Seashore’s goals is to educate visitors, through interpretation of the landscape,
about the 240 years during which the Floyd family managed the William Floyd Estate.

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE A
Impact Analysis
Under alternative A, existing deer management and monitoring efforts throughout the Seashore
would continue. These actions include continued public education/interpretation efforts, vegetation
monitoring, and deer population surveys. The Seashore would continue to have no jurisdiction
within the Fire Island communities to enforce human-deer interaction regulations. Residents of Fire
Island communities would continue to have positive and negative sentiments towards the deer
population. Visitors would continue to view and interact with the growing deer population, which
some people would continue to view positively and others negatively (NPS 2009b). Visitor use and
experience/recreation would continue to be impacted by deer on Fire Island and in the William
Floyd Estate.
Human-deer interaction management would remain unchanged. Some visitors enjoy the
opportunity to observe and interact with the deer. However, some interactions reduce both visitor
enjoyment and visitor safety. The number of incidents between humans and deer would remain the
same or could increase. Potential risks associated with the deer population, including Lyme disease,
are expected to remain the same and are discussed in the section “Impacts on Public Health and
Safety.”

175

CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES

Other visitor activities would be impacted by an unmanaged deer population. Deer would continue
to trample and browse existing vegetation throughout Fire Island. Visitors who come to the
Seashore for recreational or cultural activities could continue to note changes in the landscape. As
the deer population increases, they could reduce the habitat and vegetation available for other
Seashore fauna, thereby reducing the potential for Seashore visitors to view wildlife besides deer.
Visitors who participated in guided tours would be made more aware of the degradation of the
natural communities. The absence of the full suite of vegetative and faunal species that should be
present could adversely affect visitors who wish to experience the natural environment. Deerrelated impacts on vegetation would be most noticeable at the William Floyd Estate, where
vegetation is a part of the cultural landscape. The Seashore could not replant the gardens in the
William Floyd Estate without selected fencing because of continual deer browse, and visitor
experience of the cultural landscape would continue to be affected.
The presence of deer in the Seashore is apparent, and as the unmanaged deer population continues
to grow, deer sightings would likely become more frequent. Visitors have varying sentiments toward
deer; therefore, additional sightings could improve or diminish their experience of the Seashore.

Cumulative Impact Analysis
Past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions have the potential to impact visitor use and
experience/recreation. These actions include the following activities: the tick monitoring and
management program, use of 4-Poster devices, deer hunting and deer damage permits, waterfowl
hunting, a William Floyd Estate cultural landscape report and treatment plan, and enhanced
monitoring and management of invasive plant species.
The National Park Service would continue to monitor tick issues and provide education to visitors
regarding ticks, tick-borne illnesses, and preventive measures that visitors can take to avoid
exposure to ticks and tick bites and what to do in response to tick bites. Primary tick surveillance
and management efforts would continue to take place at the William Floyd Estate. These efforts
would provide an improvement in visitor experience because it would mitigate public displeasure at
being exposed to ticks and potentially tick-borne diseases. The use of 4-Poster devices may
indirectly reduce exposure to ticks and potentially tick-borne diseases. Cumulative impacts on
public health and safety are discussed under that impact topic.
Deer hunting and use of deer damage permits on nonfederal lands could cause a local reduction in
deer density, which could result in a reduction in negative human-deer interaction. The Seashore
would continue to permit waterfowl hunting in select areas annually. Many Seashore visitors enjoy
participating in this hunt each year as a form of recreation, while some others may find that the hunt
detracts from their enjoyment of the Seashore experience due to noise and a perceived safety risk.
Some visitors are opposed to hunting at the Seashore.
The National Park Service anticipates preparing a William Floyd Estate cultural landscape report
and treatment plan in the reasonably foreseeable future. Implementation of a Treatment Plan would
improve visitor experience of the cultural landscape, which would increase enjoyment for those
visitors wishing to experience the William Floyd Estate. It should be noted, however, that as
described in the analysis above, the ability to implement the plan, and thus, interpret the cultural
landscape accurately and completely, is limited by the continuing damage and loss from deer
browsing.
The National Park Service would continue work to control nonnative invasive plant and animal
species that pose a specific threat to native species and other natural resources within the Seashore.

176

Impacts on Visitor Use and Experience/Recreation

Enhanced efforts towards invasive species control would improve the natural setting of the
Seashore, a beneficial impact for visitors wishing to experience a natural ecosystem during their visit
to the Seashore.
The impact of these past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions would generally be
beneficial, although some of the items above would also impact visitor use and
experience/recreation adversely. When combining the impacts of these projects with the impacts of
alternative A, the cumulative impact would be beneficial. Alternative A would contribute a
noticeable adverse increment to the cumulative impact on visitor use and experience/recreation.

Conclusion
Overall, alternative A would result in increased human-deer interactions and would result in adverse
impacts on visitor use and experience/recreation because of continued negative impacts on the
Seashore’s natural ecosystem and cultural landscape vegetation from deer browse. Similarly,
alternative A would result in beneficial impacts for visitors who enjoy viewing deer. Although some
visitors may enjoy an increased chance of observing deer, some visitors may be disappointed in the
altered ecosystem and the missed opportunity to experience a more intact cultural landscape at the
William Floyd Estate. Alternative A would contribute noticeably to the cumulative impact on visitor
use and experience/recreation. Neither adverse nor beneficial impacts on visitor use and
experience/recreation would be significant because the Seashore would continue to offer relatively
unspoiled and undeveloped beaches, dunes, and other natural features where visitors can interact
with wildlife and learn about the William Floyd Estate.

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE B
Impact Analysis
Under alternative B, the Seashore would incorporate fertility control actions to reduce undesirable
human-deer interactions, protect native plant communities and cultural plantings, promote forest
regeneration, and gradually reduce the deer population in the Seashore. Additionally,
educational/interpretive efforts would be expanded to reduce undesirable human-deer interactions.
The Seashore would implement enhanced programs to educate visitors about the purpose of deer
management and how to avoid negative interactions and partner with communities to restrict deer
access to human food. As a result, human-deer interactions would become less frequent. As the deer
population gradually decreases, the perceived and actual risks associated with deer are also likely to
decrease. These risks are discussed in the section “Impacts on Public Health and Safety.”
The Seashore would implement additional vegetation protection measures, and visitors likely would
be aware of these efforts. Deer access to vegetation would decrease due to new fencing, which
would be noticeable to Seashore visitors. The condition of vegetation inside the fenced areas would
improve, and visitor experience could improve as a result, especially for those visitors seeking to
experience a more natural ecosystem, including other wildlife species that may otherwise be
displaced by heavy deer browse.
The fencing provides a tangible resource for educating visitors about the deer management program
and for improving visitor understanding about the impact of deer on vegetation. However, the
fencing would detract from natural views and cultural landscapes. The diminished views and
cultural landscapes would be particularly noticeable at the William Floyd Estate in the historic core
and adjacent areas where deer would be excluded to promote vegetation regeneration, although this
177

CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES

may be mitigated somewhat by incorporating fencing into tree lines, where available. As the
condition of the maintained gardens improves, so would visitor experience of the historic setting of
the William Floyd Estate. Visitors would not have access inside the rotational fenced areas at the
lower acreage of the William Floyd Estate. The Sunken Forest fence would diminish the natural
views somewhat, and because deer would be completely excluded from this fenced area, visitors
would not be able to experience deer viewing in this area. Visitor access would be inhibited during
fence construction and installation, but following initial construction and installation, fences and
gates or doors would allow access for visitors to the Sunken Forest. Signs would be added near the
gates or doors to remind visitors to securely close the gate or door in order to promote vegetation
regeneration.
Fertility control of the deer population would result in changes to visitor experience. Visitors could
be aware of the treatment activities, which may detract from a natural experience. Chemical
reproductive control agents have the potential to alter deer behavior, which could be noticeable to
visitors and could impact visitor sentiment toward the deer. Translocated deer would be tracked
with collars, and visitors wishing to experience a natural setting may find their experience affected
by the sight of the collars. The gradual decline in the deer population over a period of approximately
13 years would reduce visitor opportunities to view deer, and the smaller deer population could
result in the growth of other wildlife populations and increased opportunities for visitors to view
other wildlife species. These changes in wildlife viewing opportunities could improve or diminish
visitor experience, depending on visitor sentiment toward particular species. Awareness of
management practices could detract from the perceived natural experience in a unit of the National
Park System; this is most relevant to the Sunken Forest and Fire Island Wilderness, which are often
sought out as natural areas.
If an acceptable fertility control agent is not available for use immediately upon implementation of
this plan, impacts on visitor use and experience related to reduced deer numbers and the treatment
of deer with such an agent would be delayed for up to 10 years. The ongoing impacts on visitor use
and experience/recreation would be similar to those described under alternative A; however, some
actions such as education/interpretation and fencing would be implemented immediately and would
have the impacts described above.

Cumulative Impact Analysis
Past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions have the potential to impact visitor use and
experience/recreation. These actions include the tick monitoring and management program, use of
4-Poster devices, deer hunting and deer damage permits, waterfowl hunting, a William Floyd Estate
cultural landscape report and treatment plan, and enhanced monitoring and management of
invasive plant species, as described under alternative A. The impact of these past, present, and
reasonably foreseeable future actions would generally be long-term and both beneficial and adverse.
When combining the impacts of these projects with the impacts of alternative B, the cumulative
impact would be long-term beneficial. Alternative B would contribute a noticeable beneficial
increment to the cumulative impact on visitor use and experience/recreation.

Conclusion
Overall, alternative B would result in beneficial impacts on visitor use and experience/recreation due
to decreased human-deer interactions, a more balanced Seashore ecosystem, and a more intact
cultural landscape due to a gradual decrease in the deer population. The gradual reduction in deer
population would take place over approximately 13 years (although this could be delayed by an
additional 10 years if an acceptable fertility control agent is not available immediately). Some visitors

178

Impacts on Visitor Use and Experience/Recreation

may be disappointed with a decreased chance of observing deer. The visitor experience within the
Seashore would be more consistent with the purpose for which the Seashore was established due to
the restoration of a more natural ecosystem. The Seashore would be able to more effectively
interpret the relatively intact cultural landscape at the William Floyd Estate. If an acceptable fertility
control agent is not available immediately upon implementation of this plan, some of the beneficial
impacts associated with reduced deer population would be delayed for up to 10 years; however,
other benefits associated with fencing would continue as described. Alternative B would contribute
noticeably to the cumulative impact on visitor use and experience/recreation. Neither adverse nor
beneficial impacts on visitor use and experience/recreation would be significant because the
Seashore would continue to offer relatively unspoiled and undeveloped beaches, dunes, and other
natural features where visitors can interact with wildlife and learn about the William Floyd Estate.

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE C
Impact Analysis
Under alternative C, the Seashore would incorporate actions to reduce undesirable human-deer
interactions, protect native plant communities and cultural plantings and quickly reduce the deer
population in the Seashore. Population reduction and maintenance would be implemented through
a combination of sharpshooting, capture and euthanasia of individual deer, and hunting within the
Fire Island Wilderness. Additionally, educational/interpretive efforts would be expanded to reduce
undesirable human-deer interactions. Visitor experience would improve as the deer population
decreases, other fauna populations increase, and vegetation populations regenerate.
Impacts under alternative C would be similar to those described under alternative B, although the
educational material would be different due to the different management methods. The Seashore
would implement enhanced programs to educate visitors about the purpose of deer management
and how to avoid negative human-deer interactions. Visitor experience could be beneficially or
adversely impacted if educational programming includes information on the methods of deer
reduction. Visitors could be comforted by the facts that sharpshooters are professionally trained
and work at night and that the deer meat would be donated. Conversely, some visitors would be
uncomfortable with any method of direct reduction for various reasons, including the humaneness
of the method, moral opposition, and perceived safety risks. In the case of a hunt, visitors could take
advantage of an additional recreational activity at the Seashore. As the deer population decreases,
the potential for risks associated with deer is also likely to decrease. These risks are discussed in the
section “Impacts on Public Health and Safety.”
The Seashore would implement additional vegetation protection measures similar to those
described under alternative B, and visitors likely would be aware of these efforts. Deer access to
vegetation would decrease due to new fencing, which would be noticeable to Seashore visitors. The
condition of vegetation inside the fenced areas would improve, and visitor experience could
improve as a result. However, the fencing would diminish views and cultural landscapes. The
diminished views and cultural landscapes would be particularly noticeable at the William Floyd
Estate in the historic core and adjacent areas where deer would be excluded to promote vegetation
regeneration. However, fencing and protective barriers at the William Floyd Estate would be smaller
and less intrusive than fencing proposed under alternative B. As the condition of the maintained
gardens improves, so would visitor experience of the historic setting of the William Floyd Estate.
Exclosures in the Sunken Forest would diminish the natural viewsheds somewhat, and because deer
would be completely excluded from this fenced area, visitors would not be able to experience deer
viewing in this area. In the short term, fence construction and installation would inhibit visitor

179

CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES

access; however, in the long term, although access would be provided through fences and gates or
doors, access for visitors would be reduced when compared to alternative A (no fencing). Signs
would be added near the gates or doors to remind visitors to securely close the gate or door in order
to promote vegetation regeneration.
Instead of the fertility control proposed under alternative B, alternative C would use direct
reduction methods listed above to decrease and maintain deer densities. This approach would result
in changes to visitor experience. Most sharpshooting would take place between dusk and dawn or
when areas are closed to visitors. The public would be notified of any Seashore closures and deer
management activities in advance via media release and alerts posted to the Seashore's website and
social media venues, with printed notification posted at Seashore visitor contact stations and
bulletin boards, and on public billboards located within the Fire Island communities. Noise
suppression devices and night vision equipment would be used to reduce disturbance to the public
and Seashore neighbors. Additionally, visitor access of the Seashore could be restricted when
sharpshooting is occurring, which also could impact visitor experience. The decline in the deer
population would reduce visitor opportunities to view deer, and the smaller deer population could
result in the growth of other wildlife populations and increased opportunities for visitors to view
other wildlife species. These changes in wildlife viewing opportunities could improve or diminish
visitor experience, depending on visitor sentiment toward particular species. Awareness of
management practices could detract from the perceived natural experience in a unit of the National
Park System.
In limited situations where access to a carcass would be difficult or in a less visible area, surface
disposal may be acceptable. In these circumstances, every effort would be made to reduce the
visibility of the carcass to visitors or Seashore neighbors. Because the priority would be to donate
meat, surface disposal would include only a few carcasses, under exceptional circumstances.
Whenever several deer were unsuitable for donation to charities, the carcasses would be collected
and disposed of by a contractor. Carcasses would be removed quickly, to avoid visibility to visitors.
Therefore, few, if any, visitors would be exposed to deer remains or disposal activities.

Cumulative Impact Analysis
Past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions have the potential to impact visitor use and
experience/recreation. These actions include the tick monitoring and management program, use of
4-Poster devices, deer hunting and deer damage permits, waterfowl hunting, a William Floyd Estate
cultural landscape report and treatment plan, and enhanced monitoring and management of
invasive plant species, as described under alternative A. The impact of these past, present, and
reasonably foreseeable future actions would generally be long-term and both beneficial and adverse.
When combining the impacts of these projects with the impacts of alternative C, the cumulative
impact would be long-term beneficial. Alternative C would contribute a noticeable beneficial
increment to the cumulative impact on visitor use and experience/recreation.

Conclusion
Overall, alternative C would result in beneficial impacts on visitor use and experience/recreation
due to decreased human-deer interactions, a more balanced Seashore ecosystem, and a more intact
cultural landscape. The decrease in deer population would take place more quickly under this
alternative than under alternative B; therefore, adverse impacts on visitor use and
experience/recreation associated with implementation of deer population control methods may
take place for a shorter amount of time than under alternative C. In the long term, the impacts on
visitor use and experience/recreation would be the same as under alternative B. Some visitors may

180

Impacts on Visitor Use and Experience/Recreation

be disappointed with a decreased chance of observing deer. The visitor experience within the
Seashore would be more consistent with the purpose for which the Seashore was established due to
the restoration of a more natural ecosystem. The Seashore would be able to more effectively
interpret the relatively intact cultural landscape at the William Floyd Estate. Alternative C would
contribute noticeably to the cumulative impact on visitor use and experience/recreation. Neither
adverse nor beneficial impacts on visitor use and experience/recreation would be significant
because the Seashore would continue to offer relatively unspoiled and undeveloped beaches, dunes,
and other natural features where visitors can interact with wildlife and learn about the William
Floyd Estate.

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE D
Impact Analysis
Under alternative D, the Seashore would incorporate a combination of actions to reduce
undesirable human-deer interactions and quickly reduce the deer population in the Seashore. As
under alternatives B and C, educational/interpretive efforts would be expanded to reduce
undesirable human-deer interactions. Deer management actions would include exclosure fencing of
the historic core of the William Floyd Estate and at the Sunken Forest, use of direct reduction
methods to reduce the deer population density, and use of direct reduction methods and/or fertility
control to maintain the deer population at an appropriate deer density. Visitor experience would
improve as the deer population decreases, other fauna populations increase, and vegetation
populations regenerate.
The Seashore would implement enhanced programs to educate visitors about the purpose of deer
management and how to avoid negative human-deer interactions. Visitor experience could be
beneficially or adversely impacted if educational programming includes information on the direct
reduction methods of deer management. Visitors could be comforted by the facts that
sharpshooters are professionally trained and work at night and that the deer meat would be
donated. Conversely, some visitors would be uncomfortable with any form of direct reduction for
various reasons, including the humaneness of the method, moral opposition, and perceived safety
risks. In the case of a hunting, visitors could be encouraged to take advantage of an additional
recreational activity at the Seashore but could be deterred by the permitting process and/or cost.
Because hunting would take place during the day, other visitors’ experience could be impacted by
the restriction of their use of the wilderness. As the deer population decreases, the potential for risks
associated with deer is also likely to decrease. These risks are discussed in the section “Impacts on
Public Health and Safety.”
The Seashore would implement additional vegetation protection measures similar to those
described under alternative B, and visitors likely would be aware of these efforts. The impacts
related to this aspect of the plan would be the same as under alternative B, including visitor
awareness of the fencing, altered access, and improved visitor enjoyment and experience of cultural
landscapes resulting from improved condition of vegetation within the fencing.
Alternative D includes both direct reduction actions and fertility control as options to maintain the
deer population following initial population reduction (using direct reduction methods described
under alternative C). Use of direct reduction methods would result in the same changes in visitor
experience described under alternative C, and use of fertility control for population maintenance
would have the same impacts on visitor experience as described under alternative B.

181

CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES

Similar to alternative C, in limited situations where access to a carcass would be difficult or in a less
visible area, surface disposal may be acceptable. In these circumstances, every effort would be made
to reduce the visibility of the carcass to visitors or Seashore neighbors. Because the priority would be
to donate meat, surface disposal would include only a few carcasses, under exceptional
circumstances. Whenever several deer were unsuitable for donation to charities, the carcasses
would be collected and disposed of by a contractor. Carcasses would be removed quickly, to avoid
visibility to visitors. Therefore, few, if any, visitors would be exposed to deer remains or disposal
activities. If fewer deer are euthanized under this alternative, this impact on visitor experience
would be smaller than the impact under alternative C.

Cumulative Impact Analysis
Past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions have the potential to impact visitor use and
experience/recreation. These actions include the tick monitoring and management program, use of
4-Poster devices, deer hunting and deer damage permits, waterfowl hunting, a William Floyd Estate
cultural landscape report and treatment plan, and enhanced monitoring and management of
invasive plant species, as described under alternative A. The impact of these past, present, and
reasonably foreseeable future actions would generally be long-term and both beneficial and adverse.
When combining the impacts of these projects with the impacts of alternative D, the cumulative
impact would be long-term beneficial. Alternative D would contribute a noticeable beneficial
increment to the cumulative impact on visitor use and experience/recreation.

Conclusion
Overall, alternative D would result in beneficial impacts on visitor use and experience/recreation
due to decreased human-deer interactions, a more balanced Seashore ecosystem, and a more intact
cultural landscape. The decrease in deer population would take place more quickly under this
alternative than under alternative B; therefore, adverse impacts on visitor use and
experience/recreation associated with implementation of deer population control methods may
take place for a shorter amount of time than under alternative B. In the long term, the impacts on
visitor use and experience/recreation would be the same as under alternative B, and if fertility
control is used, the impacts of such use on visitor use and experience/recreation would be the same
as described under alternative C. Some visitors may be disappointed with a decreased chance of
observing deer, but opportunities to view deer would still exist. The visitor experience within the
Seashore would be more consistent with the purpose for which the Seashore was established due to
the restoration of a more natural ecosystem. The Seashore would be able to more effectively
interpret the relatively intact cultural landscape at the William Floyd Estate, especially at the historic
core following exclusion of deer. Alternative D would contribute noticeably to the cumulative
impact on visitor use and experience/recreation. Neither adverse nor beneficial impacts on visitor
use and experience/recreation would be significant because the Seashore would continue to offer
relatively unspoiled and undeveloped beaches, dunes, and other natural features where visitors can
interact with wildlife and learn about the William Floyd Estate.

IMPACTS ON FIRE ISLAND COMMUNITIES
AND ADJACENT LANDOWNERS
METHODOLOGY
Although the National Park Service does not have jurisdiction to manage resources outside its
boundaries, many natural resources transcend man-made boundaries such as property lines. The
182

Impacts on Fire Island Communities
and Adjacent Landowners

Seashore’s management policies acknowledge that the Seashore does not exist as an isolated entity,
and a goal of Seashore management is to promote and enhance a harmonious relationship between
Fire Island communities and the National Park Service.
The area of analysis for Fire Island communities and adjacent landowners encompasses all
communities on Fire Island. This section summarizes the impacts on Fire Island communities and
adjacent landowners from the actions that would potentially occur in the area of analysis under each
alternative. The potential for changes to Fire Island communities and adjacent landowners was
evaluated by assessing the current deer-related issues within Fire Island communities and adjacent
lands against the proposed alternatives, and determining whether these projected changes would
affect the Fire Island communities and adjacent landowners. Past survey data and comments from
the public also were used to estimate the effects of the alternative actions on local communities and
landowners. The experience that people have within the Seashore (regardless of whether they
travelling from local communities or from more distant locations) is addressed under the impact
topic of visitor use and experience/recreation.
Resource-specific context for assessing impacts of the alternatives on Fire Island communities and
adjacent landowners includes the following:








Fire Island is composed of a matrix of public and private lands, including the 17 private
communities and towns, Smith County Park, Robert Moses State Park (an adjacent
landowner composed of nonfederal land), and three municipal beaches.
The deer population on Fire Island moves between the Seashore and private communities.
The Seashore has received an increasing number of complaints regarding the current deer
population, many of which come from residents of the Fire Island communities.
Residents of Fire Island communities interacted with deer on a regular basis. The majority
either enjoyed deer but worried about deer-related problems in Fire Island communities or
did not enjoy deer (Siemer et al. 2007). Deer-related problems in communities include deer
browse of gardens and ornamental plantings and access to unsecured trash. Most
participants indicated that National Park Service should be managing deer-related impacts
at the Seashore and many felt that such management activities would have a positive impact
both on the Seashore and the communities (Siemer et al. 2007).
A recent study implies that most residents and visitors to Fire Island are either ‘satisfied’ or
‘highly satisfied’ with the general quality of life on Fire Island (Nelessen 2012).

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE A
Impact Analysis
Under alternative A, existing deer management and monitoring efforts throughout the Seashore
would continue, and some of these actions would have the potential to impact Fire Island
communities and adjacent landowners. These actions include continued public
education/interpretation efforts and deer population surveys.
Human-deer interaction would remain an issue. As occurs within the Seashore, the number of
incidents between humans and deer in adjacent communities would remain the same or could
increase. Incidents between humans and deer would continue to be reported to and managed by the
New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. These incidents would have an
adverse impact on the Fire Island communities and adjacent landowners. Potential risks associated

183

CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES

with the deer population, including Lyme disease, are expected to remain the same, and are
discussed in the section “Impacts on Public Health and Safety.”
The presence of deer on Fire Island is apparent, and as the unmanaged deer population continues to
grow, deer sightings would likely become more frequent in the communities. Residents have varying
sentiments toward deer, and they would respond differently to increased deer sightings. Some
community members would continue to feel positively toward deer and would persist in treating
them similarly to pets. Deer that are fed by humans are encouraged to return to the communities,
which would benefit the community members who enjoy the deer and would adversely impact the
community members who do not want deer in the communities.
Deer would continue to use Fire Island communities for foraging habitat and for shelter. Deer have
been known to use areas under the houses on Fire Island for shelter. At an increasing rate, deer
would continue to trample and browse existing vegetation throughout Fire Island. Residents’
gardens and plantings would continue to be browsed by the deer. The damaged vegetation could
impact community aesthetics. Residents whose yards are damaged would continue to feel negatively
about deer presence in the communities; this sentiment could intensify as the deer population
grows. Deer would continue to spill and/or feed from unsecured garbage cans. Spilled garbage
would inconvenience community members and would impact residents by diminishing the
appearance of the communities.

Cumulative Impact Analysis
Past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions have the potential to impact Fire Island
communities and adjacent landowners. These actions include the use of 4-Poster devices and deer
hunting and deer damage permits. The 4-Poster devices use permethrin to treat deer for ticks, which
may reduce exposure to ticks and thus tick-borne diseases in the Fire Island communities. Deer
hunting and use of deer damage permits on nonfederal lands modestly reduces the local deer
population.
The impact of these past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions would be beneficial.
When combining the impacts of these projects with the impacts of alternative A, the cumulative
impact would be beneficial. Alternative A would contribute imperceptively to the cumulative impact
on Fire Island communities and adjacent landowners.

Conclusion
Overall, under alternative A, the Fire Island communities and adjacent landowners would remain
subject to adverse impacts associated with an increasing deer population and ongoing issues
associated with deer, including browse and trampling of vegetated landscapes, use of houses for
shelter, and foraging in garbage cans. Complaints about deer would continue to increase. A greater
proportion of Fire Island community residents may worry about deer related problems or not enjoy
deer in their community. Alternative A would contribute imperceptively to the cumulative impact
on Fire Island communities and adjacent landowners. Neither beneficial nor adverse impacts on
Fire Island communities and adjacent landowners would be significant because deer would
continue to move between the matrix of public and private lands where residents have mixed
feelings about deer, but most residents would continue to be satisfied to some extent with the
general quality of life on Fire Island.

Impacts on Fire Island Communities
and Adjacent Landowners

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE B
Impact Analysis
Under alternative B, the Seashore would incorporate fertility control actions to gradually reduce the
deer population over approximately 13 years. Additionally, educational/interpretive efforts would
be expanded to reduce undesirable human-deer interactions. Generally, Fire Island communities
would experience improved conditions as the deer population decreases and planted vegetation
sustains less damage.
The number of human-deer interactions would be expected to decrease as a result of the enhanced
educational efforts by the Seashore in combination with the gradual reduction in the deer
population over time. The Seashore would implement improved educational programs to educate
community members about the purpose of deer management and how to avoid negative
interactions. Programs could include information on the consequences of feeding wildlife, strategies
for securing garbage containers, and the collaboration between the New York State Department of
Environmental Conservation and the National Park Service. These programs would encourage
community participation in order to foster a sense of responsibility and increase the effectiveness of
management efforts. As the deer population decreases, the potential for risks associated with deer
would also be expected to decrease. The risk of Lyme disease is discussed in the section “Impacts on
Public Health and Safety.”
Under alternative B, the local deer population would decrease over time due to fertility control
management employed by the Seashore. The decline in the deer population within the communities
would reduce opportunities to view deer and increase the viability of community vegetation. The
decrease in viewing opportunities could improve or diminish community member experience,
depending on individual sentiments toward deer; however, other community members would
appreciate the reduced level of deer browse on gardens and other plantings. Community members
would benefit from improved condition and appearance of community vegetation as a result of the
decreased presence of deer in the communities. However, deer exclosures within the Seashore
could encourage some deer to stray into nearby communities. This displacement and associated
issues may be noticeable during the first few years of the plan, but continued management of the
deer population would be expected to minimize any adverse impacts on Fire Island communities.
In addition to use of fertility control, the Seashore would translocate deer that approach humans to
the Fire Island Wilderness. This is intended to substantially decrease human-deer interactions in
addition to also reducing deer browse of community vegetation. Translocated deer would be
tracked with collars, which would reassure community members who do not want deer that
approach humans in the communities that the Seashore is monitoring translocated deer.
Additionally, community members would likely notice deer without collars as individuals who
strayed into the communities from another area of the Seashore. Community members could be
aware of the sedation and capturing of deer for translocation and would likely be affected by such
translocation depending on their individual attitudes.
Deer population management efforts could impact the relationship between the communities and
the Seashore. Community members could be aware of management activities (i.e., fertility control
and translocation); they could appreciate Seashore management efforts or could take issue with the
management methods. Fertility control has the potential to alter deer behavior, which could be
noticeable to community members and could impact community sentiment toward the deer and the
Seashore. For instance, interviewees in the 2005 study (Leong and Decker 2007) expressed concern
about fawns being born out of season would not survive the winter.

185

CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES

If an acceptable fertility control agent is not available immediately, other items such as
education/interpretation and translocation could take place, but the issues associated with deer
density would continue until an agent became available (within 10 years) for population reduction.
The experience of residents of and visitors to Fire Island administered areas within the Seashore,
including the impacts of proposed vegetation management, is addressed under the impact topic of
visitor use and experience/recreation.

Cumulative Impact Analysis
Past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions have the potential to impact Fire Island
communities and adjacent landowners. These actions include use of 4-Poster devices and deer
hunting and deer damage permits, as described under alternative A. The impact of these past,
present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions would be beneficial. When combining the
impacts of these projects with the impacts of alternative B, the cumulative impact would be
beneficial. Alternative B would contribute noticeably to the cumulative impact on Fire Island
communities and adjacent landowners.

Conclusion
Overall, under alternative B, Fire Island communities and adjacent landowners would experience
beneficial impacts due to a decreasing deer population and reduced issues associated with deer,
including browse and trampling of vegetated landscapes, use of houses for shelter, and foraging in
garbage cans. Complaints about deer would decrease. Members of the Fire Island communities and
adjacent landowners who enjoy deer but worry about deer-related problems in Fire Island
communities may be reassured by the Seashore’s management program. In the case that an
acceptable fertility control agent is not available immediately, adverse impacts associated with deer
density and the lack of NPS management would continue for up to 10 years. Alternative B would
contribute noticeably to the cumulative impact on Fire Island communities and adjacent
landowners. Neither beneficial nor adverse impacts are expected to be significant because deer
would continue to move between the matrix of public and private lands where residents have mixed
feelings about deer, but most residents would continue to be satisfied with the general quality of life
on Fire Island.

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE C
Impact Analysis
Under alternative C, the Seashore would incorporate actions to reduce undesirable human-deer
interactions, same as alternative B, and quickly reduce the deer population in the Seashore. The
more rapid population reduction would be achieved with different management methods under this
alternative than proposed under alternative B. Population reduction and maintenance would be
implemented through a combination of sharpshooting, capture and euthanasia of individual deer,
and the permitting of hunting within the Fire Island Wilderness. The same expanded
educational/interpretive efforts as proposed under alternative B would be implemented under this
alternative to reduce undesirable human-deer interactions. Fire Island communities and adjacent
landowners would see improvements as the deer population decreases, other fauna populations
increase, and vegetation populations regenerate.
The number of human-deer interactions would be reduced because of expanded
educational/interpretive efforts. The impacts of this outreach would be the same as described under

186

Impacts on Fire Island Communities
and Adjacent Landowners

alternative B; however, the reduction would occur more quickly. Again, the risk of Lyme disease is
discussed in the section “Impacts on Public Health and Safety.”
Under alternative C, the local deer population would decrease due to direct reduction techniques
employed by the Seashore. Although the method of deer management would be different, the effects
would be similar to those described under alternative B with a few differences. The population
would reduce more quickly under this alternative.
Community members could be beneficially or adversely impacted by an awareness of methods used
to remove deer. Some community members would appreciate the implementation of an effective
method of deer population control. Some could be reassured by safety measures such as the facts
that sharpshooters are professionally trained and work at night. Some may also appreciate that the
deer meat would be donated. Conversely, other community members would be uncomfortable with
any methods for various reasons, including the humaneness of the method, moral objection, and
perceived safety risks. One study analyzed the beliefs and attitudes of residents surrounding
Cuyahoga Valley National Park towards lethal reduction of deer at the park (Fulton et al. 2004). The
results of this study indicated that a minority of residents (15%–20%) would consider lethal control
very unacceptable as a management strategy for addressing abundant deer populations. These
respondents felt this way despite the reasons for which the strategy would be implemented. The
study also indicated that those individuals may experience negative emotional impacts. Some Fire
Island community members may feel the same; however, a majority of community members have
indicated a need to reduce adverse impacts of deer.
Deer behavior has the potential to change as a result of management actions; communities could be
adversely impacted by changes in deer behavior. Deer may flee sharpshooting zones, which could
temporarily result in higher deer densities within the communities. However, following reduction in
the deer population within the Seashore, it is expected that the deer density within the communities
would decrease as well.
The experience of residents of and visitors to Fire Island communities within the Seashore,
including the impacts of proposed vegetation management, is addressed under the impact topic of
visitor use and experience/recreation.

Cumulative Impact Analysis
Past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions have the potential to impact Fire Island
communities and adjacent landowners. These actions include use of 4-Poster devices and deer
hunting and deer damage permits, as described under alternative A. The impact of these past,
present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions would be beneficial. When combining the
impacts of these projects with the impacts of alternative C, the cumulative impact would be
beneficial. Alternative C would contribute noticeably to the cumulative impact on Fire Island
communities and adjacent landowners.

Conclusion
Overall, under alternative C, the different methods used to reduce the deer population would result
in a decreased density more rapidly than under alternative B. Otherwise, impacts on Fire Island
communities and adjacent landowners would be similar to those impacts described under
alternative B. Fire Island communities and adjacent landowners would experience beneficial
impacts due to a decreasing deer population and reduced issues associated with deer, including
browse and trampling of vegetated landscapes, use of houses for shelter, and foraging in garbage

187

CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES

cans. Complaints about deer would be expected to decrease. Members of the Fire Island
communities and adjacent landowners who enjoy deer but worry about deer-related problems in
Fire Island communities may be reassured by the Seashore’s management program. Alternative C
would contribute noticeably to the cumulative impact on Fire Island communities and adjacent
lands. Neither beneficial nor adverse impacts are expected to be significant because deer would
continue to move between the matrix of public and private lands where residents have mixed
feelings about deer, but most residents would continue to be satisfied with the general quality of life
on Fire Island.

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE D
Impact Analysis
Under alternative D, the Seashore would incorporate a combination of actions to reduce
undesirable human-deer interactions and quickly reduce the deer population in the Seashore.
Educational/interpretive efforts would be expanded to reduce undesirable human-deer
interactions, incorporating elements from both alternatives B and C. Under alternative D, deer
management would include direct reduction of the deer population and use of direct reduction
and/or fertility control to maintain the deer population at an appropriate density. Fire Island
communities and adjacent landowners would experience benefits as the deer population decreases.
As under the other action alternatives, the number of human-deer interactions would be reduced.
The impacts of this outreach would be the same as described under alternative C because direct
reduction would be one of the management techniques employed. The risk of Lyme disease is
discussed in the section “Impacts on Public Health and Safety.”
Impacts of the deer management proposed under alternative D is a combination of those described
under alternatives B and C. As under alternative C, the impacts associated with a reduction in deer
population (e.g., reduced viewing opportunities, reduced deer browse and trampling of vegetation,
and other deer-related nuisances) would take place more quickly than under alternative B, due to
the initial population reduction. However, following the initial population reduction, the Seashore
could use fertility control treatments in addition to or in place of direct reduction methods for long­
term population maintenance. As under alternatives B (fertility control) and C (direct reduction
methods), community members may appreciate or take issue with the management methods.

Cumulative Impact Analysis
Past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions have the potential to impact Fire Island
communities and adjacent landowners. These actions include the use of 4-Poster devices and deer
hunting and deer damage permits, as described under alternative A. The impact of these past,
present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions would be beneficial. When combining the
impacts of these projects with the impacts of alternative D, the cumulative impact would be
beneficial. Alternative D would contribute noticeably to the cumulative impact on Fire Island
communities and adjacent landowners.

Conclusion
Overall, under alternative D, the Fire Island communities and adjacent landowners would
experience beneficial impacts due to a rapidly decreasing deer population and reduced issues
associated with deer, including browse and trampling of vegetated landscapes, use of houses for
shelter, and foraging in garbage cans. Complaints about deer would be expected to decrease.
188

Impacts on Public Health and Safety

Members of the Fire Island communities and adjacent landowners who enjoy deer but worry about
deer-related problems may be reassured by the Seashore’s management program although specific
opinions may vary depending upon the methods used for population density maintenance (i.e.,
direct reduction and/or fertility control). Alternative D would contribute noticeably to the
cumulative impact on Fire Island communities and adjacent landowners. Neither beneficial nor
adverse impacts are expected to be significant because deer would continue to move between the
matrix of public and private lands where residents have mixed feelings about deer, but most
residents would continue to be satisfied with the general quality of life on Fire Island.

IMPACTS ON PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY
METHODOLOGY
NPS Management Policies 2006 states that, “while recognizing that there are limitations on its
capability to totally eliminate all hazards, the Service . . . will seek to provide a safe and healthful
environment for visitors and employees.” The policies also state, “the Service will reduce or remove
known hazards and apply other appropriate measures, including closures, guarding, signing, or
other forms of education” (NPS 2006a).
The safety of both visitors and NPS employees at the Seashore could be affected by implementation
of the proposed deer management actions. Impacts on visitor and employee safety would be related
to the perceived risk of tick-borne illness under all alternatives, the presence of fences in the action
alternatives, and use of firearms under alternatives C and D. The purpose of this impact analysis is to
identify the level of impact that implementing each of the proposed alternatives would have on the
safety of visitors and employees at the Seashore.
Resource-specific context for assessing impacts of the alternatives on public health and safety
include:




Fire Island is composed of a matrix of public and private lands, including the 17 private
communities and towns, Smith County Park, Robert Moses State Park, and three municipal
beaches.
The Seashore strives to provide a safe and healthful environment for visitors and employees
by removing known hazards and applying appropriate measures (NPS 2006a).

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE A
Impact Analysis
Under alternative A, existing deer management and monitoring efforts throughout the Seashore
would continue. These actions include continued public education/interpretation efforts and deer
population surveys. The Seashore would continue to have no jurisdiction in the Fire Island
communities to enforce human-deer interaction regulations. Public health and safety would
continue to be at risk of adverse impacts.
Human-deer interaction management would remain unchanged. The Seashore would continue to
disseminate information related to human-deer issues using a variety of means. Interpretive exhibits,
waysides, and print media regarding natural resources and resource issues such as keeping wildlife
wild, Lyme disease, and other topics would continue to be offered at visitor contact locations and

189

CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES

would be made available to Fire Island communities where possible. The number of incidents
between humans and deer would remain the same or could increase. Incidents between humans and
deer would continue to be reported to and managed by the New York State Department of
Environmental Conservation. These incidents would have an adverse impact on public health and
safety. Deer would continue to approach humans, which is a safety concern for many residents,
particularly in confined spaces (e.g., boardwalks). Deer that are fed by humans are encouraged to
approach them, which creates perceived and actual safety hazards for people who do not initiate
contact. If the deer population continues to grow to the point at which deer compete for food
resources, public safety, particularly in developed areas, could be further impacted. Potential
indirect risks of tick-borne diseases (e.g., Lyme disease) associated with the deer population are
expected to remain the same.
The Seashore’s vegetation monitoring and management efforts would continue. The deer
population would remain unmanaged. Current vegetation management efforts are not likely to
impact public health and safety.
As the deer population continues to grow, risks to public health and safety associated with deer
could become increasingly likely. Tick-borne diseases would continue to be a public health concern
under the unmanaged and growing deer population. The indirect relationship between deer
presence and incidence of tick-borne illness is of particular concern at the William Floyd Estate.

Cumulative Impact Analysis
Past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions have the potential to impact public health
and safety. These actions include the tick management and monitoring program, deer hunting and
deer damage permits, and the use of 4-Poster devices.
The National Park Service would continue to monitor tick issues throughout the Seashore and
provide education to visitors regarding ticks, tick-borne illnesses, and preventive measures that
visitors can take to avoid exposure to ticks and tick bites and what to do in response to tick bites.
The 4-Poster devices use permethrin to treat deer for ticks. Although this treatment takes place
outside federal lands, treated deer may travel between the communities and the Seashore. Both of
these actions reduce the risk to public health and safety from exposure to ticks and thus tick-borne
diseases. Deer hunting and use of deer damage permits on nonfederal lands modestly reduces the
local deer population, which could further reduce the potential for negative human-deer
interactions.
The impact of these past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions would be beneficial.
When combining the impacts of these projects with the impacts of alternative A, the cumulative
impact would be beneficial. Alternative A would contribute imperceptively to the cumulative impact
on public health and safety.

Conclusion
Overall, under alternative A, adverse impacts on public health and safety would persist due to the
risk of human-deer interactions and indirect increases in health risks associated with ticks. These
risks could increase in the long term as the deer population increases. These risks would continue to
be associated with deer on both public and private lands. The National Park Service would continue
current efforts to educate the public both within the Seashore and beyond on methods for avoiding
hazardous situations. Alternative A would contribute imperceptively to the cumulative impact on
public health and safety. Adverse impacts would not be significant because the Seashore would

190

Impacts on Public Health and Safety

continue to provide a safe and healthful environment for visitors to and employees of the Seashore
as well as for residents of the other communities on Fire Island and adjacent to the William Floyd
Estate by applying appropriate prevention measures.

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE B
Impact Analysis
Under alternative B, the Seashore would use fertility control to gradually reduce the deer
population. The Seashore also would expand educational/interpretive efforts from those proposed
under alternative A. Both of these actions would decrease human-deer interactions. Public health
and safety would improve as the deer population and its associated risks decrease.
Human-deer interaction management would improve through enhanced educational efforts and
reduced risks of interaction. In addition to the items described under alternative A, Seashore staff
would enhance public educational/interpretative efforts within Fire Island communities and
communities adjacent to the William Floyd Estate to raise awareness of the role of humans in deerrelated issues. Programs could include information on the consequences of feeding wildlife and the
collaboration between the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and the
National Park Service. These programs would foster a sense of responsibility in the public and
increase the effectiveness of management efforts. Increased education within the communities
would likely lead to fewer deer that approach humans in the Seashore. Additionally, fencing of the
William Floyd Estate and a large area of the Sunken Forest would exclude deer, which would
further reduce the potential for human-deer interactions in these locations. As the deer population
decreases gradually over a period of approximately 13 years outside the deer exclosures, the
potential for risks associated with deer is also likely to decrease. Incidents between humans and deer
would likely decrease, thereby improving public health and safety. A smaller deer population would
lead to fewer hosts for ticks, and the risk of tick-borne diseases could decrease.
Deer would be excluded from certain areas of the Seashore. Although exclosures could cause deer
to migrate to other areas, these management efforts are not likely to noticeably impact public health
and safety.
Deer population management efforts also could impact public health and safety. The immediate
decline in the deer population within the communities as a result of translocation of deer that
approach humans would improve public health and safety.
In the case that an acceptable fertility control agent is not available immediately, risks associated
with current deer densities described under alternative A would continue for up to 10 years in areas
outside of deer exclosures. The fencing and enhanced educational efforts would take place
immediately upon implementation of the plan, regardless of the availability of an acceptable fertility
control agent.

Cumulative Impact Analysis
Past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions have the potential to impact public health
and safety. These actions include the tick monitoring and management program, deer hunting and
deer damage permits, and the use of 4-Poster devices, as described under alternative A. The impact
of these past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions would be beneficial. When
combining the impacts of these projects with the impacts of alternative B, the cumulative impact

191

CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES

would be beneficial. Alternative B would contribute noticeably to the cumulative impact on public
health and safety.

Conclusion
Overall, alternative B would have beneficial impacts on public health and safety because of the
reduced risk of deer and human incident as well as indirect health risks associated with ticks as the
deer population is reduced over approximately 13 years. Additional benefits would result from
outreach on how to reduce and/or avoid human-deer incidents is expanded. Although decreased,
risks would continue to be associated with deer on both public and private lands. The National Park
Service would enhance efforts to educate the public both within the Seashore and beyond on
methods for avoiding hazardous situations, and would make an active effort to remove deer that
approach humans and reduce the population in general. In the case that an acceptable fertility
control agent is not available immediately, adverse impacts associated with current deer densities
would continue for up to 10 years before the population could be reduced; however, benefits
associated with deer exclosure fencing and enhanced education would take place in the interim.
Alternative B would contribute noticeably to the cumulative impact on public health and safety.
Adverse impacts would not be significant because the Seashore would make strides towards
removing known hazards and applying appropriate measures to provide a safe and healthful
environment for visitors to and employees of the Seashore as well as for residents of the other
communities on Fire Island and adjacent to the William Floyd Estate. Beneficial impacts would not
be significant because the Seashore already takes many steps to provide a safe and healthful
environment for visitors and employees by removing known hazards and applying appropriate
measures.

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE C
Impact Analysis
Under alternative C, the Seashore would use direct reduction methods to rapidly reduce the deer
population. The Seashore also would expand educational/interpretive efforts, as under alternative
B. Both of these actions would decrease human-deer interactions. Public health and safety would
improve as the deer population and its associated risks decrease.
Impacts associated with improved human-deer interaction management and improved vegetation
monitoring and management efforts under this alternative would be very similar to those described
under alternative B. Human-deer interaction management would improve through enhanced
educational efforts and reduced risks of interaction. Expanded educational programs would foster a
sense of responsibility in the public and increase the effectiveness of management efforts. Increased
education within the communities would likely lead to fewer deer that approach humans in the
Seashore. A smaller deer population would lead to fewer hosts for ticks, and the risk of tick-borne
diseases could decrease. Unlike alternative B, there could be a perceived safety risk associated with
the methods of deer population management, but Seashore programs would strive to mitigate this
concern. Additionally, fencing of the Sunken Forest and some limited fencing at the William Floyd
Estate would further reduce the potential for human-deer interactions in these locations.
As under alternative B, deer would be excluded from certain areas of the Seashore. Though
exclosures could cause deer to migrate to other areas, these management efforts are not likely to
noticeably impact public health and safety.

192

Impacts on Public Health and Safety

Removal of deer under this alternative could result in perceived impacts on public health and safety.
Although sharpshooting would occur during times of year when visitation is low (late fall and
winter) in areas which would be closed off, the public could be uncomfortable with reduction of the
population through sharpshooting. Deer behavior has the potential to change as a result of
management actions; public safety could be adversely impacted by changes in deer behavior. Deer
may flee sharpshooting zones, which could result in higher deer densities in developed areas than in
the Seashore. These deer could become habituated may approach humans in the communities and
could pose public health and safety concerns.

Cumulative Impact Analysis
Past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions have the potential to impact public health
and safety. These actions include the tick monitoring and management program, deer hunting and
deer damage permits, and the use of 4-Poster devices, as described under alternative A. The impact
of these past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions would be beneficial. When
combining the impacts of these projects with the impacts of alternative C, the cumulative impact
would be beneficial. Alternative C would contribute noticeably to the cumulative impact on public
health and safety.

Conclusion
Overall, alternative C would have beneficial impacts on public health and safety due to reduced risk
of deer and human incident, as well as indirect reductions in health risks associated with ticks.
These impacts would be experienced over the long-term as the deer population is reduced and as
outreach on how to reduce and/or avoid human-deer incidents is expanded. The deer population
would decrease more rapidly under this alternative than under alternative B. Some short-term
increase in risk may occur within the communities as a result of sharpshooting; however, use of
sharpshooting would result in a more rapid decrease in deer population, which would result in a
reduction of risk, a beneficial impact on public health and safety. Although decreased, risks would
continue to be associated with deer on both public and private lands. The National Park Service
would enhance efforts to educate the public both within the Seashore and beyond on methods for
avoiding hazardous situations, and would make an active effort to remove deer that approach
humans and reduce the population in general. Alternative C would contribute noticeably to the
cumulative impact on public health and safety. Adverse impacts would not be significant because the
Seashore would make strides towards removing known hazards and applying appropriate measures
to provide a safe and healthful environment for visitors to and employees of the Seashore as well as
for residents of the other communities on Fire Island and adjacent to the William Floyd Estate.
Beneficial impacts would not be significant because the Seashore already takes many steps to
provide a safe and healthful environment for visitors and employees by removing known hazards
and applying appropriate measures.

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE D
Impact Analysis
Under alternative D, the Seashore would use direct reduction methods to rapidly reduce the deer
population. Following this initial reduction, the Seashore could use fertility control in addition to or
in place of continued direct reduction. The Seashore also would expand educational/interpretive
efforts, as under alternative B. These actions would decrease human-deer interactions. Public health
and safety would improve as the deer population and its associated risks decrease.

193

CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES

Impacts associated with improved human-deer interaction management and improved vegetation
monitoring and management efforts under this alternative would be very similar to those described
under alternative C. The primary difference would be the inclusion of fertility control methods of
deer management in addition to all other elements described under alternative C. As under the other
action alternatives, the potential for risks associated with deer is also likely to decrease as the deer
population decreases. Incidents between humans and deer would likely decrease, thereby improving
public health and safety. A smaller deer population would lead to fewer hosts for ticks, and the risk
of tick-borne diseases could decrease.
Deer population management efforts would have the potential to impact public health and safety.
The impacts of this alternative reflect a combination of impacts discussed under alternatives B and
C. Fertility control treatment has the potential to alter deer behavior, and people who notice
changes in deer behavior could fear a safety risk. Sharpshooting also could result in perceived
impacts on public health and safety. Even though areas where sharpshooting is taking place
would be closed off, the public could be uncomfortable with reduction of the population using
this method.
Deer may flee sharpshooting zones and would be excluded from some areas of the Seashore through
establishment of exclosure fencing. This could result in relatively higher deer densities in developed
areas than in the Seashore. These deer could become habituated and may approach humans in the
communities and could pose public health and safety concerns; however, deer observed
approaching humans could be targeted for capture and euthanasia to reduce this risk.

Cumulative Impact Analysis
Past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions have the potential to impact public health
and safety. These actions include the tick monitoring and management program, deer hunting and
deer damage permits, and the use of 4-Poster devices, as described under alternative A. The impact
of these past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions would be beneficial. When
combining the impacts of these projects with the impacts of alternative D, the cumulative impact
would be beneficial. Alternative D would contribute noticeably to the cumulative impact on public
health and safety.

Conclusion
Overall, alternative D would have beneficial impacts on public health and safety due to reduced risk
of deer and human incident, as well as indirect reductions in health risks associated with ticks.
These impacts would be experienced over the long-term as the deer population is reduced and as
outreach on how to reduce and/or avoid human-deer incidents is expanded. Some temporary
increase in risk may occur within the communities as a result of deer densities increase due to
construction of deer exclosures and use of sharpshooting; however, use of direct reduction would
result in a more rapid decrease in deer population, which would result in a reduction of risk, a
beneficial impact on public health and safety. This benefit would be sustained through deer
population density maintenance by the Seashore (using direct reduction and/or fertility control).
Although decreased, risks would continue to be associated with deer on both public and private
lands. The National Park Service would enhance efforts to educate the public both within the
Seashore and beyond on methods for avoiding hazardous situations, and would make an active
effort to remove deer that approach humans and reduce the population in general. Alternative D
would contribute noticeably to the cumulative impact on public health and safety. Adverse impacts
would not be significant because the Seashore would make strides towards removing known
hazards and applying appropriate measures to provide a safe and healthful environment for visitors

194

Impacts on Seashore Operations

to and employees of the Seashore as well as for residents of the other communities on Fire Island
and adjacent to the William Floyd Estate. Beneficial impacts would not be significant because the
Seashore already takes many steps to provide a safe and healthful environment for visitors and
employees by removing known hazards and applying appropriate measures.

IMPACTS ON SEASHORE OPERATIONS
LAWS AND POLICIES
Direction for management and operations at the Seashore is set forth in NPS Management Policies
2006 (NPS 2006a), the Seashore’s business plan (NPS 2004), and the Seashore’s general management
plan (NPS 1977, 2013c). The 2004 business plan identifies and describes the roles of each of the
Seashore’s five operational functions: management and administration, facility operations and
maintenance, law enforcement and visitor safety, resource management, and visitor experience
and recreation.

METHODOLOGY
The area of analysis for Seashore operations is the boundary of the Seashore. The discussion of
impacts on Seashore operations focuses on (1) the number of staff available to manage the program
and ensure visitor and resident safety, and (2) the ability of Seashore staff to protect and preserve
resources given current funding and staffing levels. This section includes an analysis of the projected
need for staff time and materials in relationship to each of the alternatives. Seashore staff were
consulted regarding expected staffing and funding needs under each alternative. The impact analysis
is based on the current description of Seashore operations presented in “Chapter 3: Affected
Environment” and are based on the assumptions documented in chapter 2. The analysis also
assumes that adequate funding would be received before implementation of the plan. The required
level of effort is discussed in terms of full-time equivalent, or FTE, which represents the hours
worked by staff. One FTE equals 2,080 hours, the equivalent of one person working full time yearround, or two part-time staff each working six months of the year. FTE estimates provided in this
section reflect anticipated levels of staffing for specific activities associated with each alternative.
Resource-specific contexts for assessing impacts on Seashore operations include the following:







Seashore staff is responsible for ensuring a safe and enjoyable visitor experience, protection
of Seashore resources, maintenance of Seashore facilities, and Seashore administration
throughout the entire Seashore.
The Seashore currently employs approximately 40 FTE and up to 60 seasonal part-time
equivalent positions annually (NPS 2012c).
Units of the National Park System must operate within the constraints of the unit-specific
budget and number of staff positions that have been allocated by Congress and the NPS
Director’s office. While funding for the plan would be received before implementation, there
would be an increased burden on Seashore staff responsible for administering the plan.
The Seashore was established “for the purpose of conserving and preserving for the use
of future generations certain relatively unspoiled and undeveloped beaches, dunes, and
other natural features. . . which possess high values to the Nation as unspoiled areas of
great natural beauty in close proximity to large concentrations of urban population”
(PL 88-587).

195

CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE A
Impact Analysis
Under alternative A, there would be no changes to current Seashore operations. The Seashore
would continue to employ approximately 40 permanent FTE staff, and up to 60 seasonal and intern
staff, to serve the four main functional areas: visitor experience and enjoyment, resource
management, maintenance, and management/administration (NPS 2012c).
Seashore staff would continue to spend approximately 270–300 hours per year on deer-related
community outreach, including planning, correspondence, transportation, Junior Ranger
programming, public programming, informal interpretation, publications, and implementation of
deer-related programming. Seashore staff would continue to manage reports of negative humandeer interactions and complete Case Incident Reports at current rates, approximately 185 hours
annually. Management of these reports would continue to take time away from other activities. The
Seashore’s deer population would continue to grow over time, although numbers would fluctuate
annually due to temperatures, snow depths, and duration of winter and food quality and quantity. If
efforts related to deer management increased substantially, funds and personnel from other
Seashore divisions might have to be reallocated from other activities.
The work performed by these staff would include coordinating and performing deer and vegetation
monitoring. The Seashore also would continue limited use of fencing to protect sensitive species and
landscapes, and would continue to monitor deer populations and vegetation. Staff time related to
maintenance and repair of fencing would be limited, requiring approximately four hours per year at
the William Floyd Estate and 32 hours, 16 hours each for two staff, on Fire Island. The vegetation
monitoring program would continue to be conducted every five years, requiring five dedicated staff
for four months, a total of 460 hours.
Deer monitoring would continue annually on Fire Island in general, requiring approximately 120
hours for three staff. Additionally, monitoring would take place every three years within the Fire
Island Wilderness and at the William Floyd Estate. Monitoring in the wilderness would require
approximately 25 hours of time from two staff every three-year cycle. Monitoring at the William
Floyd Estate requires 25 hours from three staff every three-year cycle. Current deer management
would continue as a recurring component of the Seashore’s resource management activities because
adverse impacts on forest health would continue indefinitely.

Cumulative Impact Analysis
Past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions have the potential to impact Seashore
operations. These actions include the tick monitoring and management program, deer hunting and
deer damage permits, waterfowl hunting, a William Floyd Estate cultural landscape report and
treatment plan, and enhanced monitoring and management of invasive plant species.
The National Park Service would continue to monitor tick issues throughout the Seashore and
provide education to visitors regarding ticks, tick-borne illnesses, and preventive measures that
visitors can take to avoid exposure to ticks and tick bites and what to do in response to tick bites.
The Seashore estimates that this effort requires eight hours per month for a six-month period. The
ongoing hunting of deer and implementation of deer damage permits would continue to modestly
decrease deer density and could therefore decrease the need for Seashore staff to invest time dealing
with deer-related issues.

196

Impacts on Seashore Operations

Permitting and overseeing the annual waterfowl hunt would continue to require a modest amount of
staff time during the hunting season. Preparation of a William Floyd Estate cultural landscape report
and treatment plan would require input and potentially some research by Seashore staff, and some
change in maintenance routines would likely take place. Lastly, enhanced monitoring and
management of invasive plant species could include a comprehensive invasive species management
plan for the Seashore that addresses prevention, surveillance, and management priorities. Staff time
would be required to prepare this plan and possibly to implement improved management strategies;
however, Seashore property and infrastructure may be better protected under a comprehensive plan.
The impact of these past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions would be adverse.
When combining the impacts of these projects with the impacts of alternative A, the cumulative
impact on Seashore operations would be adverse. Alternative A would contribute imperceptively to
the cumulative impact on Seashore operations.

Conclusion
Overall, alternative A would result in indirect adverse impacts on Seashore operations. This
alternative would not cause any direct change in the current level of effort to ensure a safe and
enjoyable visitor experience, protect Seashore resources, maintain Seashore facilities, and
administer the Seashore. However, not developing a long-range comprehensive plan to manage
vegetation and white-tailed deer may indirectly increase the burden placed on Seashore staff to
maintain visitor safety and to protect natural resources due to the level of effort required for items
such as responses to deer-related incidents. Such an increase in FTE needed to respond to a possible
rise in deer population and its associated impacts could detract from FTE needed for other Seashore
operations; units of the National Park System must operate within the constraints of their unitspecific budget. Seashore managers would continue to manage the Seashore in a manner consistent
with the purposes for which the Seashore was established. Alternative A would contribute
imperceptively to the cumulative impact on Seashore operations. Adverse impacts on Seashore
operations would not be significant because any change in the level of effort needed to manage the
Seashore (management includes ensuring a safe and enjoyable visitor experience, protection of
Seashore resources, maintenance of Seashore facilities, and Seashore administration) would be
gradual and would not cause a noticeable change in administrative and supervisory responsibilities.

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE B
Impact Analysis
Under alternative B, increased staff and budget would be required to coordinate and implement
human-deer interaction management. Visitor and community education/interpretation, which
would be a key component of this alternative, would be implemented to provide information related
to why deer management is needed, why it is occurring, and what steps should be taken to reduce
potential for negative human-deer interactions. The Seashore would also compile and circulate a list
of native deer-resistant or less desirable plant species to reduce deer presence within the
communities. Although the efforts would be slightly different than current conditions, the required
Seashore staff time would be comparable. However, if the Seashore undertakes efforts to engage the
communities in developing strategies for reducing negative human-deer interactions, it is
anticipated that at least one new FTE staff position, Seashore liaison to the Fire Island communities,
would be required. Further, if the Seashore obtains jurisdiction to manage human-deer interactions
in the communities, additional staff would be required. This new staff position would be dedicated
to the enforcement of deer-related restrictions, such as ticketing residents for feeding deer,
providing shelter for deer, or improperly storing garbage bins. In the long term, implementation of
197

CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES

human-deer management efforts would result in fewer human-deer interactions, therefore,
requiring less Seashore staff time to handle Case Incident Reports, currently estimated at 185 hours
annually. It is estimated that enhanced public educational/interpretation efforts would require
approximately 270–300 hours, as under alternative A, with an additional 180 hours for developing
lesson plans for local schools and additional programs and interpretation.
Coordination and implementation of vegetation protection efforts associated with alternative B,
such as fencing of the Sunken Forest, fencing of the historic core of the William Floyd Estate, and
rotational fencing at the lower acreage of the William Floyd Estate would likely require increased
staff time and budget. It is anticipated that impacts on staff time and budget would be greatest at the
onset of vegetation protection efforts, and would stabilize over time. Vegetation monitoring would
continue under this alternative, as described for alternative A and in chapter 3, but would require
that two additional vegetation surveys, for a total of five surveys, be conducted within the life of the
plan/EIS. These surveys would include data collection and analysis and require 320 hours by one
FTE and 640 hours each for five seasonal staff. Although the vegetation management elements of
alternative B would primarily be conducted by existing staff, a temporary silviculturist position
could be required to treat the William Floyd Estate if regeneration is not occurring after other
management efforts have been implemented.
Deer management under alternative B also would require an increase in Seashore staff time and
budget. Seashore efforts would be most intensive at the onset of deer population management but
would likely decline or stabilize over time. Deer management efforts proposed under alternative B
would include coordination and implementation of fertility controls, including capture, treatment,
and tracking of deer, and hazing to remove deer from within fenced areas in Sunken Forest and at
the William Floyd Estate.
A long-term increase in staff and budget would be required to implement application of an
acceptable fertility control agent. Costs are uncertain at this time and would be determined at a later
date depending upon the agent that becomes available. A temporary increase in staff and budget
would also be required to translocate deer from the Fire Island communities to the Fire Island
Wilderness. This would require time to coordinate the translocation with the communities, capture
the deer, treat the deer with the fertility control agent, transport, reverse and release the live animal,
and track the movement of these deer to ensure that they do not return to Fire Island communities.
Tracking is estimated to require 16 hours per month for two staff for the first three years of the plan.
Capture and euthanasia would be considered for translocated individuals that consistently return to
Fire Island communities and/or continue to approach humans.
If an acceptable fertility control agent is not available following implementation of this plan, the
increase in staff and budget needed for implementation would be delayed until such an agent is
available (assumed to become available within 10 years).

Cumulative Impact Analysis
Past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions have the potential to impact Seashore
operations. These actions include the tick monitoring and management program, deer hunting and
deer damage permits, waterfowl hunting, a William Floyd Estate cultural landscape report and
treatment plan, and enhanced monitoring and management of invasive plant species, as described
under alternative A. Under the action alternatives, the ongoing hunting of deer and implementation
of deer damage permits could supplement Seashore efforts to decrease deer density. This action
could modestly decrease the need for Seashore staff to invest time dealing with deer-related issues.
The overall impact of these past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions would be

198

Impacts on Seashore Operations

adverse. When combining the impacts of these projects with the impacts of alternative B, the
cumulative impact would be adverse. Alternative B would contribute noticeably to the cumulative
impact on Seashore operations.
If an acceptable fertility control agent is not available for immediate implementation, the burden
such an implementation would place on Seashore operations would be delayed for up to 10 years;
however, the indirect impacts on Seashore resources and the need to manage them (as discussed
under alternative A) would persist.

Conclusion
Overall, alternative B would have an adverse impact on Seashore operations due to the increase in
the level of time and materials to enhance public educational/interpretive efforts, improve
vegetation management, manage deer population, maintain Seashore facilities, and administer the
Seashore associated with this alternative. While it is assumed that adequate funding would be
established to support this effort, overseeing this program would place an additional burden on
Seashore staff responsible for overseeing implementation of the plan. Seashore managers would
continue to manage the Seashore in a manner consistent with the purposes for which the Seashore
was established. If an acceptable fertility control agent is not available immediately, Seashore staff
would be relieved of that operational burden for up to 10 years but would continue to manage the
resource issues associated with current deer densities. Alternative B would contribute noticeably to
the cumulative impact on Seashore operations. Adverse impacts on Seashore operations would be
significant because considerable funding beyond current levels would be required for Seashore staff
to ensure a safe and enjoyable visitor experience, protection of Seashore resources, maintenance of
Seashore facilities, and Seashore administration.

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE C
Impact Analysis
Under alternative C, increased staff and budget would be required to coordinate and implement
human-deer interaction management in the same ways as described under alternative B. It is
estimated that enhanced public education/interpretation efforts would require approximately 270–
300 hours, as under alternative A, with an additional 180 hours for developing lesson plans for local
schools and additional programs and interpretation.
Coordination and implementation of vegetation protection efforts associated with alternative C,
such as fencing the Sunken Forest, would likely require increased staff time and budget. The actions
and associated time and materials required would be similar to those as described under alternative
B; however, less fencing would be installed (and subsequently maintained) under this alternative. It
is anticipated that impacts on staff time and budget would be greatest at the onset of vegetation
protection efforts and would stabilize over time.
Similarly, deer management under alternative C would require an increase in Seashore staff time and
budget. Seashore efforts would be most intensive at the onset of deer population management, but
would likely decline or stabilize over time. Deer management efforts proposed under alternative C
would include coordination and implementation of deer removal, including the use of sharpshooting
and hunting.
Unlike under alternative B, there would be no translocation of deer to Fire Island Wilderness;
instead, deer that approach humans would be captured and euthanized. This treatment would be
199

CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES

less labor-intensive than the translocation and follow-up monitoring required under alternative B,
as it would not involve care of a live animal, reversal, or release.

Cumulative Impact Analysis
Past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions have the potential to impact Seashore
operations. These actions include the tick monitoring and management program, deer hunting and
deer damage permits, waterfowl hunting, a William Floyd Estate cultural landscape report and
treatment plan, and enhanced monitoring and management of invasive plant species, as described
under alternative A. The impact of these past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions
would be adverse. When combining the impacts of these projects with the impacts of alternative C,
the cumulative impact would be adverse. Alternative C would contribute noticeably to the
cumulative impact on Seashore operations.

Conclusion
Overall, alternative C would have an adverse impact on Seashore operations due to an increase in
the level of time and materials to enhance public educational/interpretive efforts, improve
vegetation management, manage deer population, maintain Seashore facilities, and administer the
Seashore. While it is assumed that adequate funding would be established to support this effort,
overseeing this program would place an additional burden on Seashore staff responsible for
overseeing implementation of the plan. Such an increase in responsibilities could detract from time
needed to supervise other Seashore operations. Seashore managers would continue to manage the
Seashore in a manner consistent with the purposes for which the Seashore was established.
Alternative C would contribute noticeably to the cumulative impact on Seashore operations.
Adverse impacts on Seashore operations would be significant because considerable funding beyond
current levels would be required for Seashore staff to ensure a safe and enjoyable visitor experience,
protection of Seashore resources, maintenance of Seashore facilities, and Seashore administration.

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE D
Impact Analysis
Under alternative D, increased staff and budget would be required to coordinate and implement
human-deer interaction management in the same ways as described under alternative B. It is
estimated that enhanced public education/interpretation efforts would require approximately 270–
300 hours, as under alternative A, with an additional 180 hours for developing lesson plans for local
schools and additional programs and interpretation.
Vegetation protection efforts associated with alternative D, such as fencing of the Sunken Forest
and fencing of the historic core of the William Floyd Estate, would likely require increased staff time
and budget. The actions and associated time and materials required would be similar to those
described under alternative B but with reduced efforts due to the lack of rotational fencing of the
William Floyd Estate lower acreage.
Deer management under alternative D also would require an increase in Seashore staff time and
budget. Seashore efforts would be most intensive at the onset of deer population management but
would likely decline and stabilize over time. Deer management efforts proposed under alternative D
would include coordination and implementation of direct reduction methods followed by
maintenance of the deer population through use of a reproductive control in addition to or in place
of direct reduction methods. The costs to implement this alternative would include the same
200

Summary of Impact Analysis

elements as those described under alternative C; however, if fertility control is used to maintain the
population, the cost to use fertility control would be less than described under alternative B because
its use would be limited to population maintenance (a less intensive use than when using it for
population reduction alone). Unlike under alternative B, there would be no translocation of deer to
Fire Island Wilderness; instead, deer that approach humans would be captured and euthanized. This
treatment would be less labor-intensive than the translocation and follow-up monitoring required
under alternative B, as it would not involve care of a live animal, revival, or release.

Cumulative Impact Analysis
Past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions have the potential to impact Seashore
operations. These actions include the tick monitoring and management program, deer hunting and
deer damage permits, waterfowl hunting, a William Floyd Estate cultural landscape report and
treatment plan, and enhanced monitoring and management of invasive plant species, as described
under alternative A. The impact of these past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions
would be adverse. When combining the impacts of these projects with the impacts of alternative D,
the cumulative impact would be adverse. Alternative D would contribute noticeably to the
cumulative impact on Seashore operations.

Conclusion
Overall, alternative D would have an adverse impact on Seashore operations because of an increase
in the level of time and materials to enhance public educational/interpretive efforts, improve
vegetation monitoring, manage deer population, maintain Seashore facilities, and administer the
Seashore. While it is assumed that adequate funding would be established to support this effort,
overseeing this program would place an additional burden on Seashore staff responsible for
overseeing implementation of the plan. Such an increase in responsibilities could detract from time
needed to supervise other Seashore operations. Seashore managers would continue to manage the
Seashore in a manner consistent with the purposes for which the Seashore was established.
Alternative D would contribute noticeably to the cumulative impact on Seashore operations.
Adverse impacts on Seashore operations would be significant because considerable funding beyond
current levels would be required for Seashore staff to ensure a safe and enjoyable visitor experience,
protection of Seashore resources, maintenance of Seashore facilities, and Seashore administration.

SUMMARY OF IMPACT ANALYSIS
SUSTAINABILITY AND LONG-TERM MANAGEMENT
The National Park Service is required to consider the relationship between short term uses of the
environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity (NEPA, section
102[2][c][iv]). In doing so, the National Park Service considers the long-term impacts of its actions
and whether its actions involve tradeoffs between immediate use of resources and long-term
productivity and sustainability of resources.
Alternative A would likely be the least sustainable option because it does not establish a long-term
deer management strategy. The Seashore would continue current monitoring activities and take
actions to protect resources on an as-needed basis, but the deer population would be likely to
continue to grow and cause increasingly adverse impacts on the Seashore’s ecology through direct
reduction of natural vegetation regeneration and indirect changes to habitat for other wildlife.

201

CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES

The action alternatives would be more sustainable than the no-action alternative because all three
would establish a long-term deer management strategy. Ultimately, all three of the action
alternatives are expected to provide protection for the local ecosystem through reduced deer
browsing on native vegetation and the indirect protection of the habitat this vegetation provides for
other wildlife. There is one primary difference between the alternative B approach to managing the
deer population and the approach of alternatives C and D when discussing sustainability. That
difference is the time needed to reduce the deer population density to a point at which the
ecosystem is anticipated to be most balanced. Under alternative B, it is estimated that the use of
fertility control alone to reduce the deer population would require a minimum of 13 years,
potentially much longer, to reach a density at which ecosystem balance is restored. Under
alternatives C and D, use of sharpshooting and hunting is expected to reduce the deer population to
the same density in approximately two years. Although all methods of reduction result in a more
sustainable deer population level that allows for long-term ecosystem productivity, the latter
alternatives reach that level more quickly.

IRREVERSIBLE OR IRRETRIEVABLE COMMITMENTS OF RESOURCES
The National Park Service is required to consider if its actions involve an irreversible or irretrievable
commitment of resources (NEPA, section 102[c][v]). Irreversible impacts are those effects that
cannot be changed over the long term or are permanent. An impact on a resource is irreversible if
the resource cannot be reclaimed, restored, or otherwise returned to its condition before the
disturbance. An irretrievable commitment of resources refers to the impacts on resources that, once
gone, cannot be replaced.
All alternatives would result in some low level of irreversible commitment of resources associated
with carrying out Seashore management activities, such as limited amounts of fuel and materials
consumption. Alternative A also risks an increasingly imbalanced ecosystem in which impacts on the
rare ecosystem of the Sunken Forest could result in irreversible impacts on vegetation, unique
vegetation communities, and special-status plant species, as well as other wildlife and wildlife
habitat. Due to the time needed to effectively reduce the deer population under alternative B, this
alternative also carries a risk of irreversible impacts on vegetation, unique vegetation communities,
and special-status plant species, as well as other wildlife and wildlife habitat as heavy deer browse
continues throughout the Seashore. No irreversible or irretrievable commitment of resources,
besides the fuel use incurred by Seashore operations, would take place under alternatives C and D.

UNAVOIDABLE ADVERSE IMPACTS
The National Park Service is required to consider if the alternative actions would result in impacts
that could not be fully mitigated or avoided (NEPA, section 102[c][ii]).
Under alternative A, there would be the potential for unavoidable adverse impacts on vegetation,
unique vegetation communities, and special-status plant species; the white-tailed deer population;
other wildlife and wildlife habitat; and wilderness due to the continued increase in the deer
population over time and the associated damage to Seashore vegetation. There would be long-term,
unavoidable, adverse effects on historic structures and archeological resources due to trampling and
erosion. There would also be unavoidable adverse impacts on cultural landscapes because deer
browse would prevent a more full restoration of the cultural landscape; restoration of the garden as
it existed previously would not be possible with the current level of deer browse. There would also
be unavoidable adverse impacts on visitor use and experience/recreation because of the lack of
vegetation and the associated wildlife and scenery that Seashore visitors enjoy. The Seashore would

202

Summary of Impact Analysis

also be prevented from fully interpreting the William Floyd Estate for visitors. There would be long­
term, unavoidable, adverse impacts on Fire Island communities and adjacent landowners, as well as
public safety, as the deer population would continue to grow or stabilize at a high density. This
population would continue to browse on the gardens and ornamental plantings within communities
and in lands adjacent to the William Floyd Estate. Deer would continue to approach humans and
would continue to have access to unsecured garbage containers. The public would continue to
associate the deer population with a risk of exposure to tick-borne illness and would perceive an
increased risk associated with high deer density. Unavoidable adverse impacts would continue on
Seashore operations, due to the demand on Seashore staff related to continued deer monitoring and
resource management.
Over the next 15 years, alternative B would include most of the unavoidable adverse impacts described
for alternative A because the benefits of reproductive control would not be realized until much later.
Unavoidable adverse impacts on some plant species could be mitigated, but not eliminated, by the use
of rotational fencing. Adverse impacts would be avoided within permanent fencing established around
the Sunken Forest and William Floyd Estate. Reproductive controls may have some unavoidable
adverse impacts if the actions were visible or audible to Seashore visitors. Reproductive controls may
adversely impact deer population behavior. Providing interpretive materials may help mitigate some of
this effect; however, reproductive control as proposed under this alternative would likely occur during
relatively high visitor use periods and would require a substantial effort to treat the required number
of deer. Unavoidable adverse impacts on Seashore operations would remain relatively the same as
alternative A, as the fence construction and reproductive control implementation would be completed
by a contractor or other federal employees.
Unavoidable adverse impacts under alternatives C and D would be greatly reduced when compared
to alternatives A and B. The reduction in deer numbers would occur relatively rapidly and the
Seashore’s vegetation would begin to recover within the life of the plan. This would mitigate adverse
impacts on vegetation, unique vegetation communities, and special-status plant species; the whitetailed deer population; other wildlife and wildlife habitat; and the cultural landscape at the William
Floyd Estate. Some wildlife that prefer more open habitat would be unavoidably impacted as the
vegetation recovered. There may be some unavoidable adverse impacts on visitors associated with
the implementation of the direct reduction. Conducting direct reduction at night and providing
interpretive materials would help mitigate some adverse effects. Unavoidable adverse impacts on
operations and management would remain relatively the same as alternative A, as the direct
reduction would be administered by a contractor or other federal employees.

INTRODUCTION
This “Consultation and Coordination” chapter describes the public involvement and agency
consultation completed during the preparation of this plan/EIS for Fire Island National Seashore.
A combination of activities, including public scoping, internal workshops, and agency briefings, has
helped to guide the National Park Service in developing this plan/EIS.

BRIEF HISTORY OF PLANNING AND PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT
The National Park Service divides the scoping process into two parts: internal scoping and external
(public) scoping. Internal scoping involves discussions among NPS personnel regarding the
purpose of and need for action, issues, available references and guidance, and other related topics.
Public scoping is the early involvement of the interested and affected public in the environmental
analysis process. The public scoping process helps ensure that the public has been given an
opportunity to comment and contribute early in the decision-making process. For this plan/EIS,
project information was distributed to individuals, agencies, and organizations early in the scoping
process. These groups were given the opportunity to express their views and identify important
issues and alternatives or alternative elements for the purpose of informing the decision-making
process.

INTERNAL SCOPING AND PLANNING
An internal scoping meeting was held in October 2010 to provide an opportunity for the NPS team
to initiate the NEPA planning process and discuss the management of white-tailed deer and
vegetation at the Seashore. Attendees included representatives from the NPS Denver Service
Center, NPS Northeast Region Office, NPS Biological Resource Management Division, US
Geological Survey Patuxent Wildlife Research Center, the Seashore, and their consultants. Topics
discussed during the meeting included the purpose, need, and objectives; public and agency
involvement; potential issues; data needs; and preliminary alternative elements.
This group met again in December 2011 and June 2012 to develop the alternatives that are
considered in this plan/EIS. The group reviewed the purpose, need, and objectives as well as
potential constraints, available management techniques, public input, and science team
recommendations to compile a full spectrum of potential alternatives. The alternatives that best
met the objectives of the plan/EIS were included in this document. The meeting held in June 2012
also included the cooperating agencies, as described below.
The internal scoping process continued throughout the development of the plan/EIS through
regular conference calls.

PUBLIC SCOPING AND OUTREACH
The Seashore published the Notice of Intent to prepare an EIS in the Federal Register on June 17,
2011. The Seashore also issued a press release on June 17, 2011, which was posted on the Seashore’s
website and emailed to the media and the Seashore’s mailing list. Additionally, articles were
published in local Fire Island newspapers, and links were shared via Twitter. These documents
represented the beginning of the public scoping and outreach process. In addition, the Seashore
published three newsletters (summer 2011, fall 2012, and fall 2013) that were provided to known
stakeholders and posted on the NPS PEPC website (http://parkplanning.nps.gov/fiis).

205

CHAPTER 5: CONSULTATION AND COORDINATION

The first newsletter was generated to gather public comments. It provided background
information; the purpose, need, and objectives associated with the plan/EIS; information on
alternatives development; and instructions about how to provide comments either through the
NPS PEPC website or using standard mail. The public comment period was from June 17, 2011,
through July 31, 2011. A total of 12 pieces of correspondence were received during the public
comment period, comprising approximately 90 comments. Comments received during the public
scoping process addressed a variety of issues. Topics included the potential use of volunteers or
contractors to assist with deer population management, social impacts, visitor conflicts and safety,
the NYS-DEC 4-Poster tick management study, and potential deer population management
methods, including public hunting. A public scoping report summarizing these comments was
uploaded to the NPS PEPC website for public viewing.
The second and third newsletters provided updates on the planning process. The second
newsletter included the status of the planning process, a summary of public comments received on
the first newsletter, additional information on the alternatives development process, and a list of
preliminary alternatives. The third newsletter focused on what was accomplished in 2013 and the
pending project schedule. The second and third newsletters did not solicit public comments.

PUBLIC REVIEW OF THE DRAFT PLAN/EIS
The draft plan/EIS was available for public and agency review from July 31, 2014 through October
10, 2014. The availability of the draft plan/EIS was announced through the Seashore’s website
(www.nps.gov/fiis); through a newsletter sent to interested parties, elected officials, and
appropriate local and state agencies; and through press releases. The draft plan/EIS was made
available through several outlets, including the PEPC web site (http://parkplanning.nps.gov/fiis),
the public meetings, by contacting the Seashore Superintendent to request an electronic copy (on a
CD), and at the following public libraries: Patchogue-Medford Library (Patchogue, NY), Sayville
Library (Sayville, NY), Mastics-Moriches-Shirley Community Library (Shirley, NY), Bayport-Blue
Point Public Library (Blue Point, NY), Bay Shore-Brightwaters Public Library (Brightwaters, NY),
and Babylon Public Library (Babylon, NY). The public was encouraged to submit comments
electronically through the National Park Service’s PEPC web site, by US Postal Service or other
mail delivery service, or hand delivery directly to the Superintendent at the Seashore’s
headquarters in Patchogue, New York. Written comments were also accepted during the two
public open houses discussed below.
In August 2014, two public open houses were held to continue the public involvement process and
facilitate community feedback on the draft plan/EIS. The open houses were held on August 20,
2014 at the Patchogue Ferry Terminal in Patchogue, NY and on August 22, 2014 at the Woodhull
School in Ocean Beach, NY. The open houses were announced on the PEPC website, the
Seashore’s website and through news releases. A total of 53 attendees signed in during the two
open houses. The meeting at Patchogue was attended by 5 people, and the meeting at Ocean Beach
was attended by 48 people. Upon arrival, each attendee was offered a comment form, which
included directions on how to provide comments directly on the PEPC website, and was oriented
to the setup of the open house format. The public open houses comprised a series of display boards
along the walls of each meeting space. Display boards summarized the NEPA process; targets;
desired conditions; background information; existing conditions; purpose, need, and objectives;
the alternatives; and information on how to provide comments. During the second meeting, the
Seashore Superintendent and his staff responded to public inquiry by conducting an informal
question and answer session. Written public comments were accepted at the open houses and
entered into PEPC as correspondences. The National Park Service also provided copies of

206

Cooperating Agencies

frequently asked questions regarding the project, a chronology of major events, and the purpose,
need, and objectives.
During the open comment period, a total of 1,631 correspondences was received, with 1,525 (94%)
from commenters in the state of New York, and the remaining from 25 other states and 15 other
countries. The majority of correspondences came from unaffiliated individuals, with 1,624 (99.6%)
correspondences. Within those correspondences, 1,027 comments were extracted, including 261
(25%) substantive comments, and 766 (75%) non-substantive comments.
The 261 substantive comments fell into 24 codes. Approximately 44% of the comments fell under 3
of the 24 codes, which related to implementation of fertility control research as a management
action, dismissed alternatives/elements, and suggested changes to action alternatives. The most
common code was AL2300: Implementation of Fertility Control Research as a Management
Action, which had 59 (23%) of the substantive comments, followed by AL7000: Dismissed
Alternatives/Elements, with 42 (16%) of the substantive comments. Of all the substantive
comments, some related to methods and alternatives, while others related to the document’s text
and content. Comments ranged from topics of natural resources such as wildlife, wilderness, and
vegetation; to methodology such as data used, purpose and need, implementation, and
analysis/decision making. Other comments related to visitor and resident experience and public
safety. A few comments offered new alternative elements or implementation ideas.
The 766 non-substantive comments fell into 6 codes. Most of the comments expressed an opinion
of support or opposition for methods or alternatives, with a few comments relating to topics
outside the scope of the plan/EIS. Of the non-substantive comments, the majority opposed direct
reduction methods, while a few supported the NPS preferred action alternative, and a smaller
amount opposed capture and euthanasia. The least amount of commenters supported no action.
Refer to “Appendix E: Public Comment Analysis Report” for a detailed report of the public
comments received and the NPS responses.

FINAL PLAN/EIS
This final plan/EIS will be made available for public inspection for a 30-day no-action period,
which begins with the publication of the US Environmental Protection Agency Notice of
Availability. After the 30-day no-action period, a record of decision will be prepared that will
document approval of the plan, select the alternative to be implemented, and set forth any
stipulations required for implementation. The record of decision will be signed by the Regional
Director of the Northeast Region, after which Notice of Availability of the record of decision will
be published to the Federal Register. This publication will complete the NEPA process, at which
time the National Park Service will begin to implement the selected alternative.

COOPERATING AGENCIES
In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 USC 4321-4370h) and the
CEQ regulations sections 1501.5 and 1501.6, the National Park Service invited the New York State
Department of Environmental Conservation and the US Department of Agriculture Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Services (APHIS) to be cooperating agencies for the plan/EIS in letters
dated November 29, 2011. Each agency accepted this offer in memoranda of understanding which
was signed by NYS-DEC on June 8, 2012, and by APHIS on June 19, 2012. The National Park
Service finalized the memoranda of understanding on July 3, 2012. The cooperating agencies

207

CHAPTER 5: CONSULTATION AND COORDINATION

participated in the monthly interdisciplinary team status calls and the development of alternatives,
provided information in their areas of technical expertise, and had the opportunity to comment on
the internal review draft plan/EIS as it was prepared.

AGENCY AND TRIBAL CONSULTATION
In addition to establishing which agencies would serve as cooperating agencies, as described above,
other agencies were consulted to aid in identification of potential issues to be addressed in the
plan/EIS. Agency consultations are summarized below, and copies of relevant correspondence are
included in appendix A.

FEDERAL AGENCIES
Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act. The Seashore initiated consultation under section 7 of
the Endangered Species Act with a letter to the US Fish and Wildlife Service on July 7, 2011. This
letter notified the agency of the plan/EIS preparation and invited the agency to provide input and
information on the presence of federally listed threatened and endangered species in the vicinity of
the Seashore. A search of the USFWS Information, Planning, and Conservation System noted that
six federally listed species are potentially found in the project area:







federally threatened piping plover (Charadrius melodus)
federally proposed threatened red knot (Calidris canutus rufa)
federally endangered roseate tern (Sterna dougallii dougallii)
federally endangered sandplain gerardia (Agalinis acuta)
federally threatened seabeach amaranth (Amaranthus pumilus)
federally proposed endangered northern long-eared bat (Myotis septentrionalis)

The US Fish and Wildlife Service responded to the National Park Service’s request for information
regarding Federally-listed species within the project area via letter dated March 22, 2012. The US
Fish and Wildlife Service listed three species which may occur within the project area:




federally threatened piping plover (Charadrius melodus)
federally threatened seabeach amaranth (Amaranthus pumilus)
federally endangered roseate tern (Sterna dougallii dougallii)

The piping plover and seabeach amaranth are found on the ocean beaches and Smith Point County
Park, and do not occur on the William Floyd Estate. Roseate terns may breed in small numbers on the
offshore bay islands and forage in its adjacent waters.
The Seashore has determined that the proposed action is not likely to adversely affect these federally
listed species due to their habitat locations. The National Park Service sent a letter dated June 10,
2015, to the US Fish and Wildlife Service to confirm this determination. An electronic copy of the
plan/EIS on CD was provided with the letter.
The northern long-eared bat (Myotis septentrionalis) was listed as federally threatened by the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service on April 2, 2015. The presence of northern long-eared bats has only been
documented at the William Floyd Estate. Several northern long-eared bats were captured during
summer and fall mist-net surveys at the William Floyd Estate in 2014 and 2015.

208

Agency and Tribal Consultation

Based on discussions with the US Fish and Wildlife Service, it was determined that actions in this
plan/EIS would have no effect on northern long-eared bats. Proposed actions at the William Floyd
Estate, such as constructing a fence around the historic core and/or rotational fencing in the lower
acreage, falls under “minimal tree removal” and “forest management practices” in the 4(d) rule,
which is exempted from “take” since the goal is to promote a naturally regenerating forest and
improve habitat for bats. In addition, fences would not be constructed during the pup season (June
1-July 31) to avoid disturbance to possible maternity roosts in the area.
In a letter dated October 13, 2015, the US Fish and Wildlife Service acknowledged the National Park
Service’s determination of no effect on piping plover, roseate tern, red knot, and northern long-eared
bat and concurred with the determination that the proposed project would not be likely to adversely
affect seabeach amaranth.
The Seashore will continue to coordinate with the agency as the project moves forward, as needed.
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. When the Seashore initiated consultation
under section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act in a letter dated July 13, 2011, it
intended to use the plan/EIS for compliance with both section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act and the National Environmental Policy Act. On May 30, 2014, the Seashore
contacted the New York State Historic Preservation Office by letter stating the extent of effects on
cultural resources is uncertain and an effect determination of no adverse effect was issued for the
plan/EIS. The letter further stated undertakings outlined in the plan will be evaluated on a case-by­
case basis when locations and effects for each undertaking can be more clearly identified, in
accordance with the 2008 nationwide Programmatic Agreement. The Seashore will provide the
New York State Historic Preservation Officer with a copy of the plan/EIS and will continue to
coordinate with the agency as the project moves forward, as needed.

AMERICAN INDIAN TRIBES
In accordance with the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation regulations, 36 CFR 800, the
Seashore initiated consultation under section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act with
the Unkechaug Indian Nation and the Shinnecock Indian Nation in July 2011. These initial letters
notified the American Indian tribes of the Seashore’s intent to use the plan/EIS for compliance with
both section 106 and the National Environmental Policy Act. On May 30, 2014, the Seashore
contacted these American Indian tribes by letter stating the extent of effects on cultural resources is
uncertain and an effect determination of no adverse effect was issued for the plan/EIS. The letters
further stated undertakings outlined in the plan will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis when
locations and effects for each undertaking can be more clearly identified, in accordance with the
2008 nationwide Programmatic Agreement. The Seashore will provide both the Unkechaug Indian
Nation and the Shinnecock Indian Nation with a copy of the plan/EIS and will continue to
coordinate with the American Indian tribes as the project moves forward, as needed.

STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES
New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. The Seashore initiated
consultation with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation with a letter
dated July 7, 2011. The agency responded on July 22, 2011, suggesting the Seashore review the
state’s draft deer management plan, seriously consider public hunting as a management alternative,
and maintain a cooperative relationship with the New York State Department of Environmental

CHAPTER 5: CONSULTATION AND COORDINATION

Conservation. As described above, the New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation is now a cooperating agency on the plan/EIS.
NYS-DEC Division of Fish, Wildlife and Marine Resources. The Seashore coordinated with the
NYS-DEC Division of Fish, Wildlife and Marine Resources on July 14, 2011, to provide input and
information on the presence of New York state-listed threatened and endangered species in the
vicinity of the project area. The Habitat Inventory Unit responded to the Seashore’s request on
March 5, 2012. Their report included rare and state-listed animals and plants, significant natural
communities, and other significant habitats that, according to the New York Natural Heritage
Program database, occur or may occur on or in the vicinity of the project area (see appendix A). As
discussed in chapter 1, the Seashore has determined that the proposed action is not likely to adversely
affect these listed species. The Seashore will provide the Habitat Inventory Unit with a copy of the
plan/EIS and will continue to coordinate with the agency as the project moves forward, as needed.
Federal Consistency Review, New York State Department of State (Coastal Management
Program). NPS staff reviewed the project with staff from the Coastal Management Program following
release of the draft plan/EIS. It was determined that the project would not require a formal consistency
determination under the Coastal Zone Management Act because the proposed actions (including
fencing and deer management) would not affect the resources of the state’s coastal area.

VEGETATION MONITORING PLAN

INTRODUCTION
The vegetation monitoring plan enables the Seashore to analyze how vegetation within the
boundaries of Fire Island National Seashore (Seashore) responds to management actions
implemented as a result of the White-tailed Deer Management Plan and Environmental Impact
Statement (plan/EIS). It also allows for the Seashore to monitor specific vegetation targets defined
in the plan/EIS.
Specific targets have been established for forested areas of the park which include: The Sunken
Forest, Talisman, Blue Point, and The William Floyd Estate. Due to the difficulty in establishing
vegetation targets in habitat types other than forests, such as an early successional open swale
habitat, the Lighthouse and Otis Pike High Dune Wilderness Area do not have specific vegetation
targets. The desired condition in these areas would be to simply see a positive response in
vegetation and an increase in native species diversity. Below is an overview of the plan. Please note,
detailed protocols for monitoring are not included in this document but will be available in a
separate document.
While not all areas throughout Fire Island can be monitored, data collected in surveyed areas can
act as indicators for other non-surveyed areas. Only vegetation on federal tracts within the
boundaries of the Seashore will be surveyed as part of this vegetation monitoring plan. Areas that
fall within this plan are (from west to east) Lighthouse, Sunken Forest, Talisman, Blue Point, Otis
Pike Fire Island High Dune Wilderness Area, and the William Floyd Estate. Monitoring of
vegetation within established permanent plots will occur every 3 years (during the field season from
May-September) after implementation of the plan/EIS. For logistical reasons, these surveys can be
staggered within the 3 year period.

VEGETATION AREAS
LIGHTHOUSE
This area is primarily characterized by northern beach grass, dune, interdune beach grass, beach
heather mosaic, northern dune shrub land, maritime deciduous shrub forest, brackish meadow,
northern interdunal cranberry swale, and northern salt shrub (Klopfer et al. 2002). Permanent plots
will be established in 2014 before the implementation of the plan/EIS.

SUNKEN FOREST
The Sunken Forest is an old-growth maritime holly forest and is ranked as a critically imperiled (G1
status) habitat. The desired future condition of the Sunken Forest is to maintain the character of the
maritime holly forest in perpetuity by ensuring the regeneration of key canopy constituent tree
species and a reasonable representation of herbs and shrubs reminiscent of its floristic composition
when the Seashore was established.
Targets. The Sunken Forest vegetation monitoring utilizes 10m x 10m permanent vegetation plots
established by Hank Art in 1967 (Art 1976). Targets for the Sunken Forest were created by utilizing
data collected in 1967, a time in which deer were rarely seen on Fire Island. These targets fall into
the range of what was observed in 1967.

TALISMAN AND BLUE POINT
Talisman and Blue Point are similar areas which mostly consist of maritime deciduous scrub forests
and are also characterized by maritime holly forest (Klopfer et al. 2002). To monitor whether these
two locations reach adequate recruitment or not, the Seashore modified the recruitment index and
weighting factors established by McWilliams et al. 2005 (table C-5). While it was difficult to
compare these forests to others in the Northeast, this modification seemed most appropriate after
reviewing literature (see references below), considering vegetation survey methods practiced at this
site, and reviewing the data available. These sections of maritime forests are also extremely stunted
due to the conditions they grow in (barrier island). Permanent vegetation plots established in 2012
by Jordan Raphael (NPS Biologist) are used to monitor vegetation targets.
Targets. Densities of living “seedlings” are recorded within each 100 m2 (10 m x 10 m) permanent
vegetation plot. There are 2 size class categories that need to be surveyed, and weighting factors are
applied to each seedling according to its size class (table C-5). For example, one seedling that is
greater than 150 cm in height and less than 1 cm DBH is equivalent to 50 “seedlings.” Forest
regeneration targets (adequate recruitment) will be reached when an average of 2 seedlings per
square meter (20,000 seedlings per ha) is observed. Table 6 is a list of species (genus for Quercus)
that are used to monitor targets; these 7 added together must reach the threshold of 2 seedlings per
m2 (20,000 seedlings per ha). Prunus serotina (black cherry) is left out of the targets due to its
dominance within the understory. Evidence suggests that deer avoid this species, and it has
increased in dominance as a result (Horsley, Stout, and DeCalesta 2003; Forrester 2004).

OTIS PIKE FIRE ISLAND HIGH DUNE WILDERNESS AREA
Much of the wilderness area is characterized by an extensive saltmarsh and reedgrass marsh
network. This site is also vegetated by northern dune shrubland, northern beach grass dune, pitch
pine dune woodland, highbush blueberry shrub forest, and beach heath dune (Klopfer et al. 2002).
Permanent plots will be established in 2014, before the implementation of the plan/EIS.

WILLIAM FLOYD ESTATE
The wooded lots of the William Floyd Estate is dominated by coastal oak-heath forest and also
characterized by pitch pine-oak forest, maritime deciduous scrub forest, acidic red maple basin
swamp forest (red maple-tupelo dominant) (Klopfer et al. 2002).
The Seashore has adopted recruitment index and weighting factors established and defined by
McWilliams et al. 2005 (table C-8). This seemed most appropriate after reviewing literature (see
references below), considering vegetation survey methods practiced at this site, and reviewing the
data available. Permanent vegetation plots established by Jordan Raphael (NPS Biologist) in 2013
are used to monitor vegetation targets.
Targets. Forest regeneration targets (adequate recruitment) will be reached when an average of 2
seedlings (native and deer preferred species) per square meter is observed (McWilliams et al. 2005).
To monitor for vegetation targets, the densities of living seedlings greater than 5 cm in height but less
than 1 cm DBH are recorded within the four 1 m2 subplots located at the corners of each 100 m2 (10 x
10 m) plot. There are four height class categories that are surveyed, and weighting factors are applied
to each seedling according to its height class (table C-2). For example, one seedling that is greater than
150 cm in height and less than 1 cm DBH is equivalent to 50 seedlings that are 5 cm–30 cm in height.

DEER MONITORING PLAN

INTRODUCTION
Deer population and deer behaviors will be monitored to gauge success of actions taken to meet
Seashore objectives for the White-tailed Deer Management Plan and Environmental Impact
Statement (plan/EIS) for Fire Island National Seashore. Objectives are written for the entire
Seashore (Seashore-wide), as well as for specific areas such as the Sunken Forest, Fire Island
communities, and the William Floyd Estate.
As outlined in chapter 2 of the plan/EIS, targets have been defined for deer population and deer
behavior. This monitoring plan serves as a strategic operating plan for monitoring deer population
and deer behavior throughout the life of the plan/EIS. Data collected will be used to inform
Seashore managers on the success of management actions in the preferred alternative.

DEER POPULATION MONITORING
BACKGROUND
Distance sampling surveys have been conducted at Fire Island National Seashore to estimate whitetailed deer densities within certain areas of Fire Island since 1995 (Underwood, Verret, and Fischer
1998). This annual effort was done in tandem with the long-term fertility control research project
through 2009 and has been continued since. The Seashore has been separated into several
locales/sites for surveying: Robert Moses State Park, Lighthouse Tract, Kismet to Lonelyville,
Ocean Beach to Ocean Bay Park, Sailors Haven, Fire Island Pines, Davis Park, Fire Island
Wilderness and the William Floyd Estate. The goal each year is to survey all sites; however, not all
locales are surveyed every year due to staffing, budgetary and time constraints. Protocols are
outlined in Underwood, Verret, and Fischer (1998) and were updated in NPS (2009).
Distance sampling theory accounts for partial detection, assuming that only animals directly on the
survey route or transect will be detected, and that the probability of detection will decrease away
from the transect line (Buckland et al 1993). This alleviates the need to correct for missed animals.
The detection function describes the decrease in ability of the surveyor to detect objects with
increasing distance from the transect. The area around the transect where objects are counted can
be computed from this function. This model is then used to calculate the effective strip width
(ESW), where the number of animals detected inside the ESW equals the number of animals
detected outside the ESW.
The Seashore uses DISTANCE 6. 0 (Thomas et al 2010), a free software program, to fit the
detection function, calculate the ESW and fit a density function to the distance sampling data
collected. This process is used to generate deer densities for white-tailed deer within each of the
study units at Fire Island National Seashore. The Seashore has partnered with Dr. H. B Underwood
(USGS and SUNY-ESF) in generating deer densities from DISTANCE 6. 0 from field data collected
by NPS staff and interns.

SURVEY PROCEDURES/DATA COLLECTION
Sites, along with routes, for monitoring deer populations across Fire Island and at the William
Floyd Estate are detailed in Underwood, Verret, and Fischer (1998) and NPS (2009). The name and
length of each boardwalk or road is stored in a digital database for community sites (except Davis
Park) and the William Floyd Estate. Samples of boardwalk segments or roads are drawn randomly

C-1

APPENDIXES

for a given survey. The total number of boardwalks or roads selected is based upon a minimum
length of transect required to achieve a desired level of precision (Underwood, Verret, and Fischer
1998). For all other sites with smaller areas and accessibility there are predetermined routes that
meet the length requirement for a desired level of precision (Underwood, Verret, and Fischer 1998;
NPS 2009). Community sites and most natural areas on Fire Island are surveyed every year,
whereas the William Floyd Estate and Fire Island Wilderness are surveyed every 2-3 years. Once
the plan/EIS is implemented, these areas would also be surveyed annually.
Surveys are initiated either 20 minutes before official sunrise or timed so the survey is finished just
before sunset. This is to ensure sampling is conducted when deer are most active. In addition, the
surveyor must proceed slowly in order to scan both sides of the transect thoroughly and with equal
efficiency. If conducting the survey from within a vehicle, speeds are constrained to no more than
10 mph.
When a deer group ( ≥ 1 deer) is encountered, data should be collected as rapidly and quietly as
possible. Ideally, deer should be detected and observed before they become aware of the
researcher’s presence. Binoculars are utilized to observe details of appearance and behavior when
necessary (e.g., determining sex or age at a distance).
In the communities (with random survey routes), observations of deer are recorded on the first
passage through a segment of the selected boardwalk. Any observations made while backtracking
through a boardwalk are not counted. The surveyor should take the shortest route from one
selected boardwalk to the next to minimize the time lapse between observations. This also allows
deer less time to travel, thereby reducing the chances of viewing the same animal more than once. A
map and pre-determined route should be chosen and studied before starting the survey.
The following is a list of data to be collected in the field:
1) Herd Composition
Individuals within each deer group encountered are classified according to sex and age at the
time of sampling. Group size is also included. If group membership is questionable, distances
and angles to each deer are recorded as if it were alone. These observations are marked
uniquely, then discussed and resolved later.
Sex is classified as (1) male, (2) female or (3) unknown. Age is classified as (1) fawn (less than 1
year-old), (2) yearling (between 1-2 years old), (3) adult (greater than 2 years old) and (4)
unknown. In addition, it should be noted whether fawns have spots visible on their coats.
Physical morphological criteria developed from numerous observations of deer are used to
determine the sex and age of individuals.
2) Perpendicular Distance
After initial observations are made, the perpendicular distance from the observer is recorded
using a hand-held laser rangefinder. If the deer has moved from its original location, the
distance from another object close by can be used. The distance is estimated for deer less than
15 m away by the observer.
If the perpendicular distance cannot be measured directly, the following measurements are
taken: (1) radial distance (i.e., distance from where you located deer), (2) transect direction
(compass bearing), and (3) object direction (compass bearing). These measurements are used to
C-2

Appendix C: Deer Monitoring Plan

calculate the angle to the object and perpendicular distance is computed later in DISTANCE.
In addition, a GPS point should be recorded for each detection.

3) Ancillary Data
Ancillary data includes: information on the initial, habituation/reactive and undesirable food
conditioning behavior of deer in each detection (Table B-1); forage type, if applicable (table B­
1); start/end times of each survey; and GPS points for each detection.
NOTE: There are three properties of distance data that are fundamental for reliable density
estimation:
1) The person/s surveying a particular unit must remain the same within sampling of that unit
due to individual differences in detection.
2) There must be enough objects observed by the surveyor/s to adequately describe the
probability of detection as a function of the perpendicular distance from the transect. In
sum, the more objects (i.e., deer) observed, the smoother the representation of the
detection function. For distance data of deer at Fire Island National Seashore we aim for
60-80 detections per site each year. This number may need to be adjusted in the future, as
the preferred alternative is implemented and the white-tailed deer population declines.
3) The transect length needs to be sufficient to achieve a desired level of precision. Based on
estimates generated in DISTANCE, the total length needed to travel has been estimated for
each study site.

DEER BEHAVIOR MONITORING
Behavioral data of deer is collected in conjunction with distance sampling data. Initial behaviors of
deer when first sighted were collected from 1995 through 2007. Undesired behaviors were also
noted, such as a deer feeding from a trash can. However, it’s uncertain how standardized and
consistent these notes have been through time.
Since 2008, we have followed a standard protocol for monitoring deer behavior. First, we use the
same sites used for distance sampling and categorize them as Community or Non-community.
Community sites include: Kismet to Lonelyville, Ocean Beach to Ocean Bay Park, Fire Island Pines
and Davis Park. Non-community sites include: Robert Moses State Park, Lighthouse Tract, Sailors
Haven, Wilderness-West (Watch Hill to Bellport Beach) and Wilderness-East (Bellport Beach to
Wilderness Visitor Center). A specific objective in the White-tailed Deer and Vegetation
Management plan/EIS is to reduce human-deer interactions within Fire Island communities (i.e.,
community sites). Non-community sites provide the Seashore with acceptable targets (rather than
just zero) for deer behaviors related to human-deer interactions.
Two different kinds of deer behavior are recorded: (1) initial behaviors, including food
conditioning behaviors and forage type (if applicable); and (2) habituation/reactive behaviors (table
B-1). Initial behavior refers to the behavior that the majority of the group are engaged in at the time
of detection. Habituation/reactive behaviors describe response to the observer’s presence; an
individual or group of deer within a detection is considered unaffected if they do not react to the
observer’s presence. The behaviors during the surveys could be affected by the distance of the deer
from the transect, and whether an individual or deer group is aware of the observer’s presence.
Behaviors are coded (table B-1) and proportions calculated.

REVIEW OF WHITE-TAILED DEER
FERTILITY CONTROL

INTRODUCTION
Managing the high density of certain wildlife species has become a topic of public concern (Rutberg
et al. 2004). Species such as Canada geese (Branta canadensis), coyotes (Canis latrans), and whitetailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) have become either locally or regionally highly dense in many
areas in the United States (Fagerstone et al. 2002). Traditional wildlife management techniques such
as hunting and trapping are often unfeasible, publicly unacceptable, or illegal in many parks, urban,
and suburban areas, forcing wildlife managers to seek alternative management methods (Kilpatrick
and Walter 1997; Muller, Warren, and Evans 1997). The use of reproductive control as a wildlife
management tool has been studied for several decades.
For reproductive control agents to effectively reduce population size, treatment with an agent must
decrease the reproductive rate to less than the mortality rate in a closed population with no
immigration or emigration. In an open population, where there is much animal movement into and
out of an area being considered for treatment, the use of fertility control agents is not likely to be
successful in decreasing a population (Rudolph, Porter, and Underwood 2000). Good estimates of
population emigration, immigration, birth and survival rates are needed before predictive models
can be used to approximate the effort required to successfully use contraception as a population
management technique.
The purpose of this document is to provide NPS managers at Fire Island National Seashore with: (1)
a brief overview of contemporary reproductive control options as they pertain to white-tailed deer;
(2) an outline of the primary advantages, disadvantages and challenges related to the application of
wildlife fertility control agents including population management challenges, regulatory issues,
potential logistical issues, and consumption issues; (3) an evaluation of current fertility control agents
against criteria established by the Seashore for use of a reproductive control agent. This document is
not intended to be exhaustive but to provide a scientifically sound basis for understanding and
evaluating deer management alternatives that include reproductive control of female deer.
It is important to note that some of the most critical elements of a successful population level fertility
control program focus on ecological and logistical questions rather than the efficacy of fertility
control agents in individual animals. It should also be noted that technology and regulation is
changing rapidly in this field and updated information should be reviewed prior to implementation
of a deer management program that involves fertility control.
There is general agreement that controlling large, open, free-ranging populations of wild ungulates
solely with a contraceptive vaccine is impractical and unlikely to succeed because of the logistical
difficulties of treating significant numbers of deer (Rutberg et al. 2004; Garrott et al. 1992; Garrott
1995; Warren 2000; Rudolph, Porter, and Underwood 2000; Cowan, Pech, and Curtis 2002; Merrill,
Cooch, and Curtis 2003, 2006). There is also agreement that fertility control as an exclusive means of
managing populations cannot reduce wildlife population size rapidly (Rutberg and Naugle 2008a;
Kirkpatrick and Turner 2008). The few long-term (greater than 10 years) research projects evaluating
population level effects of porcine zona pellucida vaccine (PZP) on long-lived species (horses and
deer) support this statement. At Assateague Island National Seashore, PZP treatments were
successful in reducing the wild horse population 16% (from 160 to 135 individuals) between 1994
and 2009 (15 years). The park expects to reach the target population size of 80–100 horses in another
5-8 years (Zimmerman, pers. comm., 2009). At Fire Island National Seashore, the Fire Island
communities funded a research study through The Humane Society of the United States to evaluate
the viability of immunocontraception as a newly emerging form of deer population control. The
program began in 1993 and ended in 2009, lasting 16 years. Seashore staff report a 33% reduction in

overall deer population size (from approximately 600 to 400 individuals) between 1994 and 2009
(Bilecki, pers. comm., 2009). In the most intensively treated areas of Fire Island, deer population size
decreased up to 55% over 15 years (Rutberg and Naugle 2008a). All population level studies have
been conducted in relatively closed populations. The appropriateness of fertility control as a deer
management tool is heavily dependent on specific park objectives, local deer population dynamics,
and the purpose and need for management.

CURRENT TECHNOLOGY
The area of wildlife contraception is constantly evolving as new technologies are developed and
tested. For the sake of brevity, this appendix will only discuss reproductive control as it applies to
female deer. There is a general understanding in white-tailed deer biology that managing the female
component of the population is more important than managing the male component. Based on the
polygamous breeding behavior of white-tailed deer, treating males with reproductive control would
be ineffective when the goal is population management (Warren 2000; Garrott and Siniff 1992).
Regulation of wildlife fertility control agents can be confusing. If a product is intended for use in a
food-producing animal, it must be deemed safe for human consumers. Regardless of its use in food
animals, a fertility control agent must be considered safe for use in the target species and not present
environmental health hazards to non-target species. Until 2006, the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) was the agency responsible for regulation of wildlife contraceptives and their potential for
drug residues. In 2006, the Environmental Protection Agency assumed responsibility for regulating
contraceptives for use in free-ranging wildlife and feral animals (Fagerstone et al. 2010). After a
product is federally registered with the EPA it must also be registered for use in each individual state
where a wildlife management agency or organization would like to apply a product.
The EPA in consultation with the contraceptive manufacturer/sponsor will determine the safety of
the product and marking requirements for free-ranging animals treated with contraceptives. Prior to
EPA registration products can be studied in free-ranging populations to gather safety and efficacy
data under an experimental use permit (EUP) which is obtained from the EPA by the product’s
sponsor. Until products are registered by the EPA, and marking requirements made explicit, animals
treated with any fertility control product should be permanently marked.
Marking is also needed for long-term monitoring of contraceptive efficacy in individual animals,
determining which deer have been treated during implementation and for efficient re-treatment, and
to monitor population vital rates. Finally, while NPS units have jurisdiction for wildlife management
within their borders, parks are strongly encouraged to cooperate and coordinate with state agencies
to manage cross boundary wildlife resources whenever possible (43 CFR § 24). Therefore, parks
should also communicate with appropriate state agencies regarding marking of treated animals in
areas where deer may cross park boundaries. The disadvantages of permanent marking are primarily
related to the substantial additional labor and costs of the first year’s capture and marking of treated
animals, sustainability of this effort over the long-term, capture associated stress to individual deer
(compared to remote delivery), and potential social acceptance concerns. Despite these drawbacks,
marking is nearly always warranted when considering a fertility control program.
There are three basic categories of reproductive control technology: (1) immunocontraceptives
(vaccines), (2) non-immunological methods (pharmaceuticals), and (3) physical sterilization.

Appendix D: Review of
White-tailed Deer Fertility Control

IMMUNOCONTRACEPTIVES
It has been suggested that immunocontraceptive vaccines offer significant promise for future wildlife
management (Rutberg et al. 2004). Immunocontraception involves injecting an animal with a vaccine
that stimulates its immune system to produce antibodies against a protein (antigen) involved in
reproduction (Warren 2000). In order to induce sufficient antibody production, an adjuvant is
combined with the antigen. An adjuvant is a product that increases the intensity and duration of the
immune system’s reaction to the vaccine. There are two primary types of antigens used in
reproductive control vaccines in deer: porcine zona pellucida (PZP) and gonadotropin releasing
hormone (GnRH).
Neither PZP nor GnRH vaccines are 100% effective in preventing pregnancy. Using a 2 dose
vaccination protocol Curtis et al. (2002) demonstrated approximately 85-90% decrease in the
number of fawns born per female after vaccination with either GnRH or PZP immunocontraceptive
vaccines in white-tailed deer. Likewise, Rutberg and Naugle (2008a) showed a 75% decrease in
annual fawn production using traditional PZP vaccination in two relatively closed white-tailed deer
populations and most recently demonstrated 95-100% decrease in fawning the first year and 65-70%
the second year after a single vaccination using several long-term and delayed release PZP vaccines
(Rutberg et al. 2013). In a more contemporary version of the GnRH vaccine, Gionfriddo et al. (2009,
2011) found approximately 70-90% infertility the first year and 40-50% infertility the second year in
white-tailed deer after a single vaccination. The GnRH vaccine has not been evaluated at the
population level. Efficacy generally decreases as antibody production wanes when using any
immunocontraceptive. Reduced pregnancy rates can usually be expected for 1-2 years posttreatment with immunocontraceptive vaccines although there is the potential for longer-term or
even permanent sterility (Fraker et al. 2002; Miller et al. 2008, 2009; Gionfriddo et al. 2011; Rutberg
et al. 2013). Duration of infertility is strongly related to the conjugate-antigen design, the adjuvant
used, how the vaccine is delivered, and the host’s immune system (Miller et al. 2008, Kirkpatrick et
al. 2009).
Porcine Zona Pellucida (PZP). The majority of immunocontraceptive research in wildlife has been
conducted using PZP vaccines. PZP vaccines stimulate production of antibodies directed towards
specific outer surface proteins of domestic pig ova (eggs). Pig ova are sufficiently similar to many
other mammals’ ova and antibodies produced will cross-react with the vaccinated animal’s own
ovum. PZP antibodies prevent fertilization, presumably by blocking the sperm attachment sites on
the zona which surrounds the ovum. There are currently several PZP vaccine products being
developed, one is called SpayVac®, another is simply called PZP, and finally there is heat extruded
and cold evaporated pelleted PZP. Each can be mixed with different adjuvants which may change
their efficacy.
SpayVac® (ImmunoVaccine Technologies, Halifax) uses a liposome preparation of PZP mixed with
an adjuvant to induce antibody production. This vaccine has been evaluated in a variety of species,
including captive and to a lesser extent free-ranging white-tailed deer (Brown et al. 1997; Fraker et al.
2002; Locke et al. 2007; Rutberg and Naugle 2009; Rutberg et al. 2013). Potential advantages of
SpayVac® compared to the native PZP vaccine are: 1) a more rapid immune response, 2) higher
antibody titers, 3) a higher proportion of antibodies that bind to target sites, and 4) longer duration
of efficacy (Fraker and Bechert 2007; Miller et al. 2009). Although little long-term data on population
level effects exists for SpayVac®, it is assumed effects are similar to those for the native PZP
formulation. The second PZP vaccine, often called “native” PZP, has been used extensively in
captive wildlife species in the course of investigating its effectiveness (Kirkpatrick et al. 1997; Turner,
Kirkpatrick, and Liu 1996; Walter et al. 2002a, 2002b). This vaccine requires multiple vaccinations

D-3

APPENDIXES

(e.g., 2 the first year and yearly thereafter) to maintain high antibody titers. The native PZP vaccine
has also been tested at length in free-ranging white-tailed deer (Rutberg and Naugle 2008a; Naugle et
al. 2002; Rudolph, Porter, and Underwood 2000; Rutberg et al. 2004; Walter et al. 2002a, 2002b;
Walter, Kilpatrick, and Gregonis 2003). Potential benefits of the native vaccine include the ability to
deliver the vaccine remotely via darts, its safety in pregnant deer and non-target species (Barber and
Fayrer-Hosken 2000), and the availability of at least some long-term data on population level effects
(Rutberg and Naugle 2008a).
Finally, the delayed release heat extruded or cold evaporated pelleted vaccine has recently been
tested in free-ranging deer. Advantages are increased efficacy and single application which lasts up to
two years but requires hand-injection and has strict vaccine storage requirements (Rutberg et al.
2013). There are no long-term or population level data on this new technology.
Challenges to the use of all PZP vaccines include lack of regulatory approval for use in free-ranging
deer populations, behavioral impacts (e.g., continued estrous cycling), out of season fawning, and
possibly changes in body condition. None of the PZP vaccines are currently registered for use in
free-ranging deer but may be in the future (see above for regulatory issues).
PZP based vaccines often cause out of season breeding behavior in treated deer because
reproductive hormones which are responsible for estrous cycling are not suppressed (Miller et al.
2009; McShea et al. 1997; Fraker et al. 2002; McShea and Rappole 1997). Repeated estrous cycling
has the potential to extend the population breeding season and male/female rutting behaviors.
Additionally, extended estrous seasons may result in late pregnancies if the vaccine fails (Fraker et al.
2002; McShea et al. 1997). Fawning later in the summer/fall may lead to higher fawn mortality as
winter ensues. Any effect that extends the rut also has the potential for secondary effects to both
male and female deer. Increased attempts to breed may result in increased deer movements. It has
been suggested that this may encourage deer-vehicle collisions. However, the only known research
evaluating this specific issue reported that deer treated with PZP were at no greater risk of being
involved in a deer-vehicle collision than untreated deer (Rutberg and Naugle 2008b).
Increased activity during rut can be energetically costly for both sexes. While this is likely offset by
the lack of pregnancy demands in female deer it may have cumulative effects on energy expenditures
in male deer (Walter, Kilpatrick, and Gregonis 2003; McShea et al. 1997). Alternatively, PZP-treated
females may experience increased body condition and a longer life span compared to untreated
individuals as a result of reduced energetic costs of pregnancy and lactation (Warren 2000; Hone
1992). For example, at Assateague Island National Seashore, the life span of horses treated with PZP
has been extended from an average age at death of 20 years to 26-30 years (Kirkpatrick and Turner
2008; Zimmerman, pers. comm., 2009). Longer life span may extend the time needed to observe a
decline in population size (Kirkpatrick and Turner 2008). Studies in white-tailed deer investigating
effects on body condition are equivocal (Walter, Kilpatrick, and Gregonis 2003; McShea et al. 1997).
There are no long-term studies investigating potential extended survival in free-ranging wild deer.
Successful field application of a fertility control program requires both an effective agent and a
practical delivery system (Cowan, Pech, and Curtis 2002). Although PZP vaccines may be
successfully delivered remotely through darting, the native PZP vaccine that has been tested most
extensively requires a series of two initial doses followed by periodic boosters in order to maintain
infertility. The need for multiple doses leads to significant logistical issues when working with freeranging white-tailed deer, particularly when the number of deer to be treated is high. SpayVac® does
not require a first year booster and may prove to be easier to implement because follow-up doses

D-4

Appendix D: Review of
White-tailed Deer Fertility Control

would only be required every 3-7 years (Fraker, pers. comm., 2009), however, to our knowledge
SpayVac® has not been delivered remotely. The new long-term pellets cannot be delivered via dart.
Many studies have modeled and a few field studies have tested population-level effects of PZP
vaccination (Rutberg et al. 2004; Nielsen, Porter, and Underwood 1997; Rudolph, Porter, and
Underwood 2000; Rutberg and Naugle 2008a; Rutberg et al. 2013). Research evaluating the
effectiveness of PZP in reducing the size of deer populations has focused on moderate to high
density deer populations of relatively small size (less than 300-500 individuals). Within these
populations, long-term (greater than 10 years) data indicates that population size may gradually
decline using PZP treatments (Kirkpatrick and Turner 2008; Rutberg and Naugle 2008a). Rutberg
and Naugle (2008a) reported a 27% decline in the size of a small, relatively closed, suburban deer
population (approximately 250 deer) between 1997 and 2002, as a result of PZP treatments and
potentially other stochastic events. However, level of success in reducing population size varies
widely. For example, deer density on Fire Island National Seashore was significantly reduced in
some areas but reduced very little in other areas likely due to inability to treat significant numbers of
does in certain areas (Rutberg and Naugle 2008a; Underwood 2005). Site specific modeling using
accurate population demographic and vital rate data as well as knowledge of local deer behavior,
land access availability and likelihood of achieving treatment application goals is needed to
determine how fast a population can be reduced and how deep a reduction can be achieved.

Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH) Vaccines. GnRH is a small neuropeptide (a protein-like
molecule made in the brain) that plays a necessary role in reproduction. It is naturally secreted by the
hypothalamus (a region of the brain that regulates hormone production), which directs the pituitary
gland to release hormones (luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone) that control the
function of reproductive organs (Hazum and Conn 1988). In an attempt to interrupt this process,
research has focused on eliminating the ability of GnRH to trigger the release of reproductive
hormones. One option is vaccination against GnRH. Antibodies produced in response to vaccination
likely attach to GnRH in the hypothalamic region and prevent the hormone from binding to
receptors in the pituitary gland, thus suppressing the secretion of reproductive hormones and
preventing ovulation.
GnRH vaccines have been investigated in a variety of wild and domestic ungulates (hoofed
mammals) (Adams and Adams 1990; Curtis et al. 2002; Miller, Johns, and Killian 2000c; Miller,
Rhyan, and Drew 2004). One GnRH vaccine that has been developed specifically for wildlife
contraception is GonaCon™. GonaCon™ is registered with the EPA as a restricted use pesticide to
control white-tailed deer fertility. The label requires marking the treated animal to prevent
accidental re-injection and giving the vaccine by hand-injection which limits the potential for nontarget animal and environmental exposure to the vaccine.
Potential benefits of this vaccine include a relatively long-lasting contraceptive effect (1-2 years and
potentially longer) and possibly the lack of repeated estrous cycles (Curtis et al. 2002). In freeranging white-tailed deer, GonaCon™ is estimated to be 70–90% effective in preventing pregnancy
during the first year post-treatment, and approximately 40–50% effective in the second year
(Gionfriddo et al. 2009, 2011), however long-term field efficacy data currently does not exist.
Although the label indicates a minimum of 1 year efficacy, the contraceptive effect typically lasts two
years and possibly longer in some individuals (Fagerstone et al. 2008). Repeated estrous cycling and
other behavioral changes in white-tailed deer have not been consistently documented in association

D-5

APPENDIXES

with GnRH vaccines (Curtis et al. 2008). However, Killian et al. (2008) reported that behavioral
expressions of estrus were only decreased for 1–2 years post-treatment and increased in subsequent
years despite does remaining infertile and Curtis et al. (2002) reported sporadic and delayed estrous
cycling with prolonged fawning season in GnRH vaccinated deer as contraceptive effects waned.
GnRH vaccines have many of the same challenges associated with PZP including the need for
repeated treatment to maintain long-term infertility, and the need to mark treated animals.
Additionally, as with any vaccine which uses the adjuvant AdjuVac™, immune response to the
adjuvant may interfere with determination of the animal’s Johne’s disease status (a gastrointestinal
disease of potential regulatory importance for domestic livestock) (Miller et al. 2008). Managers
should be aware of this prior to vaccination if neighboring lands have domestic livestock grazing.
Other challenges to use of GonaCon™ include potential health effects on treated deer (Kirkpatrick,
Lyda, and Frank 2011), lack of information related to effectiveness at the population level in freeranging deer, and requirement for hand-injection. Killian et al. 2006a concluded that GonaCon™ was
safe for deer and that there were no adverse health impacts associated with unintentional repeated
vaccination. Granulomas (a localized inflammatory response to the vaccine that occurs at the site of
injection and can persist for many years post-treatment) and injection site abscesses are consistently
associated with vaccination; however, they do not appear to cause negative health impacts (Curtis et
al. 2008; Gionfriddo et al. 2009). Overall, no debilitating, long-term impacts on health or changes in
behavior have been consistently associated with GnRH vaccination in female deer.
Similar site specific modeling and population data are required for evaluating the potential for
success in managing a free-ranging deer population with GonaCon™ as was described for PZP
immunocontraception.

NON-IMMUNOLOGICAL REPRODUCTIVE CONTROL METHODS
This group of reproductive control agents includes GnRH agonists, GnRH toxins, steroid hormones,
and contragestives.
GnRH Agonists. GnRH agonists are highly active analogs of GnRH which are similar in structure
and action to the endogenous hormone. The exact mechanism of action of GnRH agonists is not
completely understood; regardless they suppress the biological activity of endogenous GnRH. As a
result of this suppression, reproductive hormones are not released (Aspden et al. 1996; D’Occhio,
Aspden, and Whyte 1996). Continuous administration of the agonist is necessary to maintain
infertility. This can be accomplished with controlled-release formulations or surgically implanted
pumps or by daily administration.
Not all agonists have the same effects in all species. In fact, some can have an effect that is the
opposite of what is intended. The wide variation in response is likely due to a combination of type of
agonist, dose, treatment regime, reproductive status, sex, and species (Becker and Katz 1997).
Therefore, it is important to fully understand the effects of a product on a given species. Although
many GnRH agonists are used in human as well as veterinary medicine only a few have been
investigated in wildlife species (Becker and Katz 1997; Vickery 1986). GnRH agonists have been
tested primarily in mule deer and elk and been shown to both suppress reproductive hormones and
prevent pregnancy (Baker et al. 2002, 2004, 2005; Conner et al. 2007).

D-6

Appendix D: Review of
White-tailed Deer Fertility Control



Leuprolide acetate: Leuprolide is a GnRH agonist that when administered as a controlledrelease formulation, results in 100% pregnancy prevention in treated female elk and mule
deer (Baker et al. 2002, 2004; Conner et al. 2007). In addition, the treatment is reversible, and
the effects last only for a single breeding season (Baker et al. 2004; Trigg et al. 2001).
Advantages of leuprolide acetate are that it is 100% effective in preventing pregnancy, is safe
for human consumption (Baker et al. 2004), can be delivered remotely (Baker et al. 2005),
does not result in physiological side effects, and there are few behavioral effects (Baker et al.
2004). Treatment did not suppress reproductive behavior during the breeding season but
also did not prolong behaviors into the non-breeding season.
Leuprolide is FDA-approved for use in humans and has been used experimentally in cervids.
It is not currently approved for use in free-ranging wildlife as a fertility control drug. It is not
known if this application will be pursued in the future. The need to deliver leuprolide
subcutaneously via hand injection has traditionally been considered a significant barrier to
the long-term application of this drug as a wildlife management tool. However, Baker et al.
(2005) successfully applied the treatment through dart delivery which may extend the
practical application of this contraceptive.
Treatment using leuprolide differs from GnRH vaccines in that it does not require an
adjuvant and does not induce an antibody reaction. Therefore, inflammatory responses to
adjuvant components and other physiological effects, often observed with
immunocontraceptives, have not been observed in association with leuprolide. It does,
however, require a slow release implant that remains under the skin or in the muscle.
Additionally, leuprolide does not likely pose a threat to the environment or nontarget species
because the drug is not absorbed through the oral route of administration (Baker et al. 2004).
Marking requirements for animals treated with leuprolide implants are currently unknown
because it is not a registered wildlife contraceptive.
One drawback to the use of leuprolide is the need to treat animals within a short timeframe
prior to the breeding season (Conner et al. 2007). If a female is not retreated each year then
she has the same chances of becoming pregnant as an animal that was never treated. The
need to treat a potentially large number of individuals within a short period of time on an
annual basis reduces the feasibility of leuprolide as a wildlife management tool, particularly
for large, free-ranging, open deer populations.



Histrelin acetate: Histrelin acetate is effective in suppressing a key reproductive hormone in
white-tailed deer (Becker and Katz 1995). However, testing was conducted using a minipump that was surgically implanted under the animal’s skin. This is an infeasible route of
administration in free-ranging animals. In the future, a delivery system with slow release
characteristics may help to make this a more feasible option for free-ranging wildlife. It is
likely that histrelin acetate will also suppress ovulation and pregnancy in white-tailed deer,
although this remains to be tested.

GnRH Toxins. GnRH toxins consist of a cellular toxin that is combined with a GnRH analog (either
agonist or antagoinst). A GnRH analog is a synthetic peptide similar to the body’s own
gonadotropin-releasing hormone. Using the analog as a carrier, a cellular toxin can be delivered to
specific cells in the pituitary which produce reproductive hormones. Internalization of the toxin
leads to cell death. When this occurs, the production of reproductive hormones (leuteinizing
hormone and follicle stimulating hormone) is affected. This process has been studied in male dogs
(Sabeur et al. 2003), domestic sheep (Nett et al. 1999), rats (Kovacs et al. 1997), and female mule deer

D-7

APPENDIXES

(Baker et al. 1999) but the technology is still in the developmental stages and not ready for use in
free-ranging wildlife.
Steroid Hormones. The field of wildlife contraception began with research examining the
manipulation of reproductive steroid hormones (Matschke 1977a, 1977b, 1980). Treatment usually
entails the application of synthetic hormones, such as norgestomet, and melangestrol acetate
(Jacobsen, Jessup, and Kesler 1995; DeNicola, Kesler, and Swihart 1997a; Fagerstone et al. 2010).
Available products are administered via slow release implants or repeated feeding and have
demonstrated variable efficacy and duration of infertility. Most products that are available are used
in domestic animal or zoological veterinary medicine and have not been tested widely in free-ranging
wildlife. Issues related to using steroids include difficulties in treating large numbers of animals for
extended periods of time, potential reproductive tract pathological side effects experienced by the
treated animals, and concerns over the consumption of treated animals by nontarget species and
humans. Although many of these hormones are used as growth promotants in domestic food animal
production, they are not labeled for use in free-ranging wildlife. Currently, this method of
contraception is not being pursued by the wildlife management community.
Contragestives. Contragestives are products that prevent or terminate pregnancy. Progesterone is
the primary gestational hormone for maintaining pregnancy in mammals. Many contragestives act by
preventing progesterone production or blocking its effect, thereby affecting pregnancy. The primary
contragestive that has been researched for use in domestic animals and white-tailed deer is an analog
of Prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) (Becker and Katz 1994; DeNicola, Kesler, and Swihart 1997b; Waddell
et al. 2001). Lutalyse® is a commercially available form of PGF2α. Unlike many of the other
alternatives, there are no issues related to consumption of the meat when the animal has been treated
with this product. Challenges with contragestives include timing of administration, efficacy,
potential to rebreed if breeding season is not finished, and the potential for aborted fetuses on the
landscape. These limitations make their use in free-ranging populations for fertility control purposes
unlikely.
Sterilization. Surgical sterilization of females is an effective method of controlling reproduction and
has been used extensively in domestic animal medicine. However, implementation requires capture,
general anesthesia, and surgery conducted by a veterinarian which is generally considered labor
intensive and costly (Boulanger et al. 2012) and calls into question the long-term sustainability of
sterilization as a wildlife management tool, except under very limited circumstances. Boulanger et al.
(2012) notes that surgical sterilization is a costly but effective technique for reducing suburban deer
herds if 80% or more of the female deer in a population are sterilized and that proportion is
maintained over time. Overall success was greatest for closed populations. Only in rare
circumstances is physical sterilization reversible.
Depending on the method of sterilization, this procedure may have behavior effects on both male
and female deer. If gonads are removed, then the source of important reproductive hormones will be
removed. This is likely to change deer social interactions. If gonads are not removed, females will
continue to ovulate and show behavioral signs of estrus and consequently may extend the breeding

Appendix D: Review of
White-tailed Deer Fertility Control

EVALUATION OF FERTILITY CONTROL AGENTS BASED ON
SELECTION CRITERIA ESTABLISHED BY
FIRE ISLAND NATIONAL SEASHORE
Five criteria were established for Fire Island National Seashore that reflect minimum desired
conditions for using a reproductive control agent. Only when these criteria are met would
reproductive control be implemented. These criteria assume that the agent poses no significant
health risk to the deer.
1. There is a federally approved and state-registered fertility control agent for application to
free-ranging white-tailed deer populations
2. The agent provides multiple year (three or more) efficacy (80-100%) to minimize the cost
and labor required to administer the drug to a large number of deer annually
3. The agent can be administered through remote injection to avoid capturing the animal on a
regular basis and to increase the efficiency of distribution
4. The agent would leave no harmful residual in the meat (meat would be safe for human and
non-target animal consumption)
5. The agent would have minimal impact on deer behavior (e.g., reproductive behaviors, social
behaviors, out of season estrous cycling)

Federally approved but not registered in the state of New York for use in free ranging white-tailed deer populations.
Recent research demonstrates excellent efficacy using a single dose of native PZP primer combined with heat extruded pellets in year 1 (96%),
moderate in year two (74%), and little efficacy by year three (Rutberg et al. 2013). The data regarding cold evaporated pellets is inconclusive (Rutberg
et al. 2013).
SpayVac® has demonstrated 80%-100% efficacy for up to 5-7 years in horses and deer (Fraker, pers. comm., 2009; Miller et al. 2009; Killian et al.
2008). The term “possibly is used because long-term studies (greater than 5 years) have been conducted only in captive deer and had a small sample
size in each treatment group (N=5) (Miller et al. 2009). The only longer term study in free-ranging white-tailed deer did not evaluate past the third
year (Rutberg et al. 2013).
Long-term pelleted PZP has not been adequately evaluated past year two in free-ranging deer to determine extended efficacy (Rutberg et al. 2013)
Research on one-shot, multiyear GnRH vaccine in penned/captive deer indicates GonaCon is 88-100% effective in year 1, 47-100% effective in year 2,
and 25-80% effective up to 5 years post-treatment (Miller et al. 2008). The term “possibly” is used because the multi-year formulation has been used
only in captive deer, had a small sample size, and lacks confidence intervals on the data. Work in free-ranging deer suggests lower efficacy rates and
shorter duration of efficacy (Gionfriddo et al. 2009, 2011).
Work published in elk used dart delivery to administer the GnRH vaccine (Killian et al. 2009).
Not applicable because this is a veterinary procedure rather than a product. The procedure requires general anesthesia, a veterinarian to perform
surgery, post-operative antibiotics, and is likely associated with a higher mortality rate (approximately 6%; MacLean et al. 2006) than anesthesia
alone (approximately 1.5%; Rutberg et al. 2013). Results in permanent sterilization.

INTRODUCTION
Pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended (NEPA) and its
implementing regulations (40 CFR 1500-1508), and National Park Service (NPS) Director’s
Order #12, Conservation Planning, Environmental Impact Analysis, and Decision-Making
(DO-12), and accompanying DO-12 Handbook, the National Park Service considered public
and agency comments submitted on the Draft White-tailed Deer Management
Plan/Environmental Impact Statement (draft plan/EIS) for Fire Island National Seashore
(Seashore). This report describes how the National Park Service considered all of the
comments received and provides responses to substantive comments.
The draft plan/EIS was available for public and agency review from July 31, 2014 through
October 10, 2014. The availability of the draft plan/EIS was announced through the
Seashore’s website (www.nps.gov/fiis); through a newsletter sent to interested parties,
elected officials, and appropriate local and state agencies; and through press releases. The
draft plan/EIS was made available through several outlets, including the National Park
Service’s Planning, Environment, and Public Comment (PEPC) web site
(http://parkplanning.nps.gov/fiis), the public meetings, by contacting the Seashore
Superintendent to request an electronic copy (on a CD), and at the following public libraries:
Patchogue-Medford Library (Patchogue, NY), Sayville Library (Sayville, NY), Mastics­
Moriches-Shirley Community Library (Shirley, NY), Bayport-Blue Point Public Library (Blue
Point, NY), Bay Shore-Brightwaters Public Library (Brightwaters, NY), and Babylon Public
Library (Babylon, NY). The public was encouraged to submit comments electronically
through the National Park Service’s PEPC web site, by US Postal Service or other mail
delivery service, or hand delivery directly to the Superintendent at the Seashore’s
headquarters in Patchogue, New York. Written comments were also accepted during the two
public open houses discussed below.

PUBLIC OPEN HOUSES
In August 2014, two public open houses were held to continue the public involvement
process and facilitate community feedback on the draft plan/EIS. Meeting times and
locations for the two public meetings were as follows:



Wednesday, August 20, 6:00–8:00 pm – Patchogue Ferry Terminal, 160 West Avenue,
Patchogue, New York. 11772
Friday, August 22, 2:00–4:00 pm – Gymnasium at Woodhull School (Ocean Beach),
Corner of Midway Walk and Surf Road, Ocean Beach, New York

The open houses were announced on the PEPC website, the Seashore’s website and through
news releases.
A total of 53 attendees signed in during the two open houses. The meeting at Patchogue was
attended by 5 people, and the meeting at Ocean Beach was attended by 48 people. Upon
arrival, each attendee was offered a comment form, which included directions on how to
provide comments directly on the PEPC website, and was oriented to the setup of the open
house format. The public open houses comprised a series of display boards along the walls of
each meeting space. Display boards summarized the NEPA process; targets; desired
conditions; background information; existing conditions; purpose, need, and objectives; the
alternatives; and information on how to provide comments. During the second meeting, the

Appendix E: Draft Plan/EIS
Comment Analysis Report

Seashore Superintendent and his staff responded to public inquiry by conducting an
informal question and answer session. Written public comments were accepted at the open
houses and entered into PEPC as correspondences. The National Park Service also provided
copies of frequently asked questions regarding the project, a chronology of major events, and
the purpose, need, and objectives.

COMMENT ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY
During the comment period, a total of 1,631 pieces of correspondence were received by one
of the following methods: hard copy letter via mail or in-person delivery to the Seashore, oral
or written statement provided at a public meeting, e-mail, or entered directly into the PEPC
website. All correspondence delivered by any of those methods were entered into the PEPC
system for analysis.
Once all the correspondence was entered into PEPC, each was read, and specific comments
within each correspondence were identified. A total of 261 comments were derived from the
correspondence received. When identifying comments, every attempt was made to capture
the full breadth of comments submitted.
In order to categorize comments, each comment was given a code to identify the general
content of a comment and to group similar comments together. A total of 25 codes were used
to categorize all of the public comments received. An example of a code developed for this
project is AL1000 – Alternatives Development. In some cases, the same comment may be
categorized under more than one code, reflecting the fact that the comment may contain
more than one issue or idea.
During coding, comments were also classified as substantive or non-substantive. As
explained in section 4.6A of the DO-12 Handbook, a substantive comment does one or more
of the following:





Question, with a reasonable basis, the accuracy of information presented in the
plan/EIS;
Question, with reasonable basis, the adequacy of the environmental analysis;
Present reasonable alternatives other than those presented in the plan/EIS; and/or
Cause changes or revisions in the proposal.

Substantive comments raise, debate, or question a point of fact or policy. Comments in favor
of or against the proposed action or alternatives, or comments that only agree or disagree
with NPS policy, are not considered substantive. While all comments were read and will be
considered in shaping the final plan/EIS, only those determined to be substantive are
explicitly addressed by the NPS responses provided in this report.
Under each code, all substantive comments were grouped by similar themes, and those
groups were summarized with a “concern statement”. A concern statement summarizes the
issues and ideas expressed in the comments that are grouped under that code. For example,
under the code AL4012 - Suggestions For Changing Education/Interpretation, the concern
statement is, “Commenters suggested that a more vigorous campaign to educate both
residents and visitors will reduce the number of negative interactions with deer. Education,
interpretation, and enforcement efforts should focus on the impacts of feeding deer, proper
store of garbage outside, and the types of plants that do not attract deer.” This one concern

E-3

statement captures many comments. Following each concern statement are one or more
“representative quotes” which are comments taken directly from the correspondence to
illustrate the issue, concern, or idea expressed by the comments grouped under that concern
statement.

SUMMARY OF COMMENTS RECEIVED
A total of 1,631 correspondences was received, with 1,525 (94%) from commenters in the
state of New York, and the remaining from 25 other states and 15 other countries. The
majority of correspondences came from unaffiliated individuals, with 1,624 (99.6%)
correspondences. Within those correspondences, 1,027 comments were extracted, including
261 (25%) substantive comments, and 766 (75%) non-substantive comments.
The 261 substantive comments fell into 24 codes. Approximately 44% of the comments fell
under 3 of the 24 codes, which related to implementation of fertility control research as a
management action, dismissed alternatives/elements, and suggested changes to action
alternatives. The most common code was AL2300: Implementation of Fertility Control
Research as a Management Action, which had 59 (23%) of the substantive comments,
followed by AL7000: Dismissed Alternatives/Elements, with 42 (16%) of the substantive
comments. Of all the substantive comments, some related to methods and alternatives, while
others related to the document’s text and content. Comments ranged from topics of natural
resources such as wildlife, wilderness, and vegetation; to methodology such as data used,
purpose and need, implementation, and analysis/decision making. Other comments related
to visitor and resident experience and public safety. A few comments offered new alternative
elements or implementation ideas.
The 766 non-substantive comments fell into 6 codes. Most of the comments expressed an
opinion of support or opposition for methods or alternatives, with a few comments relating
to topics outside the scope of the plan/EIS. Of the non-substantive comments, the majority
opposed direct reduction methods, while a few supported the NPS preferred action
alternative, and a smaller amount opposed capture and euthanasia. The least amount of
commenters supported no action.

CONCERN RESPONSE REPORT
AL1000 ALTERNATIVES DEVELOPMENT
Concern Statement:
Commenters expressed concerns about the development of the action alternatives. Several
commenters were concerned with the criteria for a fertility control agent, claiming that they
are arbitrary and prohibit the use of fertility control management actions, and that the
criteria should be used as guidelines, not requirements. One commenter felt that the National
Park Service should have conducted a public review of the criteria prior to preparing the
draft plan/EIS.
Representative Quote(s):
Correspondence Id: 1613 Comment Id: 420152
Comment Text: The NPS fails to explain how these criteria were developed, who
developed them, or why the NPS believes each individual criterion is reasonable.
Ultimately, these criteria are a product of a wholesale change in NPS policy, a change that
was not independently subject to public review, which permits and promotes the lethal
slaughter of native wildlife in national parks after decades of largely protecting park
wildlife.
Organization:
Commenter: DJ Schubert Page: Paragraph:
Kept Private: No
Correspondence Id: 1613 Comment Id: 423266
Comment Text: Since the immunocontraceptive vaccine criteria are the primary
determinant of whether the NPS selects a lethal versus non-lethal management strategy,
they should be subject to independent public and expert review. Though this review
should have occurred when the criteria were first developed, the NPS failed to engage the
public and/or outside fertility control experts at that time. Ideally, considering the
significant shift in NPS policy from protection of native ungulates to killing native
ungulates that are believed to be overabundant, the NPS should engage in a broader
analysis and review, including public participation, in its system wide wildlife
management policies. At a minimum, however, it must subject its current fertility control
vaccine criteria to separate analysis and review by the public, including experts in wildlife
management in national parks, reproductive physiology of ungulates, and in fertility
control vaccines.

Commenter: DJ Schubert Page: Paragraph:

Correspondence Id: 1596 Comment Id: 412725
Comment Text: Though currently PZP immunocontraception does not fit all the criteria
laid out in the DEIS, PZP was used for years with great effectiveness on Fire Island (deer
populations decreased 10-11% pr year in the most closely monitored area) and with
recent improvements its feasibility has only increased, not decreased. With volunteers for
The Wildlife Preservation Coalition of the East End now offering to dart deer as well,
expenses can also be kept at a minimum if this method is chosen. It is suggested that the
stated criterion (DEIS, p. 41) should be used as guidelines rather than requirements for
use of fertility control agents, like PZP, to reduce and stabilize the population of deer on
Fire Island as was done in the past.

NPS Response
The National Park Service has jurisdiction over the wildlife on its land and can set criteria for
any wildlife management tool to ensure it is consistent with NPS and Seashore-specific
mandates, as well as other federal policies. These criteria were developed by the National
Park Service and refined by the interdisciplinary team and the cooperating agencies, which
are described in the "Scoping, Issues, and Impact Topics” section of chapter 1 of the draft
plan/EIS. The rationale for each criteria is included below and in “Deer Population
Management Actions Consistent with Alternatives B and D” in chapter 2 of the final
plan/EIS.
Criterion 1: The fertility control agent is federally approved and state-registered for
application to free-ranging white-tailed deer populations.
Rationale: It is critical that all aspects of a fertility control program be consistent with federal
laws and regulations and NPS policies. The regulation of free-ranging wildlife
immunocontraceptives has recently been transferred to the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) and is administered under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide
Act (7 USC §136 et seq.). Prior to use in a management context, an immunocontraceptive
must be registered for use in white-tailed deer. They may be used under an experimental use
permit for research purposes only. As such, PZP is not currently available for managing deer
population sizes. The GnRH vaccine GonaCon™ is registered, but neither it nor PZP has met
more than two of the additional criteria listed below (criteria 2-5).
Criteria 2 and 3: The agent provides multiple-year (three or more) efficacy (80%–100%)
to minimize the cost and labor required to administer the drug to a large number of
deer (Criterion 2), and the agent can be administered through remote injection to avoid
capturing the animal on a regular basis and to increase the efficiency of distribution
(Criterion 3).
Rationale: Modeling efforts have clearly demonstrated that (1) “the efficacy of fertility
control as a management technique depends strongly on the [multi-year] persistence of…the
fertility control agent;” and (2) the only scenarios in which fertility control is more efficient
than culling at maintaining population size is when a multi-year efficacy is achieved (Hobbs
et al. 2000). In addition to increasing the efficiency of a fertility control program, these
requirements benefit and protect individual deer because they reduce the frequency of
stressful capture and/or drug delivery operations.
Criterion 4: The agent would leave no harmful residual in the meat (meat would be safe
for human and non-target animal consumption).
Rationale: Any fertility control agent applied must be safe for human consumption, either
immediately after delivery or after an established withdrawal period. While the National Park
Service understands that antibodies induced by immunocontraceptives do not pose a human
health risk, only the Environmental Protection Agency can make a claim of appropriateness
for human consumption.
Criterion 5: The agent would have minimal impact on deer behavior (e.g., reproductive
behaviors, social behaviors, out of season estrous cycling).

E-9

APPENDIXES

Rationale: NPS Management Policies 2006, section 4.4.2, states that native species will be
maintained by preserving and restoring the natural abundances, diversities, dynamics,
distributions, habitats, and behaviors of native plant and animal populations and the
communities and ecosystems in which they occur (NPS 2006a). Reproduction is a
fundamental ecological process for deer and affects their social structure. Any fertility
control agent that significantly changes the timing or duration of the breeding season or the
social structure of the population does not meet this requirement. Vaccination with PZP has
been shown to increase the duration of the reproductive season and allow repeated estrous
cycling and associated reproductive behaviors (McShea et al. 1997, Heilmann et al. 1998,
Curtis et al. 2002). Vaccination with the GnRH vaccine GonaCon has less information
published with respect to behavioral effects in deer; however, in elk there were minimal
differences in the reproductive behavior rates between treated and un-treated animals when
evaluated in captivity (Powers et al. 2011). The long-term social effects of vaccination with
either of these fertility control products in free-ranging deer are unclear.
The criteria included in the plan/EIS were chosen by the National Park Service to meet
objectives of NPS policy, and there are currently no fertility control agents that fulfill all of
the criteria.
The National Park Service appreciates public desire to be involved in the planning process
and believes that this public comment period provides a sufficient opportunity to comment
on all aspects of this draft plan/EIS, including the criteria for a fertility control agent.

AL3000 NEW ALTERNATIVES/ALTERNATIVE ELEMENTS
Concern Statement:
Commenters suggested new alternative elements as well as new alternatives. New alternative
elements included creating a deer sanctuary, designating feeding areas where residents could
bring their yard clippings, and working with the New York State Department of
Environmental Conservation (NYS-DEC) to reduce adjacent deer populations. Suggestions
for new alternatives mainly included elements of the action alternatives or the alternatives
considered but dismissed. New alternatives included managing the population size by
moving all reproductively intact bucks to the William Floyd Estate and sterilizing all males
left on Fire Island, relocating all deer in the Fire Island communities to the wilderness, and
creating an education-only alternative.
Representative Quote(s):
Correspondence Id: 1614 Comment Id: 420198
Comment Text: The NYSDEC alternative is consistent with the NEPA provision that
requires the lead agency to consider alternatives not within its jurisdiction. It would
involve working with NYSDEC to expand its deer management activities (lethal and/or
non-lethal) outside of FINS and the William Floyd Estate in order to reduce the deer
population/density of deer in the area. Though this may not have any effect on deer on
FINS or on the William Floyd Estate it may help reduce alleged complaints about deer by
residents of Fire Island communities.

Appendix E: Draft Plan/EIS
Comment Analysis Report
Comment Text: I. THE GOALS OF THE DEER MANAGEMENT PLAN 1. To promote,
as much as feasible, natural environmental processes, including the re-establishment and
flourishing of indigenous plants and animal life on land, and in the water/land interface.
2. Protect both the deer population and the human population from adverse interactive
effects 3. Avoid dangerous or troubling situations from arising in the process of better
deer management II. AN ALTERED PLAN B My preference, would be a more aggressive
version of Plan B, which excludes deer from human-populated areas, and excludes the
euthanization of individual deer. I base my approach on a judgment that a sharp
delineation should be made regarding the areas where the deer herd belongs, and does
not belong. In accord with this guiding principle, the deer would be moved to the
Wilderness Area en mass, with any stragglers moved upon discovery, and re-united with
their herd. Such a policy would minimize to the greatest extent any deer-human
interaction. It would clarify the reason, the means, and the timetable of moving the deer
herd to the Wilderness Area.. Once, we make that sharp delineation, and adopt a set of
policies in accord with that delineation we can expect to eliminate many negative effects
of the current approach: - --on indigenous plants,; - --on human beings: re a higher
chance of infection from tick-borne pathogens, - --re the nuisance of garbage strewn
around when deer knock over garbage cans, - --which also provides food for rodents: - -­
re the effect that reliance on human garbage as food has had on the deer herd, addicting
them to an unnatural and uncertain means of sustinence. The plan would be
accomplished in three steps: 1. Begin with the construction of an effective and beautiful
fence at either end of the Otis Pike Wilderness Area, going north into the bay, and south
into the ocean. The fence would extend far enough into the bay and ocean to prevent
deer from swimming around the fence, and high enough so that they would not even try
to leap over it, (which could result in severe injuries to them, if they tried to return to their
previous home-areas). 2. The purpose of this fencing would be to provide a destination
where all deer presently living in the populated half of Fire Island (to the west of the
Wilderness area) would be trans-located, either in one big effort, or over (perhaps) five

Comment Text: A public education/fencing only alternative would represent a version of
Alternative B without the fertility control element but that would implement reasonable
actions well beyond those anticipated in Alternative A. Nearly all of the alleged deerrelated impacts identified by the NPS are linked to either inappropriate human behaviors
(i.e., feeding deer, improperly securing garbage receptacles) or are a product of deer
consumption of vegetation in either unique or culturally significant landscapes. Public
education and fencing could be employed to address the bulk of the alleged impacts.
While this alternative would not include any active management to reduce the deer
population, since FINS is a barrier island, reducing the quantity of habitat available to
deer through fencing could, in time, result in a reduction in the deer population if the
population size recalibrates itself based on available habitat.

NPS Response:
The National Park Service believes that it has developed and evaluated an adequate range of
alternatives to satisfy the purpose, need, and objectives of the plan/EIS.
• Actions that are outside the scope of the plan/EIS or do not meet the purpose, need,
and objectives of the plan/EIS. Examples of commenter suggestions include eradicating
all mature male deer and relocating all young male deer, creating a deer sanctuary,
collecting yard clippings to feed deer, and expanding the project area in collaboration
with NYS-DEC.
The above suggestions would fail to meet the purpose, need, and objectives of this plan/EIS,
which are defined in chapter 1. Specifically, the first objectives listed for the plan is to manage
a viable white-tailed deer population in the Seashore that is supportive of the other objectives
for this plan/EIS. Eradicating and relocating all male deer would not allow for a viable
population by eliminating the opportunity for a self-sustaining population. Creating a deer
sanctuary would alter naturally occurring population dynamics, would impose operational
demands outside the NPS mission, and would presumably exacerbate many of the existing
issues related to overbrowsing in a more focused area. Feeding deer with yard clippings
provides an artificial food source to sustain the population. Deer would be unlikely to use
clippings as an exclusive food source; therefore, the deer density would likely be sustained or
increase which would exacerbate existing issues associated with overbrowsing. This would
not support the objective to promote natural regeneration of native vegetation. Expanding
the project area in collaboration with NYS-DEC is outside of the scope of this plan/EIS.
• Modifications to existing alternatives. Examples of commenter suggestions include
modifying alternative D to include translocation (instead of capture and euthanasia),
excluding deer from inhabited areas under alternative B, removing fertility control and
translocation from alternative B, and modifying alternative D to incrementally reduce
the deer density, focusing on areas where impacts of deer browse are particularly acute.

An EIS need not and cannot include every possible combination of elements as a separate
alternative. The elements discussed in these comments were analyzed in some form in the
EIS. The National Park Service formulated the alternatives presented in theis plan/EIS based
on combinations that would be reasonable to implement.
Suggestions for other non-lethal alternatives were not adopted because the actions described
in alternative B are considered feasible now or in the future, whereas actions suggested under
other non-lethal options were not considered appropriate or viable. A non-lethal alternative
that only includes education and fencing would fail to meet the purpose and need of the

The National Park Service has included fertility control components in two of the three
action alternatives, including the preferred alternative, as described in chapter 2. However,
none of the fertility control products currently available meet developed criteria; therefore,
fertility control methods will not be implemented immediately. Furthermore, management
actions are intended to achieve a set of desired conditions and are generally based on wellestablished scientific findings or professional experience; whereas, the primary objective of
research is to answer specific questions or gain a better understanding of the system when
outcomes are unknown. The PZP vaccination research at Fire Island National Seashore had

Service must find the most appropriate suite of management actions to achieve their goals of
resource protection and preservation. PZP vaccination alone did not meet all of these goals
during the research phase of this project. Fertility control would need to meet the criteria
outlined in “Deer Population Management Actions Consistent with Alternatives B and D” in
chapter 2 (pages 39-43) and meet the stated objectives in order to be considered a useful
management tool. When an acceptable agent is available for use, the National Park Service
could work with the Humane Society of the Unitied States to implement its use.

Fire Island have died from rat poison which they have consumed. Bucks travel
throughout the island and therefore should not be hunted because they probably
consumed rat poison from people placing it on the ground in the communities near the
hunted areas. As you pointed out deer cannot be given birth control since it can get into
the food chain. Our female deer throughout the island have received PZP over many
years and therefore should not be killed and consumed. As a result of the above hunting
and the consumption of deer meat should be prohibited because of the danger to the
person consuming the meat.

Comment Text: the dramatic variability in deer densities across the myriad of Fire Island
landscapes shows that some areas inherently support higher concentrations of deer than
others, and as such, target deer densities should reflect these differences. For instance, in
Fire Island communities where deer densities are high, since the NPS has not proposed
the continued use of fertility control to manage deer populations in these communities in
any of the alternatives listed in the DEIS, the only direct management activities planned
for these areas are capture and relocation or euthanasia of deer observed regularly
approaching humans. (DEIS, at 29). If this is the case, it is not clear how the NPS would
achieve its management objective of 20-25 deer per square mile in Fire Island
communities over 8-10 years. For these reasons, rather than establishing one target deer
density across Fire Island, we strongly recommend that the FEIS establish specific deer
density targets for each of the management areas listed in the DEIS. Projected target
densities could be determined by modelling current deer densities in these areas (i.e. the
number of deer these areas can currently sustain) with changes in deer densities that the
NPS can reasonably expect to occur over 8-10 years using the population management
methods adopted in the FEIS for each of these areas.

Comment Text: In regard to the environmental consequences of Alternative B, the NPS
claims that... Deer that approach humans in Fire Island communities would be captured

result in heavy browsing of wilderness vegetation." Fire Island DEIS at 164. This is the
first reference to this criteria of heavy browsing of wilderness vegetation being potentially
used to avoid translocating captured deer to the Fire Island Wilderness. This condition
was not included in the description of Alternative B contained in Chapter 2 of the Fire
Island DEIS. Consequently, it is unclear if this is indeed a component of Alternative B. If
it is, the NPS must provide additional information to quantify what it means by "heavy
browsing of wilderness vegetation" and explain how such browsing pressures will be
monitored including disclosing the specific methodology to be used. It also must disclose
what level of browsing pressure will be the threshold used to terminate deer

NPS Response:
The National Park Service reviewed all suggested changes to the action alternatives, but none
were adopted because, as explained below, the suggested changes would not meet the
purpose and need or would not achieve the objectives.
Changes to the target deer density were suggested by several commenters, who suggested
changes in the island-wide target density and different densities for different areas of the
Seashore. The science team initially developed varying target deer densities for different
areas of the Seashore, and the interdisciplinary team ultimately decided to use a target deer
density of 20 deer per square mile, the highest recommended density in the science team’s
various target ranges, because of the lack of site-specific information available for how the
lowered deer density would affect Seashore resources. Variable densities for the different
areas of the Seashore has been added to “Alternative Elements Considered but Dismissed”
(page 59).
One commenter suggested administering fertility control through bait stations containing
food laced with the agent. This alternative element would provide an artificial food source

E-15

APPENDIXES

for deer (and likely other animals) and was therefor not incorporated into the existing
alternatives.
One commenter suggested replanting native vegetation by using seed banks; however, this
action would not decrease browsing pressure on vegetation. Therefore, plantings were not
incorporated into the action alternatives.
Translocation (to wilderness within Fire Island National Seashore) and/or capture and
euthanasia were retained in the action alternatives because they would assist park managers
in meeting the objective (as stated in chapter 1 [page 5]) of reducing the potential for
undesirable human-deer interactions both within the Fire Island communities and at other
developed areas of the Seashore. However, translocation of deer off of Fire Island has been
dismissed for reasons described in the final plan/EIS (page 58).
Similarly, direct reduction methods in the wilderness were retained in alternatives C and D in
order to provide a method by which to ensure the deer population does not exceed the
island-wide target density in order to support the objectives listed on page 5 of the final
plan/EIS.
It is also important to note, translocation and capture and euthanasia would not be
implemented to manage the population size; rather, these actions would be implemented to
meet the objective to reduce undesirable human-deer interaction which are believed to be
caused by a relatively small portion of the deer population (estimated to be about 11% of the
deer population as discussed in “Threshholds for Taking Action” [page 31]).
The possibility of deer meat being donated is retained. Disposal of deer (including donation
of meat) would typically be coordinated by the sharpshooters. NPS Public Health Service
guidance pertaining to the donation of meat would be followed. Park staff would work with
staff from the NPS Public Health Service to develop a reasonable plan for meat safety and
donation prior to donation taking place.
In regard to the comment suggesting an increased focus on public education and
modifications to human behavior, such actions are included in all action alternatives and are
described in “Elements Comment to Action Alternatives” (pages 35-39).
In regard to the request for the definition of and monitoring protocols for “heavy browsing
of wilderness vegetation” under alternative B, the text of the final plan/EIS has been revised.
It now explains that if this alternative were selected (alternative B is not the NPS preferred
alternative), there would be additional planning and thresholds established to determine if
any impacts to vegetation occur as the deer population increases due to translocation to the
Fire Island wilderness (page 46). If impacts of deer browse on wilderness vegetation are
noticeable, alternative actions would be taken through the adaptive management process,
and additional compliance may be necessary.

Part of the purpose of the plan/EIS is to develop a deer management strategy that supports

inconsistent with the purpose of the Seashore and the purpose of the plan/EIS to protect
natural processes which affect natural systems such as forests.

Operational details such as funding for fertility control and fining individuals who feed deer
or do not secure garbage go beyond the level of detail needed in this plan/EIS. Because these
details would not result in differences in impacts among the various alternatives, these ideas
could be considered in the future as part of any alternative or as an adaptive managment
method.
Because no agent that meets all fertility control criteria currently exists, the legal
requirements for using an agent which does meet the criteria are unknown. However, tagging
may be necessary to prevent individual does from being treated multiple times and to ensure
that a sufficient number of does are treated each year. Therefore, capture and tagging has
been included in alternatives B and D.

AL4011 SUGGESTIONS FOR CHANGING HOW DIRECT REDUCTION OCCURS

the hunting season, if it is not to intrude on the communities, may also need to be
supported by special ferry access to the Wilderness area or close to it. Providing ferry
access and denial of vehicular access by way of the bridges and beach to the hunters may
also help to control poaching out of season or taking more than the permitted number of
animals during the hunting season..... Given hunger issues and poverty in communities on
Long Island adjacent to the Great South Bay, there is every reason to want to assure that
those deer that are killed are used for food, regardless of how they are killed. Carcass

Comment Text: Although Safari Club supports the NPS's choice of Alternative D in its
utilization of hunting as one of the means of deer population reduction, the preferred
alternative does not take full advantage of the hunting community's potential
contribution or offer sufficiently extensive hunting opportunities. Contrary to the plan
offered by the preferred alternative, hunting should not be used for deer management
only until an immunocontraceptive agent becomes available that will effectively maintain
population numbers. Hunting should continue to be part of the NPS's management
approach to deer, regardless of the availability of effective deer immunocontraceptives.
Continued use of hunting for deer management will result in enhanced recreational
opportunities as well as better managed wildlife. In addition, if the NPS decides to utilize
sharpshooters to more expeditiously reduce the deer population, it should work with
volunteer marksmen from the hunting community, rather than hire contractors or paid
sharpshooters to perform the same task. Many if not most hunters are excellent
marksmen and many paid sharpshooters are members of their local hunting
communities. The NPS needs to look to the hunting community as a tool in wildlife
management, rather than just as a user group that needs to be managed and restricted
within the park unit. Finally, Alternative D includes a hunt limited to the Wilderness Area
within the park unit. However, the Deer Plan indicates that in the 1988-89 hunting
research study, archery hunts took place in the natural areas on the western side of Fire
Island. Safari Club recommends that the NPS similarly expand the planned hunt to areas
outside the Wilderness Area. In this way, the NPS can increase the effectiveness of the
deer management and can also provide hunting opportunities to those who will be
hindered if not excluded by the walk-in access limits applied to hunting in the Wilderness
Area. Even in the Wilderness Area, the NPS should make appropriate exceptions to
motorized vehicle restrictions to ensure that disabled hunters can take advantage of the
hunting opportunities.

population on Fire Island and based upon findings from ongoing projects, the NPS
should reconsider surgical sterilization as a viable option when combined with other non­
lethal deer management actions, such as immunocontraception, on Fire Island. We would
recommend using surgical sterilization on deer that are known to be less approachable
and accessible (i.e., Wilderness Areas and in specific residential communities where deer
are known to be more wary of humans), and immunocontraception in residential
communities where the deer are approachable, accessible and previous efforts have been
shown to effective and widely supported by Fire Island residents.

my observation is that about 20% ae males making somewhere between 50-75 males in
the population. If we surgically neuter 80-90% o them and relocate the intact males to a
controlled environment like the William Floyd estate, YOU can control the population.
Each breeding season, you can select the females from each area, transport them to the
males, have them mated and then bring them back home to repopulate their region of the
island. If you feel that presently there are too many deer for the ecosystem to sustain, let
some die off naturally, age, disease, accidents etc. When you get to that magic number,
then start the repopulation. I know there will be arguments regarding the capture and
effects of surgery on the males, as a Veterinarian I feel that I can put these issues in a
proper prospective. First, you have tranquilized the females in the past when you did your
contraceptive study, so capturing deer is not something your are unfamiliar with.
Selecting a smaller population of males, reduces the amount of work and the cost. There
are many newer drugs used in Veterinary Medicine for the restraint of larger animals
including deer, that are relatively safe. There are certainly risks involved in this
procedure, and it is likely that some of the animals may die from either the anesthesia or
the procedure, but on the practical side, you were going to shoot them anyway. Secondly,
the effects on the behavior can only be described as an improvement. It was brought up at
the meeting that some residents felt that the deer were aggressive. It would be most likely
that the males were acting like males, territorial or aggressive. Neutering them would stop

this behavior, the animal wouldn't be adversely affected in any other way. Medically,even
if you were able to use an injectable contraceptive, you still have to capture 4 times as
many animals, subject them to the risks of tranquilization and repeat the procedure on a
regular basis. If you neuter the majority of the males, it is a one time capture and
procedure. Newborn males can easily be identified and either be neutered before sexual
maturity or relocated to the male area to be used for stud in the future.

NPS Response
The National Park Service considered the use of sterilization as for population control;
however, it was ultimately dismissed from further consideration because of concerns about
feasibility, stress to the animals, and long-term effects on population genetics and behavior.
The field of fertility control is rapidly evolving and there are new techniques being developed
to decrease the time and the stress of surgical sterilization; however, there is still significant
uncertainty in the long-term success, feasibility, and consequences of these techniques for
long-term management of deer. As the techniques such as ovariectomy or tubal ligation and
castration or vasectomy become more well-established and evaluated in the field of freeranging wildlife management, the National Park Service may reconsider their use as a
management tool. These techniques are still in the experimental stages and the long-term
ecological effects of permanent sterilization in a mostly closed deer population are unknown;
for example, the potential negative side-effects such as limiting the ability of natural selection
pressures to act on the population, consequences of altering reproductive and social
behaviors, and altering demographic structure of the population. These potential effects are
not yet fully understood and require further investigation before surgical sterilization could
be implemented as a management technique.

reproductive control agents and procedures have been shown to effectively reduce deer
fertility and thus, population levels, lethal control may sometimes have the opposite
effect. It has been shown that the reproductive rate of white-tailed deer is greatly reduced
at high population densities while deer in areas subjected to periodic lethal removal have
enhanced fertility rates resulting in increased population growth to compensate for
harvested animals (Swilhart et al. 1998). Further research also indicates that lethal
removal of both sexes does nothing to stop fluctuations in deer populations due to forage
competition and natural mortality as a result of severe winter weather (Patterson and

90% othe does are treated with a fertility agent (DEIS, at 43). The PZP vaccines used at
these other NPS sites require annual boosters to be effective, but significant progress has
been made since 2002 on a multi-year single shot PZP vaccine. Furthermore, new
information about the efficacy of contraceptive approaches on deer populations is
available (Patton et al. 2007, Rutberg and Naugle 2008). The effects of the vaccine are
reversible after three years of treatment, and no adverse health effects have been apparent
among treated deer or among fawns they carried at the time of treatment.

Comment Text: we would note that the first attempt to gauge historical figures for a
naturally balanced deer population was undertaken by the renowned mammalogist,
Ernest Thompson Seton. He estimated that in 'primitive times', the density of whitetailed deer in an eastern deciduous forest was approximately 4/km2 , or roughly 2/sq.
mile. More recently, an extensive quantitative analysis independently supported this
estimate, and Mccabe and Mccabe surmised that there were 3.1 to 4.2 deer/km2 (or 1.5 ­
2/sq. mile) in pre-colonial America. Recent long-term studies In the Allegheny National
Forest in western Pennsylvania have shown that when density rose above 8 or 12
deer/km2 (5/sq. mile) there was a significant impact on the forest . Indeed, the State of
Virginia has identified 9.7 deer/km2 (5/sq. mile) as a generalized carrying capacity and
Pennsylvania has set a deer density goal of 4.6 to 8.1 deer/km2 (2-4/sq. mile). ... Notes ­

order to make an informed decision about the four proposed plans, FINS must provide
evidence for the claimed negative environmental changes over this period, AND then
show how much of the negative effect is caused by deer, as against the effects of
hurricanes and human activity. Note, that the FINS photo of bare sand next to grazing
deer implies overgrazing by the deer. But the real cause of the erosion may have been
water and wind. FINS is asking us to choose among four alternative plans to remedy a

Comment Text: FINS is a barrier island. Hence, it vegetation characteristics, diversity,
structure, production, and ecology is comparable to other barrier islands and coastal
ecosystems but it cannot be compared to non-coastal ecosystems or inland forests. The
NPS includes some references to the unique ecological circumstances relevant to a
barrier island, though it fails to properly and comprehensively elaborate on these unique
ecological conditions found on barrier islands Moreover, the NPS does not provide,
though it should, a separate description of the ecology of barrier islands or of the unique
natural factors that influence the ecology of such islands and/or are relevant to vegetation
production, diversity, and forest regeneration. Such factors include: a) soil characteristics
including soil type, salinity, and composition; b) impact of storm surge on vegetative
health; c) soil disease; d) precipitation amounts and patterns; e) ambient temperature; f)
plant/tree disease; g) competition with exotic/invasive species; h) insects composition and
ecology particular for insects known to kill harm plants/trees; i) air quality/pollution; j)
water quality; k) canopy cover and its impact on primary production; l) plant/tree health
and vigor; m) herbivore (not deer) impact on plant (woody, herbaceous and other)
production, diversity, and health; n) soil erosion and erosive potential (wind and/or
water) of soil types; and, o) impact of sea level rise on vegetation and soil ecology and
health. The NPS is not only required to disclose and discuss these issues but it also must
provide trend data (i.e., how these factors have changed over time either to the benefit or
detriment of vegetation) and must comprehensively evaluate the implications of current
and future changes to environmental conditions (including, but not limited to, those
attributable to climate change) that may impact vegetation health, ecology and
productivity. The Fire Island DEIS contains virtually no information regarding these
factors despite their obvious relevance to vegetation ecology on FINS. For example,
there's no discussion of soil health or ecology on FINS, of plant disease, insects that may
harm/kill vegetation, of climatic/weather characteristics of the region, or any data on
canopy coverage on any of the forests, including the Sunken Forest, on FINS. Based on
an analysis of a Google Earth screen shot of the Sunken Forest apparently taken in June
2013, there appears to be considerable canopy cover in this area which has likely reduced
forest regeneration potential regardless of the presence of deer.

Appendix E: Draft Plan/EIS
Comment Analysis Report

As stated in NPS Management Policies 2006, section 4.1, “decisions about the extent and
degree of management actions taken to protect or restore park ecosystems or their
components will be based on…management objectives and the best scientific information
available.” This information may be obtained through “consultation with technical experts,
literature review, inventory, monitoring, or research to evaluate the identified need for
management…” (NPS Management Policies 2006, section 4.4.2.1). Information provided on
the impacts of white-tailed deer on other wildlife species is based on referenced scientific
literature that the National Park Service believes is sufficient to assess the likely effects of
deer on these species. The scientific studies used to assess impacts were conducted in eastern
deciduous forests that have similar species to those found in the Seashore, and the types of
impacts are applicable to the Seashore.
Impacts to vegetation due to the overpopulation of deer are well-documented across a
variety of ecosystems and landscapes. The Seashore has a comprehensive dataset on
vegetation at the Sunken Forest from the time of the Seashore’s establishment in 1964 when
deer were virtually absent, during the time when the deer population greatly exploded in the
1980s, during the 1990s, and today. The National Park Service did not use data from other
eastern deciduous forests to assess impacts at the park but rather site-specific data collected
over many decades. This data has been analyzed by multiple scientists and conclusively
shows that deer browse has adversely affected the vegetative composition of the Sunken
Forest resulting in species loss and composition shifts compared to a time when deer were
far less abundant. The scientific literature is helpful in determining that these observances at
the Seashore, both at the Sunken Forest and William Floyd Estate, are supported by very
similar ecological behaviors at other locations in the United States (i.e., an overabundance of
deer will impact vegetation). Thus, the studies in eastern Pennsylvania have relevance
because they support the finding of the Seashore, as those scientists also observed vegetation
impacts from an overabundance of deer. The studies in eastern Pennsylvania were also used
to analyze the impacts on vegetation at the William Floyd Estate which is similar
Data used to support the need for action (deer population size and forest vegetation) are
long-term and Seashore-specific. As stated in "Scientific Background: Deer and Vegetation
Management," Seashore-specific data indicates that changes in deer abundance, patterns,
and behaviors adversely affect the species richness of plant communities in the Seashore. In
addition to presenting information based on Seashore-specific data, other information
presented in the draft plan/EIS related to deer and vegetation is supported by data collected
in other similar environments. The National Park Service believes data used is sufficient to
support the purpose, need, and analysis of potential impacts.
The National Park Service has gathered and presented all necessary data to assess the
impacts of the alternatives in this plan/EIS. Additional requested data is not relevant to the
affected environment. While the factors listed by the commenter certainly impact vegetation
at the Seashore, these factors would have the same effects across all alternatives and are
therefore not discussed in detail.
The National Park Service disagrees with the commenter that the deer population at the
Seashore can be reduced by treating 60% of the females. The commenter cites Garrott (1995)
and Rutberg et al. (2004) to suggest that populations decline when more than 60% of females
are treated with a contraceptive. Garrott (1995) uses the term “effective treatment” to mean
the actual percentage of the target population that experienced successful birth control. To
reach the point of successful birth control, he points out that animals must be detected,
detected animals must be successfully inoculated, and the contraception must work (efficacy

E-25

APPENDIXES

rate). In each one of those steps, there is some degree of failure. Thus, Garrott (1995)
suggests in a best case scenario that a population where 90% of the target animals are
detected, 90% of the detected animals are inoculated, and the contraception efficacy rate is
95% would result in an “effective treatment” of 77% of the female population (0.95 X 0.90 X
0.90 = 0.77). In fact, Garrott’s analysis supports the conclusions reached in the final plan/EIS
because, under his best case scenario, the percentage of females inoculated needs to be
higher than 77% to reach an “effective treatment” rate of 77%. We do not interpret Garrott
to suggest that the inoculation of 60% of the females would result in decreasing deer
population numbers.
When attempting to use contraception to control deer populations, scientists must also
analyze other population factors such as birth rates, mortality rates, immigration rates, and
emigration rates. In situations where a population experiences high death rates, the number
of females to be inoculated will likely not be as high as another population with a much lower
mortality rate. Such is the case with Rutberg et al. (2004) where they performed a
contraception study within a relatively closed population in a highly developed, suburban
environment (233 hectare campus of the National Institute of Standards and Technology in
Gaithersburg, Maryland). Under these circumstances, success of the population decline was
accredited not only to the contraception, but a high mortality rate due to vehicle collisions
and a lower than normal birth rate. The scientists concluded that population numbers could
potentially remain stable by treating 60% of the females at this campus. This setting is greatly
different than the Seashore where the birth rate is higher and the mortality rate is much
lower because there are no vehicular collisions (within the park). Thus, given the dynamics of
the deer population at the Seashore, having the results of years of PZP treatments at the
Seashore, and analyzing results from other studies, NPS scientists and consulting experts
remain confident that a minimum 70% to 90% of the females would need to be treated for
the population to decline and remain stable.

Paragraph:

NPS Response
The National Park Service recognizes that Superstorm Sandy had severe impacts on Fire
Island and agrees that such impacts included damage to vegetation and a reduced deer
population. While baseline data on the white-tailed deer population predate Superstorm
Sandy, the Seashore has continued to monitor the white-tailed deer population as described
in appendix C, and newly available density estimates following Superstorm Sandy have been
incorporated into the final plan/EIS (see page 12 for updated density and page 51 for updated
estimates of required removal numbers). Implementation of deer population management
actions would be based on the most recent available data. The calculations used to determine
the numbers in table 7 of the final plan/EIS are included as assumptions based on the data
available at the time, and provides assumptions for understanding the timeline and potential
effects in the final plan/EIS. These calculations would be repeated upon implementing the
plan based on the most current deer density estimates to determine approximately how many
deer would need to be removed in the first three years to meet initial target densities of 20
deer per square mile. Therefore, if the deer population is indeed as low as anecdotally
indicated, or if it turns out to be higher than what is assumed in the final plan/EIS, the
number of deer removed in the first three years of the plan may be lower or even higher than
the numbers presented in table 7 of the final plan/EIS.
Baseline data on vegetation also predates Superstorm Sandy. The National Park Service
acknowledges in the “Vegetation, Unique Vegetation Communities, and Special Status Plant
Species” section of chapter 3 that changes constantly occur at the barrier island as
exemplified by the impacts of Hurricane Sandy in 2012, and that the expanse of any changes
since the Klopfer et al. 2002 publication have yet to be analyzed. Thus, the summary of
vegetation in the final plan/EIS is based on the best available information, as required by the
CEQ regulations for implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (40 CFR 1500–
1508), but should not be considered an accurate or precise description of the current
conditions because this information is not updated (see pages 73-88).

In compliance with New York State law, no sharpshooting or hunting would occur within
the Fire Island communities, and areas of the Seashore would be closed to the public when
direct reduction actions are implemented. Removal by sharpshooters would be conducted by
highly skilled individuals, only in those areas of the Seashore that have been closed, and likely
at night. Hunting would be limited to the Fire Island Wilderness, which is removed from the
Fire Island communities by more than a mile. The Seashore would coordinate with
cooperating agencies to ensure that management actions involving firearms are monitored
for the safety of residents and other visitors, as well as individuals involved with these
actions.

IT1000 VEGETATION
Concern Statement:
Commenters agreed that deer contribute to the spread of invasive species; however,
commenters suggest that the draft plan/EIS addresses neither the impact of humans on the
introduction and spread of invasive species nor the impact of backcountry campers and
beach goers on native vegetation. One commenter stated the draft plan/EIS did not include
specific details on invasive species severity, “hotspots,” or mitigation methods in the Fire
Island communities.
Representative Quote(s):
Correspondence Id: 1617 Comment Id: 420247
Comment Text: The NPS provides no information about the severity of the
invasive/exotic species infestation on FINS, where the invasive species "hotspots" are
located, what efforts and methods (i.e., hand removal, machine removal, herbicide use,
etc...) are being used to combat these infestation, the success of such methods, and/or
how the invasive species may be affecting, beneficially or adversely, native species (plant
and animal) on FINS. Nor does it evaluate what role, if any, deer play in controlling any
of the invasive species through consumption of their leaves, stems, or flowers.
Furthermore, though the NPS repeatedly claims that deer contribute to the spread of
invasive species, there's no analysis of the role of humans in invasive/exotic species
infestations. The reality is that humans, including those who reside in the Fire Island
communities and elsewhere on Long Island, are the ultimate source of invasive species on
FINS. While some invasive species in the area have likely been present for decades, they
all have a human origin. Humans purchase invasive species or their seeds and plant them
perhaps for their aesthetic beauty without understanding that they are invasive/exotic or

without attempting to control their spread. While deer may deposit seeds of invasive
species in the feces or carry such seeds in their hair, the seeds of some species may have
been introduced to FINS by birds, or they were transported to the island by wind or
water. The NPS has not conceded this fact nor does it provide any information about the
existence of exotic/invasive species in Fire Island communities, efforts its making to
convince landowners to replace invasive species with naturally occurring species, or any
outreach it does to local nurseries or horticulturalists to seek their assistance in
preventing the distribution of those invasive/exotic species that are particularly
troublesome.

NPS Response:
The National Park Service acknowledges that many factors, including human behaviors and
deer movement, influence the spread of exotic and invasive plant species, as noted in the
“Vegetation, Unique Vegetation Communities, and Special-status Plant Species” section in
chapter 3 (page 73-88). The National Park Service does not have data showing the positive
role deer play in eating nonnative invasive plant species, and no data supporting this claim
were provided in the comment. However, deer play a disproportionately large role in the
spread of exotic and invasive plant species because of their overabundance and foraging
behavior; therefore, managing the deer population could be an element of a plan more
targeted at invasive species. It should be noted that this white-tailed deer management plan is
not a comprehensive management plan nor a nonnative invasive species management plan.
While the draft plan/EIS does address invasive plants within the vegetation impact topic (see
“Vegetation, Unique Vegetation Communities, and Special-status Plant Species” sections in
chapters 3 and 4), the information requested is beyond the level of detail needed to address
this issue in a white-tailed deer management plan, and would be more appropriately
addressed in a nonnative invasive species plan.

reducing the habitat available to deer would reduce the amount of food available to the
animals, this does not necessarily correlate to nutritional stress or evidence of
malnutrition. Deer are highly adaptable and are dietary generalists able to survive on a
variety of plants. Moreover, if necessary, deer can be highly mobile in search of
alternative food sources. Even if nutritional stress is a product of reducing available
habitat for deer, this can occur even without the installation of fences. For example, a
severe storm or fire could reduce, at least temporarily, the available food supply for deer.
Consequently, nutritional stress can be a product of surviving in the wild and may be a
condition that wild animals, including deer, have adapted to as part of their normal
physiology. In other words, nutritional stress may not be an anomalous condition in wild
animals but, rather, merely a natural occurrence. Furthermore, the NPS has provided no

sources to deer and promote undesirable food conditioning behavior potentially causing
deer to become reliant on such artificial food sources as well as increasing the potential
for the spread of disease among deer congregating around the baiting sites. Fire Island
DEIS at 145. The NPS raises similar concern in regard to the 4-Poster tick control
devices, three of which are used by two Fire Island communities to try to treat deer with
chemicals that will reduce their role in harboring ticks that may transmit tick-borne
diseases to humans. These concerns as related to these 4-Poster devices are more
legitimate than the concerns associated with baiting since the 4-Poster devices are
presumably used year round resulting in deer consumption of tons of bait used to attract
deer to the devices. Conversely, if bait is used solely to attract deer for the purpose of
capture for tagging and fertility control treatments, the deer would only have access to
bait for, at most, a few days which is unlikely to result in the animals becoming reliant on
artificial food sources. The NPS has provided no evidence to substantiate such a concern
or to indicate that temporary bait sites used merely to capture deer pose any increased
risk of disease transmission between deer.

concern for certain vaccines but the NPS should expand this discussion to note that this
concern is not relevant for all vaccines (e.g., Gonacon). In addition, it should note that if a
particular vaccine results in an extended breeding season and even if it results in late fawn
births, this doesn't necessarily correlate to any adverse impacts either on male/female
deer or on fawns. In other words, fawns born late in the season may not experience
higher mortality in winter and male deer, even if they exert additional energy during an
extended rutting season, may not be adversely affected by doing so. Failing to concede

identify the likelihood that FINS deer may be exposed to CWD and the potential source
of that exposure so that the public can assess the veracity of the NPS claim. Moreover,

NPS Response:
The National Park Service has considered the commenters assertions about the impacts of
fencing, temporary bait stations, and fertility control on the white-tailed deer population and
revised the “White-tailed Deer Population” section in chapter 4 accordingly. While deer are
adaptable animals, they are known to jump fences, particularly when stressed, and
occasionally become entangled which may result in injury. Further, because deer are
adaptable and intelligent, jumping fences can be a learned behavior, and more deer may
attempt to jump fences (VerCauteren et al. 2006). Temporary bait stations would temporarily
encourage artificial feeding, but reliance on artificial food sources has been removed from
the final plan/EIS. The impact of bait stations on the spread of disease has also been removed
from the final plan/EIS. The analysis of impacts of alternative B on the white-tailed deer
population has been revised to note that impacts on deer behavior could vary depending on
the agent used.
The impacts of increased risk of vehicle collisions, harassment by the residents, and
disorientation because of unfamiliar settings are impacts on individual deer and have been
removed from the final plan/EIS.
The National Park Service agrees that increased fawn mortality may be an indication of
natural population regulation. However, the significant adverse impacts of deer on
vegetation at the Seashore began long before the population showed any indication of selfregulation.
The final plan/EIS has been revised to remove chronic wasting disease from the impact
analysis. While the National Park Service maintains that a high deer density may increase the
risk of spreading communicable diseases, chronic wasting disease is not part of this plan/EIS.

IT3000 OTHER WILDLIFE AND WILDLIFE HABITAT
Concern Statement:
Commenters expressed concern that the draft plan/EIS did not adequately analyze the many
impacts of other wildlife on the Seashore’s ecosystems. Similarly, commenters thought the
draft plan/EIS overrepresented the negative impacts of deer on other wildlife and the
beneficial impacts a reduction in deer population would have on wildlife. One commenter
noted that the impacts fencing would have on other, smaller mammals is not valid as they are
adaptable and would be able to cross either through or under the fencing.

NPS Response:
The National Park Service acknowledges that there are a number of factors which affect
other wildlife and wildlife habitat. These “non-deer factors” are acknowledged where
relevant in the impact analyses. However the impact analysis focuses on those factors that
would be affected by the proposed management action.
The evaluation of wildlife (other than deer) and wildlife habitat was based on a qualitative
assessment of how expected changes to Seashore vegetation, as described in the “Impacts on
Vegetation” section in chapter 4, would affect the abundance and diversity of wildlife
populations. As cited in chapter 4, under “Impacts of Alternative A,” high deer densities are
documented as negatively affecting other wildlife (deCalesta 1994). Studies cited in chapter 3,
(Art 1976, 1987, 1990, 1995; Forrester, Leopold, and Underwood 2006) show changes and
declines in forest understory due to heavy deer browse, which results in reduced habitat
available for some vegetation-dependent species. Change in the quality and quantity of
forage, availability of suitable nesting sites, amount of cover, and level of competition for
existing resources may lead to changes in the size, reproductive success, rate of predation,
and mortality rate for wildlife populations.
The statement that deer population contributed to reptile population decline has been
revised to clarify that the impacts on vegetation due to heavy deer browsing may have
contributed to the difficulty reptile populations had in recovering from the decline, as
vegetation is a major part of some diets.
As understory vegetation recovers, more vegetation would be available to native songbird,
insect, and small mammal populations at the Seashore. While site-specific data for these
species is unavailable, the National Park Service believes that additional available habitat and
food sources would be beneficial to many species. However, the final plan/EIS has been
revised to remove implications that the population densities of these species would increase.
Regarding the impacts of fencing on other wildlife and wildlife habitats, VerCauteren et al.
(2006) states that fencing used to manage deer populations has adverse impacts on other
wildlife. References to this study were added to “Impacts on Other Wildlife and Wildlife
Habitat” in chapter 4 of the final plan/EIS (page 154).

IT4000 WILDERNESS
Concern Statement:
Commenters expressed concerns with the analysis of impacts on the Fire Island wilderness.
Some commenters felt the deer population and ecosystem as a whole should be left alone to
balance themselves naturally, without human intervention. As such, commenters felt the
draft plan/EIS did not adequately assess the adverse impacts of hunting (and the related
decreased deer population) on the wilderness experience. One commenter expressed

concern that the impacts and specific objectives of hunting deer in the wilderness area were
not adequately examined or discussed in the draft plan/EIS. This commenter wanted to
ensure the public is involved in the Minimum Requirements Analysis decision-making
process. Another commenter stated that designating an additional area as wilderness is no
longer viable because the boardwalk at Smith Point, previously damaged and unused since
Superstorm Sandy, has been restored for use and therefore cannot be part of wilderness.

measurements are applied to fertility control (and sharp-shooting), both Alternatives C &

undesirable deer impacts in the Wilderness Area; sets no deer management objectives;
prescribes no deer density targets or vegetation targets, or procedures to measure them;
and analyzes no impacts, blithely assuming there will not be any. However, unless deer
population densities are significantly reduced by hunting in the Wilderness Area, deer
impacts will likely worsen, as the higher mortality associated with the hunt is
compensated for by increased reproduction and increased foraging by pregnant and
lactating females. The hunt will have impacts; these must be analyzed, and the
management justification for the hunt made explicit.

Comment Text: In regard to the environmental consequences of Alternative A, the NPS
claims that... If the deer population grows to a density whereby heavy browsing this may
result in an ecological system imbalance. Fire Island DEIS at 163. The NPS indicates in
the Fire Island DEIS that deer that inhabit the Fire Island Wilderness may have a much
lower productivity rate compared to deer occupying adjacent Fire Island communities. It
also reports that any deer translocated to the Fire Island Wilderness if Alternative B were
selected would not be expected to significantly increase deer density and their browsing
impacts, according to NPS biologists, would be within the range of natural variability.
Given these factors and considering that deer, though not territorial per se, occupy
specific ranges, it is difficult to perceive how the deer population within Fire Island
Wilderness could grow to a density whereby browsing results in ecological system
imbalance. Moreover, the NPS doesn't explain what it believes constitutes an ecological
system imbalance and/or why, considering the natural regulation management mandate
of the NPS, such impacts are not consistent with allowing natural ecosystems processes to
function without disruption though human actions. The mere fact that deer eat plants or
that they may hinder forest regeneration is not demonstrative of an ecosystem imbalance
but, rather, is evidence of ecosystem function and natural succession. If deer were to
become overabundant within Fire Island Wilderness then, in time, their condition would
decline, productivity would diminish, and the population would balance itself at a level
supported by the ecosystem.

The entry appropriately refers to the cessation of incompatible uses within wilderness as

However, since part of the Smith Point boardwalk has now been restored, this language is
obsolete. Any such designation would therefore seriously inconsistent with both the
Wilderness Act, which calls for the preservation of the character of individual wilderness

acres were designated as wilderness after the non-conforming uses on them had ceased.
One of these was the boardwalk from Watch Hill to Long Cove, which was pro-actively
removed as a non-conforming use- an important defining one aspect of the character of
the area as one without boardwalks. In light of the above, the Smith Point boardwalk
cannot be considered eligible for full wilderness designation, and at this time must remain
as a potential wilderness addition. At the same time, the entire subject, including the valid

Appendix E: Draft Plan/EIS
Comment Analysis Report

NPS Response:
In response to the commenters’ concerns, the description of the Fire Island Wilderness in
chapter 3 was reviewed for accuracy and revised where extraneous details not related to the
scope of this document detracted from the relevant background.
As discussed in the "Wilderness" section of chapter 3 and the "Impacts on Wilderness"
section of chapter 4, there are five character-defining features of wilderness, and the impacts
of the alternatives on these features are discussed in chapter 4. Some of these characteristics
are tied to the condition of the ecosystem; cross-references to sections describing impacts on
the deer population and on vegetation are included where relevant. Management objectives
are generally the same as elsewhere in the document.
An ecosystem imbalance imposed by modern civilization is considered possible due to the
conditions surrounding the Fire Island Wilderness that provide deer with manmade routes
by which to access the wilderness (namely, Smith Point Bridge) and supplies artificial food
sources that prevent otherwise natural population reduction during food shortage caused by
overbrowsing. Text was added to the “Impacts on Wilderness” section of chapter 4 (see page
162).
Translocating deer to the Fire Island Wilderness would cause a slight increase in the
population density in that area under alternative B. However, because we do not expect that
the number of deer translocated to wilderness will be large, biologists have concluded that
deer density, and thus, browsing pressure, would remain within the range experienced under
natural fluctuations of the population. If this alternative were chosen, there would be
additional planning and thresholds established to determine if any impacts occur. Vegetation
would be monitored and if impacts are observed, alternative actions would be taken through
the adaptive management process (any adjustments not covered in this plan could require
additional planning and compliance).
Text was added to chapter 4 to acknowledge the potential for use of vehicles on the beach
outside of the wilderness boundary to indirectly diminish opportunities for solitude (see
page 165-166).
The minimum requirements anaylsis will be completed before a selected alternative is
implemented and after details for plan implementation have been established. That analysis
is separate from the NEPA process and does not include a public comment period. The
analysis will be available to the public following its completion.

present can be somewhat mitigated by the selection of fencing materials and particular
colors. Whether this is done or not, considering the significant benefits of this alternative
in sparing the lives of hundreds of deer on FINS, this so-called visual intrusion is justified
and should not be used by the NPS to reject the selection of Alternative B as the proposed
action. Indeed, until and unless the fence is constructed the NPS can only speculate as to
how it may impact the visitor experience. Even then, the NPS can mitigate such impacts
by explaining the purpose and significance of the fence along with the broader effort by
the NPS to non-lethally and humanely reduce the deer population on FINS. AWI

the William Floyd Estate regarding the use of fencing to ostensibly protect the cultural
and natural resources found on the William Floyd Estate.

Commenter: DJ Schubert Page: Paragraph:

NPS Response
The National Park Service maintains that alternative B would result in adverse impacts on the
cultural landscape. Impacts on cultural landscapes are assessed based on the changes the
proposed action would make to a landscape and on the extent that the cultural landscape
could be interpreted, not on the visitor experience of the landscape. As noted in the draft
plan/EIS, fencing around the historic core of the William Floyd Estate would result in an
adverse impact on the cultural landscape because a fence would not be consistent with the
240 years during which the Floyd family managed the William Floyd Estate. However, as
noted in draft plan/EIS in the conclusion for the analysis of impacts of alternative B on the
cultural landscape, adverse impacts associated with fencing are not significant.
As stated on page 63 of the draft plan/EIS (pages 63-64 of the final plan/EIS), “the preferred
alternative was identified with consideration to the likelihood of meeting the objectives,
flexibility and management options available for use in order to meet the objectives,
timeframe in which desired conditions would be met, public concerns regarding safety and
resource management, and feasibility of implementing the plan given uncertain economic
conditions.” The National Park Service notes that the same fencing for the William Floyd
Estate is proposed for alternative D, the NPS preferred alternative; therefore, this was not a
factor in its identification.

NPS Response
The purpose of the white-tailed deer managment plan is to reduce adverse impacts of deer
browsing on Seashore resources as well as to reduce certain undesirable human-deer
interactions. The types of interactions this plan seeks to address as “undesirable” are
described in “Need for Action” in chapter 1 (pages 1-2) as concerns for human health and
safety, including direct physical injury, sanitation issues, the perceived role of deer in the
incidence of Lyme disease, damage to ornamental plantings and vegetable gardens,
interactions with pets, and injury to deer from fences. These types of interactions were
identified based on research (including research on perceptions of human-deer interactions,
Siemer et al, 2007, Leong and Decker 2007) and managerial experience outlined in chapter 1.
The text of the final plan/EIS under “Need for Action” in chapter 1 (pages 1-2) was revised to
more clearly identify these types of interactions as the “undesirable” interactions this plan
seeks to address.
The 2008 survey data showed the importance of deer to the Seashore. The plan/EIS
incorporates an objective of managing “a viable white-tailed deer population in the
Seashore” (page 5), which all alternatives must meet. This means that while the Seashore
must act to protect other natural and cultural resources from deer, this must also be done in a
way that maintains deer as part of the Seashore experience. The National Park Service does
not seek to eliminate visitor enjoyment of deer, nor to prioritize recreational preferences
over environmental damage caused by deer.
In general, analyses of impacts on natural and cultural resources were based on predicted
changes in the condition of the resources, which, as noted, may be perceived both positively
and negatively by visitors. Research conducted in 2005 identified concerns of community
residents (Leong et al. 2005), many of whom are also visitors to the Seashore. A follow-up
survey in 2007 revealed that the majority of respondents were somewhat or very concerned
about deer browsing on natural vegetation and vegetable gardens, accessing unsecured trash,
interacting with pets, diseases and/or parasites carried by deer, and car accidents involving
deer (Siemer et al. 2007). While day-use visitors not from the local area may attend to these
interactions to different degrees, the types of positive and negative perceptions would be
similar. These studies are mentioned in the document where relevant.
The National Park Service agrees that seeing deer can benefit visitor experience and may
affect some visitors more than others, depending on the reasons for visiting. The draft
plan/EIS also recognizes that visitors will have quite different opinions about removal of deer
in chapter 3, section titled, “Visitor Use and Experience/Recreation” (page 108 [final
plan/EIS page 108]). The courts have established that “NEPA requires agencies to consider

The reference to “cost effectiveness” has been removed and language in this section was

The methods for capture are anticipated to cost the same for both translocation and capture
and euthanasia, so the difference in cost between the two actions would be in physical
translocation of a live animal versus euthanasia. Translocation of live animals to the Fire
Island Wilderness would be much more labor intensive than euthanasia. Translocation
would involve careful transportation of live deer, ensuring that they arrive to the Fire Island
Wilderness safely, as well as administration of a reversal agent and supervision until deer are

intensive with regard to time and materials, which translates to a higher cost. Additionally,
translocated deer may return to the Fire Island communities, and could therefore incur

decision-makers as to the relative burden placed on park staff and resources by the

weigh the relative advantages of each alternative.

MT1100 LYME DISEASE
Concern Statement:
Commenters expressed concerns relating to Lyme disease incidence and the tick population
in the Seashore and suggested that the Seashore also implement tick management actions in
tandem with deer management actions. Management suggestions included installing 4-poster
devices with nearby cameras to aid in baiting and monitoring, respectively. One commenter
pointed out that deer are not the only carrier of ticks, therefore the white-tailed deer and tick
populations are not directly related.

Comment Text: In general, The HSUS does not support providing supplemental food for
wildlife, but given its proven effectiveness, the real public health concerns associated with
Lyme disease, and the high volume of people who visit Fire Island every year (not to
mention the many year-round residents), we strongly recommend the NPS reconsider
incorporating 4-Posters into the FEIS. Not only would 4-Posters devices reduce tick
populations and potentially reduce the incidence of Lyme disease in humans on Fire
Island, the devices could be used in concert with deer monitoring and fertility control
efforts. Field cameras could be installed near the 4-Posters devices to track the number,
sex and age of deer and the devices would serve as bait stations to aid in efforts to dart
deer with fertility control agents. The benefits of using these devices far outweigh any
negative impacts on the deer or the environment if coupled with a fertility control
program to suppress and reduce the deer population over time, and for these reasons, the
NPS should include the use of 4-Posters in the FEIS.

Comment Text: In regards to expressed concerns regarding black-legged ticks and Lyme
disease, it is also worth pointing out that deer are only one of many carriers of blacklegged ticks and serve as just one host of the adult stage of the tick. The issue of Lyme
disease is one that is not as closely related to deer populations as many would believe with
one study finding that when as many as 70% o the deer were removed from an island
there was no marked reduction in the abundance of the tick. (Wilson et al 1984, p.697)

NPS Response
The National Park Service recognizes and appreciates that Lyme disease is a concern for
many residents and visitors to the Seashore. The public education/interpretation efforts
included in the NPS preferred alternative would seek to increase understanding of tickborne diseases, including the relationship between deer and tick populations. While the
plan/EIS does address the public perception that a high deer density may support an
increased tick population within the public health and safety impact topic (see “Public
Health and Safety” sections in chapters 3 and 4), the information requested is beyond the
level of detail needed to address this issue in a white-tailed deer management plan, and
would be more appropriately addressed in a tick or tick-borne illness management plan. This
white-tailed deer management plan is not a comprehensive management plan nor a tick or
tick-borne disease management plan. As such tick management is not part of the purpose and
need for this plan and is not included in any of the plan objectives, and examination of
alternatives for addressing the tick population fall outside the scope of this plan/EIS. Because
deer can host ticks, managing the deer population could be an element of a plan more
targeted at the management of ticks and/or tick-borne disease.

NI3001 LAW AND POLICY
Concern Statement:
Commenters expressed concerns about how the draft plan/EIS complies or fails to comply
with several laws and policies including the NPS Organic Act, the National Environmental
Policy Act, the Wilderness Act, and NPS Management Polices. A commenter questioned
whether the draft plan/EIS provided evidence that the use of lethal reduction is justified
under 16 USC 3. Another commenter stated that the draft plan/EIS does not address or
define standards of impairments or unacceptable impacts. One commenter noted several
additional cumulative actions which he felt should have been included in the cumulative
action analysis. The same commenter requested that each impact topic have “meaningful,
reasonable, [and] quantifiable metrics” for evaluating impacts.

Comment Text: Since the impact threshold at which impairment occurs is not always
readily apparent, the NPS has created the "unacceptable impacts" standard to provide
greater assurance that impairment will not occur. ... The decision as to whether an impact

activity will not lead to an impairment of park resources and values. In making this
determination, the NPS decision-maker is to use his/her professional judgment, consider
relevant NEPA documents, consultations under the National Historic Preservation Act,
relevant scientific and scholarly studies, advice by subject matter experts and others with
relevant knowledge or experience, and the results of civic engagement and public
involvement activities relating to the decision. Policies at 1.4.7. These same standards are
also applicable when reaching conclusions about unacceptable impacts. In the Fire Island

the Fire Island DEIS which cannot be corrected in the Final EIS. Instead the NPS needs
to prepare a supplement to the Fire Island DEIS to include this required impairment
analysis which then must be subject to public review and comment. In preparing this
supplement, the NPS should be cognizant of the finding in Bluewater Network v. Salazar
(U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Civil Action No. 08-841) where the
court criticized the NPS for failing to provide meaningful and quantifiable intensity
definition when determining whether jet ski use represented an impairment to park
resources. Absent this analysis, the Fire Island DEIS decision-making process cannot
proceed.

Comment Text: The only other legal authority that the NPS can consider to justify the
proposed action is that contained in 16 USC 3. The specific language in that provision is:
"The Secretary of the Interior shall make and publish such rules and regulations as he
may deem necessary or proper for the use and management of the parks, monuments,
and reservations under the jurisdiction of the National Park Service... The term "use" in
this text clearly refers to public use of a park including uses authorized by the NPS. For
this standard to be used to justify lethal control of deer in FINS, the NPS must
demonstrate that deer are detrimental to public use of the park. The NPS has failed to
provide such evidence in the Fire Island DEIS. It has speculated that public use is
impacted by deer in that the public may be adversely impacted by deer over-browsing
their habitat resulting in impacts to other wildlife and plant species, to forest
regeneration, and to cultural resources. It even claims that public use may be affected if
visitors to FINS observed malnourished deer. What it doesn't provide is any evidence
that public use of the park has or is being adversely impacted by deer. Speculation is not
proof and the NPS has offered no credible evidence that the public have complained
about the alleged reduction in vegetation diversity, it has offered no proof that any
wildlife species has been adversely impacted by deer, it has provided no evidence that
visitors are offended by deer impacts to cultural landscapes, and it cites to no evidence to
suggest that deer on FINS are malnourished or that the appearance of such compromised
deer have adversely impacted public use and experience/recreation on FINS. What it
does provide are the results of a 2008 survey of FINS visitors where approximately 50
percent indicated that the opportunity to see deer improved their visitor experience, that
20 percent reported that deer did not affect their visit, 29 percent indicated that they did
not observe deer, and that only 2 percent of survey respondents expressed any concerns
or complaints about deer. Fire Island DEIS at 108. Even for those two percent, the NPS
did not explain how they may have been adversely impacted by deer which is critical in
this case since those concerns could have been tied to disease concerns or simply a fear of
large animals and not linked to deer impacts to vegetation or other wildlife on FINS. The
NPS also reports that there have been incidents of deer-human conflicts where food
conditioned deer approach visitor or residents in Fire Island communities seeking food
handouts. If those incidents are real, the NPS, under 16 USC 3 would have the authority
to lethally remove those deer on park lands that threaten or accost park visitors. Taking
action to address such specific human-deer conflicts is far different, however, than a
parkwide killing program intended to substantially reduce deer density due primarily to
alleged impacts to park vegetation. Also, the authority provided by 16 USC 3 does not
apply to deer that are not on park lands - such as those who may "threaten" people within
the Fire Island communities since the language only refers to wildlife "detrimental to the

Comment Text: In addition, in that September 2012 GMP newsletter, the NPS references
the "deer and vegetation management plan" and claims that that planning process can go
forward independent of completion of the revised GMP because it is being subject to
analysis in an environmental impact statement. This claim is entirely erroneous
considering, as the Policies make clear, that an IP (like the deer management plan) is
intended to implement activities and projects to achieve the desired conditions identified
in the GMP, PMPs, and SPs. Completing this decision-making process on deer
management and then preparing a draft GMP and associated NEPA document and
subjecting those documents to public review is entirely antithetical to the NPS planning
process as detailed in the Policies. The Policies set forth a step-wise and hierarchical
planning process in order to achieve the overall objective of park service decision-making
... NEPA prohibits an agency from taking any major federal actions that are covered by a
separate programmatic environmental impact statement and may significantly affect the
quality of the human environment unless the action is "justified independently of the
(programmatic EIS)," "is itself accompanied by an adequate environmental impact
statement," and "will not prejudice the ultimate decision on the program." 40 CFR
1506.1(c)(1)(2) and (3). However, none of those criteria are applicable in this case. In
particular, the NEPA analysis to be prepared on the GMPs not a programmatic document
and, even if it were, given NPS Policies, the deer management plan is not justified
independently of the GMP but, rather, must logically follow the GMP as part of the NPS
planning process. Furthermore, as articulated in this letter, the present EIS is not
adequate and, as the NPS concedes in the Fire Island DEIS, the decision to be made on
deer management will prejudice the decision to be made on the GMP.

Comment Text: The NPS allowed this management problem to develop because it has
misinterpreted the role that hunting is to play on Fire Island National Seashore. The Deer
Plan inaccurately describes the Fire Island National Seashore as a place "in which public
hunting is allowed through its enabling legislation." Deer Plan at 108 (emphasis added).
Fire Island's enabling language does not allow hunting - it mandates the activity: The
Secretary shall permit hunting, fishing, and shellfishing on lands and waters under his
administrative jurisdiction within the Fire Island National Seashore in accordance with
the laws of New York and the United States of America, except that the Secretary may
designate zones where, and establish periods when, no hunting shall be permitted for
reasons of public safety, administration, or public use and enjoyment. 16 U.S.C.A. Â§

Seashore property to the extent authorized by the State of New York and to restrict or
close areas to hunting only under extraordinary circumstances relating to public safety,
administration, and public use and enjoyment. Instead of opening the National Seashore
to hunting and only closing it in limited areas and times for these specific purposes, for
the last several years the NPS has opened only limited areas of the property to waterfowl
hunting and has not permitted any deer hunting. This approach has not only jeopardized
the health of the unit's wildlife and plant populations as well as the safety of the park's
visitors, but it has also violated Congress' mandate.

Comment Text: In the Fire Island DEIS, the NPS evaluation of cumulative impacts is
limited to the following actions that the NPS claims are those that are past, present or
reasonably foreseeable: tick monitoring, 4 Poster Deer Treatment Devices, waterfowl
hunting, deer hunting and deer damage permits, William Floyd Estate cultural landscape
report and treatment plan, and enhanced monitoring and management of invasive plant
species. This list, however, is incomplete as it doesn't include public use of FINS, Fire
Island community development, or climate change. Public use of FINS is clearly
applicable to evaluating the cumulative impacts of each alternative since such use can
effect park wildlife, including deer, and vegetation. As previously explained, the NPS has
conceded in its 2007 to 2011 SP that public use of FINS has resulted in adverse impacts to
vegetation as a result of human day use of beaches and backcountry recreation. Though
the NPS included visitor use and experience/recreation as an impact factor in the Fire
Island DEIS this examined how each alternative would impact visitor use but not how
visitor use impacts deer, other wildlife, and vegetation ecology on FINS. As the definition
of cumulative impact includes action taken by non-Federal agencies and even private
persons, development activities within Fire Island communities should have been
evaluated as a cumulative impact. It could be that these communities are fully developed
and that, consequently, without the ability to expand their footprint there will be no
additional significant impact on FINS wildlife, including deer, or wildlife habitat. If this is
not the case, then the NPS should have consulted with the Fire Island communities to
determine their development plans so that such information could be included in the Fire
Island DEIS in order to analyze its impact, when combined with other past, present, and
reasonably foreseeable actions, on FINS. Though climate change does not represent an
"action" per se, there is little question that the implications of climate change particularly
in regard to a barrier island like FINS will be substantial and will impact potentially all
wildlife and vegetation on FINS. The NPS includes some discussion of climate change in
the Fire Island DEIS but that is in the context of claiming that the impacts of climate
change will be even more severe to vegetation and other wildlife if the deer population on
FINS is not reduced. What the NPS fails to provide is a comprehensive of how climate
change impacts (e.g., sea level rise, increased storm frequency, increased severity of
storms, overwash, saltwater intrusion) will impact deer, other wildlife, vegetation, FINS
operation, and visitor use either as a stand-alone impact or cumulatively when combined
with other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable impacts. Not only should the NPS
have included a comprehensive review of such adverse implications associated with
climate change in Chapter 3 which described the Affected Environment but it should
have evaluated such impacts in its cumulative impacts analysis of each alternative.

NPS Response
Organic Act
The National Park Service has broad authority to manage wildlife and other natural
resources within the boundaries of units of the national park system. In addition to the
general mandate to conserve park resources and prevent impairment 54 USC 100752
expressly authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to, “…provide in his discretion for the
destruction of such animals and of such plant life as may be detrimental to the use of [the
parks, monuments, and reservations under the jurisdiction of the National Park Service].”
This project is a straightforward exercise of that discretion. Courts have ruled that Section 3
of the Organic Act does not require the Secretary of the Interior to wait until damage has
taken its toll before taking action to control the impacts of overabundant deer, and have
consistently and repeatedly upheld the use of this authority in situations such as this.
The procedural duty to take a “hard look” at the environmental consequences of a proposed
action and its alternatives, and to prepare an EIS if there is the potential to cause significant
impacts, is separate from the substantive prohibition against impairment of park resources
and values found in the NPS Organic Act. While the National Park Service uses the NEPA
process to inform the impairment anaylsis, the requirements of the two statutes are quite
distinct. The National Park Service must consider any potential for impairment in
conjunction with environmental review and analysis but there is no requirement to include a
determination on impairment in a NEPA document; a non-impairment determination is
required only when a decision is made; i.e., in conjunction with a finding of no significant
impact or a record of decision.
Unacceptable Impacts
The commenter is correct that NPS Management Policies 2006, section 1.4.7.1 requires the
National Park Service to evaluate the potential for unacceptable impacts to park resources.
However, the commenter is incorrect in his claim regarding disclosure of unacceptable
impacts. NPS management policies requires consideration of unacceptable impacts when
engaged in the evaluation of proposed actions; however, there is no requirement to provide a
written determination nor is a determination of unacceptable impacts required to be
included in NEPA documents. The NPS has not found any reason to believe that
unacceptable impacts would result from implementation of the preferred alternative or other
alternatives under consideration nor has the commenter identified any specific impacts that
he believes would result in unacceptable impacts.
National Environmental Policy Act
The National Park Service has, in the past, considered completing a programmatic EIS
relating to deer management. However, the National Park Service decided that due to the
unique nature of each park unit, site-specific plans would be more efficient. Ultimately, if the
National Park Service completed a programmatic EIS, additional site-specific NEPA
compliance would be required for each park unit before any action to manage deer
populations could be taken, thus reducing the perceived efficiency of a programmatic EIS.
The National Park Service may revisit the issue of a programmatic EIS again in the future, but
this issue is outside of the scope of the current plan.

E-48

Appendix E: Draft Plan/EIS
Comment Analysis Report

The draft plan/EIS discusses vegetation and the relationship of deer management to Seashore
vegetation. However, the focus of the plan/EIS is on deer management, not vegetation
management. While deer and vegetation management are related, the National Park Service
has broad discretion in determining how best to handle related, yet discrete issues. The
National Park Service is not required to address the management of these two resources in
the same planning process (Grunewald v. Jarvis 2013 930 F. Supp. 2d 73), and there is a need
to take action relating to deer impacts now. Actions being taken by the Seashore to address
vegetation issues such as exotic or nonnative plant species are handled by separate planning
efforts. The foreseeable actions regarding invasive plant species monitoring and management
are described as part of the cumulative impact analyses in the draft plan/EIS.
The National Park Service does not agree that the commenter’s suggestions have cumulative
impacts on the resources at the Seashore. As stated in the “Cumulative Impact Analysis
Methodology” (page 116 of the final plan/EIS), the National Park Service identified past,
present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions during internal and external scoping
processes and analyzed the impacts of those actions in compliance with NEPA (40 CFR
1508.7). Visitor use is not discussed as a cumulative impact because visitor use is part of the
purpose of the Seashore and is therefore included in the description of the affected
environment in chapter 3 (beginning on page 73 of the final plan/EIS) which takes into
account typical visitor use volumes and patterns as they related to vegetatation, the whitetailed deer population, other wildlife, etc. The NPS approach to considering climate change
in NEPA compliance documents is to analyze impacts of alternatives in the context of the
current as well as anticipated future environmental conditions when reasonably foreseeable
impacts to park resources stemming from climate change are identified. Therefore, relevant
impacts are discussed within the context of conditions as affected by climate change; climate
change is not called out as a separate cumulative action. Impacts of climate change on
specific park resources are considered as part of the affected environment, not as a
cumulative action. In response to comments received regarding future development, the
National Park Service contacted the communities, and there are no known developments for
which there are existing decisions, proposals, or funding. As a result, future development
would be considered speculative (43 CFR 46.30) and need not be considered in the
cumulative effects analysis.
Rather than using metrics, the NPS has chosen to use a qualitative approach in its impact
assessments, and the NPS has discretion as the lead agency as to how to conduct the analysis.
As explained in “Methodology for Assessing Impacts” in chapter 4 of the plan/EIS (pages
115-119), direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts are discussed and described. The analysis
is based on the best information available and knowledge of what is likely to occur.
NPS Management Policies
The NPS agrees with the commenter that the logical order of planning efforts would be the
General Management Plan, followed by an updated Resource Management Plan and then
implementation plans. General management plans are a means of meeting the four legislative
requirements for planning as established in the Parks and Recreation Act of 1978. However,
meeting immediate park planning needs does not need be delayed until the completion of a
general management plan. NPS planning efforts seek to be responsive to high priority
planning needs, which includes completion of implementation management plans that are
guided by law and policy and existing park plans.

Comment Text: According to the NPS, action is needed at the present time to address
impacts associated with changes in white-tailed deer abundance, distribution, and
behavior across the Seashore. Fire Island DEIS at 1. ... Given these claims, to substantiate
the purpose and need to implement deer management actions, particularly the overtly
draconian option of lethal deer control, the NPS would have to prove that deer are: a)
adversely impacting park vegetation by preventing its preservation; b) preventing forest
regeneration and restoration; c) harming other natural resources within FINS; d)
damaging cultural resources; and, e) causing undesirable human-deer interactions within
FINS and in adjacent Fire Island communities. ... The evidence and data included in the
Fire Island DEIS does not substantiate the purpose and need for the proposal to engage in
the park-wide lethal control of deer. While some may question whether the relevant
information provides support for any active management of deer on FINS, including
non-lethal management, I do not oppose the implementation of non-lethal management
options to begin to address the concerns about deer raised by the NPS. Nevertheless, I do
not believe that the NPS has sufficiently substantiated the majority of its deer-related
concerns with credible evidence or analysis. I strongly encourage the NPS to immediately
reestablish the deer immunocontraception project in order to resume the use of fertility
control to reduce, stop, and, ideally, reverse the rate of growth of the FINS deer
population. It is unfortunate that the NPS erred in stopping the program in 2009 which

began recently. While AWI is not suggesting that such impacts are not possible and/or are
not occurring, the fact that the NPS only initiated vegetation monitoring on the William
Floyd Estate recently suggests that such impacts must not be as significant or severe as the
NPS is claiming; otherwise surely it would have initiated such monitoring decades ago so
that it would have credible data to prove the claimed impacts. The need to fully interpret
the landscape also hasn't been sufficiently explained. In this case, it would appear that the
NPS is attempting to recreate a snapshot in time from some historical era when William
Floyd and family occupied and used the estate lands. Yet, the NPS has failed to explain
why it feels obliged to recreate this snapshot in time instead of recognizing that, over
time, natural and anthropogenic factors have affected and changed the William Floyd
Estate. Surely, given the skill of the NPS interpretation staff, they can use alternative
methods (i.e., old photographs, drawing, renderings of what the historical landscape may
have appeared) to transport visitors back in time in order to help them interpret the
landscape as it appeared at whatever year the NPS is most interested in preserving.
Indeed, painting that picture while explaining how the landscape has changed over time,
and why, may also be of interest to visitors to the William Floyd Estate to help them
appreciate the evolution of the landscape whether it was caused by natural or
anthropogenic forces. The NPS isn't legally mandated to preserve the William Floyd
Estate as it existing in some year in the past since it doesn't impose such manipulations to
other historic landscapes under its jurisdiction.

NPS Response:
The need for action is stated in chapter 1, and the Seashore and studies elsewhere have
documented that deer densities such as those at Fire Island have adverse impacts on
vegetation. The draft plan/EIS discusses how the continued presence of overabundant deer
could cause significant adverse impacts. Courts have ruled that 54 USC 100752 does not
require the Secretary of the Interior to wait until damage has taken its toll before taking
action to control the impacts of overabundant deer, and have consistently and repeatedly
upheld the use of this authority in situations such as this.
The National Park Service designated the William Floyd Estate as a cultural landscape which
represents 240 years of ownership by the Floyd family. Rather than recreating a snapshot in
time, the National Park Service is preserving the landscape as it was “over time for the
purposes of agriculture, ornamentation, and conservation which have created historic
patterns of vegetation growth that should be preserved” (as stated in chapter 4, page 168).
The draft plan/EIS addresses the period of significance from 1724 through 1975, based on
the Cultural Landscape Inventory completed in 2006 (NPS 2006b). Due to deer impacts on

vegetation that contribute to the historic patterns (including ornamental plantings), a lower
deer density at William Floyd Estate would assist in achieving this preservation.
One commenter stated the National Park Service has not demonstrated a need for managing
deer which regularly approach humans. However, as noted in response to the concern under
IT6000, a number of undesirable human-deer interactions have been identified through
surveys of residents and management experience; human-deer interactions affect not only
people but also the deer themselves. In recognizing that eliminating these undesirable
interactions is unrealistic, the National Park Service set objectives for this plan / EIS to:




Improve public understanding of the issues such as human-deer interactions, the
impact of white-tailed deer on the cultural and natural resources of the Seashore, and
tick-borne diseases throughout the Seashore, including the William Floyd Estate.
Reduce the potential for undesirable human-deer interactions both within the Fire
Island communities and at other developed areas of the Seashore.

As explained in the “Thresholds for Taking Action” section of chapter 1, the National Park
Service has noted that during deer density surveys, deer approaching researchers
(approximately 11% of the deer in the communities) appeared to be the same individuals,
suggesting that these returning deer are the cause of many human-deer interactions.
Therefore, the National Park Service believes the need for the approach identified to manage
this issue (translocation or capture and euthanasia of deer that approach people) is welldemonstrated and will be effective in meeting this objective.
