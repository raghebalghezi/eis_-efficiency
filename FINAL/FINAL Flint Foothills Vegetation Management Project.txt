Abstract: The Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest (BDNF), Pintler Ranger District, is proposing the
Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Project to address the vegetation conditions in the project area
resulting from current insect and disease infestations. The Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Project
area encompasses 44,522 acres located on the north end of the Flint Range in the Clark Fork Flint
Landscape (Forest Plan pp. 108-109), about 6 miles southeast of Drummond, Montana (figure 1). Eightythree percent of the area (37,010 acres) is managed by the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest; the
remainder is private inholdings (7,512 acres). This Final Environmental Impact Statement considers the
environmental effect of proposed activities including salvage harvest, commercial thinning, and seed tree
harvest with reserves, prescribed burning and precommercial thinning, on 5,703 acres.
Alternative 2-Proposed Action proposes to:
•

Salvage harvest dead and dying lodgepole pine stands on 1,163 acres.

•

Commercial thin ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir stands, including 157 acres of old growth, on
1,149 acres.

•

Regenerate by seed tree harvest Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine stands on 353 acres.

•

Collectively, the commercial vegetation treatments would provide 16,042 MBF (32,083 CCF) in
sawtimber; and 4,010 MBF (8,021 CCF) in non-saw timber.

•

Prescribe burn mid-elevation lodgepole pine and low-elevation Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine
stands on 1,990 acres.

•

Precommercial thin naturally regenerated, lodgepole pine and Douglas-fir stands on 1,048 acres.

•

Construct 1.3 miles of new National Forest System road.

•

Construct 7.2 miles of new temporary road. Following project implementation, the roads would
be decommissioned by obliteration.

•

Reconstruct approximately 4.4 miles of open and closed unauthorized routes to use as haul routes.
Following project implementation, these routes would be decommissioned by various methods.

•

Add 2.8 miles of road (1.3 miles of new NFS road construction and 1.5 miles of open and closed
unauthorized routes) to the Forest transportation system.

Alternative 3 addresses public concerns over new road construction, and logging within old-growth
stands. This alternative proposes no new system or temporary roads constructed to access units or
accommodate logging within units. No commercial thinning would occur within the understory of oldgrowth stands. As a result, alternative 3 includes 141 fewer acres of salvage harvest, and 483 fewer acres
of commercial thinning. All other vegetation treatments remain the same as alternative 2.
We prepared this Final EIS based on public and other agency comments received during the Draft EIS
comment period and additional interdisciplinary team input. It includes the identification of our preferred
alternative (alternative 2); it incorporates suggested corrections and changes made by the public (as
summarized at the beginning of chapter 1 then stated specifically at the beginning of chapter 2 and
chapter 3) and additional internal discussion among the project interdisciplinary team.

Summary
Introduction
This section is a brief summary of the contents of this Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS). The
FEIS begins with chapter 1.
The Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest (BDNF), Pintler Ranger District, is proposing the Flint
Foothills Vegetation Management Project to address the vegetation conditions in the project area resulting
from current insect and disease infestations, or at risk from future infestations. Proposed activities include
salvage harvest, commercial thinning, seed tree harvest, precommercial thinning and prescribed burning.
The Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Project area encompasses 44,522 acres located on the north
end of the Flint Range in the Clark Fork Flint Landscape (Forest Plan pp. 108-109), about 6 miles
southeast of Drummond, Montana (figure 1). Eighty-three percent of the area (37,010 acres) is managed
by the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest; the remainder is private inholdings (7,512 acres). Proposed
activities for the project follow direction for the Flint Foothills and Flint Uplands Management Areas as
described in the 2009 Beaverhead-Deerlodge Forest Plan (Forest Plan pp. 108-109; 112-115).
Other plans, policies and regulations provide management direction for this project, including but not
limited to:
•

The National Forest Management Act of 1976 (NFMA) and implementing regulations - The
Flint Foothills Project is consistent with the findings required when making project-level
decisions involving timber harvest.

•

Forest Service Policy - The Flint Foothills Project is consistent with the Forest Service Manual
and Handbook direction outlined in this analysis.

•

Forest Plan Consistency - The Flint Foothills Project is consistent with the Forest Plan
management area direction, and also designed to meet vegetation goals and objectives within
the plan.

•

The Endangered Species Act of 1973 - Requires federal agencies to ensure that any agency
actions (any action authorized, funded or carried out by the agency) are not likely to jeopardize
the continued existence of any threatened, endangered or proposed species.

•

Sensitive Species - The sensitive species analysis in this document meets the requirements for
a biological evaluation as outlined in FSM 2672.42. Sensitive species are administratively
designated by the Regional Forester and managed under the authority of the National Forest
Management Act.

Background - Existing Vegetation Conditions in the Project Area
The Flint Foothills area is part of a larger mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) epidemic
occurring across the majority of the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest and on other forests in the
Northern Region. Mountain pine beetle has been active in the Flint Foothills area since about 2000,
reaching epidemic proportions beginning in 2007. This has resulted in extensive areas of dead and dying
lodgepole pine, and the mortality of more individually scattered ponderosa pine and whitebark pine. A
cold event in 2010, with sustained temperatures below zero degrees Fahrenheit, caused a reduction in
beetle population in many areas on the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest, and may have led to the
decline in tree mortality; however, suitable pine host trees remained in the Flint Foothills analysis area,

S-1

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

which likely led to the increase in tree mortality with beetle activity in 2011. Within the Flint Foothills
Project area on National Forest System (NFS) lands, it is estimated that all (100 percent) of the pine
stands 5 inches dbh and larger have been affected by mountain pine beetle. Beetle infestations are a
regular force of natural change in forested ecosystems; however, several current outbreaks occurring
simultaneously across western North America are the largest and most severe in recorded history (Bentz
2008).
Surveys show that mortality of individual Douglas-fir trees is occurring in the project area due to western
spruce budworm (Choristoneura occidentalis). The recent drought conditions and dense stand conditions
cause the late-successional stands of Douglas-fir to be susceptible to western spruce budworm because
these stands are often stressed by competition. Areas of higher mortality due to western spruce budworm
in contiguous stands of Douglas-fir are evident in the Gird Creek to Douglas Creek areas within the
project area.
An increase in individual numbers of Douglas-fir trees killed by Douglas-fir bark beetle (Dendroctonus
pseudotsugae) has been noted in the Dunkleberg Ridge, Jackson Park and Blum Creek areas. An increase
of mortality due to Douglas-fir bark beetle may be attributed to the heavy and repeated defoliation from
western spruce budworm, which may lead to increases in Douglas-fir bark beetle activity.
Fire frequency determines the vegetation successional stage and fuel conditions; the shape and size of
past fires play a role in fuel connectivity and landscape heterogeneity or homogeneity (Arno et al. 2000,
Turner et al. 1998). Forest structure and composition in the Flint Foothills Project area have been most
significantly altered due to the lack of fire disturbance. The mid- to high-elevation forests are currently
homogeneous, mature stands lacking stand-age diversity. Past fire disturbances suggest a more
heterogeneous landscape. Blister rust (Cronartium ribicola) and mountain pine beetle have accelerated
succession to subalpine fir by killing mature whitebark pine. Mountain pine beetle has killed the majority
of lodgepole pine in the project area. Additionally, mortality of very large ponderosa pine from mountain
pine beetles has been noted in the project area through stand exams. Coupled with the lack of fire, these
disturbances have caused a major shift in landscape composition and structure from pine to fir and spruce
(Keane 2000).

Purpose and Need
The purpose and need of the Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Project is to contribute to
achievement of the following Forest Plan goals and objectives:
1. Forest Plan Timber Management Goals
a. Lands Suitable for Timber Production: Manage lands suitable for timber production for the
growth and yield of sawtimber, crop trees, pulpwood, and other forest products, including
salvage harvest.
b. Product Utilization: Forest products would be used to provide economic benefits where
project objectives, forest plan objectives, and forest plan standards can be met.
2. Forest Plan Timber Management Objectives on Lands Suitable for Timber Production
a. Bring 10 percent of lands suitable for timber production into a managed condition. 1

The Corrected Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) for the Forest Plan identifies 284,000 acres of
suitable timber ground (FEIS p. 38). The Forest Plan objective applies to ten percent—28,400 acres of suitable lands
on a Forestwide basis for the ten-year planning period of the Plan.

1

S-2

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

b. Manage those stands already in a managed condition to maintain long-term sustained yield.
3. Forest Plan Vegetation Management Objectives
a. Reduce forest density in the large size classes of dry forest communities and some lodgepole
pine communities to maintain or improve resilient forest conditions.
b. Douglas-fir Type: Increase the number of acres in the 0- to 5-inch dbh class on approximately
20,000 acres.
c. Lodgepole Pine Type: Increase the number of acres in the 0-to 5-inch dbh class by
approximately 74,000 acres.
All project treatment units have been proposed on lands classified as “Suitable for Timber Production”
using the Forest Plan’s Timber Harvest Classification Protocol (Forest Plan p. 42), which includes both
coarse-scale GIS modeling and site-specific on the ground reconnANSsance. Table S-1 cross-walks
proposed treatments with the corresponding Forest Plan Goal/Objectives.

Changes to the Proposed Action
Changes since Publishing the DEIS
Additional field reviews identified 36 acres of old-growth in proposed commercial thin unit 71C, bringing
the total old-growth acres thinned to 157 acres in 5 units.

Changes since Publishing the Notice of Intent
Field reviews of the proposed treatment units were completed by the interdisciplinary team members
subsequent to publishing the Notice of Intent (NOI) in June 2011 and mailing the June 7, 2011 scoping
letter. These reviews resulted in updates to the proposed action, including changes in treatment
prescriptions, unit boundary changes, and the addition and deletion of units. Many of the originally
proposed precommercial thinning units were identified as previously thinned, and therefore, dropped from
the list of units proposed for treatment. Other units were identified for density reduction, and therefore,
added to the list of units proposed for treatment. Overall, the net changes resulted in the addition of 92
acres of commercial treatments, and a reduction of 98 acres of precommercial thinning, for a net change
of 6 fewer acres in the updated proposed action.
June 2011 scoping identified approximately 10 miles of temporary road construction and 72 miles of
National Forest System roads (NFS roads) needed for access and hauling. Haul route needs were refined
in the updated proposed action presented in this FEIS. A distinction is made between NFS roads 2, and
open and closed unauthorized routes (UR). 3 4 One segment of new temporary road construction in the
June 2011 scoping was determined to need construction specifications due to steep slopes and is now
proposed as new National Forest System road construction (1.3 miles).
Table S-2 displays the changes in activity acreages and haul route mileages between the proposed action
presented in June 2011, and the updated proposed action in this document.

The DEIS identified 121 acres of old-growth within four units; the FEIS identified 157 acres of old-growth within
five units.
2
A National Forest System road is a forest road other than a road which has been authorized by a legally
documented right-of-way held by a State, county or other local public road authority.
3
An unauthorized road is a road that is not a forest road or a temporary road and that is not included in a forest
transportation atlas.
4
A route is a road or a trail.

Alternatives
Alternative 1– No Action
Under the no-action alternative, no salvage harvest of lodgepole pine, commercial thinning, seed tree
harvest, prescribed burning, or precommercial thinning would be implemented to accomplish project and
Forest Plan objectives.
Alternative 2 and Alternative 3
Treatments
Alternative 2 and alternative 3 differ by the number of units and total acreages for salvage harvest, and
commercial thinning of ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir stands. There is no difference in treatment acres
between the alternatives for seed tree harvest, prescribed burning and precommercial thinning treatments.
Table S-3 displays the proposed activities for alternative 2 and alternative 3 and clearly shows the
differences associated with each alternative.

Logging Systems
Treatments would generally be accomplished with conventional, ground-based timber harvest equipment
such as rubber-tired skidders, and would be limited to slopes less than 35 percent. Cable logging systems
would be used where slopes are greater than 35 percent.
Trees would be whole tree logged and skidded to central landing areas adjacent to roads where they
would be processed into logs and loaded on trucks for transport to area sawmills. Unmerchantable
material brought to the landing would be piled for chipping or burning. Burning would occur when
weather and ground conditions are suitable to maintain air quality, and burning can be controlled.
Haul Routes
Existing Forest roads, 5 NFS roads, and unauthorized routes would be utilized as haul routes. The total
mileage varies by alternative.
All unauthorized routes currently exist on the ground. Unauthorized routes that are open to public motor
vehicle travel are those that are included in the Forest Plan Interim Roads and Trails Inventory GIS Layer
as displayed on page 53 of the Forest Plan (hereafter referred to as “Page 53”) and that are open pursuant
to the travel restrictions displayed on the 2013 Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest North Map.
Unauthorized routes not shown on page 53 are closed to public motorized travel. Unauthorized routes are
referred to in this analysis as “open unauthorized routes” and “closed unauthorized routes”, consistent
with page 53 of the Forest Plan and 2013 Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest North Map.
Three unauthorized routes, UR8-260 (open), UR8-256 (open) and UR8-253 (open and closed segments)
would be added to the Forest transportation system and would be managed as maintenance level 2 roads
(high clearance vehicles recommended). They are described as “NFS roads proposed” on the summary

A Forest road is wholly or partly within or adjacent to and serving the National Forest System that the Forest
Service determines is necessary for the protection, administration, and utilization of the National Forest System and
the use and development of its resources.

tables and alternative maps. 6 The routes and mileages of other unauthorized routes proposed for use, both
open and closed are provided in the alternative descriptions.
New temporary roads 7 constructed for project use would be decommissioned following project
implementation of authorized activities, consistent with Forest Service policy (FSM 7703.24) which
states that temporary roads are to be decommissioned. Decommissioning is an activity that results in
stabilization and restoration of unneeded roads (or trails) to a more natural state (FSM 7705). The roads
would be closed with a combination of signs and berms to allow for a subsequent travel management
planning effort to consider these routes for addition to the system or more physical methods of
decommissioning such as obliteration.
Road maintenance or reconstruction would occur on the haul route portions of all NFS roads and Forest
roads associated with the project, prior to the commencement of log hauling. The open and closed
unauthorized routes would be reconstructed. Road maintenance typically involves grading, drainage
features such as culverts, ditches, drainage dips, and spot surfacing as needed to meet Best Management
Practices (BMPs). Reconstruction activities would include maintenance items as well as more significant
roadway improvement and/or realignment: embankment and slump repair, curve widening, subgrade
boulder or cobble excavation and removal, and upgrades to accommodate safe timber haul. All applicable
BMPs would be applied to all routes utilized within the project. BMPs would be fully functional from
start to final closeout of the sale.
Alternative 2 – Proposed Action
Alternative 2 is the preferred alternative. The proposed action would achieve project objectives through a
mix of vegetation treatments. A map of the proposed action is available in chapter 2 of this FEIS.
Treatments
• Salvage harvest dead and dying lodgepole pine stands on 1,163 acres.
•

Commercial thin ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir stands, including 157 acres of old growth, on
1,149 acres.

•

Regenerate by seed tree harvest Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine stands on 353 acres.

•

Collectively, the commercial vegetation treatments would provide 16,042 MBF (32,083 CCF)
in sawtimber; and 4,010 MBF (8,021 CCF) in non-saw timber.

•

Prescribe burn mid-elevation lodgepole pine and low-elevation Douglas-fir and ponderosa
pine stands on 1,990 acres.

•

Precommercial thin naturally regenerated, lodgepole pine and Douglas-fir stands on 1,048
acres.

•

Construct 1.3 miles of new National Forest System road.

Forest Service Manual (FSM) 7703.26 provides direction on adding roads to the forest transportation system,
including unauthorized routes. Decisions must be informed by travel analysis; in this case, the Pintler RD conducted
an internal travel analysis in 2008 which is available in the project file. This process is distinguished from
designating routes and areas for motor vehicle use under the travel management regulations, which results in a
MVUM (motor vehicle use map).
7
A temporary road is a road necessary for emergency operations or authorized by contract, permit, lease, or other
written authorization that is not a forest road or a forest trail and that is not included in a forest transportation atlas.

Haul Routes
Under alternative 2, 109.8 miles of road would be used as haul routes. Table S-5 identifies the roads and
associated mileages.
•

A total of 101.3 miles of existing roads, including unauthorized routes, would be utilized as
haul routes. This includes 74.9 miles within the project area boundary (chapter 2, figure 6).
The remaining 26.4 miles are private, county, and NFS road outside the project area (chapter
2, figure 4). Approximately 59 miles would be maintained, and 42 miles would be
reconstructed.

•

Approximately 1.3 miles of new roads would be constructed for haul to access units 36S and
47S. The site conditions require the need for specified road construction, as opposed to
temporary road. These roads would be added to the Forest transportation system as NFS roads.
They would be put into storage (maintenance level 1) for future access following
implementation of the Flint Foothills project. These roads would be closed to all motor vehicle
use during the time they are in storage.

•

Approximately 7.2 miles of new temporary road would be constructed, utilizing construction
measures such as outsloping, drainage dips, and water-spreading ditches. Following
completion of the vegetation projects, the new temporary roads would be decommissioned by

S-8

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

obliteration, in which the road prism is recontoured; cut and fill slopes are restored to natural
grades; and slash, stumps, and woody debris are placed on top of the corridor to effectively
block vehicle travel.
•

Approximately 4.4 miles of open and closed unauthorized routes would be reconstructed and
utilized as haul routes. Following project implementation, these routes would be
decommissioned by various methods.

•

Approximately 1.5 miles of open and closed unauthorized routes would be reconstructed,
utilized as haul routes and added to the Forest transportation system following reconstruction.
They would be managed as maintenance level 2 roads (high clearance vehicles recommended).

Alternative 3
Treatments
Alternative 3 addresses public concerns about new road construction and the associated potential for
increased sediment delivery to streams and invasive plant expansion and establishment; and managing
(commercial thinning) within old-growth stands. This alternative proposes no new NFS or temporary road
construction to access units or to accommodate logging within units. No commercial thinning would
occur within the understory of old-growth stands. As a result, alternative 3 includes 141 fewer acres of
salvage harvest and 483 fewer acres of commercial thinning. All other vegetation treatments remain the
same as alternative 2. Collectively, the commercial vegetation treatments would provide 12,686 MBF
(25,372 CCF) in sawtimber; and 3,172 MBF (6,343 CCF) in non-saw timber.
Alternative 3 eliminates eight units (36S, 47S, 72S, 48C, 56C, 57C, 68C, and 71C) requiring new
temporary road construction for access to the unit, thereby eliminating the need for new temporary road
construction. Five units (52S, 73S, 12C, 23C, and 80C) utilize open and closed unauthorized routes to and
within the unit to accommodate logging; no new temporary roads would be constructed. Instead, longer
skidding distances, which average 1,425 feet, would be utilized to log the unit with ground-based
systems.
In addition, four units are reduced in size (23C, 25C, 55C, and 6C) by a total of 121 acres to eliminate
commercial understory thinning of old-growth stands under alternative 3. A map displaying the location
of activities proposed for alternative 3 is available in chapter 2.

Haul Routes
Under alternative 3, 85.3 miles road would be utilized as haul routes. No new roads would be constructed.
Table S-7 identifies the roads and associated mileages. Two open and closed unauthorized routes would
be added to the Forest transportation system. Other unauthorized routes proposed for use would be
reconstructed then decommissioned following project implementation.
•

A total of 85.3 miles of existing roads, including unauthorized routes, would be utilized as
haul routes. This includes 70.8 miles within the project area boundary. The remaining 14.5
miles are private, county, and NFS road outside the project area. Approximately 47 miles
would be maintained, and 38 miles would be reconstructed.

•

Approximately 2.3 miles of open and closed unauthorized routes would be reconstructed and
utilized as haul routes. Following project implementation, these routes would be
decommissioned by various methods.

S-10

•

Approximately 1.5 miles of open and closed unauthorized routes would be reconstructed,
utilized as haul routes and added to the Forest transportation system. They would be managed
as maintenance level 2 roads (high clearance vehicles recommended).

Project Design Features and Mitigation Measures
The Forest Service developed project design features and mitigation measures that are part of the action
alternatives. Project design features and mitigation measures are incorporated as integral parts of
alternatives 2 and 3, and are nondiscretionary once approved in a decision. They are based upon standard
practices and operating procedures that have been employed in similar circumstances and conditions. The
line officer and Forest specialists would review project design features and mitigation measures that
would be applied through a timber sale contract, prior to contract advertisement.

Decision Framework
The Forest Supervisor of the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest is the responsible official for this
project, and will decide whether to implement the proposed action, one of the other alternatives (including
the no- action alternative), subsets of an alternative, or combination of alternatives that would best meet
the purpose and need.
The Forest Supervisor will determine that the selected alternative complies with relevant management
direction and existing policies, programs and plans, whether risks to people and the environment are
properly mitigated and whether project-specific monitoring measures are necessary.

S-11

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Public Involvement
Initial scoping for the Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Project began in July 2010, when the Forest
solicited public comment on a proposal to use salvage logging, commercial and precommercial thinning,
and prescribed burning to harvest timber and restore resiliency on about 5,600 acres. The proposal was to
analyze the effects of the proposed action and any alternatives in an environmental assessment to
determine if there would be significant effects. The Forest received seven response letters in the initial
round of scoping.
We decided to prepare an environmental impact statement, and initiated the second round of scoping in
June 2011. A Notice of Intent to Publish an Environmental Impact Statement was published in the
Federal Register on June 2, 2011 asking for public comment on the proposal from June 2 to July 5, 2011.
In addition, as part of the public involvement process, the Forest mailed a scoping letter to interested
parties on June 7, 2011. The Forest received eight response letters from the second round of scoping, two
of which were duplicates from initial scoping. Several issues and concerns were raised about the project
and resulted in refinement of the proposal.
A notification was published in the Montana Standard on October 16, 2012, on the upcoming availability
of the DEIS and comment period. The 45-day comment period began the day after the Notice of
Availability of the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) was published in the Federal Register
on October 19, 2012. The 45-day comment period closed on December 3, 2012. Letters or e-mails were
sent to 24 individuals and agencies who had requested notification of availability of the DEIS on the
Forest’s website, or had requested a CD of the DEIS. The original comments (e-mails and letters) that
were received during the comment period are filed in the project record. The comments and agency
responses are included in Appendix G of the FEIS.
Many comments on the DEIS were addressed in the analysis (FEIS, appendices B and G). Others were
previously decided by law or regulations, the Forest Plan, or were not related to the purpose and need of
the project.
The Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Project has appeared on the NEPA Schedule of Proposed
Actions (SOPA) since June 1, 2011. The quarterly SOPA provides information about ongoing and
planned project proposals. This report is available on the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest website.
As this project implements a land management plan and is not authorized under the HFRA it is subject to
subparts A and B of 36CFR 218 and therefore subject to the objection process. The June 2015 FEIS and
Draft Record of Decision were mailed to all people and organizations that commented during any
designated opportunity for public comment. A legal notice of opportunity to object was published on June
22, 2015 in the Montana Standard, the Forest’s newspaper of record. Two objections were received
during the objection filing period, one from the Alliance for the Wild Rockies, and one from Native
Ecosystems Council. Objection content and Forest Service responses to objections are available in the
project file and on the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest website. Further detail regarding Forest
Service responses to and attempts to resolve the objections will be documented in the Record of Decision.

Influence of Scoping Comments on Alternative Development
The responsible official and the interdisciplinary team (IDT) reviewed all public comments submitted
during both scoping periods to determine how they would be considered in the analysis. Several
comments requested that alternatives be developed in response to expressed resource concerns.
Comments about road construction and old growth were identified by the responsible official and the IDT
as issues to formulate an alternative to the proposed action. Other comments were used to refine the
proposed action while still meeting the purpose and need for the project. Many comments were addressed
S-12

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

in the analysis; and still others were previously decided by law or regulations, the Forest Plan, or were not
related to the purpose and need of the project. All scoping comments and the Forest’s responses are in
Appendix B of this document. Original letters are available in the project file. Several suggestions for
alternatives to be considered were submitted during public comment.
The following discussion describes how comments influenced the development of alternatives.

Issues Used to Formulate an Alternative
Comments about road construction and old growth were used to develop an alternative to the proposed
action.
Road Construction
Several scoping comments expressed concerns that road construction and subsequent use could negatively
affect water quality through sediment delivery to streams, or would create ideal conditions for weed
establishment. The commenters encouraged minimizing or eliminating construction of both temporary
and NFS roads. To address this concern, alternative 3 was developed to exclude new road construction.
Old Growth
Several scoping comments identified concerns about managing and retaining old growth in the project
area, specifically requesting a 20-25 percent retention level of old growth for wildlife. Alternative 3 was
developed to address the concerns for managing and retaining old growth in the Flint Foothills area.
Alternative 3 retains all existing old growth in a multi-storied condition; no understory thinning would
occur in old-growth stands. This is in contrast to the proposed action, which thins the understory of 157
acres in existing old growth, retaining the old growth in a single-storied stand condition. Both action
alternatives retain all of the existing old-growth trees and therefore, the old growth habitat as defined by
Green et al. (1992, errata corrected 2005, 2007, 2008, 2011) within the project area. The difference is a
change in old growth structure in that alternative 2 removes the majority of the understory trees from the
mature old-growth overstory whereas alternative 3 leaves the younger understory trees as well as the oldgrowth overstory.
Providing old growth at a prescribed level (e.g. the suggested 20-25 percent recommendation) can be
done if old growth exists at that level in the project area. Forest Plan Standard 1 for Vegetation states:
“Mechanical vegetation treatments and prescribed fire in old-growth stands (see FP Glossary) do not
reduce the age and number of large trees and basal area below the ‘minimum criteria’ required for Eastern
Montana old growth in Green et al. table 3. Removing hazardous fuels within old-growth stands is
allowed if conducted in a manner that meets this requirement. This requirement does not apply to hazard
tree removal and other public safety needs (Forest Plan, p. 44)”.

Comments Addressed through Project Design
Whitebark Pine
Include an alternative that excludes burning in the presence of whitebark pine regeneration: One
scoping comment requested an alternative that excludes burning in the presence of whitebark pine
regeneration, and that ‘day-lighting’ of seedlings and saplings be an alternative method to the use of
prescribed fire. ‘Day-lighting’ is directional falling of competing conifer trees around whitebark pine; in
essence, thinning around whitebark pine trees. Whitebark pine is known to occur in three proposed midelevation prescribed burn units (Units 3B, 4B and 5B), based on formal surveys.

S-13

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Specific design criteria were added to exclude prescribed burning in the presence of whitebark pine
regeneration. A project design feature was created for hand felling of conifers prior to prescribed fire
activities to facilitate underburning; areas with concentrations of whitebark pine would be avoided.
Additionally, ignition patterns would avoid the use of fire directly in areas where whitebark pine occurs in
groups or clumps. This would provide a means of protecting live, mature trees and established whitebark
pine regeneration, and would create favorable ecological conditions for regeneration on areas of existing
whitebark pine, without the effects of fire. While there is potential for individual whitebark pine trees to
be killed with prescribed burning treatments, the resulting canopy openings would be conducive for
seeding by Clark’s nutcrackers.
Provide an alternative that eliminates units that have invasive plant species present on roads within
units from fire management proposals: All proposed treatment units and access routes were surveyed in
2011 for presence of invasive plants. Based on these surveys, there are no prescribed burn units that have
invasive plants present along roads within the units.
Units 2B and 7B have a moderate amount of spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa) populations
(estimated 4-7 acres). Three other units have small infestations (0.01 acre or less): Unit 5B has a small
infestation of yellow toadflax (Linaria vulgaris) adjacent to NFS Road 5167, which serves as the unit
boundary; and units 6B and 8B have small (0.01 acre) infestations of spotted knapweed along NFS roads
78493 and 8615, respectively, which serve as the unit boundaries. A project design feature was created to
aggressively treat prescribed burn units containing invasive plant species following prescribed fire
activities. The invasive plants would be controlled following procedures in the Noxious Weed Control
Program Record of Decision for the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest (USDA Forest Service 2002,
Appendix H). A map of the 2011 survey findings of all of the units and access roads is found in the
Invasive Plant section, figure 28.
Provide an alternative that includes land management standards that will prevent new invasive
plant species infestations by addressing the causes of weed infestation: Invasive plant design criteria
and mitigation measures have been incorporated into the action alternatives to ensure an overall low risk
of invasive plant establishment and spread from proposed activities. These practices comply with existing
law, Executive Order, and Forest Service policy as discussed in the Invasive Plants section of this FEIS.
The alternatives apply the policies and procedures in a site-specific manner to minimize the likelihood of
invasive plant establishment and spread during project implementation.

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Chapter 1. Purpose of and Need for Action
Introduction
The Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest (BDNF), Pintler Ranger District, is proposing the Flint
Foothills Vegetation Management Project to address the vegetation conditions in the project area resulting
from current insect and disease infestation, or at risk from future infestations. Proposed activities include
salvage harvest, commercial thinning, seed tree harvest, and precommercial thinning and prescribed
burning.
The Forest Service has prepared this final environmental impact statement (FEIS) in compliance with the
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and other relevant Federal and State laws and regulations 8.
This environmental impact statement discloses the direct, indirect, and cumulative environmental impacts
that would result from the proposed action and alternatives. Additional documentation is provided in the
project file, located at the Pintler Ranger District, 88 Business Loop, Philipsburg, Montana, 59858.

Project Area
The Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Project area encompasses 44,522 acres located on the north
end of the Flint Range in the Clark Fork Flint Landscape (Forest Plan p. 108 -109), about 6 miles
southeast of Drummond, Montana (figure 1). Eighty-three percent of the area (37,010 acres) is managed
by the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest; the remainder is private land (inholdings) (7,512 acres).
Proposed activities for the project follow direction for the Flint Foothills and Flint Uplands Management
Areas (MAs) as described in the 2009 Beaverhead-Deerlodge Forest Plan (Forest Plan, pp. 108-109; 112115). The Flint Foothills MA comprises 85 percent of the project area and is managed for timber
production, livestock grazing and dispersed recreation. The Flint Uplands MA comprises the remaining
15 percent. This area is managed for a mix of semi-primitive motorized and nonmotorized recreation and
secure high elevation wildlife habitat. In this management area, “…timber harvest is permitted, but other
resource objectives are primary” (Forest Plan, p. 42).
The project area lies within the Clark Fork River-Gold Creek and the Lower Flint Creek watersheds.
Lands in the watersheds include National Forest System lands, private lands and lands managed by other
agencies (state of Montana, and the United States Department of the Interior (USDI) Bureau of Land
Management). Figure 2 shows the spatial relationships between the watersheds, the Clark Fork Flint
Landscape, the Flint Foothills and Flint Uplands MA’s, the Flint Foothills project area, and all other
ownerships.
The project area includes portions of both Powell and Granite Counties. The project area is bounded by
private and State-owned lands along the Flint Creek Valley to the west, the Clark Fork River Valley to the
north, the Deer Lodge Valley to the east, and the Flint Creek Range to the south. Elevations range from
approximately 4,430-9,250 feet. The legal description of lands in the project area follows: T. 8 N., R. 10
W., sec 6; T. 8 N., R. 11 W., sec 1 -11, 15-21, 29, 30; T. 8 N., R. 12 W., sec 1 -19, 21 -26; T. 8 N., R. 13
W., sec 1-3, 10 – 14, 24; T. 9 N., R. 10 W., sec 31; T. 9 N., R 11 W., sec 17 -21, 26 – 36; T. 9 N., R. 12
W., sec 10 – 16, 19 – 36; T. 9 N., R. 13 W., sec 25, 36.

This project tiers to the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan Final
Environmental Impact Statement (BDNF 2009) and the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest Noxious Weed
Control Final Environmental Impact Statement (BDNF 2002).

Background
Existing Vegetation Conditions in the Project Area
The Flint Foothills area is part of a larger mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) epidemic
occurring across the majority of the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest and on other forests in the
Northern Region. Mountain pine beetle has been active in the Flint Foothills area since about 2000,
reaching epidemic proportions beginning in 2007. This has resulted in extensive areas of dead and dying
lodgepole pine, and the mortality of more individually scattered ponderosa pine and whitebark pine. A
cold event in 2010, with sustained temperatures below zero degrees Fahrenheit, caused a reduction in
beetle population in many areas on the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest, and may have led to the
decline in tree mortality; however, suitable pine host-trees remained in the Flint Foothills analysis area,
which likely led to the increase in tree mortality with beetle activity in 2011. Within the Flint Foothills
project area on National Forest System (NFS) lands, it is estimated that all (100 percent) of the pine
stands 5 inches diameter breast height (dbh) and larger have been affected by mountain pine beetle. Beetle
infestations are a regular force of natural change in forested ecosystems; however, several current
outbreaks occurring simultaneously across western North America are the largest and most severe in
recorded history (Bentz 2008).
Fire frequency determines the vegetation successional stage and fuel conditions; the shape and size of
past fires play a role in fuel connectivity and landscape heterogeneity or homogeneity (Arno et al. 2000,
Turner et al. 1998). Forest structure and composition in the Flint Foothills Project area have been most
significantly altered due to the lack of fire disturbance. The mid- to high-elevation forests are currently
homogeneous, mature stands lacking stand-age diversity. Past fire disturbances suggest a more
heterogeneous landscape. Blister rust (Cronartium ribicola) and mountain pine beetle have accelerated
succession to subalpine fir by killing mature whitebark pine. Mountain pine beetle has killed the majority
of lodgepole pine in the project area. Additionally, mortality of very large ponderosa pine from mountain
pine beetles has been noted in the project area through stand exams. Coupled with the lack of fire, these
disturbances have caused a major shift in landscape composition and structure from pine to fir and spruce
(Keane 2000).
The disruption of the natural fire intervals of the past have resulted in higher stand densities, multilayered stands of mostly one species, Douglas-fir. In contrast to the open-grown, larger-diameter stands of
Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine of the early 1900s, current Douglas-fir stands in the project area are
continuous, mid-successional, densely stocked and establishing into dry grassland and quaking aspen
communities. The increase in extent and continuity of this vegetation type has effectively reduced
landscape vegetation diversity, associated biodiversity, and put unique habitat types in the Flint Foothills
Project area (most importantly aspen and seral ponderosa pine communities) at risk of irreversible habitat
conversion.
Surveys show that mortality of individual Douglas-fir trees is occurring in the project area due to western
spruce budworm (Choristoneura occidentalis). The recent drought conditions and dense stand conditions
cause the late-successional stands of Douglas-fir to be susceptible to western spruce budworm because
these stands are often stressed by competition. Areas of higher mortality due to western spruce budworm
in contiguous stands of Douglas-fir are evident in the Gird Creek to Douglas Creek areas within the
project area (Figure 3).

12

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

An increase in individual numbers of Douglas-fir trees killed by Douglas-fir bark beetle (Dendroctonus
pseudotsugae) has been noted in the Dunkleberg Ridge; Jackson Park and Blum Creek areas. An increase
of mortality due to Douglas-fir bark beetle may be attributed to the heavy and repeated defoliation from
western spruce budworm, which may lead to increases in Douglas-fir bark beetle activity.

Purpose and Need for Action
The purpose and need of the Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Project 9 is to contribute to
achievement of the following Forest Plan goals and objectives:
1. Forest Plan Timber Management Goals:
a. Lands Suitable for Timber Production: Manage lands suitable for timber production for the
growth and yield of sawtimber, crop trees, pulpwood, and other forest products, including
salvage harvest.
b. Product Utilization: Forest products would be used to provide economic benefits where
project objectives, forest plan objectives, and forest plan standards can be met.
2. Forest Plan Timber Management Objectives on Lands Suitable for Timber Production:

9

Referred to from this point forward as the Flint Foothills Project
13

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

a. Bring 10 percent of lands suitable for timber production into a managed condition. 10
b. Manage those stands already in a managed condition to maintain long-term sustained yield.
3. Forest Plan Vegetation Management Objectives:
a. Reduce forest density in the large size classes of dry forest communities and some lodgepole
pine communities to maintain or improve resilient forest conditions.
b. Douglas-fir Type: Increase the number of acres in the 0 to 5 inch dbh class on approximately
20,000 acres.
c. Lodgepole Pine Type: Increase the number of acres in the 0 to 5 inch dbh class by
approximately 74,000 acres.
All project treatment units have been proposed on lands classified as “Suitable for Timber Production”
using the Forest Plan’s Timber Harvest Classification Protocol (Forest Plan, p. 42), which includes both
coarse scale GIS modeling and site-specific on the ground reconnaissance. The following table crosswalks proposed treatments with the corresponding Forest Plan goal/objectives:

*Includes 157 acres of old growth; this change is addressed in the subsequent Proposed Action section as well as the Vegetation
section 11.

Proposed Action
The proposed action would achieve project objectives through a mix of vegetation treatments as outlined
in this section. Table 2 displays the treatment types by acres, the number of units and the range of unit
sizes. Table 3 displays the roads associated with the haul routes, including construction of 1.3 miles of
new National Forest System road 12, and 7.2 miles of new temporary road 13.
In addition, approximately 1 mile of open and closed unauthorized routes (UR) 1415 would be added to the
forest transportation system 16. Detailed descriptions are provided in the alternatives section in chapter 2.
The proposed action would:
o

Salvage harvest dead and dying lodgepole pine stands on 1,163 acres.

o

Commercial thin ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir stands to reduce stand densities
including 157 acres of old growth, on 1,149 acres (further field reviews following
publication of the DEIS identified 36 acres of old growth in unit 71C; this is described in
detail in the Vegetation section).

o

Regenerate by seed tree harvest Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine stands on 353 acres.

o

Provide 16,042 MBF (32,083 CCF) in sawtimber; and 4,010 MBF (8,021 CCF) in
nonsaw timber.

The proposed action in the DEIS identified 121 acres of old growth in four commercial thin trealtment units.
Additional field review identified an additional 36 acres of old-growth in unit 71C for a total of 157 acres.

A National Forest System road is a forest road other than a road which has been authorized by a legally
documented right-of-way held by a State, county or other local public road authority.
13
A temporary road is a road necessary for emergency operations or authorized by contract, permit, lease, or other
written authorization that is not a forest road or a forest trail and that is not included in a forest transportation atlas.
14
An unauthorized road is a road that is not a forest road or a temporary road and that is not included in a forest
transportation atlas.
15
A route is a road or trail.
16
Forest Service Manual (FSM) 7703.26 provides direction on adding roads to the forest transportation system,
including unauthorized routes. Decisions must be informed by travel analysis. The Pintler Ranger District completed
a preliminary transportation (travel) analysis in 2008, which included the Flint Foothills project area (USDA Forest
Service 2008). This analysis assessed inventoried routes within the project area based on resource risks and values.
Recommended changes were site specific, route by route, and included: adding routes to the Forest transportation
system, decommissioning unneeded routes, closing and storing roads for future use, converting roads to trails, and
mitigating resource concerns through road maintenance and reconstruction. The recommendations pertinent to the
Flint Foothills Project are incorporated into this analysis. The documentation of the preliminary travel analysis is on
file at the Pintler Ranger District office. This process is distinguished from designating routes and areas for motor
vehicle use under the travel management regulations, which results in a MVUM (motor vehicle use map).

o

Prescribe burn mid-elevation lodgepole pine and low-elevation Douglas-fir and
ponderosa pine stands on 1,990 acres.

o

Precommercial thin naturally regenerated lodgepole pine and Douglas-fir stands to reduce
stand densities on 1,048 acres.

o

Construct 1.3 miles of new National Forest System road.

o

Construct 7.2 miles of new temporary road. Following project implementation the
temporary roads would be decommissioned by obliteration.

o

Reconstruct approximately 4.4 miles of open and closed unauthorized routes to use as
haul routes. Following project implementation, these routes would be decommissioned by
various methods.

o

Add 2.8 miles of road (1.3 miles of new National Forest System road and 1.5 miles of
open and closed unauthorized routes) to the Forest transportation system.

For salvage harvest, commercial thin and seed tree treatments, approximately 1.3 miles of new
National Forest System road construction and an estimated 11.6 miles of temporary roads would be
needed to access and harvest the units. Of the temporary road mileage, about 7.2 miles of newly
constructed temporary roads would be needed, and 4.4 miles of open and closed unauthorized routes (UR)
would be utilized. Three unauthorized routes, totaling 1.5 miles, UR 8-260 (0.4 miles), UR8-256 (0.5
miles), and UR 8-253(0.6 miles) are proposed to be added to the transportation system.
16

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Salvage harvest, commercial thinning and seed tree treatments would be accomplished primarily using
conventional, ground-based timber harvest equipment such as rubber-tired skidders, and would be limited
to slopes less than 35 percent. Approximately 110 acres of commercial harvest in eight units is proposed
on slopes greater than 35 percent. Cable logging systems would be used in these areas.
Fifteen proposed units—12 lodgepole pine salvage and 3 Douglas-fir/ponderosa pine seed tree units—
exceed 40 acres in size, ranging from 41 to 139 acres. Forest Plan timber standard 2 (Forest Plan, p. 39)
allows openings created by one regeneration unit to exceed 40 acres on lands suitable for timber
production when a natural event created an undesirable opening. This requires public notification and
Regional Forester approval.
Prescribed burning treatments would use aerial ignition for mid-elevation burns; and hand lighting for
both mid- and low-elevation and understory burns. Hand falling or slashing of trees may occur to
facilitate burning objectives. Burning would occur when weather and ground conditions are suitable to
maintain air quality and burning can be controlled. Ignitions may occur over multiple years.
In precommercial thin treatment units, ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir and lodgepole pine (in order of
preference) would be retained at 300 to 500 trees per acre to enhance species diversity, improving the
long-term resiliency of these stands. Cut trees would be lopped and scattered.

Changes to the Proposed Action
Changes since Publishing the DEIS
Field reviews identified 36 acres of old-growth in proposed commercial thin unit 71C, bringing the total
old-growth acres thinned to 157 acres in 5 units.
Changes since Publishing the Notice of Intent
Field reviews of the proposed treatment units were completed by the interdisciplinary team members
subsequent to publishing the Notice of Intent (NOI) in June 2011 and mailing the June 7, 2011 scoping
letter. These reviews resulted in updates to the proposed action, including changes in treatment
prescriptions, unit boundary changes, and the addition and deletion of units. Many of the originally
proposed precommercial thin units were identified as previously thinned, and therefore, dropped from the
list of units proposed for treatment. Other units were identified for density reduction, and therefore, added
to the list of units proposed for treatment. Overall, the net changes resulted in the addition of 92 acres of
commercial treatments, and a reduction of 98 acres of precommercial thinning, for a net change of 6
fewer acres in the updated FEIS proposed action.
Scoping (June 2011) identified approximately 10 miles of temporary road construction and 72 miles of
National Forest System roads needed for access and hauling. Haul route needs were fine-tuned in the
updated proposed action presented in the FEIS (table 4). A distinction is made between NFS roads and
open and closed unauthorized routes. One segment of new temporary road construction in the June 2011
scoping was determined to need construction specifications due to steep slopes and is now proposed as
new National Forest System road construction (1.3 miles).
Table 4 displays the changes in acreages and haul route mileages between the proposed action presented
in June 2011, and the updated proposed action in this document. Unit-specific changes from the June
2011 proposed action are described in Appendix A.

Decision Framework
The Forest Supervisor of the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest is the responsible official for this
project, and will decide whether to implement the proposed action or one of the other alternatives
(including the no action), subsets of an alternative, or combination of alternatives that would best meet the
purpose and need.
The Forest Supervisor will determine that the selected alternative complies with relevant management
direction and existing policies, programs and plans, whether risks to people and the environment are
properly mitigated and whether project-specific monitoring measures are necessary.

Public Involvement
Initial scoping for the Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Project began in July 2010, when the Forest
solicited public comment on a proposal to use salvage logging, commercial and precommercial thinning,
and prescribed burning to harvest timber and restore resiliency on about 5,600 acres. The proposal was to
analyze the effects of the proposed action and any alternatives in an environmental assessment to
determine if there would be significant effects. The Forest received seven response letters in the initial
round of scoping.
Based on the controversial nature of the response letters, we decided to prepare an environmental impact
statement, and initiated the second round of scoping in June 2011. A Notice of Intent to Publish an
Environmental Impact Statement was published in the Federal Register on June 2, 2011 asking for public
comment on the proposal from June 2 to July 5, 2011. In addition, as part of the public involvement
process, the Forest mailed a scoping letter to interested parties on June 7, 2011. The Forest received eight
response letters from the second round of scoping, two of which were duplicates from initial scoping.
Several issues and concerns were raised about the project and resulted in refinement of the proposal.

18

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

A notification was published in the Montana Standard on October 16, 2012, on the upcoming availability
of the DEIS and comment period. The 45-day comment period began the day after the Notice of
Availability of the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) was published in the Federal Register
on October 19, 2012. The 45-day comment period closed on December 3, 2012. Letters or e-mails were
sent to 24 individuals and agencies who had requested notification of availability of the DEIS on the
Forest’s website, or had requested a CD of the DEIS. The original comments (e-mails and letters) that
were received during the comment period are filed in the project record. The comments and agency
responses are included in Appendix G of the FEIS.
Many comments on the DEIS were addressed in the analysis (FEIS, appendices B and G). Others were
previously decided by law or regulations, the Forest Plan, or were not related to the purpose and need of
the project.
The Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Project has appeared on the NEPA Schedule of Proposed
Actions (SOPA) since June 1, 2011 and project documents have been posted on the project website since
scoping began: http://www.fs.fed.us/nepa/nepa_project_exp.php?project=33238
As this project implements a land management plan and is not authorized under the HFRA it is subject to
subparts A and B of 36CFR 218 and therefore subject to the objection process. The June 2015 FEIS and
Draft Record of Decision were mailed to all people and organizations that commented during any
designated opportunity for public comment. A legal notice of opportunity to object was published on June
22, 2015 in the Montana Standard, the Forest’s newspaper of record. Two objections were received
during the objection filing period, one from the Alliance for the Wild Rockies, and one from Native
Ecosystems Council. Objection content and Forest Service responses to objections are available in the
project file and on the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest website. Further detail regarding Forest
Service responses to and attempts to resolve the objections will be documented in the Record of Decision.

Influence of Scoping Comments on Alternative Development
The responsible official and the interdisciplinary team (IDT) reviewed all public comments submitted
during both scoping periods to determine how they would be considered in the analysis. Several
comments requested alternatives be developed in response to expressed resource concerns. Comments on
road construction and old growth were identified by the responsible official and the IDT as issues to use
to formulate an alternative to the proposed action. Other comments were used to refine the proposed
action while still meeting the purpose and need for the project. Many comments were addressed in the
analysis; and still others were previously decided by law or regulations, the Forest Plan, or were not
related to the purpose and need of the project (scoping comments and responses are in Appendix B).
Original letters are available in the project file located at the Pintler Ranger District. Several suggestions
for alternatives to be considered were submitted during public comment.

Issues Used to Formulate an Alternative
Comments on road construction and old growth identified issues used to develop an alternative to the
proposed action.
Road Construction
Several scoping comments expressed concerns that road construction and subsequent use could negatively
affect water quality through sediment delivery to streams, or would create ideal conditions for weed
establishment. The commenters encouraged minimizing or eliminating construction of both temporary
and NFS roads. To address this concern, alternative 3 was developed to exclude new road construction.

19

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

The action alternatives differ by the miles of specified road construction, and the miles of new temporary
road construction.
Old Growth
Several scoping comments identified concerns about managing and retaining old growth in the project
area, specifically requesting a 20-25 percent retention level of old growth for wildlife. Alternative 3 was
developed to address the concerns for managing and retaining old growth in the Flint Foothills area.
Alternative 3 retains all existing old growth in a multi-storied condition; no understory thinning would
occur in old-growth stands. This is in contrast to the proposed action, which thins the understory of 157
acres in existing old growth, retaining the old growth in a single-storied stand condition. Both action
alternatives retain all of the existing old-growth acres within the project area.
Providing old growth at a prescribed level (e.g. the suggested 20-25 percent recommendation) can be
done if old growth exists at that level in the project area. Forest Plan Standard 1 for Vegetation states,
“Mechanical vegetation treatments and prescribed fire in old-growth stands (see Forest Plan Glossary) do
not reduce the age and number of large trees and basal area below the ‘minimum criteria’ required for
Eastern Montana old growth in Green et al, table 3. Removing hazardous fuels within old-growth stands
is allowed if conducted in a manner that meets this requirement. This requirement does not apply to
hazard tree removal and other public safety needs” (Forest Plan, p. 44).

Comments Addressed through Project Design
Whitebark Pine
Include an alternative that excludes burning in the presence of whitebark pine regeneration: One
scoping comment requested an alternative that excludes burning in the presence of whitebark pine
regeneration, and that ‘day-lighting’ of seedlings and saplings be an alternative method to the use of
prescribed fire. ‘Day-lighting’ is directional falling of competing conifer trees around whitebark pine; in
essence, thinning around whitebark pine trees. Whitebark pine is known to occur in three proposed midelevation units (Units 3B. 4B and 5B), based on formal surveys.
Specific design criteria were added to exclude prescribed burning in the presence of whitebark pine
regeneration. A project design feature was created for hand felling of conifers prior to prescribed fire
activities to facilitate underburning; areas with concentrations of whitebark pine would be avoided.
Additionally, ignition patterns would avoid the use of fire directly in areas where whitebark pine occurs in
groups or clumps. This would provide a means of protecting both live mature trees and established
whitebark pine regeneration, and would create favorable ecological conditions for regeneration on
extensive areas of existing whitebark pine, without the effects of fire. While there is potential for
individual whitebark pine trees to be killed with prescribed burning treatments, the resulting canopy
openings would be conducive for seeding by Clarks nutcrackers.
Spread of Invasive Plants
Provide an alternative that eliminates units that have invasive plant species present on roads within
units from fire management proposals: All proposed treatment units and access routes were surveyed in

20

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

2011 for presence of invasive plants 17. Based on these surveys, there are no prescribed burn units that
have invasive plants present along roads within the units.
Units 2B and 7B have a moderate amount of spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa) populations
(estimated 4-7 acres). Three other units have small infestations (0.01 acre or less): Unit 5B has a small
infestation of yellow toadflax (Linaria vulgaris) adjacent to NFS Road 5167, which serves as the unit
boundary; and units 6B and 8B have small (0.01acre) infestations of spotted knapweed along NFS roads
78493 and 8615, respectively, which serve as the unit boundaries. A project design feature was created to
aggressively treat prescribed burn units containing invasive plant species following prescribed fire
activities. The invasive plants would be controlled following procedures in the Noxious Weed Control
Program Record of Decision for the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest (USDA Forest Service 2002,
Appendix H). A map of the 2011 survey findings of all of the units and access roads is found in the
Invasive Plant section.
Provide an alternative that includes land management standards that will prevent new invasive
plant species infestations by addressing the causes of weed infestation: Invasive plant design criteria
and mitigation measures have been incorporated into the alternatives to ensure an overall low risk of
invasive plant establishment and spread from proposed actions. These practices comply with existing law,
Executive Order, and Forest Service policy as discussed in the Invasive Plants section of this EIS. The
alternatives apply the policies and procedures in a site-specific manner to minimize the likelihood of
invasive plant establishment and spread during project implementation.

Changes to the EIS since the Draft
Several clarifications and edits were made to the EIS since the release of the Draft in October 2012.
Additional information about Knutson Vandenberg projects, old-growth units, snag inventory data, and
Mountain pine beetle mortality has been included. Some tables were modified to add Forest Plan goals
and objectives or to clarify area closures. Project design features have been modified, and we added a
project design feature that informs the public about upcoming prescribed burning. Some resource sections
were updated to respond to public comment. The Forest Service response to comments on the DEIS were
added to Volume 2 – Appendix G.
Specific changes made to this document since publishing the Flint Foothills Project Draft Environmental
Impact Statement are listed at the beginning of chapters 2 and 3.

To simplify terminology for this statement, all noxious weed and invasive plant species will collectively be called
invasive plants. This will include all the species listed on the Federal and Montana Noxious Weed lists as well as
cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) and musk thistle (Carduus nutans).

Replaced the number of acres of total pine with dead or dying trees from 19,199 to 17,938

•

The proposed action in the DEIS identified 121 acres of old growth in four commercial thin
treatment units. Further field review identified an additional 36 acres of old growth in unit
71C, making 157 acres of old growth in five units tracked through the proposed action.

•

Some changes were made to the wildlife, transportation, vegetation, hydrology and aquatic
resources project design features.

•

We added a project design feature to notify the public, Sherriff’s Office and Department of
Natural Resources, by press releases or telephone, about any upcoming prescribed burning
activities.

•

Tables in alternatives 2 and 3 were adjusted to clarify travel area closures.

•

Forest Plan goals and objectives for the purpose and need were added to the comparison table.

•

Information about Knutson Vandenberg funding for projects was added.

Introduction
This chapter describes and compares the alternatives considered for the Flint Foothills Vegetation
Management Project. It includes a description of each alternative (including the no action), and presents
the alternatives in comparative form, sharply defining the differences between each alternative and
providing a clear basis for choice by the decision maker and the public. Some of the information used to
compare the alternatives is based on the issues (i.e., acres of thinning old-growth understories versus not
thinning old-growth understories) and some of the information is based on the environmental, social and
economic effects of implementing each alternative (i.e., the effect to old-growth stands in the short and
long term, with and without commercial thinning.).

Alternatives Considered in Detail
The Forest Service developed three alternatives, including the no action (alternative 1), the proposed
action (alternative 2), and alternative 3, developed in response to road construction and old growth issues
raised during scoping by the public.

Alternative 1 – No Action
Under the no-action alternative, no salvage harvest of lodgepole pine, commercial thinning, seed tree
harvest, prescribed burning, or precommercial thinning would be implemented to accomplish project and
Forest Plan objectives.

22

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Alternative 2 – Proposed Action, and Alternative 3
Vegetation Treatments Common to the Action Alternatives
Alternatives 2 and 3 differ by the number of units and total acreages for salvage harvest, and commercial
thinning of ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir stands.
There is no difference in treatment acres between the alternatives for seed tree harvest, prescribed burning
and precommercial thinning treatments.

Salvage Harvest of Lodgepole Pine Stands
Dead and dying lodgepole pine (from 4 inches up to 20 inches dbh) would be salvaged harvest. All other
species would be retained. Most of the lodgepole pine that is currently alive is expected to be dead or
dying by the time the project is implemented. All trees (alive or dead) greater than 20 inches dbh would
be retained in all units to meet Forest Plan snag retention standards (Forest Plan, p. 48). Additional snag
and live tree retention information to meet snag standards is provided in the Vegetation Section
Commercial Thinning of Ponderosa Pine and Douglas-fir Stands
Ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir stands would be commercially thinned. The large-diameter ponderosa
pine trees are infested by western and mountain pine beetle; and the Douglas-fir trees are affected by
Douglas-fir bark beetles. Not all of these stands are pure ponderosa pine/Douglas-fir type and contain a
component of lodgepole pine infected with mountain pine beetle, which would also be harvested. Light
underburning after commercial thinning would target understory trees left after harvest to lower stand
densities. All trees (alive or dead) greater than 20 inches dbh would be retained in all units to meet Forest
Plan snag retention standards (Forest Plan, p. 48). Additional snag and live tree retention information to
meet snag standards is provided in the Vegetation Section.
Seed Tree Harvest
A seed-tree harvest would be implemented in Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine stands to create an early
seral component of each species, leaving large diameter ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir as seed trees.
Five to 15 trees per acre across the treatment unit would be retained as seed trees. The seed tree harvest
would remove much of the understory; light underburning would further reduce understory trees left after
harvest. Collectively, these actions would reduce stand density, which would lower the hazard for

23

mountain pine beetles on the remaining ponderosa pine. Some stands contain a component of lodgepole
pine infected with mountain pine beetle, which would also be harvested. All trees (alive or dead) greater
than 20 inches dbh would be retained in all units to meet Forest Plan snag retention standards (Forest
Plan, p. 48). Additional snag and live tree retention information to meet snag standards is provided in the
Vegetation Section. Ponderosa pine would be planted in all seed tree units post harvest.
Prescribed Burn of Mid-elevation Lodgepole Pine and Low-elevation Douglas-fir and Ponderosa
Pine Stands
Prescribed fire would be used on mid-elevation lodgepole pine and low-elevation Douglas-fir and
ponderosa pine stands to reduce stand densities and create a mosaic of age classes.
Prescribed burning would use either aerial ignition (for mid-elevation burns) or hand lighting (both midelevation mixed-intensity and understory light-intensity burns). Burning would occur in either the spring
or fall when weather and ground conditions are suitable to maintain air quality, and burning can be
controlled. Ignitions may occur over multiple years.
In low-elevation Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine stands, low-intensity understory burns would occur
across all acres.
In mid-elevation lodgepole pine stands, mixed-intensity fires would be ignited on approximately 40
percent of the unit. Up to 10 percent of each unit would have small-diameter (4 to 12 inches dbh) conifers
cut down. Slash created as a result of these activities would be strategically located to facilitate a mosaic
of mixed-severity burned areas. Ignition patterns would be designed so that the concentrations would burn
with fire carried into the crown of the trees for areas up to 20 acres in size, with the objective of mortality
in 50 percent of the overstory trees within the unit. Fire would not be carried throughout the unit. The
unburned portions of the units would primarily include riparian areas.
The mosaic stand conditions created by the prescribed fire are described in the Desired Condition section
of the Vegetation section of this FEIS.
Precommercial Thinning of Lodgepole Pine and Douglas-fir Stands
Precommercial thinning would treat naturally regenerated, previously harvested stands in 20 units.
Retaining ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir and then lodgepole pine (in order of preference) would enhance
species diversity improving long-term resiliency of these stands. Trees would be thinned to a 9-foot to 16foot spacing (500 to 300 trees per acre).

Logging Systems
Treatments would generally be accomplished with conventional, ground-based timber harvest equipment
such as rubber-tired skidders, and would be limited to slopes less than 35 percent. Cable logging systems
would be used where slopes are greater than 35 percent.
Trees would be whole tree logged and skidded to central landing areas adjacent to roads where they
would be processed into logs and loaded on trucks for transport to area sawmills. Unmerchantable
material brought to the landing would be piled for chipping or burning. Burning would occur when
weather and ground conditions are suitable to maintain air quality, and burning can be controlled.

Haul Routes
Existing Forest roads, 18 National Forest System (NFS) roads and unauthorized routes (UR) would be
utilized as haul routes. The total mileage varies by alternative. Figure 4 displays the common haul routes
that would be used outside of the project area. (The transportation report in the project file provides
details on road access to the project areas.)
All unauthorized routes currently exist on the ground. Unauthorized routes that are open to public motor
vehicle travel are those that are included in the Forest Plan Interim Roads and Trails Inventory GIS Layer
as displayed on page 53 of the Forest Plan (hereafter referred to as “Page 53”) and that are open pursuant
to the travel restrictions displayed on the 2013 Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest North Map.
Unauthorized routes not shown on page 53 are closed to public motorized travel. Unauthorized routes are
referred to in this analysis as “open unauthorized routes” and “closed unauthorized routes”, consistent
with page 53 of the Forest Plan and 2013 Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest North Map.
Three unauthorized routes, UR8-260 (open), UR8-256 (open), and UR8-253 (open and closed segments)
would be added to the Forest transportation system and would be managed as maintenance level 2 roads
(high clearance vehicles recommended). They are designated as “NFS road proposed” on the summary
tables and alternative maps 19. Route UR8-260 accesses private land; all of UR 8-253, including the closed
section, is currently displayed on the 2013 Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest North Map as an open
road as well as UR8-256. The routes and mileages for the other unauthorized routes proposed for use,
both open and closed are provided in the alternative descriptions.
Temporary roads constructed for project use would be decommissioned following project implementation
of authorized activities, consistent with Forest Service policy (FSM 7703.24), which states that temporary
roads are to be decommissioned. Decommissioning is an activity that results in stabilization and
restoration of unneeded roads (or trails) to a more natural state (FSM 7705). The roads would be closed
with a combination of signs and berms to allow for a subsequent travel management planning effort to
consider these routes for addition to the system or more physical methods of decommissioning such as
obliteration. Violations of road closures are subject to fines. The road-specific decommissioning methods
for both alternatives are displayed in table 6.
Road maintenance or reconstruction would occur on the haul route portions of all National Forest System
roads and Forest roads associated with the project, prior to the commencement of log hauling. The open
and closed unauthorized routes would be reconstructed. Road maintenance typically involves grading,
drainage features such as culverts, ditches, drainage dips, and spot surfacing as needed to meet BMPs.
Reconstruction activities would include the maintenance items as well as more significant roadway
improvement and/or realignment: embankment and slump repair, curve widening, subgrade boulder or
cobble excavation and removal, and upgrades to accommodate safe timber haul. All applicable BMPs will
be applied to all routes utilized with the project. BMPs will be fully functional from start to final closeout
of the sale.

A Forest road is wholly or partly within or adjacent to and serving the National Forest System that the Forest
Service determines is necessary for the protection, administration, and utilization of the National Forest System and
the use and development of its resources.
19
Forest Service Manual (FSM) 7703.26 provides direction on adding roads to the forest transportation system,
including unauthorized routes. Decisions must be informed by travel analysis; in this case, the Pintler RD conducted
an internal travel analysis in 2008 and is available in the project file. This process is distinguished from designating
routes and areas for motor vehicle use under the travel management regulations, which results in a MVUM (motor
vehicle use map).

Actions Proposed for KV Funding
The Knutson-Vandenberg (KV) Act of 1930 provides the authority for requiring purchasers of National
Forest timber to make deposits to finance sale area improvement activities (FSH 2409.19). The activities
listed in table 7 are associated with the proposed action, and are listed by priority for funding using KV
dollars generated through the timber sale. Funding generated for KV projects is dependent on the bid
value of the timber sale. If KV funding falls short to finance the listed projects, appropriated or other
dollars would be required to complete the projects.

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Vegetation Treatments – Commercial Harvest
Salvage Harvest of Lodgepole Pine Stands
Dead and dying lodgepole pine would be salvage harvested on 1,163 acres. Salvage harvest would occur
on 30 units ranging in size from 2 to 94 acres.
Twelve proposed lodgepole pine salvage units (19S, 34S, 35S, 36S, 39S, 46S, 49S, 52S, 58S, 61S, 73S,
and 74S) exceed 40 acres in size, ranging from 41 to 94 acres. Although Forest Plan direction requires
public notification and Regional Forester approval for regeneration units to exceed 40 acres in size
(Forest Plan, p. 39), these proposed treatments are not regeneration harvest actions but rather salvage
removal of overstory with regeneration already established. However, for this project these requirements
were met, including Regional Forester notification and approval. Public notice is also required when
salvaging units larger than 40 acres. Additionally, resource specialists conducted their analysis as if these
were considered openings that exceed 40 acres in size.
Commercial Thin of Ponderosa Pine and Douglas-fir Stands
Twenty-nine ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir stands would be commercially thinned on 1,149 acres, with
the 29 units ranging in size from 9-175 acres. A total of 157 acres of old-growth stands are included in
five commercial thin treatment units (6C, 23C, 25C. 55C and 71C); thinning these areas would meet
minimum criteria for old growth after treatment, consistent with Forest Plan standards (Forest Plan, p.44).
The proposed action in the DEIS identified 121 acres in four commercial thin treatment units. Further
field review identified an additional 36 acres of old growth in unit 71C that was added to the proposed
action.
Light underburning after commercial thinning would reduce understory vegetation not removed during
harvest to lower stand densities. The commercial thin units that contain old-growth stands would be
excluded from burning.
Seed Tree Harvest of Douglas-fir and Ponderosa Pine Stands
Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine stands would be seed tree harvested on 353 acres within 6 units ranging
in size from 8 to 139 acres.
Light underburning after the seed tree harvest would reduce the understory vegetation not removed during
harvest to lower stand densities.
Three proposed seed tree units exceed 40 acres in size (units 1ST, 5ST, 27ST). Forest Plan timber
standard 2 (Forest Plan, p. 39) allows openings created by one regeneration unit to exceed 40 acres on
lands suitable for timber production after public notification and Regional Forester approval.
Logging Systems
Temporary roads and landings constructed within the units would reduce yarding distances. External
yarding distances 20 would range from 250-1,600 feet with an average external yarding distance of 999
feet.

External yarding distance is the slope distance from the landing to the furthest reachable point within the treatment
unit boundary.
20

30

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Approximately 110 acres of commercial harvest using cable logging systems in units 26S, 36S, 28C, 29C,
33C, 28CS, 60C, 68C and 30ST would occur on slopes greater than 35 percent.
Haul Routes
Under alternative 2-proposed action, 109.8 miles of road would be used as haul routes. Table 9 identifies
the roads and associated mileages. Figure 6 displays the haul routes proposed inside the project area
boundary.
•

A total of 101.3 miles of existing roads, including unauthorized routes, would be utilized as
haul routes. This includes 74.9 miles within the project area boundary that are displayed in
figure 6 in chapter 2. The remaining 26.4 miles are private, county, and NFS road outside the
project area (figure 4). Approximately 59 miles would be maintained, and 42 miles would be
reconstructed.

•

Approximately 1.3 miles of new roads would be constructed for haul to access units 36S and
47S. The site conditions require the need for specified road construction, as opposed to
temporary road. These roads would be added to the Forest transportation system as NFS roads.
They would be put into storage (maintenance level 1) for potential future access following
implementation of the Flint Foothills project. These roads would be closed to all motor vehicle
use during the time they are in storage.

•

Approximately 7.2 miles of new temporary road would be constructed, utilizing construction
measures such as outsloping, drainage dips, and water-spreading ditches. Approximately 0.5
miles would be in Riparian Conservation Areas (RCAs). Following completion of the
vegetation projects, the newly constructed temporary roads would be decommissioned by
obliteration, in which the road prism is recontoured; cut and fill slopes are restored to natural
grades; and slash, stumps, and woody debris are placed on top of the corridor to effectively
block vehicle travel.

•

Approximately 4.4 miles of open and closed unauthorized routes would be reconstructed and
utilized as haul routes. Approximately 0.2 miles would be in RCAs. Following project
implementation, these routes would be decommissioned by various methods as described in
Table 6.

•

LWD (Large Woody Debris) placement would occur in approximately 0.7 miles of stream
where temporary road construction and reconstruction occurs in RCAs. Wood used for
restoration would be felled by hand on site.

•

Just over 1 mile of open and closed unauthorized routes would be reconstructed, utilized as
haul routes and added to the Forest transportation system following reconstruction. They
would be managed as maintenance level 2 roads (high clearance vehicles recommended).

Alternative 3
Alternative 3 addresses public concerns over new road construction, and logging within old-growth
stands. This alternative proposes that no new NFS or temporary roads be constructed to access units or to
accommodate logging within units. No commercial thinning would occur within the understory of oldgrowth stands.
Alternative 3 eliminates eight units (36S, 47S, 72S, 48C, 56C, 57C, 68C, and 71C) requiring new
temporary road construction for access to the unit, thereby eliminating the need for new temporary road
construction. Six units utilize open and closed unauthorized routes to and within the unit to accommodate
logging (52S, 73S, 12C, 20C, 23C, and 80C); no new temporary roads would be constructed. Instead,
longer skidding distances, which average 1,425 feet, would be utilized to log the unit with ground-based
systems. In addition, four units are reduced in size (23C, 25C, 55C, and 6C) by a total of 121 acres to
eliminate commercial understory thinning of old-growth stands under alternative 3.
All other vegetation treatment proposals for this alternative are the same as for the proposed action.
Collectively, the commercial vegetation treatments would provide 12,686 MBF (25,372 CCF) in
sawtimber; and 3,172 MBF (6,343 CCF) in non-saw timber. Figure 7 displays the location of proposed
activities for alternative 3. Table 13 displays the vegetation treatment acres.

Eleven proposed lodgepole pine salvage units (19S, 34S, 35S, 39S, 46S, 49S, 52S, 58S, 61S, 73S, and
74S) exceed 40 acres in size, ranging from 41 to 94 acres (Figure 7). Although Forest Plan direction
requires public notification and Regional Forester approval for regeneration units to exceed 40 acres in
size (Forest Plan, p. 39), these proposed treatments are not regeneration harvest actions rather are salvage
removal of overstory with regeneration already established. However, for this project these requirements
were met, including Regional Forester notification and approval. Public notice is also required when
salvaging units larger than 40 acres. Additionally, resource specialists conducted their analysis as if these
were considered openings that exceed 40 acres in size.
Commercial Thin of Ponderosa Pine and Douglas-fir Stands
Twenty-four ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir stands would be commercially thinned on 1,022 acres, with
the 24 units ranging in size from 9-118 acres.
Light underburning after commercial thinning would reduce understory vegetation not removed during
harvest to lower stand densities.
Seed Tree Harvest of Douglas-fir and Ponderosa Pine Stands
Douglas-fir stands and ponderosa pine stands would be seed tree harvested on 353 acres within six units
ranging in size from 8 to 139 acres.
Light underburning after the seed tree harvest would reduce understory vegetation not removed during
harvest to lower stand densities.
Three proposed seed tree units exceed 40 acres in size (1ST , 5ST, 27ST) Forest Plan timber standard 2
(Forest Plan, p. 39) allows openings created by one regeneration unit to exceed 40 acres after public
notification and Regional Forester approval.

Logging Systems
Logs would be skidded to landings located adjacent to existing system roads. External yarding distances
would range from 250 to 4,080 feet with an average external yarding distance of 1,425 feet.
Approximately 78 acres of commercial harvest using cable logging systems, in units 26S, 28C, 29C, 33C,
60C, would occur on slopes greater than 35 percent.
Haul Routes
Under alternative 3, 85.3 miles road would be utilized as haul routes. No new roads would be constructed.
Table 14 identifies the roads and associated mileages. Figure 8 displays the haul routes within the project
area boundary.
Two open and closed unauthorized routes would be added to the Forest’s Transportation system. Other
unauthorized routes would be reconstructed, used as haul routes, and then decommissioned following
project implementation.
•

A total of 85.3 miles of existing roads, including unauthorized routes, would be utilized as
haul routes. This includes 70.8 miles within the project area boundary. The remaining 14.5
miles are private, county, and NFS road outside the project area. Approximately 47 miles
would be maintained, and 38 miles would be reconstructed.

•

Approximately 2.3 miles of open and closed unauthorized routes would be reconstructed and
utilized as haul routes. Approximately 0.2 miles would occur in RCAs. Following project
implementation, these routes would be decommissioned by various methods.

•

Stream restoration using placement of large wood would occur in approximately 0.2 miles of
stream where temporary road reconstruction occurs in RCAs. Wood used for restoration would
come from trees cut during reconstruction.

•

Just over 1 mile of open and closed unauthorized routes would be reconstructed, utilized as
haul routes and added to the Forest transportation system. They would be managed as
maintenance level 2 roads (high clearance vehicles recommended).

Project Design Features and Mitigation Measures
The Forest Service developed the following project design features and mitigation measures as part of all
of the action alternatives. Both project design features and mitigation measures are incorporated as an
integral part of alternatives 2 and 3, and are nondiscretionary once approved in a decision. They are based
upon standard practices and operating procedures that have been employed in similar circumstances and
conditions. The line officer and Forest specialists would review project design features and mitigation
measures that would be applied through a timber sale contract, prior to contract advertisement.

Project Design Features and Mitigation Measures Common to Alternative 2 and
Alternative 3
Vegetation
• In salvage units, lodgepole pine (from 4 inches up to 20 inches dbh) would be salvage
harvested using mechanized ground-based equipment. All other species that occur in the units
(Douglas-fir, spruce, subalpine fir, and aspen) would be retained.
•

In Douglas-fir commercial thinning units, Douglas-fir stands would be thinned to a density of
40 to 60 square feet of basal area per acre where it exists.

•

In the Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine seed tree units, seed trees would be left that are greater
than 20 inches dbh and additional trees left to leave 5-15 trees per acre across the unit with the
preference being ponderosa pine over Douglas-fir where they exist.

•

In Douglas-fir commercial thinning units, and Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine seed tree units,
a low intensity understory burn would target reducing understory trees left after harvest to
lower stand densities, with fire carried over 60 to 100 percent of each unit. Ignition for the
understory burn of harvest units would be by hand-lighting, with the firing operations
preferably conducted in the fall; though spring burning would be acceptable.

•

In the precommercial thinning units of old harvest units (from the 1960s and the 1970s); the
units would be thinned on a variable spacing between 12 and 16 feet apart. The best trees
(defined as free growing and full crowned) would be retained; however, where species other
than lodgepole pine occur, they would have priority for retention to promote a diversity of
species (with the exception of subalpine fir in Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine units).

•

Live dwarf mistletoe-infected lodgepole pine within harvest units would be felled to reduce
the spread of disease to the new stand. Slash from the trees would be scattered on site or piled
and burned at central log landings.

•

All trees (live or dead) greater than 20 inches dbh would be retained in all units. An exception
would occur in harvest units if they are defined a hazard to harvest operations and designated
for felling by a Forest officer.

•

If whitebark pine is found during implementation of harvest (1) retain all whitebark pine of 3”
dbh or greater through avoidance; (2) designate skid trails that avoid whitebark pine to the
extent possible; and (3) directionally fell trees to be harvested to avoid damaging whitebark
regeneration to the extent possible.

•

In precommercial thin units, full-crowned trees with green branches down to within 12 inches
of the ground would be retained to maintain winter snowshoe habitat (cover and forage).

45

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Prescribed Fire
• The public, the sheriff's office and the DNRC would be notified through phone contacts and
news releases of upcoming prescribed burning activities.
•

In the mid-elevation prescribed fire units, up to 10 percent of each unit would have smalldiameter (4 to 12 inches dbh) conifers slashed (cut down). Slash created as a result of these
activities would be strategically located to facilitate a mosaic of mixed severity burned areas
with the objective of 50 percent mortality in the overstory trees within the unit. The
concentrations would burn with fire carried into the crown of the trees for areas up to 20 acres
in size, but fire is not carried throughout the unit. Ignition for the mid-elevation burn units
would be a combination of aerial ignition and hand-lighting. Approximately 40 percent of each
unit would be targeted with fire ignitions. A spring-time burn would be preferable, when the
spread of fire over the ground vegetation would be minimal, but a fall burn would be
acceptable.

•

Whitebark pine is known to occur in three mid-elevation units proposed for prescribed burning
(Units 3B, 4B and 5B). The felling of conifers prior to burning activities would avoid areas of
units that have concentrations of whitebark pine. Additionally, ignition patterns would avoid
the use of fire directly in areas of units that have concentrations of whitebark pine.

•

Control lines for the mid-elevation prescribed fire units would principally be natural features
that provide adequate fuel breaks. In the Mount Princeton area, Units 3B and 4B would require
about 2,000 feet of lightly constructed hand fire-line to control the prescribed fire along the
ridge. These lines would be rehabilitated if necessary after activities are complete, and
monitored for weed infestations.

•

In the low-elevation prescribed fire units, a low intensity understory burn would target
reducing understory trees to lower stand densities, with fire carried over 100 percent of each
unit. Ignition for the low-elevation burn units would be by hand-lighting, with the firing
operations preferably conducted in the fall, though a spring burn would be acceptable.

•

Control lines for the low-elevation prescribed fire units would be lightly constructed hand firelines and existing road systems. These lines would be rehabilitated if necessary after activities
are complete, and monitored for weed infestations.

Air Quality
• All prescribed burning would comply with the State Requirements of the State Implementation
Plan and the Smoke Management Plan (USDA Forest Service 1987, pages II-26). Prescribed
burning is reported to the Airshed Coordinator on a daily basis. If ventilation problems are
forecast by the monitoring unit, prescribed burning is either restricted by elevation or curtailed
until good ventilation exists (Story and Dzomba 2005).
•

A prescribed burn plan would be completed prior to any burning. The burn plan would address
mitigation measures to minimize smoke impacts and to comply with state and Federal air
quality regulations.

•

Best Available Control Technologies (BACT) would be implemented during prescribed
burning operations to limit emissions to the maximum degree that Montana Department of
Environmental Quality (DEQ) determines for that source on a case-by-case basis. Techniques
and methods may include, but are not limited to: scheduling burn periods, applying dispersion
forecasts, fuel preparation and configuration, and limiting the amount of burning, ignition and
burning techniques that minimize smoke production.

46

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Harvest Operations
• Harvested trees would be whole-tree yarded to landing sites. Slash and logging debris would
be burned or chipped.
•

The use of roads that are currently closed and would be opened for harvest access, including
unauthorized routes, would be restricted to motorized access by Forest personnel and those
involved in vegetation treatment harvest operations.

•

All temporary roads on open and closed unauthorized routes would be decommissioned upon
completion of the authorized activities. The proposed method of the decommissioning would
vary by road, as displayed in table 6.

•

All newly constructed temporary roads, skid trails, and landings would be obliterated upon
completion of harvest operations. Obliterating temporary roads would consist of recontouring
the road prism, including all cut and fill slopes. Logging slash, stumps, and woody debris
would be placed on top of obliterated road corridors to effectively prevent vehicle travel.

•

Landings would not be located in natural openings such as meadows or grass-shrub parks, or
in riparian areas, to avoid impacts to the vegetation and the introduction and spread of noxious
weeds.

Transportation
• Administrative use and contractor use during project implementation would be authorized
through a permit on the routes identified in table 18 below. These routes are closed year-round
to the public as identified on the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest North Map 2013.
Although travel would be authorized during restricted periods it would not include the period
Oct. 15 - Dec. 2:

Travel would be authorized outside of the period of October 15-December 2.

•

Signs, gates, cattleguards and other features damaged or removed during harvest activities
would be repaired or replaced.

•

Temporary traffic control measures would be implemented for public safety in accordance
with Forest Service signing policy and the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices
(MUTCD).

•

Danger trees would be felled as necessary to provide for safe use of project haul routes.

47

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Invasive Plant Species
• Invasive plants would be controlled following procedures in the Noxious Weed Control
Program Record of Decision for the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest (USDA Forest
Service 2002, Appendix H) to limit infestation and spread.
•

Log landings would be located in invasive plant-free areas. If no such areas are available, the
site would be treated prior to use to minimize weed seed production and spread.

•

All heavy equipment would have an undercarriage wash and inspection prior to entering
National Forest System lands to reduce the spread of invasive plants.

•

Slash and chipped material generated from the project can be spread over bare soil. Debris
would be placed to deter public motorized vehicle use on landings.

•

Disturbed areas as determined by the Forest Service would be monitored to ensure soil
stabilization occurs through natural revegetation from the soil seed bank. If additional plant
seed is required, only native seed mix approved by the Forest Service would be used. Seed
would be broadcast-spread over disturbed areas in the fall of the year, prior to snowfall.
Seeded areas would be monitored closely to ensure successful establishment of desired
vegetation. All seed and mulch material would be certified noxious weed seed free. In
addition, invasive plants would be monitored and treated as necessary to reduce the potential
spreading into new areas.

•

Piling and burning slash would be avoided on invasive plant infestations. Jack-pot burn pile
locations would be monitored and treated as necessary to prevent establishment and spread of
invasive plants.

•

Prescribed burning would be accomplished in a manner to ensure a low severity burn. This can
be accomplished by burning in the spring or fall because fuel and soil moisture are higher
during these times of year compared to summer, which would reduce the intensity of the fire.
Some mid-elevation lodgepole pine areas would experience a mosaic of mixed-severity burned
areas, as designed.

•

Prescribed burn units containing invasive plant species would be aggressively treated
following prescribed fire.

•

Post-activity monitoring for and treatment of invasive plants would occur on all proposed
treatment units. Specific emphasis would be given to areas of ground disturbance within the
units, and to units with existing infestations where monitoring and treatment would occur until
populations are effectively controlled.

Wildlife
•

Bear Sanitation Guidelines as detailed in Food Storage Order 2014-BD/BITT-009 will be
followed for all activities associated with this proposed action.

Snags and Large Woody Debris
• Snag and live tree retention standards (FP Wildlife Standards 3 and 4) and their application to
this proposal are provided as outlined below. Exceptions will occur in harvest units if the snags
are defined a hazard to harvest operations and designated for felling by a Forest officer.

Applies only to regeneration harvest
units, which are the Seed Tree Harvest
units; retaining 47 trees per acre over

•

For those snags retained to meet Forest Plan snag standards, distribute snags in groups
(clumps) averaging 0.50 acre to 3 acres in size to reduce the potential for windthrow and
removal for safety reasons.

•

Large woody debris, at least six pieces per acre with small-end diameter equal to or greater
than 8 inches and at least 10 feet long, would be retained in harvest units. To meet this, trees
would be marked for retention prior to salvage and then dropped (cut) after the operator has
moved from the site.

•

Large woody debris, at least six pieces per acre with small-end diameter equal to or greater
than 12 inches and at least 10 feet long, would be retained in commercial thin harvest units
(Douglas-fir cover types).

49

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

•

Existing large diameter logs in various stages of decay would be retained in all treatment units
where possible. Methods include placement of slash away from logs to prevent burning and
avoiding the logs with equipment to prevent demolishing.

Active TES nests and roosts
• No ground disturbing mechanized activities will occur from March 15th through July 15th,
unless approved by the Wildlife Biologist, in order to reduce the potential for impacts to
roosting, denning and nesting wildlife; both resident and migratory.
•

No activities will occur within the 40 acre Gird Creek nest buffer for 10 years (Gird Creek

Soils
•

Ground based yarding would not occur on slopes exceeding 35 percent that have not had a
site-specific evaluation by a soil scientist determining that damage is unlikely (Forest Plan
direction; Soil and Water Conservation Practice (SWCP 14.07)).

•

Harvest would not occur unless soils are dry or frozen as determined by the Forest Service in
order to minimize potential compaction and/or rutting (SWCP 13.06).

•

Timber operations and harvest units would avoid wet areas. The Forest soil scientist,
hydrologist, and fisheries biologist would work with the project implementation team to
protect these areas (SWCP 13.03).

•

Skid trails would be spaced an average of 75 -100 feet apart (SWCP 14.08). Skid trails would
be adequately drained in order to prevent overland water flow. Slash would be placed on skid
trails to prevent erosion and to discourage ATV use (SWCP 14.15). Drainage structures (or
slash) would be placed on temporary roads and skid trails that would be left over the winter to
reduce erosion potential during higher flows associated with the spring season (SWCP 14.15).
If slash were used for overwinter protection, it would be removed before use or obliteration the
following summer.

•

Constructed skid trails and newly constructed temporary roads would be obliterated—
including recontouring where needed—and revegetated with native seed mix approved by the
Forest Service (SWCP 15.25).

•

A range of 7 to 12 tons per acre of coarse woody debris (3 inches or greater in diameter) would
be left in harvest units. This may be accomplished by felling and leaving trees where necessary
(USDA Forest Service 1999).

•

Landings would be revegetated with native seed and areas of compacted soil would be
scarified prior to seeding (SWCP 14.11).

•

Slash would be piled in such a way (tall and narrow) as to reduce the footprint on the soil and
piles would be burned when the soil is cold or frozen and moist.

•

Yarded logs would be partially or fully suspended for cable logging systems (SWCP 14.09).

•

Sub-soiling would occur within specified units in order to restore portions of the units to
ensure compliance with soil quality standards within these units. 21

•

Broadcast and concentration burning of slash would be performed in the fall or spring when
soil moisture levels are high (SWCP 18.02).

Hydrology and Aquatic Resources
• Commercial harvest units and landings would avoid riparian conservation areas (RCAs)
(Forest Plan, pp. 18 and 21) and seasonally wet areas. The Forest soil scientist, hydrologist,
and fisheries biologist would work with the project implementation team to protect these areas.
•

Harvest units, temporary roads, timber operations and project activities would avoid known
western toad breeding sites and natal areas during breeding and juvenile rearing periods.

•

Temporary roads would have water bars or other appropriate drainage structures.

Refer to the “Soils Restoration Plan” under project design features and mitigation measures specific to each
alternative.

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

•

The hydrologist or fisheries biologist would be notified by the sale administrator that site
conditions in riparian conservation areas warrant snow plowing for operator access and safety.

•

Project-related storage of fuels and toxicants within riparian conservation areas would be
prohibited. Refueling within riparian conservation areas would be prohibited except for
emergencies, in which case refueling sites must have an approved spill containment plan
(Forest Plan, p. 21).

•

Montana Best Management Practices would be applied to all haul routes.

•

On all reconstructed road segments:

•

o

All BMPs would be functional at the close of timber sale activities by subdivision, as
displayed on the timber sale map. The timber sale administrator would coordinate with a
Forest engineering representative and hydrologist to accomplish BMP surveys. All
culverts would be marked by the Forest engineering representative before winter and
cleared of debris as needed to keep them functioning. This would help prevent equipment
operators from crushing the inlet and outlet of culverts.

o

Snow would not be completely removed. In general, a minimum 4 inches of snow must
be left on the roadway during plowing operations to protect the surface of the road.

Slash filter windrows or an equivalent alternative, would be placed when necessary at stream
crossings and maintained to prevent measurable sediment impacts to stream and fish habitats
during hauling and road maintenance related to harvest activities. Potential slash filter
windrow placement sites would be identified prior to the timber sale appraisal by the forest
engineer and fisheries biologist or hydrologist. The following general guidelines would be
used for slash filter windrow placement:
o

Apply 100 to 200 feet of windrow to the majority of intermittent and perennial stream
crossings.

o

Place windrows where slash is available on site or with minimal haul.

o

Where slash is not immediately available, an alternative filter may be used such as silt
fence or straw bales.

o

Locate at the toe of the road fill slope on both sides of the stream and road and extending
over the crossing structure.

o

Place windrows along road segments that would receive road blading and reconstruction.

o

Place on major timber haul routes where roads may be susceptible to large traffic
volumes and consequent road surface erosion and rutting.

•

Where system roads and unauthorized routes are reconstructed, road work would comply with
all BMP standards.

•

Water quality samples would be taken from Douglas Creek before and after prescribed burning
occurs in units 1B, 2B, and 6B to determine measureable changes in nitrates.

•

Following burning, landings would be reseeded within one year using native seed mix
approved by the Forest Service.

•

Placement of large wood in a manner that creates and improves pool habitat, promotes
sediment capture and retention, and/or improves stream width to depth ratioswould occur at a
frequency that ensures a minimum of 20 pieces per mile by Forest Service personnel.

52

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

•

No direct ignition of prescribed burning would occur within riparian conservation areas;
however, fire would be allowed to back into RCAs to provide desired long-term benefits

•

No landing or skid trail construction is allowed within RCAs, wetlands, seasonally wet areas,
springs or bogs.

Sensitive Plants
• If undocumented sensitive plant populations were found before or during the project, activities
would be halted until avoidance or mitigation measures can be considered by the Forest
Botanist.
Recreation
• No log hauling would occur on NFS roads on weekends and federal holidays to provide for
public safety.
•

The trail surface and signs would be protected from damage from treatment activities in the
vicinity of Forest System Trail 8049. If trail surface damage occurs, the surface would be
restructured to meet serviceable standards. Damaged signs would be replaced. Slash and burn
piles would be located off the trail tread.

•

All recreational trails, trailheads, and other recreation facilities (i.e., signs, gates, poster
boards, etc.) would be protected during or re-established after activity.

•

Dust would be abated in the vicinity of Douglas Creek Cabin if harvest or treatment activities
occur while the cabin is open to occupancy during the dry season.

•

Roads and trails within Unit 4B may be closed during implementation of the prescribed burns
to provide for public safety.

Range
•

Natural barriers removed during harvest that serve to block livestock movement between
allotments would be replaced with fencing. Range betterment (RBRB) funds would be used to
purchase fence materials, and fencing would be completed by the appropriate range
permittee(s), or through a contract.

•

Existing fences and water development would be protected from damage during project
implementation. Damage to infrastructure would be repaired to Forest Service specifications.

•

Gates and/or cattleguards would be installed where new roads intersect with fences.

Scenic Resources
• Visible stumps within 100 feet of Concern Level 2 routes should be cut to a maximum stump
height of 6 inches. This would apply to units with edges that are directly adjacent to the
following routes within the project area: NFS roads 707, 1544, 1557 and 636.
•

Salvage units seen from NFS roads 1544 and 1557 would have form and shape that simulates
natural patterns (i.e., avoiding straight lines and sharp corners). The edges of such units would
be tied into existing meadows and openings where possible, or provide feathering that allows
gradual transition into the untreated adjacent forest area (as opposed to an abrupt line). Units
that would be seen from NFS road 1544: 36, 45S, 69S, and 37S. Units that would be seen from
NFS roads1557: 41S, 35S, 16S, 61S, 50S, 26S, 76S, and 49S.

53

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

•

Final layout of units seen from the Concern Level 2 routes listed above shall be reviewed by
the forest landscape architect prior to implementation.

Heritage
•

Sites would be avoided or site-specific mitigation measures would be developed in
consultation with the Montana State Historic Preservation Office prior to project
implementation.

•

Mitigation measures would ensure cultural resources are not impacted by fire in the prescribed
burn units and the commercial thin and seed tree unit understory burning. If there is potential
to affect a cultural site, additional mitigation measures would be developed in consultation
with MT State Historic Preservation Office prior to project implementation.

•

Sites with flammable components would be protected, if needed, with the use of mitigation
measures prior to implementation including: Exclusion from the treatment area, handlines,
blacklines (burning fuels around the site to create a fire break), wet lines, foam retardant,
structural fire shelter, or removal of fuels from the site by hand.

•

Non-fire sensitive sites, considered to have less risk for fire effects in low-temperature and or
light fuel load condition (such as prehistoric and historic sites with deeply buried cultural
deposits, prehistoric and historic artifact scatters, and prehistoric and historic sites with nonflammable surface features) that are located within prescribed burn, commercial thin and seed
tree units, would be protected, if needed, with the following measures:
o

No staging, parking or use of mechanized equipment would occur within site boundaries.

o

No ignition points would occur within site boundaries.

o

Large diameter trees would be felled away from all features.

o

Thinning within site boundaries would be accomplished using hand tools only.

o

No slash piling would occur within site boundaries.

o

Thinned material would be hand carried outside site boundary.

Project Design Features and Mitigation Measures Specific to Alternative 2 (Proposed
Action)
•

Old growth stands within commercial thin units (23C, 25C, 55C, 6C and 71C) would retain
sufficient structural characteristics to meet old-growth definitions post-treatment (Forest Plan,
p. 44).

•

New temporary road construction and landings would be designed to limit the need for
excavation during construction and would be located on slopes less than 35 percent.

•

Newly constructed temporary roads would be closed to the public through a forest order.
Advance notice and appropriate signs would be used to inform the public of the closures.

Soils Restoration Plan
• For all units with proposed temporary road construction (12C, 20C, 27ST, 34S, 35S, 41S, 42C,
46S, 48C, 49S, 51S, 52S, 55C, 56C, 57C, 61S, 68C, 71C, 72S, 73S, 77S, 78S, 79S) all
temporary roads (new construction) would be ripped or subsoiled, seeded with native seed,
and blocked at the entrance. Roads would be re-contoured where needed.

54

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

•

For three units (27ST, 32ST, 41S) additional restoration may be required to comply with the
regional soil quality standards (SQS). In these units existing and new skid trails would be
subsoiled to reduce compaction. Restoration activities would focus on skid trails and landings
and would occur on suitable acres, excluding areas that are too rocky, wet, or have other
limiting factors. Restoration would be implemented on the number of acres needed to meet
soil quality standards; actual acres restored may be higher or lower than what is shown in the
soils section. Treatments would occur within three years of completion of harvest.

•

Actual acres to be restored would be determined by post-harvest monitoring to determine the
actual percent detrimental soil disturbance, from which actual acres to be restored can be
calculated. These units would need to be monitored to ensure that SQS are met within 3 years
of the conclusion of the project.

Project Design Features and Mitigation Measures Specific to Alternative 3
Soils Restoration Plan
• For two units (27ST and 32ST) additional restoration may be required to comply with the
regional soil quality standards. In these units existing and new skid trails would be subsoiled
to reduce compaction. Restoration activities would focus on skid trails and landings and would
occur on suitable acres, excluding areas that are too rocky, wet, or have other limiting factors.
Restoration would be implemented on the number of acres needed to meet soil quality
standards; actual acres restored may be higher or lower than what is shown in the soils section.
Treatments would occur within three years of completion of harvest.
•

Actual acres to be restored would be determined by post-harvest monitoring to determine the
actual percent detrimental soil disturbance, from which actual acres to be restored can be
calculated. These units would need to be monitored to ensure that SQS are met within 3 years
of the conclusion of the project.

Monitoring
Silviculture
•

Monitoring of regeneration success would begin one year after all proposed actions have been
implemented (generally late summer to early fall). Monitoring would continue on a schedule of
first, third and fifth-year exams. By the third year, if exams indicate that natural regeneration is
not progressing toward the desired seedling-per-acre goal, planting of seedlings would be
considered.

Invasive Plants
•

Post activity monitoring and treatment would occur as long as necessary to ensure that existing
infestations do not expand and new infestations have been controlled. It is recommended that the
units, haul routes, temporary roads, and burn piles be identified as a high priority for funding in
the KV Plan to treat existing weed populations.

Soils
•

Units requiring subsoiling per the soils restoration plan would be monitored, at a minimum, to
ensure compliance with Region 1 SQS since they are predicted to exceed the SQS before

55

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

restoration. Monitoring would follow the Forest Soil Disturbance Monitoring Protocol (USDA
Forest Service, 2009b).

Hydrology
•

Blum Creek would be monitored to identify if prescribed fire treatments result in any new
sediment delivery sites.

•

Water quality in Douglas Creek would be monitored during and after prescribed fire treatments to
determine if there are measurable changes in nutrient loading.

Heritage
•

A sample of cultural resources in the area of potential effect (APE) would be monitored by a
Forest Service archaeologist following project work to ensure that mitigation measures were
followed and sites sustained no damage. If sites are damaged, the archaeologist would determine
the appropriate actions, which may include data recovery, site stabilization and reporting to insure
that similar damage does not occur in the future.

•

A sample of sites would be re-visited by Forest Service personnel to evaluate the effectiveness of
the treatments. The purpose of post-treatment monitoring is to gather data that would be used to
improve planning for the protection of heritage resources in future projects.

Transportation
•

Monitoring transportation routes to determine if soil and water conservation practices (BMPs)
being implemented during project work and are they resulting in protection of water quality and
beneficial uses.

Wildlife
•

Obliteration of temporary roads would be monitored for effectiveness of eliminating motorized
use and re-vegetating or stabilizing the roadbed.

•

A portion of units would be monitored for implementation of the design features to retain snags
according to Forest Plan standards, and to meet large woody debris requirements.

Alternatives Considered but Eliminated from Detailed Study
Federal agencies are required by NEPA to rigorously explore and objectively evaluate all reasonable
alternatives and to briefly discuss the reasons for eliminating any alternatives that were not developed in
detail (40 CFR 1502.14). Alternatives not considered in detail may include, but are not limited to, those
that fail to meet the purpose and need, are technologically infeasible or illegal, or would result in
unreasonable environmental harm (FSH 1900.15.14.4).
Public comments submitted during scoping suggested that the number of acres proposed for treatment be
increased; that the purpose and need be expanded to include restoration components; or that woodpecker
conservation areas be established in areas affected by the mountain pine beetle. These alternatives either
fail to meet the purpose and need, or were determined inconsistent with the Forest Plan. Therefore, four
alternatives were considered by the ID team and responsible official, but not analyzed in detail pursuant
to the direction cited above. The following section describes the rationale.

56

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Provide an alternative that builds flexibility into the analysis to be able to add harvest areas at a
later date. A thorough integrated analysis has been done within the project area to include all acres that
are appropriate to harvest at this time and in the reasonably foreseeable future. Currently, 100 percent of
the lodgepole pine stands have been affected by the mountain pine beetle. All suitable acres were looked
at for harvest and presented in the updated proposed action. The number of acres proposed for
commercial harvest increased by 343 acres from the June 2010 public scoping effort when 70 percent of
the lodgepole pine stands were estimated to be affected. Adding new acres would include areas that are
not accessible or would not comply with Forest Plan standards and objectives.
The table below shows the comparison of the proposed commercial harvest acreages.

We encourage the Forest Service to consider including a watershed or ecosystem restoration
alternative for detailed evaluation, or at least to include watershed/ecosystem restoration elements
in the reasonable alternatives: Watershed restoration elements would not address the purpose and need
of the proposal and are not included in the range of reasonable alternatives. Road maintenance and
reconstruction associated with the proposed haul routes, including implementation of Best Management
Practices (BMPs) and the use of other mitigation measures would improve road surface conditions and
reduce sediment delivery associated with road use and runoff.
We request the FS design a restoration/access management plan for project area streams that will
achieve recovery goals. This alternative was not analyzed in detail because it does not meet the purpose
and need to manage for the specific vegetation types identified in the proposed action and scoping letter.
Please include an alternative that recognizes the high value of the mountain pine beetle in creating
wildlife habitat both in the short and long term, and therefore includes management conservation
strategies that incorporate the value of these infestations as a resource management strategy,
including woodpecker conservation areas. The no-action alternative provides for dead and dying
lodgepole pine stands across the project area, providing habitat affected by the mountain pine beetle in the
short and long term. Affected areas that were not included in the action alternatives due to accessibility, or
retained to meet Forest Plan standards, also provide for habitat in the short and long term.

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental
Consequences
This chapter describes the physical, biological, social and economic environments of the project area and
the environmental consequences that would occur from implementing the alternatives. Together, these
descriptions form the scientific and analytical basis for the comparison of effects in chapter 2.

Changes to the EIS since the Draft
Some of the more noteworthy changes include:
•

Present and reasonably foreseeable actions was updated to reflect completed and new projects.

•

The Wildlife and Transportation analysis has been updated to reflect road closures displayed
on the Beaverhead-Deerlodge North Map 2013.

•

A map was added to the Air Quality section reflecting relationship to Class 1 airsheds to Butte
Montana to respond to public comment.

•

Acres of Mountain Pine Beetle mortality were updated based on survey results (see Vegetation
section).

•

Field review identified unit 71c having 36 acres of old growth, now added to the proposed
action and tracked through analysis.

•

Snag inventory data was added to the Vegetation analysis.

•

Terms such as “salvage with clearcut” or “clearcut” have been changed to “salvage” as this is
the correct silvicultural term to describe the activities proposed considering the changes in
stand conditions since the publication of the DEIS. Enough time has passed since the DEIS
analysis that the intent of using a “salvage with clearcut” to shorten the timeframe of
reestablishment and subsequent growth of the new stand is no longer necessary. Stand
initiation has already occurred because the mountain pine beetle epidemic has created large
areas of dead and dying lodgepole pine; there is now a manageable component of naturally
regenerated seedlings underneath these trees. This renders the regeneration requirement for an
even-aged management vegetation treatment (i.e. any type of clearcutting) unnecessary. Postsalvage harvest evaluations will occur to track and monitor the natural regeneration.

•

The Roadless section was updated to be consistent with the Northern Region’s protocol for
wilderness potential.

•

A more detailed description of the indicators and measures was added in the Hydrology and
Fish and Aquatics Overview of Analysis sections.

•

We expanded the hydrology analysis area to include the entirety of all watersheds that occur
within the project area (rather than just the portions above the Forest Boundary). We've also
added the Lower Boulder Creek watershed to the analysis area.

•

Increased analysis and discussion of prescribed fire in RCAs was added in the Hydrology
analysis.

•

Increased analysis regarding the potential for water temperature changes was added in the
Hydrology analysis.

•

Increased analysis regarding the potential for timber salvage to change water yield and peak
stream flows was added in the hydrology analysis.
61

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

•

Increased analysis regarding cumulative effects was added in the hydrology section and in the
Aquatic Resources section.

•

An expanded analysis area which includes the Lower Boulder Creek watershed was added in
the Aquatic analysis area 22.

•

Analysis and discussion of the effects of prescribed fire was added in the Aquatic Resources
section.

•

Analysis and discussion of canopy removal in RCAs on water temperature was added in the
Aquatic Resources section

•

Analysis and discussion of stream restoration through placement of large wood is discussed in
the Hydrology and Aquaitcs Resources sections.

•

Analysis and discussion of project effects on bull trout and designated critical habitat was
added in the Aquatic Resources section.

•

Analysis and discussion of the potential for forest canopy removal to influence channel shape
and stream function was added in the Aquatic Resources section.

Consistency with Forest Plan Standards
See table C-1 in volume 2, Appendix C for a listing of all relevant Forest Plan standards and a discussion
of the applicability and consistency of these standards to the Flint Foothills action alternatives.

Spatial and Temporal Context for Effects Analysis
The relative boundaries, and past, present and planned activities included in the effects analysis vary by
resource both in area and time. This spatial and temporal context is described in each resource section.
The cumulative effects analysis for each environmental component or resource area is guided by and
consistent with FSH 1909.15, Section 15.2 “Bounding Effects”.

Cumulative Effects
According to the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), NEPA regulations, “cumulative impact” is
“…the impact on the environment that results from the incremental impact of the action when added to
other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable actions regardless of what agency (Federal or non-Federal)
or person undertakes such actions” (40 CFR1508.7). Since past actions are already included in the
affected environment, the cumulative effects analysis builds upon this existing condition assessment by

that it focuses on the potential impacts of the proposed action that an agency is considering. Thus, review
of past actions is required to the extent that this review informs agency decisionmaking regarding the

proposed action (36 CFR 220.4(f)). The resource information provided in the Affected Environment
narratives includes the effects of relevant past actions that may still be contributing effects to the resource
and therefore are considered as part of the existing condition.
The baseline for cumulative effects analysis is the current condition. The Forest Service National
Environmental Policy Act Regulations (36 CFR 220.4(f) (July 24, 2008) state, in part:
“CEQ regulations do not require the consideration of the individual effects of all past actions to
determine the present effect of past actions. Once the agency has identified those present effects of
past actions that warrant consideration, the agency assesses the extent that the effects of the
proposal for agency action or its alternatives will add to, modify, or mitigate those effects. The
final analysis documents an agency assessment of the cumulative effects of the actions considered
(including past, present and reasonable foreseeable future actions) on the affected environment.
With respect to past actions, during the scoping process and subsequent preparation of the
analysis, the agency must determine what information regarding past actions is useful and
relevant to the required analysis of cumulative effects. Cataloging past actions and specific
information about the direct and indirect effects of their design and implementation could in some
contexts be useful to predict the cumulative effects of the proposal. The CEQ regulations,
however, do not require agencies to catalogue or exhaustively list and analyze all individual past
actions. Simple because information about past actions may be available or obtained with
reasonable effort, does not mean that it is relevant and necessary to inform decision making” (40
CFR 1508.7)

Past Vegetation and Prescribed Burning Activities
Past vegetation and prescribed burning actions considered in the affected environment and cumulative
effects analysis are summarized in this section. These past activities, together with natural processes, have
contributed to creating the existing condition described in this chapter. The past actions summary is not
necessarily exhaustive, as records may not exist for all past activities by project. This is particularly true
for those actions that predate the passage of the National Environmental Policy Act in 1970. Additional
details and an associated map are provided in Appendix D.
Timber Management
Timber was harvested in the Flint Foothills Project area to support mining, homesteading and settlement
out in the valley. Timber harvest increased greatly from the 1960s through the mid-1980s and has
declined in recent years. Harvest in the last decade has been post and pole thinning and roadside hazard
tree removal.
Timber harvest activities included salvage, seed tree, shelterwood, selection cut, commercial thinning
(principally post and pole), sanitation (removing mistletoe infected trees) and special harvest (principally
hazard tree removal). Commercial timber harvest has occurred on about 23 percent of the project area or
10,265 acres. Table 23 displays the acres of commercial timber harvest by decade starting with 1960 and
up to 2010.

Prescribed Burning
The majority of Forest Service prescribed fire use has been disposal of logging slash, either through pile
burning or jackpot burning activities. Some prescribed fire use has been for improving stand conditions
for certain vegetation species (e.g. removing conifer succession in grassland-shrubland areas). Understory
burns are considered low-intensity fires over the majority of the unit, whereas broadcast burning are
higher-intensity fires over the majority of the unit. Minor amounts of fire woodcutter piles have also been
burned. Prescribed burning has occurred on about 11 percent of the project area or 4,974 acres (table 25).

Actions

Description

Public activities

Recreational activities such as hiking, biking, horseback riding, OHV riding,
hunting, fishing, forest product gathering, camping (dispersed), snowmobiling,
cross country skiing, wildlife viewing, driving for pleasure.

Activities requiring fees
and or permits

(1) Douglas Cabin, recreation rental; (2) Outfitter guide services: Two Outfitters,
area of operation in both Flint Foothills and Flint Uplands management areas.
Activity occurs in summer and for fall big-game hunting; and (3) personal firewood
and post and pole permits.

Trail maintenance

8.65 miles of trail maintenance in the project area on three trails: 8052(3.39 miles),
8054(3.89 miles), and 8049 (1.37)

Route and Area
Designation (MVUM motor vehicle use map)

The Forest has begun preliminary work on site-specific travel planning for the
motor vehicle route and area designation process. The Travel Management Rule
(which modified travel management regulations in 36 CFR Part 212) was published
in the Federal Register on November 9, 2005. This rule requires each national
forest to designate those roads, trails, and areas that are open to motor vehicle
use. Following site-specific analysis, these designations will be made by class of
vehicle and, if appropriate, by time of year.
The designations culminate in publishing of the Motor Vehicle Use Map (MVUM),
and will be guided by the above Rule, as well as the Forest Plan, Forest Service
directives, and other applicable laws, regulations, and policies. Effects from this
action could change the overall mileage of roads and trails available to motorized
vehicles within the project area and across the Forest. The analysis is anticipated
to begin in 2014, with a first MVUM published in 2015.

Annual road
maintenance

Typical activities include surface blading, drainage cleaning and repair, roadside
brushing, and sign maintenance. The annual miles of road maintenance varies; in
2011, approximately 43 miles of road maintenance was completed.

Grazing

Livestock grazing as currently permitted is expected to continue in the project area.
(Five allotments, with seasons of use between 6/16 and 10/7).

Invasive plant species
control

Spraying to control weeds is expected to continue in the project area. Existing
invasive plant infestations within the project area are currently being treated with
herbicides annually. Additional biological agents will be introduced. In 2010, the
United States Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station released Mecinus
janthinus, a stem mining weevil to control yellow toadflax. The Research Station
will study the effects of this agent on yellow toadflax in this area and climate.

Danger tree removal at
developed sites

Danger tree removal within the project is being conducted in accordance with the
Decision Memo for Forest-Wide Developed Site Hazard Tree Removal within the
BDNF. This Decision Memo provides that dead, dying, and structurally unsound
trees be removed from within developed recreation sites across the BDNF.

Douglas Creek culvert

Project replaces two culverts and re-aligns about 400 feet of stream channel, with
either bridges or larger culverts, on the North Fork Douglas Creek. The Douglas
Creek project is located on Forest System roads 707 and 1544 on the North Fork
Douglas Creek in T9N, R12W, sections 28 and 32.

BDNF Aspen Project

Future aspen treatments to improve conditions for aspen where an assessment
indicates a need a the site conditions are favorable to support aspen. Estimated 1
to 3 projects per year across the forest.

Maxville

Future timber harvest of dead lodgepole pine in Douglas-fir communities
(approximtately 2,000 acres). Watershed and fisheries improvement projects have
been identified.

Description

Wildland fire
suppression

Wildland fire suppression actions would most likely continue in lower elevations
due to proximity to private land and communities; upper elevations are available for
managing wildland fires after adequate analysis determines the fire could be
contained on the Forest. Time of year, fire danger, drought, weather, values at risk,
firefighter and public safety are all analyzed when making this management
decision.

Timber harvest on
private in-holdings within
the project area
boundary

Private land total 7,512 acres within the project area. Currently, harvest on private
inholdings has occurred on approximately 80 percent (about 5,500 acres) of the
forested portions. Most of the harvest on private land took place in the 1980s. Not
all of the inholdings are forested; about 10 percent are nonforested, dry, grassland
areas.

Vegetation
The Flint Foothills Vegetation Management project area is roughly 44,522 acres on the north end of the
Flint Range, located on the Pintler Ranger District of the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest (BDNF).
There are ten watersheds that comprise the project. Eighty-three percent of the area (Forest Service
ownership 37,010 acres; private ownership, 7,512 acres) is managed by the BDNF. The analysis area for
this Vegetation Report is the 44,522-acre project area.
This Vegetation Report provides analysis of the existing condition of the major vegetation types within
the project area and the effects of the proposed action on those major vegetation types. A discussion of
dominant processes provides the characterization of change that has occurred over time to the vegetation
types that provides the basis for the analysis.

66

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Overview of Issues Addressed
The relevant issues to this analysis are old growth, and the ongoing mortality with bark beetles to
ponderosa pine and whitebark pine; these issues will be analyzed in the effects discussion of this
vegetation analysis.

Measurement Indicators
The measurement indicators used to evaluate impacts of alternatives:
•

Acres of lodgepole pine salvage, providing for free growing conditions for lodgepole pine
regeneration

•

Acres of basal area reduction, growing conditions improved with thinning of Douglasfir/ponderosa pine stands

•

Acres of basal area reduction, growing conditions improved, and type change of old growth
from multi-story to single story

•

Acres of Douglas-fir/ponderosa pine regenerated

•

Acres of basal area reduction and growing conditions improved with low-intensity prescribed
burning of low-elevation Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine stands

•

Acres of lodgepole pine regenerated through prescribed burning in mid- to high-elevation
lodgepole pine stands

•

Acres of growing conditions in young stands improved by reducing stand density in past
timber harvest areas

Affected Environment
Existing Condition
A combination of site specific scientific information in the Flint Foothills project area as well as results of
studies completed in ecosystems and landscapes of the Western United States and Northern Rocky
Mountains were used to assess the processes that influenced vegetation composition and structure in the
analysis area.
Dominant Processes
Composition and configuration of vegetation in the Flint Foothills project area prior to European
settlement was shaped by natural disturbances and processes and to a lesser extent, Native American land
management. Natural disturbances and processes that influenced and would continue to influence
vegetation in this area include climate variability, watershed processes (i.e. flooding, mass wasting, debris
flows, avalanches), fire events, and insect population dynamics. Native American land management was
characterized by fire ignitions for travel corridors, forage improvement, game habitat improvement, and
maintenance of native plant food sources. More recently, vegetation after European settlement has been
shaped by Forest Service management practices, such as timber sale activity, domestic grazing and fire
suppression.

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Forest Carbon Cycling and Storage
As a major disturbance on the landscape, the mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) epidemic
and associated large-scale pine-species (lodgepole pine, ponderosa pine, and whitebark pine) mortality is
affecting forest carbon storage. Every pine stand that is larger than 5 inches in diameter has been affected
by the mountain pine beetle epidemic in the project area (17,938 acres of total pine with dead or dying
trees; see Table 27 and Figure 3). Initially, these forest stands shifted from a carbon sink to a source with
dead trees releasing carbon to the atmosphere as they decompose. Recent analysis at the Regional-scale
has indicated that the BDNF is increasing in ecosystem forest carbon stocks (USDA 2015).
Net ecosystem productivity (NEP) is a direct measure of the degree to which an ecosystem is a source
(NEP<0) of, or a sink (NEP>0) for atmospheric carbon over the time period of interest (Brown et al.
2010). NEP is negative (or decreased) when carbon lost through decomposition exceeds that gained
through photosynthesis. The mountain pine beetle epidemic has affected the NEP in these stands in
several ways. First, stand photosynthesis has been dramatically reduced with the increasing severity of
attack due to the death of canopy trees. This is accompanied by a corresponding decrease in stand
respiration, i.e. release of carbon dioxide. The decline in photosynthesis could be reduced by increased
growth of tree seedlings, saplings, trees that survive the beetle attack, shrubs, grasses, and forbs (Brown et
al. 2010). A substantial increase in carbon release would be expected once dead standing trees begin to
fall and decompose in the next 5-15 years; these fall rates of pine trees are predicted by Mitchell and
Preisler (1998).
Because mountain pine beetles kill larger lodgepole pine trees preferentially, these killed trees represented
proportionally larger values of carbon stocks (or sequestration) and above-ground tree carbon production
in killed trees within stands; more and larger trees killed results in greater decreases in carbon
sequestration. Stand-level carbon can be recovered to pre-outbreak values in 25 years or less; it takes 50160 years to recover to carbon storage values from simulations where stands were not attacked. The size
distribution of surviving trees can shorten this timeframe; a greater number of smaller trees store carbon
at a greater rate through an amplified growth rate when compared to larger survivors, having a greater
capacity to take advantage of increased resource availability (Pfeifer et al. 2010). Successful tree
regeneration is a much more critical factor in recovering carbon than stand age class distribution or tree
density. As long as post-disturbance lodgepole pine stands support enough trees to have the structural
characteristics of forests rather than shrublands, grasslands, or other kinds of non-forest vegetation, they
would recover pre-disturbance carbon stocks quickly and the landscape would be resistant to long-term
changes in carbon storage (Ryan et al. 2008).
Pregitzer and Euskirchen (2004) synthesized results from 120 separate studies of carbon pools and carbon
fluxes for boreal, temperate, and tropical biomes. They found that forest age is a highly significant source
of variability in NEP at the biome scale. In temperate forests such as those in the project area, the mean
NEP was negative (a carbon source), but also the most variable in young stands (0-10 years). Mean NEP
is positive and is highest (a carbon sink) in stands 11-30 years old, declining thereafter as stands age, but
still remaining positive.
These studies also reveal a general pattern of total carbon sequestration declining after disturbance,
increasing rapidly during intermediate years, and then declining over time until another significant
disturbance (timber harvest or tree mortality resulting from drought, fire, insects, disease, or other natural
disturbances) kills large numbers of trees and again converts the stands to a carbon source. In this
situation, carbon emissions from the decay of dead biomass exceed the amount of carbon removed from
the atmosphere by photosynthesis within the stand. Over the long-term (centuries) net carbon storage is
often zero if stands regenerate after disturbance because re-growth of trees recovers the carbon lost in the
disturbance and in decomposition of trees killed by the disturbance (Kashian et al. 2006).

68

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Recent scientific literature confirms some general patterns of forest carbon storage and release over the
period of forest stand development and natural or induced disturbances. For large-scale context, our
nations’ forests have and continue to sequester vast amounts of carbon, equivalent to approximately 10
percent of annual U.S. carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels, with some estimates are as
high as 19 percent (Heath and Smith 2004; Birdsey et al. 2006; Ryan et al. 2010; McKinley et al. 2011).
Nationally, forests are a net carbon sink, sequestering far more carbon than they release.
Fluctuations in temperature and precipitation that characterized historic climate likely influenced
vegetation distribution and patch size in the Flint Foothills project area by affecting other processes such
as germination and establishment of native species, fire regimes, insect activity, erosion, and stream
morphology. Despite the uncertainty of future climate conditions at local scales, the majority of published
science suggests that climate changes may strongly influence the frequency, intensity, and size of
disturbances (such as fire and extensive insect outbreaks) in coming decades on areas of the BDNF. These
disturbances have important consequences for community protection, timber water yield, carbon storage,
timber production, invasive species, and public perception of forest management. Changes in disturbance
prompted by climate change are likely as important as incremental changes in temperature and
precipitation for affecting ecosystem productivity and species composition (FP FEIS, p. 1041).
Insects
Mountain pine beetle (MPB) populations have been cyclic in conifer stands of the Flint Foothills area.
This species affects three species in the project area; lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), ponderosa pine
(Pinus ponderosa) and whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis). Twenty to forty year cycles of population
increases lasting up to 11 years initially kill larger individual trees before successively killing smaller
individuals (Cole and Amman 1980). Up to 60% of trees greater than 8 inches in diameter are killed when
MPB populations are epidemic.
Currently, the Flint Foothills analysis area is part of a larger epidemic occurring across the majority of the
Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest and on other forests in Region 1. MPB has been active in the Flint
Foothills area since about 2000, reaching epidemic proportions beginning in 2007 (based on field
reconnaissance of the area) and resulting in extensive areas of dead and dying24 lodgepole pine, and the
mortality of more individually scattered ponderosa pine and whitebark pine. A cold event with sustained
temperatures below zero degrees Fahrenheit in 2010 caused a reduction in beetle population in many
areas on the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest, and may have led to the decline in tree mortality as
indicated in Table 27 below; however, suitable pine host trees remained in the Flint Foothills analysis
area, which likely led to the increase in tree mortality with beetle activity in 2011. Bark beetle infestations
are a regular force of natural change in forested ecosystems; however, several current outbreaks occurring
simultaneously across western North America are the largest and most severe in recorded history (Bentz
2008). As trees become older than about 50 years, the proportion of trees in a given stand able to resist the
beetles generally decreases with tree age. This is especially true in even-aged stands of lodgepole pine
(Randell 2000). Outbreaks in even-aged stands of older trees of the same diameter class kill almost all
trees, whereas mixed-aged stands lose mostly the larger trees (Amman et al. 1977).
Table 27 summarizes the annual affected acreage totals and the total number of trees estimated to have
been attacked over the entire Flint Foothills area, including non-federal lands for these years. Note that

For this project, dead pine trees are defined as those having red/brown or no needles. Dying trees are defined as those trees
with green needles having more than five visible pitch tubes (Klein et al. 1978) on more than one face of the bole of the tree or
have visible frass (the fine, sawdust-like boring dust) (Amman and Logan 1998).

24

acreage totals can have overlap from year-to-year, as MPB attacks can be progressive over several years
within a particular acre.

Note: Acreage totals from year-to-year are not cumulative: MPB attacks are typically the same acre; however, the total trees attacked can
be viewed as what was attacked in that individual year.

MPB populations have been maintained and increasing year-by-year due to the recent above average
winter and spring temperatures, allowing a high over-winter success. Pine stand conditions across the
BDNF are conducive for carrying epidemic populations and without a change in over-winter temperatures
to colder extremes, the epidemic would continue until the host species of the appropriate diameter (about
5 inches and larger) have been exhausted. Within the Flint Foothills project area on NFS lands, it is
estimated that all (100 percent) of the pine stands 5 inches in diameter and larger have been affected by
MPB (17,938 acres with lodgepole, ponderosa pine or whitebark pine component; see Figure 3).
Western spruce budworm (WSB; Choristoneura occidentalis Freeman) occurrence has been most evident
at lower elevations where Douglas-fir occurs. WSB population booms last up to 30 years and cause
mortality in small and defoliation of large Douglas-fir trees. Increasingly dense, later successional stands
of Douglas-fir are susceptible to WSB because these stands are often stressed by competition. As a
consequence of recent drought condition coupled with interspecific competition and WSB population
increases, mortality of Douglas-fir individuals is occurring in the Flint Foothills project area. Areas of
higher mortality due to WSB in contiguous stands of Douglas-fir can be seen in the Gird Creek to
Douglas Creek areas (see Figures below).
Douglas-fir beetle (DFB; Dendroctonus pseudotsugae) numbers have generally thought to be in decline in
the Northern Region as well as the Flint Foothills analysis area; however, an increase in individual
numbers of Douglas-fir trees killed by DFB have been noted in the Dunkleberg Ridge, Jackson Park and
Blum Creek areas. An increase of mortality due to DFB can be attributed to the heavy and repeated
defoliation from WSB, which may lead to increases in DFB activity. Additionally, highly dense stand
conditions are also contributing to the increase in mortality to Douglas-fir from DFB (see Figures below).

Rusts, fungi, and microbes
The bulk of rust, fungi and microbes occurring in the Flint Foothills area are important components of
ecosystem function and structure. Alternatively, white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola) is a nonnative species that has negatively affected five-needle pines in the western US during a portion of its life
cycle (McDonald and Hoff 2001). Limber and whitebark pines are the only five needle pines on the
BDNF; whitebark pine is the most common on the forest. Limber pine does not occur in the project area;
whitebark pine comprises about 1.5 percent of the Flint Foothills area. In portions of the BDNF white
pine blister rust has resulted in widespread mortality of whitebark pine; although a comprehensive field
review of higher elevations within the Flint Foothills area have not been done, the stands that have been
viewed show moderately to severely impacted whitebark pine overstory trees by a combination of blister
rust and mountain pine beetles.

71

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Fire
Fire was historically the predominant natural disturbance in the Flint Foothills project area and lightning
ignitions largely determined where and when fires started (Agee 1993, Baker 2002, Pyne 1982); while
indigenous burning is presumed to have occurred at lower elevations within the analysis area (Kimmer
and Lake 2001). Fire regimes are differentiated by the frequency, extent, severity, and timing of fire
events associated with vegetation. The presence or absence of fire does play a key role in the composition
and structure of vegetation that occurs in the project area (Figure 13). The frequency and severity of past
fires can to a certain extent be determined by looking at the existing condition of the different vegetation
types in the analysis area. Although variable, natural fire intervals are a reflection of the vegetation types
that occur in broad elevational, aspect and slope bands across the analysis area. High frequency, low
severity fire regimes were historically typical of low elevation dry forests of Douglas-fir and mixed
Douglas-fir - ponderosa pine on the BDNF. Senesced grass and herb communities fueled understory fires
in these forests, allowing dominant conifer species to survive multiple low intensity fire events that killed
seedlings and created low density stands (Heyerdahl et al. 2006). For the moist Douglas-fir type fire was
an important agent in controlling density and species composition. Frequent low or moderate severity
fires favored ponderosa pine over Douglas-fir in stands where it occurred (Fischer & Bradley 1987). In
the analysis area, fire scars indicate a natural mean fire interval of 20 years in the low elevation forests
until the early 1900s (USDA 1994). The fire interval was disrupted at that time due to a combination of
events: indigenous burning ended as the area was populated by European Americans; and intense grazing

to support new settlements reduced available grass as a light-fuel. Additionally, fire suppression was
initiated with the formation of the National Forest System.
Mixed severity fire regimes historically occurred in several forest types in the region such as early seral
subalpine fir forest types dominated by lodgepole pine (Arno 1980, Arno et al. 2000). A mixed severity
fire is a mixture of ‘stand-replacement’ (where most of the conifers die) and ‘understory’ (where most of
the conifers live) variable intensity fire. Fuel loads increased in the mid- to higher elevation forests with
the less frequent fires than those of lower elevation forests. Mixed severity fire regimes are when fire
spread in mid- to higher elevation forests exhibit fire behavior that would include low severity surface
fire, single or clustered tree torching, and high severity crown fire; all within a single fire perimeter. Fire
intervals that produce the mixed severity fire regimes in the analysis area are highly variable, and are
influenced by proximity to lower elevation areas of high frequency fires, climate, and fuel loading.
Multiple fire scars on lodgepole trees in the project area suggest some lower intensity thinning fires
occurred along with higher intensity stand replacement fires.
Fire frequency determines vegetation successional stage and fuel conditions and past fire shape and size
play a role in fuel connectivity and landscape heterogeneity or homogeneity (Arno et al. 2000, Turner et
al. 1998). Summer persistent snow pack in high elevation forests historically resulted in high fuel
moisture and low potential for fire spread on an annual basis; extended time between fires then cause a
buildup of high fuel loading so that when a fire does become established, fire is more readily able to
spread from surface to crown with potential for canopy consumption in these forests (Romme 1982).
These trends in fire and the relationship between fire and climate in the northern Rocky Mountains
existed in the distant (Heyerdahl et al. 2008) and recent past (Morgan et al. 2008). The last major fires to
occur in the analysis area were in 1847 and in 1867; the entire extent of these two large fires are not
known, but multiple areas from 400 to 800 acres of contiguous fuel arrangement are attributed to these
fires, even though the fires had burned many more total acres when they occurred (USDA 1994).
The majority of Forest Service prescribed fire use has been disposal of logging slash, either through pile
burn or jackpot burn activities. Some prescribed fire use has been for improving stand conditions for
certain vegetation species (e.g. removing conifer succession in grassland-shrubland areas). Understory
burns are considered low intensity fires over the majority of the unit, whereas broadcast burning are
higher intensity fires over the majority of the unit. Minor amounts of fire woodcutter piles have also been
burned. Prescribed fire has occurred on about 11 percent of the analysis area (4,974 acres;).

Timber Management
Timber was harvested in the Flint Foothills project area to support mining, homesteading and settlement
out in the valley. Timber harvest increased greatly from the 1960s through the mid-1980s and has
declined in recent years. Harvest in the last decade has been post and pole thinning and roadside hazard
tree removal.
Timber harvest activities included clearcut, seed tree, shelterwood, selection cut, commercial thinning
(principally post and pole), sanitation (removing mistletoe infected trees) and special harvest (principally
hazard tree removal). Commercial timber harvest has occurred on about 23 percent of the project area
(10,265 acres; see Table 29 below).

Stand Structure Created from Disturbance
Although a combination of disturbance factors contribute to size class distribution in forest types, the
dominate disturbance factor determining current forest structure has been the on-going mountain pine
beetle epidemic. Additional in-depth analysis using the most recent imagery, VMap 25 data, and a model
created to represent current conditions extrapolated from field survey information was used to produce a
more comprehensive view of the forest conditions within the project area. This analysis shows the effects
of beetle mortality to the forested conditions within the project area. Prior to the beetle epidemic
impacting the project area in 2008, there were 2,013 acres considered to be in a stand initiation phase that
had been created from past harvest. With the mortality to overstory trees from the mountain pine beetle,
there has been a dramatic shift from a project area dominated with mature structure to one with a high
percentage of stand initiation structure (wherein the overstory trees are dead and new regeneration of
seedlings has begun; Figure 14). Determining stand initiation structure is relatively straightforward using
25

VMap (Region 1 Existing Vegetation Map Product) is a vegetation map product produced by the Northern Region Geospatial
group.

74

imagery, VMap and analysis tools. However, determining multi-story structure with imagery is not
possible; detailed stand exams and informal surveys, such as that used to evaluate old growth (see below
section) gives an indication that the distribution of stand structure by dominance group displayed in Table
31 may characterize the project area, but may not represent all structural stages with high accuracy. Table
32 depicts what the structural stages look like.)

Old Growth
Old growth stands as defined by Green et al. (1992, errata corrected 2007, 2008, 2011) do occur in the
Flint Foothills project area. Stand exam surveys were completed during the field season of 2010 in a
small portion of the project area. Stand exams were conducted in Douglas-fir-ponderosa pine (781 acres)
and lodgepole pine stands (529 acres). Surveys that discovered old growth was in Douglas-fir/ponderosa
pine stands (see Table 33 and Figures below). In addition to the stand exams, informal surveys in each
proposed unit was conducted by a silviculturist. Informal surveys included measuring basal area and
aging trees to ascertain stand characteristics. Although these surveys noted a few individual scattered old
trees in additional stands that did not have formal stand exam surveys, the occurrence of these trees were
at numbers far below old growth standards; these old trees exist as a component in the mid- to late-seral
size classes. Old growth forests are distinguished by old trees and structural characteristics developed
over time (Green et al. 1992, errata corrected 2007, 2008, 2011). An analysis of old growth over large
landscapes as part of Forest Plan revision using FIA data was completed (Bush et al. 2006). In the Clark
Fork - Flints Landscape, Bush et al. (2006) estimate that 20.9% of the Forest is in old growth with a 90%
confidence interval of 14.1 – 28.1%. This old growth analysis indicates that old growth in the Clark Fork
- Flints is not deficient at the regional scale (Bush et al. 2006). No old growth mapping was performed
specific to Flint Foothill project area beyond the formal stand exam surveys and informal surveys that
were conducted in each proposed unit.

Grazing, Invasive weed treatment
Cattle grazing in the past have been of variable intensity. The effects of grazing may have contributed to
the spread of invasive plants, such as knapweed, although the majority of invasive plant introduction is
from motorized routes (roads and trails). Invasive weeds have been treated and are continuing to be
treated with herbicides; dry grassland parks are susceptible to the threat of invasive weeds, but have not
been impacted due to the success of the weed spray program. (Refer to the Noxious Weeds and Livestock
Grazing analysis.)

Figure 19: Distribution of cover types for the Flint Foothills project area

Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine vegetation type
Historically, many dry coniferous forests were shaped by frequent, low-intensity fire; this included the
warm, dry as well as moist Douglas-fir habitat types of the Flint Foothill project area. This disturbance
80

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

regime sustained open, large-tree dominated structures with diverse and productive understory
communities (Arno 1980, Hessburg and Agee 2003). However, over the last century, fire suppression,
livestock grazing, and high-grade logging, among other factors, have altered the structure and function of
dry coniferous forests across much of western Montana. Forest structure and composition has been most
significantly altered with the lack of fire disturbance; the disruption of the natural fire intervals of the past
have resulted in higher stand densities, multi-layered stands of mostly one species, Douglas-fir.
Dramatically higher stand densities and development of ladder fuels (Covington and Moore 1994, Arno et
al. 1995, Peterson et al. 2009) increase the risk of uncharacteristically severe wildfire (Everett et al. 2000,
Friederici 2003), bark beetle infestations (Fettig et al. 2007), and in some areas such as the Flint Foothill
project area, successional replacement by shade-tolerant competitors (Fischer and Bradley 1987, Mutch et
al. 1993, Habeck 1994, McKenzie et al. 2004).
Along with dry grassland parks, Douglas-fir with very little ponderosa pine dominates the low to middle
elevations of the Flint Foothills project area (17,827 acres or 40 percent of the project area; Table 34). In
contrast to early 1900s conditions of open-grown, larger diameter stands of Douglas-fir and ponderosa
pine, current Douglas-fir stands in the project area are continuous, mid- successional and densely stocked,
and establishing into dry grassland and quaking aspen communities. The increase in extent and continuity
of this coniferous vegetation type has effectively reduced landscape vegetation heterogeneity and
associated biodiversity and put unique habitat types of the Flint Foothills analysis area (most importantly
aspen and seral ponderosa pine communities) at risk of irreversible habitat conversion. Highly dense
stands of Douglas-fir have been affected by western spruce budworm and an increase of individual trees
killed by Douglas-fir bark beetle has been noted in the analysis area through field surveys. Additionally,
mortality of very large ponderosa pine through bark beetles has been noted in the analysis area through
stand exams.
Lodgepole pine vegetation type
Even-aged stands of lodgepole pine currently impacted by the mountain pine beetle epidemic make up
about 41 percent of the Flint Foothill analysis area; virtually all (about 100 percent) of the 18,142 acres of
the lodgepole pine type greater than 5 inches in diameter has been affected by MPB. Walk-through
surveys in the analysis area have found tree ages of all species range from 80-120 years. Under forested
canopies, intermediate and understory trees are rare (mostly suppressed lodgepole pine and Douglas-fir
seedlings and saplings) and average 60-82 years old. New seedlings are well established under the dead
lodgepole pine canopy, created from the available sunlight hitting the forest-floor through the opened
canopy that provided enough heat to open serotinous cones.
Cool habitats dominated by lodgepole pine are common in the Flint Foothills analysis area. Two habitat
types represented the broader cool habitat types dominated by lodgepole pine: habitats where lodgepole
pine was the climax species and occurred as pure stands prior to climax; and mixed conifer habitats where
lodgepole pine was dominant in most stands. Fire disturbances historically characterized the mosaic of
age classes and stand successional stages of cool habitats dominated by lodgepole pine that occurred at
mid to upper elevations; past fire disturbances suggest a more heterogeneous landscape.
Dense lodgepole pine stands dominated cool habitats, and are one of the most common vegetation types
in the Flint Foothills area. Habitat types below 7,500 feet experienced more frequent fire than those above
this elevation. At lower elevations fire perpetuated lodgepole pine by eliminating shade tolerant species
from stands. Fischer and Clayton (1983) indicate that lodgepole pine-dominated areas occurred in patches
ranging from five to hundreds of acres. Elevations above 7,500 feet fires under natural disturbance
regimes were more infrequent, lightning-caused fires that burned with mixed fire severity; the result being
a patch-mosaic of lodgepole pine size classes (Fisher and Bradley 1987).

81

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Prior to the beetle epidemic affecting the project area, over 17,000 acres out of the 18,142 acres of the
lodgepole pine vegetation type were mid- to late seral, indicating a very homogeneous landscape in the
project area. Mountain pine beetle has affected every mature stand of lodgepole pine in the project area;
over 13,000 acres of lodgepole pine stands have had enough overstory mortality of mature trees to begin a
stand initiation phase (see Table 31).
Mixed conifer vegetation type
In the project area, the mid- to high elevation forest are currently homogeneous mature stands, lacking
stand age diversity that comes from past fire disturbances that characterized a more heterogeneous project
area. Blister rust and MPB have accelerated succession to subalpine fir by killing mature whitebark pine,
and MPB has killed the majority of lodgepole in the project area (see Table 34 above); this coupled with
the lack of fire as a recycling agent has caused a major shift in landscape composition and structure from
one of pine to fir and spruce (Keane 2000).
Whitebark pine is a foundation species of high elevation ecosystems, providing snow capture and
retention, carbon storage, increasing biodiversity, and serving as a good source for wildlife. Throughout
its range whitebark pine is experiencing rapid mortality due to several factors including the exotic white
pine blister rust, the native mountain pine beetle infestation, and wildfire exclusion resulting in conifer
encroachment, (USDA 2011f; GYCC 2011). Warming temperatures are thought to further increase the
rate of mortality due to favorable conditions for white pine blister rust and mountain pine beetle (GYCC
2011).
Within the Flint Foothill project area, many of the mature whitebark trees have been killed by mountain
pine beetle over the approximately 683 acres of whitebark stands or mixed conifer (lodgepole pine,
subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce and Douglas-fir) with whitebark trees. There is a strong relationship
between rates of whitebark pine killed by MPB and whitebark pine regeneration density that indicates that
stand-scale gap-phase 27 dynamics may be one response to MPB outbreaks (Larson and Kipfmueller
2010). Although project area specific surveys have not been done in whitebark pine, Forest-wide
monitoring has shown a substantial amount of whitebark regeneration established under more pure
whitebark pine stands, and mature whitebark pine trees persisting in the face of both beetle and blister rust
pressure (USDA 2011f). This establishment of whitebark pine seedlings underneath dead whitebark
mature trees has been observed in the project area. Whitebark pine occurs most commonly at the highest
elevations in the project area, with a few scattered individuals or in smaller (1/4 acre-sized) patches down
to the mid-elevations.
Ongoing successional replacement of whitebark pine with the absence of fire may actually be enhanced
by blister rust and mountain pine beetle kill; this is especially true where fire exclusion reduces the
opportunity for whitebark regeneration (FP FEIS, p. 453). Keane et al. (1994) found that other conifers
replace whitebark pine, in the absence of fire.
Arno (1989) reported wildfire is an important process for whitebark pine with fire return intervals from 50
to 300 years in the Northern Rockies, with fires being highly variable in severity and size. Not all
ecosystems or all Rocky Mountain landscapes have experienced the impacts of fire exclusion as yet; the
lack of impacts may not yet be manifested at the stand level, but are detectable at the landscape level
(Keane et al. 2002). Whitebark pine survives low intensity fires but still benefits from stand replacing fire

‘Gap-phase’ dynamics is defined as where the patchy mortality of mountain pine beetle outbreaks creates numerous forest
openings and canopy gaps of varying sizes, which then allows for natural regeneration to become established (Larsen and
Kipfmueller 2010).

27

82

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

where regeneration is most successful. Keane and Arno (1993) suggest that fire is important in
perpetuating an abundance of whitebark pine.
Whitebark pine was designated in 2011 as a sensitive species in the Northern Region and is addressed in
the Sensitive Plant section of this FEIS.

Desired Condition
Desired condition is a portrayal of the land, resource, or social and economic conditions that are expected
to result in 50-100 years if objectives are achieved. It is a vision of the long-term conditions of the land
(Forest Plan, page 286). The desired condition for the project area is to maintain or improve resilient
forest conditions (Forest Plan, page 43), which is the capacity to return to prior conditions after
disturbance. Resilient forests are those that not only accommodate gradual changes related to climate but
tend to return toward a prior condition after disturbance either naturally or with management assistance.
Within the BDNF, maintaining a diversity of tree species or dominance types, age or size class diversity
within dominance types, and forest density similar to what historic disturbance regimes produced, are
considered underpinnings of a resilient forest (Forest Plan, page 299). In all forest types, seedling and
sapling development and management of stand densities allows for achieving resilient vegetation
communities.
In Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine stands, the desired condition is to have larger diameter (up to 30+
inches dbh), open-grown, widely spaced old trees (Joy and Hutton 1990) in stands averaging 60-80 ft2/ac
of basal area and a range from 40-100 ft2/ac. Many of these stands would be old growth (per Green et al.),
with more than 20 percent of the stands being comprised of ponderosa pine. Periodic thinning or low
intensity prescribed fire would be considered in order to maintain the desired stand densities. These stands
would be resilient to inherent insect and fire disturbances. Smaller trees would be scarce or occur mainly
in openings (as individuals or in clumps) within the tree canopy; openings are natural and would be
expected throughout these types. Shrubs and forbs would be common and would be similar to current
understory vegetation. Species composition favors ponderosa pine, though the dominate species would be
Douglas-fir with the potential for other species such as subalpine fir, lodgepole pine, and Engelmann
spruce to be present. Aspen clones would have adequate growing space where they occur and are a
healthy component of these Douglas-fir dominated stands. Ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir are long-lived
which allows for stand replacement over long periods, and in most cases with partial forest canopy in
place. The forest plan objective for the dry Forest habitat types is to reduce stand densities in the large
size classes of Douglas-fir dry forest communities to maintain or improve resilient forest conditions
(Forest Plan, page 43).
The desired forest condition for lodgepole pine is to perpetuate open to moderately dense stands
averaging 80 square feet of basal area with a range of 60 to 100 basal area (Schmid and Mata 1996;
Schmid and Amman, 1992), at 6 to 12 inches dbh, and intermixed with Douglas-fir and minor
representation of spruce and/or subalpine fir. Overall stand structure for lodgepole pine stands would
continue to be even-aged, single-storied structure with occasional mature Douglas-fir; increase Douglasfir component to the extent possible increasing species diversity. Stand density would be managed to
perpetuate a more open and relatively evenly spaced stand of lodgepole pine to improve individual tree
growth and vigor; reduce crown fire potential; promote younger age class of wind-firm, bark beetleresistant lodgepole pine; and increase the quantity of longer-lived species such as Douglas-fir and aspen.
The desired composition mix is mostly lodgepole pine, Douglas-fir and aspen, with an occasional
Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir. Understory vegetation would be similar to what currently exists on
site. In addition to increasing the resiliency of these stands (Forest Plan, page 43), the forest plan

83

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

objective for the lodgepole pine type is to increase the number of acres in the 0-5 inch dbh class where
insect-infested stands are dead or dying (Forest Plan, page 44).
The desired condition for mid-elevation mixed conifer stands is to maintain a patch mosaic of forested
size classes. Forest vegetation structure provides the basis for maintaining or restoring forested ecological
communities of sufficient diversity to provide for the viability of the majority of species that occur or
make use of the forested types on the BDNF (FP FEIS p. 473). Creating openings suitable for early seral
conifer species establishment, such as lodgepole pine and whitebark pine, is one objective with this
desired condition. Although this proposal targets mid-elevation stands rather than high elevation stands,
there would be opportunities for whitebark pine establishment (which is highly desired) through Clark’s
nutcracker seed caching. Fires would ensure a richer mosaic of stands in different successional stages,
contributing to the long-term viability of the early seral whitebark pine (Murray et al. 2000) and
lodgepole pine.

Regulatory Framework
Current management direction for the Beaverhead National Forest is found in the 2009 Revised
Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest Plan (FP). The plan describes forest-wide goals and objectives,
standards and guidelines, and direction for subunits of the forest referred to as “Management Areas.” The
project area is located in two subunits: Flint Foothills Management Area and the Flint Uplands
Management Area. No treatment units occur within the Flint Uplands MA.
Table 35: Forest Plan Management Area Direction
MANAGEMENT
AREA

DIRECTION

Flint Foothills
Management Area
(pg. 113)

This area is managed for timber production, livestock grazing, and dispersed
recreation. This management area provides a roaded setting for recreation in
mix of altered and natural appearing scenery (FP, p.113).

Flint Uplands
Management Area
(PG. 115)

This area is managed for a mix of semi-primitive motorized and nonmotorized recreation and secure high elevation wildlife habitat. Vegetation is
managed primarily through prescribed and natural fire with exceptions in
roaded settings where some harvest may take place (FP, p.115).

Other Laws and Regulations
The regulatory framework for the management of vegetative resources on the Beaverhead-Deerlodge
National Forest includes the following:
Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974
The Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act requires the following: “It is the policy of
Congress that all forested lands in the National Forest System, be maintained in appropriate forest cover
with species of trees, degree of stocking, rate of growth and conditions of stand designed to secure the
maximum benefits of multiple use sustained yield management in accordance with land management
plans.” (RRPA, Sec. 3(d)(1) and NFMA sec. 4).
National Forest Management Act of 1976
The National Forest Management Act of 1976 (NFMA) and implementing regulations requires the
following findings to be made when making project-level decisions involving timber harvest:

84

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Suitability for Timber Production (16 USC 1604(k))
No timber harvest, other than salvage sales or sales to protect other multiple-use values, shall occur on
lands not suited for timber production. There is a mix of salvage treatments and green tree thinning, with
all timber harvest activities are in areas suitable for timber production.
Timber Harvest on National Forest Lands (16 USC 1604(g)(3)(E))
A Responsible Official may authorize site-specific projects and activities to harvest timber on National
Forest System lands only where;
a. Soil, slope or other watershed conditions will not be irreversibly damaged (16 USC 1604(g)(3)(E)(i)).
Mitigation measures have been provided in the soil analysis and would be incorporated into the project
implementation design to insure that soil, slope, and watershed conditions would be adequately protected
(Soils Analysis, project file).
b. There is assurance that the lands can be adequately restocked within 5 years after final regeneration
harvest (16 USC 1604(g)(3)(E)(ii)). The desired reforestation goal for the seed tree harvest units is a
minimum of 200 tree seedlings per acre by natural regeneration within 5 years after all treatments are
completed. Monitoring of regeneration success would begin one year after all proposed actions have been
implemented (generally late summer, early fall). Monitoring would continue on a schedule of Year 1, Year
3, and Year 5. By exam Year 3, if exams indicate that natural regeneration is not progressing toward the
desired seedling per acre goal, planting of trees suitable for the site would be considered if natural
regeneration levels were short of minimum stocking levels (the 200 tree seedlings per acre). In some
units, planting of ponderosa pine regardless of natural regeneration success is planned to ensure the
desired mixed of species occurs. The salvage cut harvest units already have begun the stand initiation
stage (are reforested), and are not considered a regeneration harvest but rather an intermediate treatment.
After the salvage cut harvest has removed the dead lodgepole pine overstory, a post-harvest monitoring
evaluation would be done to ensure that the existing unit understory seedlings and saplings remained at
acceptable stocking rates after the harvest activities had occurred.
c. Protection is provided for streams, stream banks, shorelines, lakes, wetlands, and other bodies of water
from detrimental changes in water temperatures, blockages of water courses, and deposits of sediment,
where harvests are likely to seriously and adversely affect water conditions or fish habitat (16 USC
1604(g)(3)(E)(iii)). Protection is provided for streams, stream banks, wetlands and other bodies of water
from detrimental changes. Protection of stream, riparian and fish habitats would be assured through best
management practices, streamside protection rules and project specific mitigation (Hydrology and
Fisheries analyses, project file).
d. The harvesting system to be used is not selected primarily because it will give the best dollar return of
the greatest output of timber (16 USC 1604(g)(3)(E)(iv)). The harvesting system proposed is the system
determined to meet the purpose and need most effectively. The economic feasibility of this project was
not the reason for developing the alternatives (refer to the Economic analysis).
Clearcutting and Even-aged Management (16 USC 1604(G)(3)(F))
Ensure that clearcutting, seed tree cutting, shelterwood cutting, and other cuts designed to regenerate an
even-aged stand of timber would be used as a cutting method on National Forest System lands only where
applicable. Due to the extensive mortality from mountain pine beetles, the stand initiation phase has
already happened (reforestation established) in the lodgepole pine dominated vegetation type. Salvage of
these trees would occur protecting the already established regeneration, and would set the stands up for

85

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

future management options. Live trees relatively free from insect and disease infestation and of good form
would be retained wherever possible.
To meet the Forest Plan standard for timber management (FP, p. 39) even-aged harvesting would occur on
lands suitable for timber production as it is the appropriate and optimum method for the timber type and
would contribute to meeting vegetative objectives for the site. Such harvest would be consistent with the
protection of soil, watershed, fish, wildlife, recreation, and aesthetic resources. Harvest areas would be
blended to the extent practicable with the natural terrain. The maximum size of openings created by one
regeneration harvest operation would not exceed 40 acres, except where a natural event, such as the
current mountain pine beetle epidemic has created a larger opening. A regeneration harvest larger than 40
acres may be allowed after public notice, and review and approval by the officer one level above the
responsible official. In this project, there is seed tree harvest proposed that exceed 40 acres that are
regeneration harvest units. Salvage cut harvest is not considered clearcutting or even-age management,
but is defined as an intermediate treatment, wherein the removal of dead trees does not affect the desired
stocking levels of live trees. In this project, the desired stocking levels of live trees exist naturally from
the lodgepole pine serotinous cones that provided the seed source for the current seedlings in areas
dominated by lodgepole pine. Public notice is also required when salvaging units larger than 40 acres.
Consideration of the best available science (2004 Interpretive Rule for Planning, 219.35a)
The vegetation analysis is based on a thorough review of relevant scientific information, consideration of
responsible opposing views and the acknowledgement of incomplete or unavailable information,
scientific uncertainty, and risk. Relevant references and considerations are cited at the end of this report
and uncertainties have been disclosed and placed in appropriate context.
Forest Service Handbook (FSH 2409.17-94-1)
“Harvest cutting is done to carry out the intent of the Forest Plan. The objectives of harvest cutting (are):
develop desired forest conditions over time that “benefit all allocated forest resources; utilize the timber
resource; and sustain ecological function.” All three objectives must be considered when applying a
harvest treatment. In this proposed project, the commercial harvest activities are designed to achieve the
following:
•

Remove dead and dying lodgepole pine trees to reduce the amount of carbon on the site;

•

Control of tree density, species composition, and understory tree development;

•

In the long-term, regenerate and manage the forested areas for more resilience to natural
disturbances.

Guidance on Consideration of Climate Change in Project-Related NEPA
Council on Environmental Quality
The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) has issued draft guidance for public consideration and
comment on “Consideration of the Effects of Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas Emissions” (Federal
Register, Volume 75, Number 35, page 8046). This draft guidance is not yet applicable to this analysis.
Moreover, CEQ explicitly excluded Federal land and resource management from the draft guidance.
Rather, the CEQ solicited public comment on the appropriate means of assessing the greenhouse gas
emissions and sequestration that are affected by Federal land and resource management decisions.

86

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Forest Service
The Forest Service has prepared agency guidance on “Climate Change Considerations in Project Level
NEPA Analysis” (http://www.fs.fed.us/emc/nepa/climate_change/includes/cc_nepa_guidance.pdf). In
general, that guidance recognizes that while some actions may warrant qualitative or even quantitative
analysis of the effects of an action on climate change, some actions are at such a minor scale that the
effects would be meaningless to a reasoned decision. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals recently agreed
with that reasoning, finding that a project of similar scope as that proposed here did not warrant detailed
analysis of the projects potential impacts on climate change (Hapner v. Tidwell, No. 09-35896 (9th Cir.
2010)).
Other Contextual Considerations
The top three anthropogenic (human-caused) contributors to greenhouse gas emissions (from 1970-2004)
are: fossil fuel combustion, deforestation, and agriculture (IPCC 2007, page 36). Land use change,
primarily the conversion of forests to other land uses (deforestation), is the second leading source of
human-caused greenhouse gas emissions globally (Denman et al. 2007, page 512). Loss of tropical forests
of South America, Africa, and Southeast Asia is the largest source of land-use change emissions (Denman
et al. 2007, page 518; Houghton 2005).
Unlike other forest regions that are a net source of carbon to the atmosphere, U.S. forests are a strong net
carbon sink, absorbing more carbon than they emit (Houghton 2003; US EPA 2010, pages 7-14; Heath et
al. 2011). For the period 2000 to 2008, U.S. forests sequestered (removed from the atmosphere, net)
approximately 481.1 teragrams 28 (Tg) of carbon dioxide per year, with harvested wood products
sequestering an additional 101 teragrams per year (Heath et al. 2011). Our national forests accounted for
approximately 30 percent of that net annual sequestration. National forests contribute approximately 3 Tg
carbon dioxide to the total stored in harvested wood products compared to about 92 Tg from harvest on
private lands. Carbon flux rates have not yet been calculated for the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National
Forest, but the extensive recent disturbances from bark beetles and forest fires would have sharply
weakened the pre-disturbance sequestration rates. Within the US, land use conversions from forest to
other uses (primarily for development or agriculture) are identified as the primary human activities
exerting negative pressure on the carbon sink that currently exists in this country’s forests (Ryan et al.
2010; McKinley et al. 2011; Conant et al. 2007).
This proposal does not fall within any of these primary contributors of global greenhouse gas emissions
nor is it similar to the primary human activities exerting negative pressure on the carbon sink that
currently exists in US forests. The affected forests would remain forests, not converted to other land uses,
and long-term forest services and benefits would be maintained.
This project and proposed activities are consistent with the Forest Plan and all other applicable laws,
policy, and regulations.

Environmental Consequences
Methodology
This analysis will consider the projected trends for ponderosa pine-Douglas-fir, lodgepole pine and
mixed-conifer vegetative communities with the absence of treatment (no action) and the action

28

87

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

alternatives. FVS29 modeling was used to estimate the 50 year trend for these stands. FVS is one of the
most widely used forest management growth models, and simulates a wide array of different forest
processes, including natural disturbance process such as insects, and includes a fire and fuel extension.
The fundamental disadvantage of any forest yield model is that it’s not linked to the underlying causes of
productivity: carbon and nutrient cycles, moisture regime, and climate (Monserud 2003).

Analysis Area Spatial and Temporal Boundaries
The spatial vegetation analysis area encompasses 44,522 acres (Forest Service ownership 37,010 acres;
private ownership, 7,512 acres); in essence, the project area is Forest Service NFS lands on the entire
north end of the Flint Mountain Range. The analysis area includes all proposed activities, and is within
the Flint Foothills Management Area and Flint Uplands Management Area. The temporal timeframe
covers the span of time in which the effects of the proposed actions were analyzed. This period takes into
account the cumulative effects of all actions up to the present, and extends into the future for 50 years.

Alternative 1 – No Action
Direct, Indirect and Cumulative Effects
The No Action Alternative provides the resource specialist a means for evaluating the current ecosystem
conditions as a baseline. In this alternative, the proposed salvage of dead and dying lodgepole pine stands
by salvage cut harvest, the seed tree harvest and commercial thin of Douglas-fir/ponderosa pine stands,
the precommercial thins, and the prescribed burning of mid-elevation mixed conifer stands would not
occur. The direct, indirect, and cumulative effects of no action would be the forest stand progression
trending away from the desired future condition.
Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine vegetation type
In absence of a stand-replacing fire event, Douglas-fir stands in the Flint Foothill project area would
continue to increase in density and canopy layering. Where the densest Douglas-fir stands occur,
individual trees Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine may die (from competition or insects), continuing the
current trend in the project area. When either of these two species dies by bark beetle, the tree attacked is
usually one of the larger diameter trees within the stand of trees. The dead tree or groups of trees then
create canopy gaps that provide opportunity for an increase in seedlings and sapling-sized trees to
develop; usually the size of these openings favors Douglas-fir regeneration. As stands progress over time,
canopy gap areas would begin to fill in as Douglas-fir regeneration is established and trees grow, resulting
in a decline in other species such as the early seral ponderosa pine, aspen, shrubs, and other herbaceous
vegetation. The density of trees within the project area would increase causing a decline in individual tree
vigor.
In approximately 60 to 80 years, it is possible that some of the Douglas-fir stands may attain old growth
characteristics (Koch 1996). FVS29 indicates that current non-old stands (that are mature stands with 15
inch dominant trees) would not attain old growth characteristics in a 50 year period due to mortality from
bark beetles. Existing old growth may be reduced due to mortality to large trees from bark beetles, with
large ponderosa pine trees potentially becoming scarce; 50 year trend modeling (with FVS) of one stand
that is currently old growth estimated a reduction of ponderosa pine and the stand losing enough large

Stand Prognosis Model. The Eastern Montana Variant was used to model stands within the project area (see Vegetation Report
in the project file).

88

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

trees to fall out of old growth status (see ). The future trend due to beetle-caused large tree mortality is for
fewer acres of low elevation old growth in the project area.
Continued disruptions of the past mean fire interval of 20 years would affect forest structure and
composition. The lack of fire coupled with insect disturbances and individual stand dynamics continue to
favor increasing densities and layering of Douglas-fir, and discriminate against the early seral species
ponderosa pine. FVS29 modeling shows that with one fire disturbance, ponderosa pine increases in
presence within the stand, and without fire ponderosa pine is reduced.
With increasing Douglas-fir stand density and the multi-layering of Douglas-fir trees, both western spruce
budworm and Douglas-fir beetle would continue to cause mortality. An increase in mortality due to
Douglas-fir beetle can currently be attributed to the heavy and repeated defoliation from spruce budworm,
which then may lead to additional increases in beetle activity and large Douglas-fir tree mortality (as is
evident from the current trend). An increase in other bark beetles (specifically MPB and western pine
beetle) in ponderosa pine can be contributed to the sustained and increasing stand densities and associated
loss in individual tree vigor due to competition from principally Douglas-fir (Figure 20 and Figure 21).
Dramatically higher stand densities and development of ladder fuels increase the risk of wildfire, bark
beetle infestations, and in some areas, successional replacement by shade-tolerant competitors (Fiedler et
al. 2010). It is expected that with the no action alternative, mortality in Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine
would not only continue, but increase. The increase in mortality is expected in the analysis area given the
current trend in local climatic conditions coupled with the current dense and multi-layered stand
conditions common in the Flint Foothill area for the Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine vegetation
community.

Lodgepole pine vegetation type
Lodgepole pine stand conditions in the Flint Foothill project area are conducive for continuing the
epidemic populations of MPB, and without a change in over-winter temperatures to colder extremes, the
beetle attacks would continue until the host species of the appropriate diameter (about 5 inches and larger)
have been exhausted. This trend with the MBP epidemic has been seen on other locations nearer to the
epicenter of the epidemic in the Butte area of the BDNF. Within the Flint Foothill project area on NFS

89

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

lands, Table 27 above displays that virtually all (about 100 percent) of the 17,938 acres of the lodgepole
pine type greater than 5 inches in diameter has been affected by MPB.
Incidental mature lodgepole pine escaping attack by mountain pine beetle would grow vigorously; other
species that occur in the stand (Douglas-fir, subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce and aspen) would also
increase growth. Understory herbaceous vegetation (grasses, shrubs, and forbs) has thrived with the
increased sunlight with the majority of the lodgepole pine overstory now dead. Natural regeneration has
already begun and is well established in ‘canopy gap’ areas where enough warming sunlight has opened
serotinous lodgepole pine cones. This natural regeneration would continue in the lodgepole pine type.
Most of the dead lodgepole pine will be on the ground in 10 years (Mitchell and Preisler state that dead
trees fall over 5-15 years after killed; the peak mortality year was 2009). This deadfall will result in large
surface fuel accumulation. This fuel accumulation will be variable, but is estimated to be between 40 and
80 tons per acre of 5 inch and larger material, with some areas exceeding 100 tons per acre of material.
Over decades, when there is a significant component of large down wood, there would be an increase in
fire severity during high-intensity fire events (Jenkins et al. 2007). As the fuel load changes from standing
dead to a horizontal profile, the natural regeneration would have physical barriers, and coupled with the
staggering in time of canopy gaps, create a variable height and age lodgepole pine stand, with scattered
older trees of the few lodgepole pine trees not affected by MPB and other species of trees. This
progression with the lodgepole pine type is expected to occur on about 17,000 acres within the analysis
area.
The extent of the bark beetle epidemic and lodgepole pine tree mortality in the Flint Foothill area would
result in a profound change in the condition and arrangement of forest biomass (Kaufmann et al. 2008).
Crown fires are possible both before an epidemic and while the red needles remain on the trees
(Kaufmann et al. 2008). Mortality due to the mountain pine beetle epidemic changes the fuel complex or
characteristics in terms of fuel load and structure, microclimate and fuel moisture, and fire potential.
These characteristics vary with the intensity of the beetle attack, initial stand conditions, and the time
following the attack.
The 50 year trend for lodgepole pine vegetation type, as modeled with FVS29, is for small (mean)
diameter stands that would have some variability in size due to the regeneration being impeded by the
horizontal profile of downed trees from the MPB epidemic. This would result in most lodgepole pine
vegetation type stands in the project area to be coming into the mid-seral pole-sized size class right at year
50.
Mixed conifer vegetation type
The MPB epidemic would continue to kill whitebark pine, especially individual trees stressed from white
pine blister rust. However, with whitebark pine occurring at higher elevations, the colder climatic
conditions may prevent all of the mature whitebark pine trees from being killed; this is a different
potential trajectory in the project area as compared to lodgepole pine. The resulting fuel profile associated
with dying pine trees within the mixed conifer vegetation type is more complex than that described in the
lodgepole pine type. Accumulation of dead fuel would be in juxtaposition with live fuel, rather than the
more straightforward accumulation of dead fuel loading with pure lodgepole pine stands. Fires that burn
at higher elevations are known to have beneficial effects to whitebark pine with the potential for
whitebark pine natural regeneration (Arno 1986; Keane et al. 1994; Murray et al. 2000; Keane 2000;
Keane and Parsons 2010).
Additionally, there is a strong relationship between rates of whitebark pine killed by MPB and whitebark
pine regeneration density that indicates that stand-scale gap-phase dynamics may be one response to MPB

90

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

outbreaks (Larson and Kipfmueller 2010). Forest-wide monitoring has shown a substantial amount of
whitebark regeneration established under more pure whitebark pine stands with MPB mortality (USDA
2011f). The same Forest-wide monitoring shows that whitebark regeneration does not become established
in mixed conifer stands (USDA 2011f). In more mixed conifer stands on the BDNF, blister rust and MPB
have accelerated succession to subalpine fir by killing mature whitebark pine, with a lack of adequate
gap-size to allow whitebark pine natural regeneration to occur. It is anticipated that the stand dynamics in
mixed conifer stands with blister rust and MPB –caused mortality to whitebark pine and MPB mortality
to lodgepole pine, coupled with the lack of fire as a recycling agent, would cause a major shift in
landscape composition and structure from one of pine to fir and spruce (Keane 2000) (Figure 22).

Figure 22: Mix of live and dead whitebark pine with live and dying
subalpine fir; little opportunity for early seral whitebark pine
establishment.

As most of the mixed conifer vegetation type includes a large component of lodgepole pine, the 50 year
trend for lodgepole pine vegetation type, as modeled with FVS29, is for small (mean) diameter stands that
would have some variability in size due to the regeneration being impeded by the horizontal profile of
downed trees from the MPB epidemic. The fuel profile trajectory created from the current MPB epidemic
is projected by FVS to be relatively unchanged in 50 years. The trend is that most of the lodgepole pine in
the mixed conifer type stands would be attaining mid-seral pole-sized size class at year 50. Forest-wide
monitoring has shown that whitebark pine seedlings are expected to become established under more pure
stands or pockets of whitebark pine (USDA 2011f); these trees would likely still be in a sapling size (or
early seral) condition. Fir and spruce are expected to become well established in the partial shade
conditions of mixed conifer vegetation types, and in 50 years are expected to be the dominant species.
Forest Carbon Cycling and Storage
The acreage of lodgepole pine forests currently affected by the MPB epidemic is extensive throughout the
Flint Foothill analysis area. As a major disturbance on the landscape, the bark beetle epidemic and
associated large-scale lodgepole pine mortality is affecting overall forest structure, development, and
forest carbon storage. Due to the amount of recent dead and dying trees, it is estimated that there would

91

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

be a decrease in the net ecosystem productivity (NEP) with the No Action Alternative. This assumption is
based on recent scientific literature on forest carbon storage which will be discussed more in this section.
These stands have been converted from a carbon sink to a carbon source to the atmosphere. Under the no
action alternative, these areas would remain that way until the carbon uptake by new tree regeneration
exceeds the emissions from decomposing dead organic material. Barring a large-scale fire, these stands
would likely remain a carbon source for several years or longer depending on the amount of dead biomass
left on the site, the length of time before new trees become re-established, and their rate of growth once
trees start to grow. As new trees become established, the amount of carbon would accumulate rapidly for
several decades. The net ecosystem productivity would increase until reaching an intermediate age, then
gradually begin declining but remain positive until impacted by future disturbances (Law et al. 2003).
Recent scientific literature confirms some general patterns of forest carbon storage and release over the
period of forest stand development and natural or induced disturbances. For large-scale context, our
nations’ forests have and continue to sequester vast amounts of carbon (nationally they are a net carbon
sink, sequestering far more carbon than is released), equivalent to approximately 10 percent of annual
carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels (Heath and Smith 2004; Birdsey et al. 2006). Law et
al. (2003) looked at changes in carbon storage and fluxes for ponderosa pine stands in central Oregon.
They evaluated the NEP, which is the balance between being a net carbon source and net carbon storage
(referred to as carbon sink). Their evaluation concluded that NEP is lowest and negative (carbon source)
in young stands (9 to 23 years), moderate in young stands (56 to 89 years), highest in mature stands (95 to
106 years), and low in old stands (190 to 360 years). Most mature and old stands remained a net sink of
carbon. Pregitzer and Euskirchen (2004) synthesized results from 120 separate studies of carbon pools
and carbon fluxes for boreal, temperate, and tropical biomes. They found that in temperate forests, NEP is
lowest (more towards source) and most variable in young stands (0 to 30 years), highest (more towards
carbon sink) in stands 31 to 70 years, and declines thereafter as stands age. These studies also reveal a
general pattern of total carbon stocks declining after disturbance, increasing rapidly during intermediate
years, and then declining over time until another significant disturbance (timber harvest or tree mortality
resulting from drought, fire, insects, disease or other natural disturbances) kills large numbers of trees and
again converts the stands to a carbon source. In this situation, carbon emissions from the decay of dead
biomass exceed the amount of carbon removed from the atmosphere by photosynthesis within the stand.
Over the long-term (centuries) net carbon storage is often zero if stands regenerate after disturbance
because re-growth of trees recovers the carbon lost in the disturbance and in decomposition of trees killed
by the disturbance (Kashian et al. 2006). Recent analysis at the Regional-scale has indicated that the
BDNF is increasing in ecosystem forest carbon stocks (USFS 2015).
Because mountain pine beetles kill larger lodgepole pine trees preferentially, these killed trees represented
proportionally larger values of carbon stocks (sequestration) and above-ground tree carbon production in
killed trees within stands; more and larger trees killed results in greater decreases in carbon sequestration.
Stand-level carbon can be recovered to pre-outbreak values in 25 years or less; it takes 50-160 years to
recover to values shown in simulations where stands were unattacked. The size distribution of surviving
trees can shorten this timeframe; a greater number of smaller trees store carbon at a greater rate through
an amplified growth rate when compared to larger survivors, having a greater capacity to take advantage
of increased resource availability (Pfeifer et al. 2010). Successful tree regeneration is a much more critical
factor in recovering carbon than stand age class distribution or tree density. As long as post-disturbance
lodgepole pine stands support enough trees to have the structural characteristics of forests rather than
shrublands, grasslands, or other kinds of non-forest vegetation, they would recover pre-disturbance
carbon stocks quickly and the landscape would be resistant to long-term changes in carbon storage (Ryan
et al. 2008).

92

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

For the short term, onsite carbon stocks may remain higher under the No Action alternative than under the
Action Alternatives. Nevertheless, caution is advised against interpreting carbon inventory maintenance
or gains from deferred or foregone timber harvest in any specific forest or stand as affecting atmospheric
concentrations of greenhouse gases. This only holds true if harvest does not occur elsewhere in the world
to supply the same world demand for timber. The result can be a net carbon impact if the timber is
replaced in the marketplace with higher carbon source products such as steel or concrete or is harvested in
a manner that does not result in prompt reforestation (Ryan et al. 2010; McKinley et al. 2011; Harmon
2009).
The risk of some high mortality disturbance events is greater under the No Action Alternative. The longterm ability of forests to persist as net carbon sinks is uncertain. Drought stress, forest fires, insect
outbreaks and other disturbances may substantially reduce existing carbon stock. Climate change
threatens to amplify risks to forest carbon stocks by increasing the frequency, size, and severity of these
disturbances (Boisvenue and Running 2010). Recent research indicates that these risks may be
particularly acute for forests of the Northern Rockies (Boisvenue and Running 2010). Increases in the
severity of disturbances, combined with projected climatic changes, may limit post-disturbance forest
regeneration, shift forests to non-forested vegetation, and possibly convert large areas from an existing
carbon sink to a carbon source (Galik and Jackson 2009). Providing for prompt reforestation after
disturbance ensures that forests become sinks again in the future and can speed carbon recovery. The No
Action Alternative foregoes such climate change adaptation actions.

Alternative 2 – Proposed Action
There is a total of 5,703 acres (see table below) combined vegetation treatment over 93 units in the
proposed action, with the purpose to move toward achievement of Forest Plan goals and objectives for

Specifically this project would help achieve the following Forest Plan goals and objectives for vegetation:
•

There is a need to create early seral conditions to maintain or improve resilient forest
conditions.
o

Creating a mosaic of age classes would improve resiliency to natural disturbances. The
Forest Plan forested vegetation objectives for Douglas-fir and lodgepole pine types are to

93

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

"increase the number of acres in the 0- to 5-inch dbh class…where…insect infested
stands of trees are dead or dying" 30 (Forest Plan, p. 43-44).
•

There is a need to reduce forest densities to maintain or improve resilient forest conditions.
o

The Forest Plan objective for forested vegetation is to “reduce forest density in large size
classes of dry forest communities and in some lodgepole pine communities to maintain
and improve resilient forest conditions” (Forest Plan, p. 43).

In addition to the above goals, Standard 2 for Timber Management states that regeneration harvest
operation shall not exceed 40 acres; harvest area may be larger than 40 acres after public notice, and
review and approval by the officer one level above the responsible official. Alternative 2 has 3 units that
exceed 40 acres in size (1ST, 5ST, and 27ST; see below table). In addition, FSM 2471.1 states that with
salvage harvest 40 acres may be exceeded without public review and Regional Forester approval provided
the public is notified and the environmental analysis supports the decision. There are 12 units that exceed
40 acres in size that are salvage units (Table 37).

The forest stands with past regeneration harvest adjacent to the proposed units that exceed 40 acres are

designed to encompass past fire and insect disturbance patterns that created a patch mosaic of stands. The
large units proposed for treatment are an indication of the variability in size and shape of these past
disturbances. Large patch sizes that comprise the units that exceed 40 acres provide the structure and
arrangement of lodgepole pine forests that naturally occur within landscape that is the Flint Foothills
project area.

Direct and Indirect Effects
Precommercial thin of old harvest areas
Pre-commercial thins (non-commercial) would be used to treat naturally regenerated and planted trees in
previously harvested stands in 20 units over 1,048 acres. Ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir and then lodgepole
pine (in order of preference) would be retained to enhance species diversity thereby improving long-term
resiliency of these stands. Trees would be thinned to a 9-foot to 16-foot spacing (300 to 500 trees per
acre). Lopping and scattering of branches would be included activities.
The objective of the thinning in old harvest units (from the 1960s through the 1970s) is to increase growth
and improve resiliency by reducing stand density with the proposed treatment (FP p. 43). Current stocking
in these areas is quite variable, from 300 and 1,000 trees per acre. The best tree (defined as free-growing
and full crowned) would be retained. These old harvest areas are principally lodgepole pine sapling-sized
stands, although some units have other conifers, specifically Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, subalpine fir
and Engelmann spruce.
The direct effect would be the cutting down about 0 to 500 trees per acre, retaining about 300 to 500 trees
per acre, with an average of about 400 trees per acre. The indirect effect would be to improve growing
conditions for the remaining trees, thereby increasing resiliency. FVS modeling has indicated that in 50
years these stands would be mid- to late seral sized (small sawtimber) stands of trees.
Commercial thin Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine stands
The proposed prescription for the commercial thin of Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine stands is to reduce
the current stand densities that average between 90 to 220 square feet of basal area per acre (see Figure
24) to an initial, post-harvest density that averages between 40 to 60 square feet of basal area per acre
over approximately 1,149 acres (Table 38). Old growth stands would have a higher basal area retained,
and is discussed in more detail below. Basal area is a measurement of stand density, where a given area of
trees is described by the cross-section (in square feet) of those trees. The thin is of the overstory (sawlogsized) trees up to 20 inches in diameter. No trees greater than 20 inches would be cut.
Additionally, the proposed prescription would remove most of the smaller trees (less than 4 inches in
diameter), principally through an understory burn after the proposed thin. Although basal area is the
measure used for density in this analysis, the less than 4 inch size trees can account for a high level of tree
stocking on an individual stand basis. An example of this is in Unit 59C, where 240 trees per acre with an
average diameter of 1 inch account for less than 2 square feet of basal area of the total basal area for the
stand.

The proposal would convert dense (high basal area) and multi-storied stands (with layering of different
aged trees) into open-grown, widely spaced trees. The resultant post-treatment stand structure would be
similar to what would have been created with the 20-year interval fire disturbance regime described in the
existing condition of this analysis. Treatments that approximate desired conditions create relatively open,
large-tree dominated structures primarily composed of seral species (Feidler et al. 2010). Poor growth,
high stand densities and the amount of Douglas-fir are correlated to infestation levels of Douglas-fir
beetle (Fettig et al. 2007). Slow growth and tree competition (with a reduction in tree vigor with increases
of stand density) are also correlated to MPB levels in ponderosa pine, with thinning to reduce tree
competition and increase individual tree growth potentially being critical for long term prevention of
mountain pine beetle outbreaks in ponderosa pine (Fettig et al. 2007).
Post thinning conditions would find widely spaced large trees with smaller trees scarce or occurring as
clumps in openings within the tree canopy. Shrubs and forbs would be common, but low growing. Surface
fuels would be at 12 to 15 tons per acre. Species composition would favor ponderosa pine, although
Douglas-fir is common with other species present such as aspen, lodgepole pine and Engelmann spruce.
Aspen clones would be provided adequate growing space where they occur, with conifers less than 20
inches in diameter removed within and adjacent to the clone.
A total of 157 acres of old growth stands are included in the commercial thin treatments; these acres
would meet minimum criteria for old growth after treatment, consistent with Forest Plan standards (FP p.
44). Old growth is defined using the minimum criteria required in Green et al., errata corrected 2007
(page 12 of that document, which is Table 3: Eastern Montana Zone Old Growth Type Characteristics).
Table 39 below discloses the pre- and post- treatment minimum criteria conditions of each proposed unit,
and that the post treatment conditions would still meet the criteria of old growth.

Post thinning conditions for the old growth stands are as described above, with widely spaced large
diameter trees retained at 60 to 80 square feet of basal area with small trees primarily occurring in
clumps. Additional younger, mature large trees would be retained to perpetuate large trees on the site
(hence, the higher basal area retained over the non-old growth commercial thin units). The old growth
32

Age from Green et al.for both old growth types is a minimum of 200 years old for the large trees. As the large trees would be retained, the
age post treatment would remain the same.
33
The number of trees per acre are a minimum of 4 >or= to 17”DBH for OG Type 1 and 5 >or= to 19”DBH for OG Type 2 (Green et al. 2007
errata corrected 2011). As the large trees would be retained, the number of trees per acre above the minimum diameter would stay the same.
34
Minimum basal area for both old growth types in this proposal is 60 square feet (Green et al. 2007 errata corrected 2011).

98

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

structural attributes would change from a multi-storied stand with layers of different sized trees to a
single-storied, large diameter stand with small pockets of seedling to sapling trees. One example of a high
amount of understory is in Unit 25C where 150 trees per acre are currently under the large diameter, old
growth trees. This understory would be mostly removed with this proposal, converting the multi-story
canopy stand to a single-story canopy stand with small pockets of seedling-sapling sized trees.
The desired result of developing resilient old growth conditions through management techniques is to
maintain composition and structure that conforms to the Green et al. (1992, errata corrected 2007) old
growth definition (FP FEIS p. 1052) reversing the trend described in Alternative 1 where larger diameter
trees succumb to bark beetles, and existing old growth stands may become non-old growth. FVS
modeling of stand 85202013 within Unit 23C indicates that without treatment and continued high MPB
activity, the stand would fall out of old growth status in 50 years with a reduction of ponderosa pine in the
stand. The 50 year trend (using FVS modeling) for prescribing a thin with the same old growth stand and
high MPB activity indicates that the stand would still be old growth in 50 years, and the ponderosa pine
component would increase.
The direct effect for the 1,149 acres of commercial thin would be the cutting down of about 50 to 160
square feet of basal area of principally Douglas-fir (with salvage of dead lodgepole in some units) and
removal of most of the smaller diameter understory. The indirect effect would be to improve growing
conditions for the remaining trees, thereby increasing resiliency and promoting opportunity for quicker
development of old growth stands where the minimum criteria is not met, and perpetuating old growth for
the long term where currently there is old growth.
In addition, a direct effect would be the removal of conifer competition to upland aspen clones, which
would indirectly improve growing conditions for aspen and creating the opportunity for seedlings to
develop into large trees.
The 50 year trend for the commercial thin non-old growth stands would be large, open-grown ponderosa
pine and Douglas-fir stands that are resilient to inherent disturbance regimes (insects and fire) as is
described in the Desired Condition section of this analysis (Figure 26). FVS29 modeling of a commercial
thin and prescribed burn shows that in 50 years there would be widely spaced trees (up to 30+ inches in
diameter with basal area ranging from 40 to 100 square feet per acre). An increase of ponderosa pine
resulting from the proposed treatments is shown with FVS modeling. If the non-old growth stands meet
age requirements per Green et al. (1992, errata corrected 2007)in 50 years, these stands would be
classified as old growth, as FVS modeling indicates they would meet the structural definitions. Mean
diameters for these stands would more than double, which means that smaller trees are not common or if
present, occur in openings within the tree canopy, and that there are larger diameter trees than without
treatment. Shrubs and forbs are common, but are low growing. Species composition favors ponderosa
pine, although Douglas-fir is common with other species present such as aspen, lodgepole pine and
Engelmann spruce. Aspen clones are provided adequate growing space where they occur, and are a
healthy component of these thinned stands in 50 years. Without additional future disturbances that are
similar to the natural fire intervals of the past, the stand would revert back to the stand conditions
described in the no action alternative.

Forest Plan Wildlife Standard 3 (FP, page 48) is met in the Douglas-fir commercial thin treatments with
Alternative 2 through: retention enough live trees greater than 15 inches in diameter in the commercial
thin and seed tree units to meet Forest Plan retention requirements; retention of all snags greater than 15
inches in diameter in all units where it is safe to do so; and no trees (dead or alive) larger than 20 inches
diameter would be removed. Forest Plan Wildlife Standard 4 (FP, page 48) does not apply to this
treatment type. Snag inventories outside of the proposed treatment units were not conducted. (Snag
numbers per unit is displayed in Table 38.)
Seed Tree with reserve trees in Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine stands
The proposed prescription for the 353 acres of seed tree harvest with reserve trees is to retain ponderosa
pine and Douglas-fir seed trees at about 5 to 15 trees per acre as displayed in the table below. All trees
greater than 20 inches dbh would be retained, with additional trees kept to maintain a distribution of seed
trees across each unit; preference for retention are ponderosa pine over Douglas-fir leave trees. Ponderosa
pine seedlings would be planted after the harvest has been completed.

The seed tree harvest would create an early seral component (begin stand initiation phase) of ponderosa
pine leaving large diameter ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir as seed trees. The seed tree harvest would
remove much of the understory; light underburning would remove the remaining ladder fuels not removed
with harvest. Collectively, this would reduce stand density to between 20 and 40 square feet of basal area,
which would lower the hazard for bark beetles on the remaining ponderosa pine. Not all of these stands
are a pure ponderosa pine - Douglas-fir type; some stands contain a component of bark beetle infected
lodgepole pine which would be a salvage component within the seed tree harvest. The final action in these
units would be planting ponderosa pine seedlings to increase the pine component over the long term of
these units.
Post seed tree harvest conditions would find widely spaced large trees with about 400 ponderosa pine
seedlings planted per acre. Shrubs and forbs would be common, but low growing. Surface fuels would be
at 12 to 15 tons per acre. Aspen clones would be provided adequate growing space where they occur, with
conifers less than 15 inches in diameter removed within and adjacent to the clone.
All trees less than sawlog size would be removed and brought to a landing for disposal (either as biomass,
firewood, or other product). The direct effect would be the cutting down of about 0 to 200 square feet of
BA (basal area) of principally Douglas-fir (with salvage of dead lodgepole in some units) with about 20 to
40 BA retained (5 to 15 trees per acre). An additional direct effect would be a change in species
composition to predominately ponderosa pine with some Douglas-fir, after the planting has been
completed. The indirect effect would be to improve growing conditions for the remaining trees, and
creating optimal growing conditions for the planted ponderosa pine. In addition, a direct effect would be
the removal of conifer competition to upland aspen clones, which would indirectly improve growing
conditions for aspen and creating the opportunity for seedlings to develop into large trees.

Alternative 2 has 15 total units that exceed 40 acres (Table 37). By design, these units encompass past
disturbance patterns. Three of the units exceeding 40 acres are comprised of Douglas-fir and ponderosa
pine stands created by past disturbance, rather than constrained by a certain size – the 40-acre limitation.
Forested stands are defined by past disturbance (harvest, insect mortality, or fire); the compilation of these
stands creates the different structural stages displayed in Table 31 of this report.
The 50 year trend for the seed tree harvest would be large, open-grown ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir
stands that are resilient to inherent disturbance regimes (insects and fire) as is described in the Desired
Condition section of this analysis. FVS29 modeling shows that in 50 years there would be widely spaced
large Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine trees, residual from the harvest (over 30 inches in diameter with
basal area ranging from 20 to 60 square feet per acre). The planted ponderosa pine would be over 7 inches
in diameter and growing vigorously. Shrubs and forbs are common, but are low growing. Species
composition in 50 years would be primarily ponderosa pine with some Douglas-fir, aspen and lodgepole
pine. Aspen clones are provided adequate growing space where they occur, and are a healthy component
of these thinned stands in 50 years.
Forest Plan Wildlife Standard 3 (FP, page 48) is met in the seed tree with reserve tree treatments with
Alternative 2, as no trees (dead or alive) larger than 20 inches diameter would be removed. Forest Plan
Wildlife Standard 4 (FP, page 48) would also be met through the retention of the seed trees and reserve
trees with this treatment type. Snag inventories outside of the proposed treatment units were not
conducted.
Salvage harvest of dead and dying lodgepole pine stands
The proposed prescription for the 1,163 acres of dead and dying lodgepole is to remove the dead and
dying lodgepole pine trees through a salvage cut harvest, retaining all other species that occur in the units

Total acres of salvage of dead and dying lodgepole pine

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

The current mortality sets the stage for the next age class of naturally regenerated lodgepole pine stands
throughout the project area. This proposal changes the trajectory described in the Alternative 1 only for
the salvage activities on the proposed 1,163 acres, thereby removing what is now a vertical fuel structure
that has begun to fall over, and which most will be on the ground in the next 10 years (Mitchell and
Preisler state that most will fall in 5-15 year period, and the height of the epidemic occurred in 2009). The
fallen lodgepole will result in large and variable horizontal fuel accumulation that would be about 40 and
80 tons per acre of 5 inch and larger material, with some areas exceeding 100 tons per acre of material.
With this proposed treatment, the new stands would develop without the physical barriers created by
falling, jack-strawed logs, allowing future management of these stands such as thinning to improve stand
health and vigor. This proposed action on 6 percent of the lodgepole pine acres increases the acres in the
0- to 5-inch dbh class. The stand conditions created by salvage harvest are described in the Desired
Condition section of this analysis; namely an open to moderately dense stands averaging 80 square feet of
basal area with a range of 60 to 100 square feet basal area, intermixed with Douglas-fir and aspen, with
minor amounts of spruce and/or subalpine fir. The harvested acres overtime (50 or more years) would
create mid- to late- seral stands of larger diameter more quickly as compared to stands without harvest.
The remaining 87 percent (all lodgepole pine acres except for the proposed action plus the acres of
existing seedling stands) of the lodgepole pine vegetation type would continue on the projected trajectory
described in the no action alternative.
Alternative 2 has 15 total units that exceed 40 acres (Table 37). By design, these units encompass past
disturbance patterns. Twelve of the units exceeding 40 acres are comprised of lodgepole pine stands
created by past disturbance, rather than constrained by a certain size – the 40-acre limitation. Forested
stands are defined by past disturbance (harvest, insect mortality, or fire); the compilation of these stands
creates the different structural stages displayed in Table 31 of this section. Large patch sizes that comprise
the units exceeding 40 acres provide the structure and arrangement of lodgepole pine forests that naturally
occur in the Flint Foothills project area.
The direct effect is the salvage cut harvest which removes all dead and dying lodgepole pine greater than
5 inches in diameter (not to exceed 15 inches in diameter); these units would be large open areas (average
size: 39 acres) with live trees consisting of Douglas-fir with occasional aspen, live lodgepole pine less
than 5 inches diameter, and incidental occurrences of other conifer species. Less than 5 percent live
canopy coverage would be expected to remain in the units after salvage harvest.
The immediate increase in available light created through the salvage treatments would stimulate
understory vegetation including growth of seedling and sapling Douglas-fir, lodgepole pine, and aspen.
The solar heating at ground level would open additional lodgepole pine serotinous cones, increasing the
amount of lodgepole pine seedlings. By salvaging lodgepole pine rather than allowing the dead trees to
fall to the forest floor, there would be an increase in the density and growth rate of the new stand thereby
shortening the timeframe of establishment and subsequent growth than if these stands were not salvaged
(Romme et al. 1986). The proposed salvage harvest units currently have adequate stocking at acceptable
levels.
Old growth is defined using the minimum criteria required for Eastern Montana old growth in Green et
al., errata corrected 2007 (Forest Plan, p. 44). No proposed salvage activities in old growth or potential
old growth stands would occur. Because no treatment is proposed in old growth stands, no old growth
would be affected by salvage harvest treatments.
Informal walk-through surveys were conducted in the salvage units; however, these surveys did not
include snag surveys. Snags were surveyed with the 529 acres of stand exams conducted in the lodgepole
pine vegetation type; Table 39 above displays the results of those exams. Of the 18,141 acres of lodgepole
104

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

pine type in the project area, an estimated 17,000 acres are pole size or larger. Virtually all of the
lodgepole pine stands have been affected by mountain pine beetle; these dead trees are currently available
for snags outside of the proposed treatment units. This proposal would reduce the amount available for
snags less than 15 inches in diameter by 1,163 acres (6 percent of the lodgepole pine type); however, the
acres treated would meet the Forest Plan standards for snag retention. Forest Plan Wildlife Standard 3
(Forest Plan, p. 48) is met in the salvage cut harvest treatments under Alternative 2. Snag inventories
outside of the proposed treatment units were not conducted.
Over the next 50 years, stand density would be managed (through precommercial thinning) to perpetuate
a more open and relatively evenly spaced stand of lodgepole pine to improve individual tree growth and
vigor; reduce crown fire potential; promote younger age class of wind-firm, bark beetle-resistant
lodgepole pine; and increase the quantity of longer-lived species such as Douglas-fir and aspen. The 50
year trend for the salvage harvest of dead and dying lodgepole pine would be open to moderately dense
lodgepole pine with minor amounts of other tree species stands that are resilient to inherent disturbance
regimes (insects and fire) as is described in the Desired Condition section of this analysis. FVS29
modeling shows that in 50 years there would be fast growing lodgepole at moderate densities. Shrubs and
forbs would be common, but are low growing. Species composition in 50 years would be primarily
lodgepole pine with some Douglas-fir, aspen, subalpine fir, and Engelmann spruce.
Most of the lodgepole pine type in the project area would be in a mid-seral-pole size class due to the
current mountain pine beetle activity in the project area. FVS modeling has indicated that stands that are
not managed would have smaller mean diameters in 50 years than stands that are managed.
Prescribed burn mid-elevation mixed conifer and dry low elevation forests
The proposal is to use ignited fire to prescribed burn 1,990 acres of mid-elevation mixed conifer
(lodgepole dominated) units and low elevation dry forest units. There are 1,259 acres of mid-elevation
mixed conifer in three units, and 731 acres of low-elevation Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine stands in five
units. (Refer to Table 42 below.)
Prescribed fire would use either aerial ignition (for mid-elevation burns) or hand-lighting (both midelevation mixed intensity and understory light intensity burns). Some hand-falling of trees may occur to
facilitate burning objectives. Burning would occur when weather and ground conditions are suitable to
maintain air quality and burning can be controlled; this timing may be in spring or fall. Ignitions may
occur over multiple years.

Dead and dying pine species (lodgepole pine, ponderosa pine and whitebark pine) killed by bark beetles
and ongoing defoliation by spruce budworm to Douglas-fir set a trajectory of fuel loading (vertical and
horizontal) and forest succession to fir species; this trajectory is described in the Alternative 1 discussion.
Treatments in low elevation, dry forests that approximate desired conditions (as described in the Desired
Condition section) tend to create relatively open, large-tree dominated structures primarily composed of
seral species; these treatments induce ponderosa pine regeneration, reduce tree density and expedite
reintroduction of fire (Fiedler et al. 2010). Prescribed burning in low elevation units with this proposal
would return the fire as a disturbance process to the analysis area, and are designed to be low-intensity
with fire ignited over the entire unit, reducing multi-layering understory trees and overall forest density.
This action would allow for the ability to improve resiliency, resulting in stands more able to withstand
bark beetle mortality and stand-replacing fire (Agee and Skinner 2005; Fettig et al. 2007). Overtime, fire
as a disturbance would need to be continued as a management tool, as the Douglas-fir – ponderosa pine
vegetation type in the project area historically experienced fires on frequent intervals. Long-term
resilience would be improved with these disturbances; without additional future disturbances that are
similar to the natural fire intervals of the past, these forest types would revert back to the conditions
described in the no action alternative.
The direct result from the low elevation prescribed fires would be the burning of the grass, herb and shrub
understory communities (that fueled the understory burned), along with the killing of seedling and sapling
sized conifers in the understory. A few overstory trees (less than 5 percent) may also be killed from the
understory burning. Spring burning would be more of an impact to the overstory trees, as the tree buds
would be more susceptible to heat. Fall burning would be less of an impact as the tree buds would be
hardened, and more able to withstand heat generated from burning. The indirect effect of the low
elevation prescribed fire would be a re-growth of senesced grass, herb and shrub understory communities
(that fueled the understory burned), increased vigor for the remaining conifers, and natural regeneration of
ponderosa pine. FVS29 modeling indicates that in 50 years understory burning would result in less dense
stands with larger mean diameters, and a higher amount of ponderosa pine where it is present than
compared to stands that had no burning.
In the mid-elevation prescribed fire units, up to 10 percent of each unit would have small-diameter (4 to
12 inches dbh) conifers slashed (cut down). Slash created as a result of these activities would be
strategically located to facilitate a mosaic of mixed severity burned areas with the objective of 50 percent
mortality in the overstory trees within the unit; the mosaic stand conditions created by the prescribed fire

106

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

are described in the Desired Condition section of this analysis. Proposed treatments are not necessarily
‘natural’, though are designed to create more heterogeneous conditions that existed in the past; diverse
forest vegetation structure provides the basis for maintaining forested ecological communities that are
resilient (Forest Plan, p. 299).
Ignition patterns for the mid-elevation fire units would be designed so that the concentrations would burn
with fire carried into the crown of the trees for areas up to 20 acres in size, but fire is not carried
throughout the unit. Ignition for the mid-elevation burn units would be a combination of aerial ignition
and hand-lighting, with the firing operations conducted in either the spring or the fall. Approximately 40
percent of each unit would be targeted with fire ignitions. A spring-time burn would allow much more
control over the spread of fire over the ground vegetation. The fire effects from heat to conifers in a
spring time burn would be greater, as conifers are more susceptible at that time due to their growing buds.
Conifer buds harden in the fall, so trees would be less susceptible with a fall burn, but fire spread over the
ground vegetation would be more difficult to control.
Although whitebark pine as a vegetation type is a small percentage (1.5 percent) of the project area, and is
not the objective of proposed treatments, there may be an effect to whitebark pine with the mid-elevation
burning. Whitebark pine is known to occur in one mid-elevation unit (Unit 5B), and may occur in others.
Potential effects would be to individual whitebark pine trees scattered in the proposed units, although the
majority of the acres delineated are below the elevation of the more common occurrence of whitebark
pine in the project area. Fire effects might include individual tree mortality. The felling of conifers prior to
burning activities would avoid areas of units that have concentrations of whitebark pine. Additionally,
ignition patterns would avoid the use of fire directly in areas of units that have concentrations of
whitebark pine. Conducting the prescribed burn during spring conditions controls fire spread. The
potential effects to whitebark pine could be greater with fall burning, as fire spread with ground
vegetation would be more difficult to control.
The direct effect of burning mid elevation mixed conifer (lodgepole dominated) stands would be the
killing of overstory and understory conifers in a patch mosaic across the proposed unit. The fire would
directly consume a portion of the existing vertical and horizontal fuel, some of which has been created by
bark beetles working in the project area. Another direct effect would be a limited amount of burning in the
grass, herb and shrub understory communities; the amount is limited due to the spring-time burning
conditions. Fall burning would directly affect more understory vegetation communities, providing more
opportunity to rejuvenate these ground-cover species.
The indirect effect of the mid elevation prescribed fire in mixed conifer stands would be a re-growth of
senesced grass, herb and shrub understory communities and natural regeneration of lodgepole pine and
some whitebark pine.
Forest Carbon Cycling and Storage
The treatments in the Alternative 2 would reduce on-site carbon sources by removing the dead and dying
lodgepole component that would release stored carbon during decomposition. Forested environments over
time are renewable carbon sinks. With the removal of the dead trees, overall carbon sequestration would
be begin to increase more rapidly in the treated stands when compared to the No Action Alternative by
increasing the health and vigor of the remaining trees and understory vegetation, and by promoting
regeneration of seedlings for the next stand. In general, such management actions as those proposed in the
project could improve the resilience of forests to climate-induced increases in frequency and intensity of
disturbances such as fire and insect and disease epidemics. Utilizing harvested trees for long-lasting forest
products and renewable energy sources may help sustain the current strength of the carbon sink in U.S.
forests (Birdsey et al. 2006 and 2007).
107

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

In the short term, the actions proposed by this alternative would release some carbon currently stored
through harvest of live and dead trees (USEPA 2010; Depro et al. 2008). Motorized equipment used
during any of the proposed activities would emit greenhouse gasses. For at least the short term, on-site
carbon stocks would be lower under the Action Alternatives than under No Action. Actions such as the
proposed intermediate harvests may, in some cases, increase long-term carbon storage (Finkral and Evans
2008; North et al. 2009; Mitchell et al. 2009) but current research in this field shows highly variable and
situational results (Mitchell et al. 2009; Reinhardt and Holsinger 2010; Ryan et al. 2010; McKinley et al.
2011). See also the discussion of forest carbon cycling and storage under the Affected Environment –
Existing Conditions section.
The lodgepole pine stands recently killed by MPB are estimated to be functioning as a net carbon source
to the atmosphere. Removal of dead wood would reduce on-site carbon stores. The portion removed as
wood products may partially delay carbon release relative to on-site decay rates. These stands would
continue to emit more carbon than they absorb and would remain net carbon sources until trees that
sequester additional carbon are well established. Monitored regeneration would help ensure these forest
stands return to a carbon sink function as quickly as possible. As the stands continue to develop, the
strength of the carbon sink would increase until peaking at an intermediate age and then gradually decline
but remain positive (Pregitzer and Euskirchen 2004). Carbon stocks would continue to accumulate as the
stands mature, although at a declining rate, until impacted by future disturbances.
To the extent proposed actions reduce the risk or delay the event of future stand-replacing disturbance
events, potential emissions from those events are equally reduced or forestalled. The vegetation
treatments are designed to enhance forest resiliency to disturbances such as wildfire and insect outbreaks.
Sustaining forest productivity and other multiple-use goods and services requires that land managers
balance multiple objectives. The long-term ability of forests to sequester carbon depends in part on their
resilience to multiple stresses, including increasing probability of drought stress, high severity fires, and
large scale insect outbreaks associated with projected potential climate change. Management actions
(such as those proposed with this project) that maintain the vigor and long-term productivity of forests
and reduce the likelihood of high severity fires and insect outbreaks can maintain the capacity of the
forest to sequester carbon in the long-term. Thus, even though some management actions may in the nearterm reduce total carbon stored below current levels, in the long-term they maintain the overall capacity
of these stands to sequester carbon while also contributing other multiple-use goods and services
(Reinhardt and Holsinger 2010).

Alternative 3
This alternative was designed to address public concerns over new road construction, and logging within
old-growth stands. No new system or temporary roads would be constructed to access units or
accommodate logging within units. No commercial thinning would occur within the understory of old
growth stands.
The changes in treatments between Alternative 2 and Alternative 3 are as follows:
•

Eight units (36S, 47S, 72S, 48C, 56C, 57C, 68C, 71C, and 82C) requiring temporary road
construction for access to the unit were eliminated from the Alternative 3 to eliminate temporary
road construction.

•

Five units are reduced in size (71C, 23C, 25C, 55C, and 6C) by a total of 157 acres to eliminate
commercial understory thinning of old-growth stands.

Direct and Indirect Effects
The direct and indirect effects are the same for Alternative 3 as described for in the Alternative 2
discussion, with the two exceptions noted below.
Commercial thin Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine stands
The 483 fewer acres of commercial thin in Alternative 3 would see those acres develop on the trajectory
described in Alternative 1. The noteworthy difference in indirect effects is dropping old growth
treatments; the 157 acres of tree density reduction with Alternative 2 wherein old growth is retained
would not take place with Alternative 3. Dropping these acres with Alternative 3 would result in a
trajectory of maintaining old growth to a likely conversion to a non-old growth status. The 50 year trend
as indicated with FVS29 modeling of stand 85202013 within Unit 23C (in Alternative 2) indicates that
without treatment and continued high MPB activity, the stand would fall out of old growth status in 50
years with a reduction of ponderosa pine in the stand. The 50 year trend (using FVS29 modeling) for
prescribing a thin with the same old growth stand and high MPB activity indicates that the stand would
still be old growth in 50 years, and the ponderosa pine component would increase. In addition, Alternative
3 would have 362 acres of currently non- old growth stands that would likely not become old growth in
50 years, as is indicated by FVS modeling29.
Salvage harvest of dead and dying lodgepole pine stands
The 141 fewer acres of salvage harvest would see those acres develop on the trajectory described in
Alternative 1. The ability to manage those acres in the future to maintain stand densities as described in
the Desired Condition section of this analysis would not take place, with the potential to create mid- to
late- seral stands of larger diameter more quickly as compared to stands without harvest not occurring.
The 141 acres would join the remaining 87 percent (all lodgepole pine acres except for the proposed
action plus the acres of existing seedling stands) of the lodgepole pine vegetation type on the projected
trajectory described in the no action alternative.
One unit exceeding 40 acres in size (36S) is dropped with Alternative 3.
The table below displays all of the units with Alternative 3 that exceeds 40 acres in size. As with
Alternative 2, units that exceed 40 acres with Alternative 3 were designed to encompass past fire and
insect disturbance patterns that created a patch mosaic of stands. Large patch sizes that comprise the units
that exceed 40 acres provide the structure and arrangement of forests that naturally occur within
landscape that is the Flint Foothills project area. The forest stands with past regeneration harvest adjacent
the proposed units that exceed 40 acres are fully reforested and are no longer considered openings.

Cumulative Effects Discussion for Alternative 2 and Alternative 3
Past Actions
The environmental analysis required under National Environmental is forward-looking in that it focuses
on the potential impacts of the proposed action that an agency is considering. Specific past actions
considered in the affected environment and cumulative effects analysis are summarized below. The past
actions summary is not necessarily exhaustive, as records may not exist for all past activities by project.
This is particularly true for those actions that predate the passage of the National Environmental Policy
Act in 1970. Nonetheless, the effects of such past actions are accounted for in the assessment of the
existing condition, as the current condition assessment necessarily reflects any relevant impacts of such
actions.

Timber Management
Timber was harvested in the Flint Foothills project area to support mining, homesteading and settlement
out in the valley. Timber harvest increased greatly from the 1960s through the mid-1980s and has
declined in recent years. Harvest in the last decade has been post and pole thinning and roadside hazard
tree removal.
Timber harvest activities included clearcut, seed tree, shelterwood, selection cut, commercial thinning
(principally post and pole), sanitation (removing mistletoe infected trees) and special harvest (principally
hazard tree removal). Commercial timber harvest has occurred on about 23 percent of the project area
(10,265 acres; see Table 46 below).

Prescribed Fire
The majority of Forest Service prescribed fire use has been disposal of logging slash, either through pile
burn or jackpot burn activities. Some prescribed fire use has been for improving stand conditions for
certain vegetation species (e.g. removing conifer succession in grassland-shrubland areas). Understory
burns are considered low intensity fires over the majority of the unit, whereas broadcast burning are
higher intensity fires over the majority of the unit. Minor amounts of fire woodcutter piles have also been
burned. Prescribed fire has occurred on about 11 percent of the analysis area (4,974 acres; see Table 48
below).

Grazing, Invasive weed treatment
Cattle grazing in the past have been of variable intensity. The effects of grazing may have contributed to
the spread of invasive plants, such as knapweed, although the majority of invasive plant introduction is
from motorized routes (roads and trails). Invasive weeds have been treated and are continuing to be
treated with herbicides; dry grassland parks are susceptible to the threat of invasive weeds, but have not
been impacted due to the success of the weed spray program. (Refer to the Noxious Weeds and Livestock
Grazing analysis.)

Cumulative Effects – Combined Effects from Past, Proposed, Ongoing and Foreseeable
Actions:
Reasonably foreseeable actions include those management activities that are on-going or scheduled to
occur within the next five years. These activities may occur regardless of which alternative is selected for
implementation.
Table 49 below discloses the ongoing and reasonable foreseeable actions within the project area that are
germane to this vegetation analysis. A listing of all known past and ongoing prescribed burn, harvest and
precommercial thin activities is located in Appendix A of the Vegetation Report located in the project file.

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Past actions that have affected vegetation include fire suppression, timber harvest, prescribed burning,
livestock grazing, and firewood cutting. These past actions have contributed to the existing vegetation and
habitat conditions.
Harvest increased greatly from the 1960s through the mid-1980s and has declined in recent years.
Commercial timber harvest has occurred on about 23 percent of the project area, while non-commercial
thinning has occurred on about 3 percent of the project area. Roadside salvage has occurred in the project
area as well. Harvest has occurred on approximately 237 acres of private land within the project area
boundary. Prescribed fire (burning of logging slash, understory burns, and burns to remove conifer
succession in grass-shrub habitats) has occurred on about 11 percent of the project area.
Table 49 above discloses the present and reasonably foreseeable actions within the project area that are
relevant to this FEIS analysis. Present and reasonably foreseeable activities that may affect species or
habitats discussed in this analysis include: livestock grazing on public and private lands (inside and
outside of the project area); ongoing invasive plants control; wildland fire suppression; Montana DNRC,
BLM and private lands potential future timber harvest (inside and outside of project area); and BLM lands
prescribed fire treatments (outside of project area).
Private inholdings total 7,512 acres within the project area. So far, harvest on private inholdings has
occurred on approximately 80 percent (about 5,500 acres) of the forested portions. Most of the harvest on
private land took place in the 1980s. Not all of the inholdings are forested; about 10 percent are nonforested (dry grassland areas). It is not known whether additional acres of private harvest would occur;
however, the overall affect is anticipated to be negligible in the project-wide trends for the forested
vegetation type on Federal lands.
In general, there would be no apparent cumulative effects on the project area vegetation from the sum
total of past, present, and reasonably foreseeable actions when cumulatively added to either of the action
alternatives. This is principally due to the small number of acres proposed for vegetative treatments
(5,703 acres in Alternative 2 or 13 percent of the project area; and 5,043 acres in Alternative 3 or 11
percent of the project area) relative to the size of the analysis area (44,522 acres) and the type of activities
proposed with known direct, indirect and cumulative effects within the project area. Over time, the types
of activities that are proposed would recover (vegetation re-growth), which is observed with historic
harvest and prescribed burn activities in the analysis area.

MANAGEMENT
AREA

Air Quality
Prescribed burning is subject to air quality standards by following federal and state regulations along with
policies that focus on maintaining air quality standards through the management and control of emissions
generated by human-caused activity. To help ensure that the Forest Plan and clean air goals are met, fire
management practices that minimize emissions and impacts of smoke from prescribed burning must be
considered. All prescribed burning activity associated with the proposed action will be coordinated and
conducted through the Montana/Idaho Airshed Group smoke management program. This program is
approved and certified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and minimizes impacts to air
quality by allowing prescribed burning to occur only during favorable weather, moisture, and air quality
conditions.
Under the Montana/Idaho Airshed Smoke Management program, prescribed burners in an Airshed submit
a request to burn within the airshed by noon the day before they plan to burn. The Airshed Group Models
all the proposed burns and determines if there will be impacts to Class 1 airsheds or non-attainment areas
(sensitive areas) that exceed the legal limits. The Airshed Group can then restrict some of the prescribed
burning down to levels where the impacts to sensitive areas are mitigated or close down the airshed to all
prescribed burning. If during a burn period the Airshed Group determines that a sensitive area is being
114

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

impacted or is going to be impacted they can order prescribed burning shut down on all or a portion of the
Airshed.

Overview of Issues Addressed
Pile and under burning would occur, (1) in landing areas and in the understory of commercial thin and
seed tree units, and (2) in approximately 1,990 acres associated with prescribed burn units. Effects from
prescribed burning in the project area will be analyzed in relation to the alternatives’ potential to impact
air quality in local Montana airsheds and visibility in three nearby federally designated Class I areas
(wilderness).

The area surrounding the city of Butte is classified by MT-DEQ as a state non-attainment area 36 for PM10
(MT-DEQ 2008) and is the only non-attainment area for particulate matter within 100 kilometers of the
Flint Foothills project area. The northern boundary of this non-attainment area is approximately 28 miles
southeast from the southern-most boundary of the Flint Foothills project area.

36
A community that does not meet or attain the NAAQS may be designated as a non-attainment area by EPA for
federal air quality standards or by the state for state air quality standards. The state must then develop an Emissions
Control Plan as part of its SIP to improve the air quality and bring the area back into attainment. Management and
restriction of prescribed fire emissions may be included in the control plan. The city of Butte has been identified as a
Montana PM10 non-attainment area (MT-DEQ 2008).

Climate
Climate is characterized in terms of precipitation, temperature, and wind regimes. Although the action
alternative would not affect the regional climate, aspects of the climate could influence timing or extent of
project activities. Precipitation, temperature, or wind extremes can exacerbate the effects of fires. Fire is
more common in the summer months when higher temperatures, higher winds, and lower relative
humidity result in increased surface evaporation and drier fuels, making densely wooded areas more
susceptible to wildfires or human-caused fires. Also, thunderstorm activity in the summer months
increases the likelihood of lightning strikes, which can spark wildfires. Higher winds can cause fires to
spread further, faster, and with increased intensity.
In Montana, the Continental Divide influences the climate of adjacent areas. West of the Divide, which is
where the Flint Foothills project area is located, the climate is a modified north Pacific coast type. On the
west of the mountain barrier, winters are milder, precipitation is more evenly distributed throughout the
year, summers are cooler, and winds are lighter than on the eastern side. The air quality report in the
project file displays wind speed data for the Montana 5 airshed. In the west, there is more cloudiness in all
seasons, humidity is slightly higher, and the growing season is shorter than in the eastern plains areas.
Wind speeds are highest during the summer months. Although the general upper air flow is from west to
east, the orientation of mountain ranges and valleys in the analysis area can significantly influence the
surface level wind direction. This is very evident in the Butte and Helena wind observations, which show
prevailing southerly and westerly surface winds in the two airsheds, respectively (see the Air Quality
Report in the project record). Generally the air masses over the airshed(s) are more unstable with good
dispersion in the spring and become more stable with poorer dispersion during the fall and winter months.
This means the Airshed Group would mandate more restrictions on prescribed burning in the fall/winter
as opposed to spring burning.

Desired Condition
Forest Plan– Protection of Air Quality
The Forest Plan establishes guidance for all resource management activities on Forest System lands
within the BDNF. The air quality in the vicinity of a fire can be severely impacted from the pollutants
within the smoke which is comprised mainly of small particulates. Because smoke is readily transported
by the wind, it can also impact air quality at distances downwind of a fire.
The Forest Service is committed to the protection of air quality by following federal and state regulations
along with policies that focus on maintaining air quality standards through the management and control of
emissions generated by human-caused activity. Prescribed burning, being a human-caused activity, is
subject to management practices and air quality standards. To ensure that the Forest Plan and clean air
goals are met, fire management practices that minimize emissions and impacts of smoke from prescribed
burning are implemented. Wildfires, on the other hand, being naturally occurring events are not counted
toward the exceedance of any air quality standard.
With regard to air quality, the Forest Plan has set the following goals, objectives, and standards:
Goals:
o

Air Quality: Air quality is maintained within the standards set by federal and state
agencies and by the Montana/Idaho Airshed Group’s Memorandum of Agreement and
State Implementation Plan.

117

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

o

Smoke Management: A variety of management tools (including prescribed fire and
appropriate management response) are used to help manage vegetation to reduce
potential smoke.

Standard
o

Standard 1: Meet smoke management requirements according to the Montana/Idaho
Airshed Group Operating Guide (MIAG 2008).

Regulatory Framework– Protection of Air Quality
Clean air regulations, laws, policies, and programs that affect the action alternatives are listed below.
Additional details are provided in the air quality report in the project file.
The Clean Air Act (CAA)– The U.S. Congress passed the CAA in 1970 and two amendments in 1977
and 1990 (USEPA 1990). The CAA was enacted to protect and improve air quality while ensuring the
protection of public health and welfare. It established National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)
as one measure to define acceptable air quality. The CAA sets the framework under which industries and
government agencies, including the Forest Service, are to operate in order to maintain these standards.
Each state is given primary responsibility for management of their air quality through State
Implementation Plans (SIPs) defined by the entire collection of programs, policies and rules that the
state’s agencies use to attain and maintain the NAAQS. Through the SIPs, states develop air permitting
and air pollution control programs that are as strict, if not more, than those identified in the CAA. The
programs address industrial emissions, automobile emissions, outdoor burning, road dust, and similar
sources of air pollution. The Montana Department of Environmental Quality (MT-DEQ) is the state
agency responsibility for developing and enforcing the SIP.
National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) – Under the CAA, the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) established NAAQS for criteria pollutants that have been determined to be harmful to the
public and the environment (USEPA 2008). Montana has adopted state air quality standards (MT 2008b)
that are the same or stricter than the NAAQS. The EPA reviews and amends these standards as more
scientific and health information becomes available. The federal and state air quality standards currently
are as follows:

Particulate matter may be the air pollutant that most commonly affects people's health. Particles can come
in almost any shape or size, and can be solid particles or liquid droplets. Particles are divided into two
major groups. Larger particles are called PM10 and smaller particles are called PM2.5.The big particles
are between 2.5 and 10 micrometers (from about 25 to 100 times thinner than a human hair). The small
particles are smaller than 2.5 micrometers (100 times thinner than a human hair). Particulate matter,
especially small particles, can cause severe health problems, which is why they are regulated and
monitored during prescribed burning. Burning processes are the most common sources of particulate
matter.
Regional Haze Rule – In addition to the PSD provision of the CAA, the EPA promulgated the Regional
Haze Rule in 1999 (USEPA 1999) for protecting visibility in national parks and wilderness areas. These
regulations call for states to establish goals for improving visibility in these areas and to develop longterm strategies for reducing emissions of air pollutants that cause visibility impairment.
Effective October 18, 2012, the EPA promulgated a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) to address
regional haze in the State of Montana. EPA developed this FIP in response to the State’s decision in 2006
to not submit a regional haze State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision. The FIP satisfies requirements of
the Clean Air Act (CAA or ‘‘the Act’’) that require states, or EPA in promulgating a FIP, to assure
reasonable progress towards the national goal of preventing any future and remedying any existing manmade impairment of visibility in mandatory Class I areas.
EPA approved one of the revisions to the Montana SIP submitted by the State of Montana through the
Montana Department of Environmental Quality on February 17, 2012, specifically, the revision to the
Montana Visibility Plan that includes amendments to the ‘‘Smoke Management’’ section, which adds a
reference to Best Available Control Technology (BACT) as the visibility control measure for open
burning as currently administered through the State’s air quality permit program.
This change was made to meet the requirements of the Regional Haze Rule.
Non-Attainment Areas – A community that does not meet or attain the NAAQS may be designated as a
non-attainment area by EPA for federal air quality standards or by the state for state air quality standards.
The state must then develop an Emissions Control Plan as part of its SIP to improve the air quality and
bring the area back into attainment. Management and restriction of prescribed fire emissions may be
included in the control plan. The city of Butte has been identified as a Montana PM10 non-attainment
area (MT-DEQ 2008). The health department has identified road dust, residential wood burning stoves,
and local industrial plants as the major contributors to the high particulate matter concentrations. The

119

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

northern boundary of this non-attainment area is approximately 28 miles from the southern-most
boundary of the Flint Foothills project area.
General Conformity Provisions of the CAA – The general conformity provisions in Section 176(c) of
the CAA prohibit federal agencies from taking any action within a non-attainment area (for NAAQS) that
causes or contributes to a new violation of the standards, increases the frequency or severity of an existing
violation, or delays the timely attainment of a standard. Federal agencies are also required to ensure their
actions conform to applicable SIPs. Since the Flint Foothills project is not located within the city of Butte
non-attainment area, it is not subject to the general conformity provisions.
In addition to the requirements established under the CAA and Montana’s SIP, there are several policies,
planning groups, and monitoring programs that must be considered with regard to air quality issues
associated with prescribed fires, as follows:
•

Interim Air Quality Policy on Wildland and Prescribed Fires – The EPA (1998) issued this
policy to balance the use of managed wildland fires and prescribed fires with protection of
public health and welfare. It has two public policy goals: (1) to allow fire to function in its
natural role in maintaining healthy wildland ecosystems, and (2) to protect public health and
welfare by mitigating the impacts of air pollutant emissions on air quality and visibility.

•

Montana/Idaho Airshed Group Smoke Management Program – In 1978, federal, state, and
local government agencies, and the forest products industry formed the Montana State Airshed
Group for the purpose of managing and limiting the impacts of smoke generated from
necessary prescribed burning. Agencies and companies from Idaho joined this group in 1990
and 1999 to collaboratively form the Montana/Idaho Airshed Group. This group operates
under a smoke management program to minimize or prevent smoke impacts while using fire to
accomplish land management objectives. Airshed Group members coordinate all prescribed
burning activities through the Smoke Monitoring Unit (SMU) located in Missoula, Montana.
The Departments of Environmental Quality for both Idaho and Montana have certified to the
EPA that the Montana/Idaho Airshed Group smoke management program meets EPA’s
definition of a basic smoke management program. Since the Forest Service is a member of this
Airshed Group, all prescribed burning within the Flint Foothills project area will comply with
the smoke management program. The Montana/Idaho State Airshed Group website can be
accessed at: http://www.smokemu.org.

•

Airshed Monitoring – As part of the smoke management program, the Montana/Idaho State
Airshed Group has established a smoke monitoring system that provides air quality
predictions, air dispersion forecasts, and burn recommendations and restrictions to its
members. The Flint Foothills project area is located on the northern edge of Montana Airshed
5 (Upper Clark Fork) and adjacent to the southern edge of Montana Airshed 3B.

•

Smoke Impact Zones – The MT-DEQ has further defined a number of Smoke Impact Zones
around areas that are either not meeting or close to not meeting ambient air quality standards
for particulate matter (MT-DEQ, 2008). These impact zones were established so that regulators
may monitor open burning activities more closely in and near these areas.

120

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Environmental Consequences
Alternative 1 – No Action
Direct, Indirect and Cumulative Effects
Under alternative 1, there would be no direct, indirect or cumulative effects to air quality from the Flint
Foothills Project because no project prescribed burning activities are proposed.

Alternatives 2 and 3
Direct, Indirect and Cumulative Effects
Project design features for both action alternatives require coordination with the Montana/Idaho Airshed
Group, use of BACT, and public notifications when undertaking prescribed burning.
All prescribed burning activity would be coordinated and conducted through the Montana/Idaho Airshed
Group smoke management program to ensure that impacts to air quality would be minimized. This
program minimizes impacts to air quality by allowing prescribed burning to occur only during favorable
weather, moisture, and air quality conditions. The Montana/Idaho Airshed Group has established an air
quality Monitoring Unit that provides daily air quality predictions and restrictions to its members from
March 1 to November 30. The practices established by the Airshed Group are considered Best Available
Control Technology by the Department of Environmental Quality. The Bureau of Land Management and
the Forest Service are permitted to burn based on compliance with burning restrictions set by the Airshed
Group and compliance of all other Federal and State laws and regulations. A site-specific burn plan would
be written for all prescribed burning in the project area that follows the Interagency Prescribed Fire
Planning and Implementation Guide, and includes notification of publics located within the vicinity of the
burn units.
In conclusion, smoke from prescribed fires will not impact the Butte non-attainment area or Class 1
Airsheds because the Montana/Idaho Airshed Group would restrict burning during periods when
dispersion would transport smoke toward this area.

Compliance with Forest Plan and other Relevant Laws, Regulations, Policies and Plans
All alternatives would be consistent with the Forest Plan and all clean air regulations, laws, policies, and
programs identified above.
All open burning in Montana is regulated by the restrictions and standards of the Montana Department of
Environmental Quality (MDEQ), which is subject to all Federal Laws including the Clean Air Act. Major
prescribed burners, which include the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service, have formed
the Montana/Idaho Airshed Group. This group has established an air quality Monitoring Unit that
provides daily air quality predictions and restrictions to its members from March 1 to November 30. The
major goal of the group is to “minimize or prevent the smoke impacts while using fire to accomplish land
management objectives” (Montana/Idaho Airshed Group Operating Guide 2004). The practices
established by the Airshed Group are considered Best Available Control Technology by the Department of
Environmental Quality. The Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service are permitted to burn
based on compliance with burning restrictions set by the Airshed Group and compliance of all other
Federal and State laws and regulations. The CAA and local policies require that Forest Service actions
have “no adverse effect” on air resources affecting human populations by not exceeding the NAAQS and

121

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

not degrading the air quality requirements for Class I areas. By following the Montana/Idaho Airshed
Group Operating Guide, impacts to the class 1 areas and the non-attainment area would be minimal. If the
airshed group determined that impacts to the class 1 areas or the non-attainment area would exceed legal
thresholds on any particular day they would either restrict the number of prescribed burns within the
airshed(s) down to levels that don’t reach the legal threshold for impacts or shut down burning within the
entire airshed altogether. Montana has monitoring sites in 17 locations around the state with the 4 closest
to the project area being Butte, Helena, Missoula and Seeley Lake.

Transportation
This section analyzes the impact of implementing the proposed activities on transportation resources. The
analysis area for transportation includes all National Forest System (NFS) lands within the project area, as
well as travel routes outside NFS lands that provide access to the project area.

Overview of Issues Addressed
This analysis focuses on the project engineering concerns including road treatments to accomplish
proposed vegetation treatments as well as maintenance and reconstruction treatments to improve facilities
and reduce negative resource impacts related to the Forest transportation system. Through the public
scoping process, the potential for sediment delivery and the spread of invasive plants from temporary road
construction was identified as an issue. Road engineering, including new road construction and temporary
road construction will be discussed in detail in this analysis.

Measurement Indicators
The measurement indicators used to evaluate impacts of alternatives:
•

Work descriptions, road conditions associated with project use and mileage summaries for road
treatments associated with accomplishing timber treatments, including a breakdown of proposed new
road construction and temporary road actions.

Affected Environment
Existing Condition
Transportation Network
The analysis area contains a diverse network of NFS and nonsystem roads and trails. There are currently
over 204 miles of existing roads inventoried within the analysis area. While the majority is managed by
the Forest Service as NFS roads, there are also county and private roads as well as unauthorized roads
inventoried in the project area (Figure 6). Unauthorized routes that are open to public motor vehicle travel
are displayed on page 53 of the Forest Plan and are subject to the travel restrictions displayed on the 2013
Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest North Map. Physically, unauthorized routes shown and not shown
on page 53 are similar.
There are over 7 miles of NFS trails managed in the project area; additional information on project area
trails can be found in the Recreation Resource Report. Table 53 displays the route categories and
associated mileage.

An additional 26.9 miles of roads, located outside the project area, provide access from Interstate 90 and
Montana State Highway 1 to the Flint Foothills Project area. Routes outside the project area are under
various administrative jurisdictions, including Granite County, Powell County, and Forest Service. Figure
4 in chapter 2 displays existing roads accessing the Flint Foothills project area.
Access to the Project Area
Public road access to the southwest portion of the project area is the Finley Basin Road (Forest Road
676). This road is managed jointly by the Granite County and the Forest Service. The road starts at State
Highway 1 with a paved surface (near Maxville), which then transitions to aggregate surface and then
native surface before intersecting with NFS Road 1500. This Eureka Ridge Road (NFS Road 1500)
climbs and accesses the SW portion of the project area.
The west side of the project area is accessed by two roads that connect with State Highway 1: the Gird
Creek Road (NFS Road 8402) and the Granite County managed Douglas Creek Road. The Gird Creek
Road, aggregate-surfaced from Hwy 1 and transitioning to native-surfaced after 1.6 miles, accesses the
western-most project area and also connects with Forest Road 8454 (East Gird Creek). Aggregatesurfaced Forest Road 8454 passes through private land and jurisdiction for 1.7 miles before entering NFS
lands and becoming native-surfaced NFS Road 8454.
The northeast portion of the project area is accessed via the Gold Creek drainage from Interstate 90.
Powell County managed and aggregate-surfaced Gold Creek and Mullan Trail Roads provide access to
Forest Road 636 (also Gold Creek), which is also managed by Powell County for the first 2.5 miles.
Native-surfaced Forest Road 636 enters the project area and provides access to NFS Road 1557 (Jackson
Park Road), which accesses a network of roads in the northern portion of the project. Forest Road 636
transitions to Forest Service jurisdiction and becomes NFS Road 636, which accesses the eastern and
southern portions of the project area. Figure 4 in chapter 2 indicates the haul routes outside of the project
area, and figure 6 and figure 8 in chapter 2 displays haul routes proposed by alternatives 2 and 3
respectively.
The BDNF North Visitor Map (2013) is available through the USFS and provides additional information
for roads and trails.
Gates
There are a number of gates within the project area managed by the Forest Service. These gates are used
to physically implement travel management restrictions in accordance with the Forest Plan and travel
map. A map of inventoried gates and an accompanying table with attribute data is available in the project
record.

123

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Flood Damage
Due to high precipitation and runoff in the winter of 2010-2011and the following spring, there were a
number of flood damage sites affecting important access roads to the project area. Five sites located on
project roads include: Upper and Lower Douglas Creek washouts (both on NFS Road 707), lower Gird
Creek (NFS Road 8402), Upper Gird Creek (NFS Road 666), and a fill failure or slump on NFS Road
1544. These sites resulted in temporary public road closures and blocked access to some portions of the
project area. All sites are now repaired.

Desired Condition
Forest Plan
The following direction and desired condition components (forestwide desired condition, goals,
objectives, and standards) come from the Beaverhead-Deerlodge Forest Plan.
Desired forestwide conditions include:
• People and communities benefit from programs and infrastructure that support livestock
grazing and an array of forest products and services. Methods for using resources to benefit
people while maintaining functioning ecosystems are employed.
•

Visitors benefit from a range of primitive to developed recreation settings and opportunities.
Most of the BDNF continues to offer uncrowded motorized and nonmotorized backcountry
opportunities, and

•

Resources adversely affected by past management activities have been rehabilitated or the
related public health and safety issues corrected.

Goals of the Forest Plan for infrastructure include:
• The minimum transportation system necessary is identified and managed.
•

Roads and trails are identified in the transportation atlas maintained at the Forest Supervisor’s
Office.

•

Roads and trails are constructed, managed, and maintained to meet land and resource
objectives.

Goals of the Forest Plan for recreation and travel management include:
• A system of routes and areas designated for non-motorized and motorized use are identified
and available for public use.
Standards of the Forest Plan for recreation and travel management include:
Standard 1: Permanent road construction is not allowed in summer non-motorized allocations or
in areas evaluated for wilderness potential.
Standard 2: Motorized vehicles are not allowed in summer or winter non-motorized allocations
except for permitted or administrative use.37
Administrative use and contractor use during Project implementation would be exempt in accordance with
Recreation and Travel Management Standard 3 (Forest Plan, p. 32).

Standard 3: Restrict year-round, wheeled motorized travel to designated routes or areas.
Where routes have not been designated through site specific travel planning, restrict motorized
vehicles to open motorized routes identified on the Forest Plan Interim Roads and Trails Inventory
GIS Layer displayed on page 53. Motorized wheeled travel on routes leading to identified
dispersed campsites is allowed. Exceptions may be authorized for:
Motorized wheeled cross-country travel for any military, fire, search and rescue, or law
enforcement vehicle used for emergency purposes.
Authorized motorized wheeled cross-country travel is limited to official admimistrative
duties or emergency services such as fire suppression, prescribed fire, noxious weed
control, vegetation restoration, surveying, and law enforcement.
Motorized wheeled cross-country travel for other government entities on official
administrative business as authorized through the normal permit processes or a
memorandum of understanding.
Motorized wheeled cross-country travel for lesses and permittees limited to terms
described in the federal lease or permit.
Other Direction
Water quality can be affected by road construction, maintenance, drainage and rehabilitation. Proper use
of applicable Best Management Practices (BMPs) during road management activities help to mitigate
impacts, including excessive sedimentation. According to Forest Service policy for watershed
management policy contained in FSM 2500, management activities will be designed to minimize shortterm impacts on the soil and water resources and to maintain or enhance long-term productivity, water
quantity, and water quality. The Beaverhead-Deerlodge Forest Plan also directs that BMPs will be applied
during implementation of projects to ensure that water-related beneficial uses are protected and that State
water quality standards are met. BMPs for Montana are described in “Best Management Practices for
Montana Forests (Logan, 2001).

Environmental Consequences
Methodology
Transportation in the project area is largely road dependent. Therefore, methods to assess impacts of the
alternatives on transportation resources in the project area involved analysis of impacts to these facilities.
Forest Service Geographic Information System (GIS) data was used to compute indicators such as miles
of existing, new and temporary roads to be used as haul routes, and miles of road decommissioning. In
addition, field data from engineering road condition surveys were used to identify the conditions of roads
within the project area, as well as prescribe work items and estimate costs. The overall effect of road
changes on transportation in the project area is also qualitatively discussed.
Assumptions and Limitations
The GIS data used to compute mileages generally do not correspond precisely (to the nearest hundredth of
a mile) with the engineering surveys, which utilized vehicle-measured mileages for field reports.
Intersections and other landmarks were adequately noted in the field data, which allowed for confident
spatial analysis involving particular route segments.

125

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Incomplete and Unavailable Information
The best available information was used to analyze impacts to transportation resources for the effects
analysis. Within the timber treatment units, harvest activities and associated roadwork are expected to be
completed within 5 years following initiation of contracts. However, the exact dates, sequence and
schedule of timber operations is unknown at this time.
Spatial and Temporal Context for Effects Analysis
The spatial scale of the impact analysis is the project area plus the inventoried travel corridors connecting
the project area with Interstate 90 and State Highway 1. The short-term timeframe used for this analysis is
0 to 10 years and the long-term effects are those that last beyond 10 years.
Connected Actions, Past, Present, and Foreseeable Activities Relevant to Cumulative Effects
Analysis
Historic and ongoing land use activities continue to affect the project area and have the potential to affect
the cumulative effects analysis for transportation resources.
Past and Present Actions
A number of past and present actions have occurred or are occurring in the assessment area that affect
transportation resources including: mining, livestock grazing, noxious weed control, recreation use,
maintenance of forest roads and trails, firewood cutting, timber harvest, wildfire and fire management and
suppression activities and other land management decisions. These actions are presented in the “master”
list. These actions overlap in time with direct effects.
Past aquatic organism passage construction on FSR 707 road maintenance, and road repair work affect the
transportation indicators and will be discussed in cumulative effects.
Timber harvest has been a relatively common occurrence within the project area. With the high mortality
from the mountain pine beetle, additional danger (hazard) tree removal has been and continues to occur
along roads and in developed recreation sites.
Danger tree removal within the project is being conducted in accordance with the Decision Memo for
Forest-Wide Developed Site Hazard Tree Removal within the BDNF (USDA Forest Service 2009c).
Reasonably Foreseeable Future Activities
Table 26 at the beginning of chapter 3 discloses the present and reasonably foreseeable actions within the
project area that are relevant to this FEIS analysis. Reasonably foreseeable future activities that have the
potential for effects to transportation resources are generally the same as the past and present actions
discussed above and include mining, livestock grazing, noxious weed control, wildfire, fire suppression
activities, and additional road and trail use, maintenance, construction and restoration.
Continued danger tree removal along roads and at developed sites is a likely foreseeable activity as trees
continue to be stressed and die.
Stream rehabilitation is being planned for the Douglas Creek watershed, including replacement of two
stream crossings as well as reconstruction of 400 feet of stream adjacent to NFS Road 707.
Personal firewood and post and pole permits would be issued.

126

Another planned activity will be the Motor Vehicle Use Mapping (MVUM) effort as part of travel
planning and the motor vehicle route and area designation process.

Environmental Consequences
Alternative 1– No Action
Direct, Indirect and Cumulative Effects
Under alternative 1, there would be no direct, indirect or cumulative effects to the transportation system
from the Flint Foothills Project because no project activities are proposed.
Dead and dying trees impacted from the mountain pine beetle would remain and continue to fall and
break, creating potential safety issues as people travel and recreate in the area. Basic annual road
maintenance would continue, although likely at a less efficient rate due to dead and dying trees that
continue to fall across routes, potentially blocking access. Transportation efficiency to and through the
project area would likely decrease due to these deteriorated road conditions.
Road drainage improvements associated with vegetation treatment access and product removal in
compliance with BMPs would not occur in the project area.
There would be no change in the number of miles of open roads.
Danger tree management (hazard tree removal) has occurred in the past and may continue in the future
both along roads and in developed recreation sites, but comprehensive vegetation management would not
occur and merchantable timber would not be salvaged. Basic annual maintenance of roads and trails
would continue as funding allows. Many of these routes currently receive little maintenance, due to
limited funds and backlogged maintenance. This trend would likely continue and impact future use.
Under this alternative there would be a potential threat to transportation infrastructure over time from tree
blow downs, though danger tree management could occur under smaller, separate project plans and
decisions.
Under this alternative, while storm damage road repairs and previously planned projects in Douglas Creek
would occur, overall the project area would not move towards the desired future condition described in
the Forest Plan (pages 11-62). Future travel management decisions are expected to occur in the area.

Alternative 2– Proposed Action
Direct and Indirect Effects
Under alternative 2 both existing roads and newly constructed roads—temporary and permanent system
roads—would be used to transport logs and forest products from the treatment units to main arterial roads
(State Highway 1 and Interstate 90) outside the USFS boundary. Figure 6 in chapter 2 shows the location
of alternative 2 proposed transportation activities. A complete list of route segments and associated
actions by alternative is included in Appendix B of the Transportation Report in the project file.
Past AOP construction on NFS Road 707, major road repair work as well as BMP’s are actions that have
improved NFS Road 707 road structure and improved water quality in North Douglas Creek. Past BMP
work on NFS Road 1544 and NFS Road 1550 have improved road structure and reduced sediment flow

127

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

into Middle Fork Douglas Creek and South Fork Douglas Creek respectively. This work will protect both
the road and Douglas Creek from the impacts of log haul and future road use.
Approximately 58.9 miles of existing roads would be maintained, and another 41.7 miles would be
reconstructed. These improvements would bring the roads to a standard complying with BMPs and also
allow for safe product removal. Just over 1 mile of unauthorized roads would be added to the Forest
transportation system following reconstruction, and would be managed as maintenance level 2 roads (high
clearance vehicles recommended). After vegetation treatments, 4.4 miles of temporary roads on
reconstructed unauthorized routes would be decommissioned; these treatments are further outlined in
table 6. A 0.6-mile reduction of roads open to motor vehicle use would result in the project area following
treatments, and a total reduction of 3.1 miles of road would occur.
Approximately 0.4 miles of UR8-253 (an existing route currently closed to wheeled, motorized vehicles
year around) would be added to the transportation system as a system road (maintenance level 2) and
remain open for public, wheeled motorized use following project implementation. This action would
extend the existing length of UR8-253 open to motorized vehicles by 0.4 miles. The existing route
terminates at the end of the currently closed section and does not provide motorized access to other
routes. Speed, volume, composition and distribution of traffic on this 0.4 mile segment of road would be
limited by road conditions (maintenance level 2) which does not physically allow high speeds or
encourage high volume of traffic. Since the route is short and does not access other routes, existing traffic
distribution in the overall area would change little. Maintenance leve 2 roads limit vehichle use to high
clearance vehicles. Reconstruction of UR8-253 for use as a haul route would provide road geometry and
surfacing compatible with use by a high clearance vehicle. Use of the road does not alter existing rights of
access. The expected light use of the route by high clearance vehicles at low speeds combined with the
short length and current presence of the route would not alter existing effects to natural and cultural
resources, public safety, recreational opportunities and does not conflict with other land uses of adjacent
NFS lands. Maintenance of the short length of road would be minimal.
Nearly 1.3 miles of new road would be added to the Forest transportation system as NFS road, and would
be put into storage (maintenance level 1). These maintenance level 1 roads would be closed to motor
vehicle use while in Maintenance Level 1 storage status; a new NEPA decision would be required to open
these routes, if needed at some future point in time. The 7.2 miles of newly constructed temporary road
would be decommissioned by obliteration following implementation.
The new temporary roads, in particular temporary road T3 (due to proximity to an ephemeral draw in unit
55C), would be constructed away from the bottom of channels to avoid sedimentation. Where feasible,
the roads would be constructed at least 50 feet from the bottom of draws, and a culvert or other means for
stream crossing would be provided for areas where it is necessary to cross the draws. Natural vegetation
filters or slash filter windrows, or suitable alternatives, would be utilized where the roadway drainage is
directed towards the draws.
Timber harvesting and associated transportation activities would be expected to occur within 5 years from
the start of the timber contract(s).
Road use authorizations would need to be obtained for Forest Service, or Forest Service contractor, use of
private routes. Use and maintenance would also be coordinated with the Powell and Granite County
Public Works Departments for public county roads used to implement the timber and restoration
treatments.
Appendix C of the Transportation Report in the project file provides a breakdown of road work items and
estimated costs by alternative.

128

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Cumulative Effects
The direct effects of Alternative 2 would contribute to cumulative effects to the transportation system by
constructing, reconstructing, maintaining, and decommissioning roads within the project area.
National Forest System roads would continue to be used for firewood cutting.
Stream rehabilitation is being planned for the Douglas Creek watershed, including replacement of two
stream crossings as well as reconstruction of 400 feet of stream adjacent to NFS Road 707. This
reasonably foreseeable action would improve stream conditions in the Douglas Creek watershed.
Past AOP construction on NFS Road 707, major road repair work as well as BMP’s are actions that have
improved NFS Road 707 road structure and improved water quality in North Douglas Creek. Past BMP
work on NFS Road 1544 and NFS Road 1550 have improved road structure and reduced sediment into
Middle Fork Douglas Creek and South Fork Douglas Creek respectively. This work will protect both the
road and Douglas Creek from the impacts of log haul and future road use. Additionally the NFS Road
707, 1544 and 1550 improvements will protect the road and Douglas Creek from day to day travel
necessary to control invasive weeds, recreation use, perform mining, conduct livestock grazing and to
construct, recondition and maintain roads and trails.
Future travel management decisions are expected to occur in the area. Travel management direction
changes subsequent to the Flint Foothills Project decision would require additional analysis and decision
making prior to designation.
Collectively, the direct effects of the alternative in combination with the effects of actions discussed
above the Forest transportation system within the Flint Foothills Project area would be in better condition:
more resilient to storms and runoff, and further maintained in accordance with Best Management
Practices.

Alternative 3
Direct and Indirect Effects
Under alternative 3 only existing roads, including NFS and unauthorized routes would be used to
transport logs and forest products from the removal treatment units to main arterial roads (State Highway
1 and Interstate 90) outside the USFS boundary. No new road construction would occur under this
alternative. Figure 8 in chapter 2 shows the location of alternative 3 proposed transportation routes. A
complete list of route segments and associated actions by alternative is included in Appendix B of the
Transportation Report in the project file.
Past AOP construction on NFS Road 707, major road repair work as well as BMP’s are all actions that
have improved NFS Road 707 road structure and improved water quality in North Douglas Creek. Past
BMP work on NFS Road 1544 and NFS Road 1550 have improved road structure and reduced sediment
into Middle Fork Douglas Creek and South Fork Douglas Creek respectively. This work will protect both
the road and Douglas Creek from the impacts of log haul and future road use.
Approximately 47.1 miles of existing roads would be maintained, and another 38.3 miles would be
reconstructed. These improvements would bring the roads to a standard complying with BMPs and also
allowing for safe product removal. Just over 1 mile of open unauthorized roads would be added to the
Forest transportation system following reconstruction, and would be managed as maintenance level 2
roads (high clearance vehicles recommended). After vegetation treatments, 2.3 miles of temporary roads
(reconstructed unauthorized routes) would be decommissioned; these treatments are further outlined in
129

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

table 6. There would be a total reduction of 2.3 miles of road (unauthorized routes) in the project area
following treatments. There would be a negligible change (less than 200 feet) in mileage available for
motor vehicles.
Approximately 0.4 miles of UR8-253 (an existing route currently closed to wheeled, motorized vehicles
year around) would be added to the transportation system as a system road (maintenance level 2) and
remain open for public, wheeled motorized use following project implementation. This action would
extend the existing length of UR8-253 open to motorized vehicles by 0.4 miles. The existing route
terminates at the end of the currently closed section and does not provide motorized access to other
routes. Speed, volume, composition and distribution of traffic on this 0.4 mile segment of road would be
limited by road conditions (maintenance level 2) which does not physically allow high speeds or
encourage high volume of traffic. Since the route is short and does not access other routes, existing traffic
distribution in the overall area would change little. Maintenance leve 2 roads limit vehichle use to high
clearance vehicles. Reconstruction of UR8-253 for use as a haul route would provide road geometry and
surfacing compatible with use by a high clearance vehicle. Use of the road does not alter existing rights
of access. The expected light use of the route by high clearance vehicles at low speeds combined with the
short length and current presence of the route would not alter existing effects to natural and cultural
resources, public safety, recreational opportunities and does not conflict with other land uses of adjacent
NFS lands. Maintenance of the short length of road would be minimal.
Road use authorizations would be the same as for alternative 2.
Road maintenance and reconstruction associated with timber haul, in addition to the removal of dead and
dying trees, would provide for much needed maintenance and also a safer and more efficient
transportation system, allowing for additional mileage to be maintained with future annual maintenance
funds. NFS haul routes would be improved to comply with BMPs.
Appendix C of the Transportation Report in the project file provides a breakdown of road work items and
estimated costs by alternative
Cumulative Effects
The direct effects of Alternative 3 would contribute to cumulative effects to the transportation system by
constructing, reconstructing, maintaining, and decommissioning roads within the project area.
Stream rehabilitation is being planned for the Douglas Creek watershed, including replacement of 2
stream crossings as well as reconstruction of 400 feet of stream adjacent to NFS Road 707.
Past AOP construction on NFS Road 707, major road repair work as well as BMP’s are actions that have
improved NFS Road 707 road structure and improved water quality in North Douglas Creek. Past BMP
work on NFS Road 1544 and NFS Road 1550 have improved road infrastructure and reduced sediment
into Middle Fork Douglas Creek and South Fork Douglas Creek respectively. Additionally the NFS Road
707, 1544 and 1550 improvements will protect the road and Douglas Creek from day to day travel
necessary to control invasive weeds, recreation activity, perform mining, conduct livestock grazing and to
construct, recondition and maintain roads and trails.
National Forest System roads would continue to be used for firewood cutting.
Future travel management decisions are expected to occur in the area. Travel management direction
changes subsequent to the Flint Foothills Project decision would require additional analysis and decision
making prior to designation.

130

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Collectively, the direct effects of the alternative in combination with the effects of actions discussed
above, the Forest transportation system within the Flint Foothills Project area would be in better
condition: more resilient to storms and runoff, further maintained in accordance with Best Management
Practices.
Compliance with Forest Plan and Other Relevant Laws, Regulations, Policies and Plans
The no-action alternative would be consistent with the Forest Plan for infrastructure, although no action
would be taken to achieve the desired conditions. Alternatives 2 and 3 would be consistent with the Forest
Plan desired conditions, goals, objectives and standards for transportation management. Alternatives 2
and 3 activities would include implementing and managing recommendations included in the Pintler
travel analysis (USDA Forest Service 2008). Transportation actions in the action alternatives are also in
accordance with regulations and policies regarding transportation and travel management.

Sensitive Plants
This section serves as the biological evaluation of impacts to USDA Forest Service Northern Region
sensitive plant species, including federally listed species. It is Forest Service policy to protect the habitat
of federally listed threatened and endangered species (Forest Service Manual (FSM) 2670 (USDA, Forest
Service 2005)), and to avoid or minimize adverse impacts to species designated by the Forest Service as
sensitive (FSM 2670.32), thus promoting biodiversity.
In order to determine impacts, all Forest Service projects, programs, and activities are reviewed for
possible effects to federally listed, threatened or endangered plant species and Forest Service designated
sensitive species. No federally listed threatened or endangered plants are known to occur on the BDNF.
Therefore, the following analysis will address only the potential impacts to Forest Service designated
sensitive plant species and their habitats as a result of implementing the proposed Flint Foothills
Vegetation Management Project.

Overview of Issues Addressed
Sensitive plant populations and habitats can be impacted by vegetation management projects. Direct
effects can include disturbance of sensitive plant habitat from project activities and equipment, as well as
direct removal or death of individual plants. Indirect effects that may decrease sensitive plant viability can
include the spread of invasive weeds as a result of disturbance and weed spread, and increased livestock
grazing to areas with reduced overstory cover. These effects can impact overall plant biodiversity. Indirect
effects that may increase sensitive plant viability can include reduced competition from conifers or
overstory species, as well as habitat creation for sensitive plant species adapted to disturbance.
The purpose of this analysis is to:
•
•
•
•

Determine if the alternatives will adversely affect any of the sensitive plant species
Insure that the alternatives do not contribute to the loss of viability of any sensitive plant
species or cause a trend toward federal listing
Comply with USDA Forest Service Region 1 policy (FSM 2600) to insure that sensitive plant
species receive full consideration in the decision-making process
Comply with the Endangered Species Act

Measurement Indicators
The resource indicators are attributes whose measures signal the effects of a pressure on a resource
(Landsberg and Crowley 2004). In order to adequately address impacts to sensitive plants and how the
project will relate to the above regulations and direction, the following resource indicators and units of
measures will be utilized as shown in Table 54 below. These indicators were chosen based on available
data and information presented in two papers discussing resource indicators: Dale and Beyeler 2001; and
Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) 1993.
Abundance: Changes in the number of sensitive plant populations or number of individuals within a
population can result from climate, habitat changes, and stressors (examples include: wildfire, herbivory,
conifer encroachment, disturbance, etc.).
Suitable habitat: The presence of suitable habitat in the area of analysis would indicate that impacts from
the proposed action should be considered.

Determination1

The four possible determinations are: 1) “No impact”– when a project or activity will have no environmental effects on habitat,
individuals, a population or a species; 2) “Beneficial impact”– where impacts area expected to be wholly beneficial, or the project is
designed to benefit the species; 3) “May impact individuals or habitat, but will not likely contribute to a trend towards federal listing or
loss of viability to the population or species”– where impacts are expected to be immeasurable or minor, or that are consistent with
Conservation Strategies or conservation of the species; and 4) “Will impact individuals or habitat with a consequence that the action
will contribute to a trend towards federal listing or cause a loss of viability to the population or species”– where impacts are expected
to be detrimental and substantial, or the project is in conflict with Conservation Strategies or conservation of the species.

Affected Environment
Existing Condition
The Flint Foothills project area is experiencing extensive tree mortality in lodgepole pine, Douglas fir and
ponderosa pine due to the ongoing insect and disease epidemic. Dense conifer stands do not typically
present habitat for BDNF sensitive plant species. However, moist seeps, streams, ponds, bogs, open
meadows, sparsely vegetated slopes, disturbed sites and some road-cut situations can present habitat for
BDNF sensitive plant species.
The following nine species were originally identified as having potential habitat within the project area
during the pre-field review using maps and aerial imagery: Austin’s knotweed (Polygonum douglasii ssp.
austiniae), California false-hellebore (Veratrum californicum), Hall’s rush (Juncus hallii), Lemhi
penstemon (Penstemon lemhiensis), Missoula phlox (Phlox kelseyi var. missoulensis), peculiar moonwort
(Botrychium paradoxum), Sapphire rockcress (Arabis fecunda) wavy moonwort (Botrychium
crenulatum), and western moonwort (Botrychium hesperium). These nine species were surveyed for in the
Flint Foothills project area.
Hall’s rush, Lemhi penstemon and sapphire rockcress were all identified as having potential to occur in
the project area during the pre-field review. However, no populations of these species were found, and

132

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

none are known to occur on the Pintler Ranger District where the Flint Foothills project is proposed. The
project area is likely outside of their range, therefore, they will not be carried forward for analysis. This
proposal would have “no impact” on these species.
In July 2011, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) declared whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) a
warranted but precluded species for federal listing (76 FR 42631), giving it candidate status for the time
being. The Northern Region of the USDA Forest Service has designated whitebark pine a sensitive
species based on the USFWS candidate status. Whitebark pine is known to occur within the project area
at mid- and high elevations.
Austin’s knotweed, California false-hellebore, Missoula phlox, peculiar moonwort, wavy moonwort,
western moonwort, and whitebark pine all have potential habitat within the project area. Known
populations occur on the Pintler Ranger District. These species will be carried forward for analysis.
Austin’s knotweed– Austin’s knotweed is a sparsely distributed species in Montana, occurring in open,
gravelly, and sparsely vegetated slopes with shale-derived soils. There are roughly 30 known occurrences
in Montana, most of which are generally not impacted by human activity due to habitat, though some do
occur along roads (Austin’s knotweed 2012). Populations do occur on the Pintler Ranger District, but are
not known to occur within the project area, and were not found during project surveys. Steep shale slopes
(suitable habitat) are present within the project area, but are not common.
California false-hellebore – California false hellebore is rare in Montana. Roughly six occurrences are
known to exist at the periphery of its range in the southwestern corner of the state, all of which are in the
BDNF. Its habitat includes wet meadows and streambanks (Californian false-hellebore 2012). Populations
occur on the Pintler and Wisdom Ranger Districts. No populations were found during project surveys, but
suitable habitat was present.
Missoula phlox– Missoula phlox is a state endemic, known from over two dozen occurrences in
Montana. It occurs in the foothills on open, exposed slopes of limestone derived material, and in the
subalpine zone on exposed ridges (Missoula phlox 2012). Several locations occur on the Pintler Ranger
District. No populations were found during project surveys, but suitable habitat was present.
Moonworts– Three sensitive moonwort species occur on the Forest and suitable habitat for all three is
present along roadsides, abandoned roads, and within open meadows of the project area. One population
of wavy moonwort was found during project surveys.
Moonworts are an interesting group of perennial plants closely related to ferns with much of their life
being spent underground as immature plants, and reproducing via spores. After germinating underground,
plants may not emerge above ground for 5-10 years. When they do emerge, they produce only one leaf,
and stand only 1-10 cm tall (BDNF sensitive species) making them very difficult to detect. Above ground
emergence is very sporadic, where after emerging one year, they may not return above ground for several
years. Yearly fluctuations in population numbers vary greatly between years because of this, likely due to
environmental and demographic factors (Ahlenslager and Potash 2007). Time of year for emergence
fluctuates yearly as well (Vanderhorst 1997).
Research indicates that most moonworts require habitats that have experienced some level of past
disturbance, 10-30 years previously (both natural and anthropogenic), and are therefore found in early to
mid-successional habitats (Ahlenslager and Potash 2007). Succession to closed canopy forests result in
moonwort decline (ibid.).Moonworts are heavily dependent on fungi, or mycorrhizal associations, for
carbohydrates, minerals, and water uptake (ibid.). Their dependence on a fungal relationship is a possible
explanation for their delayed inhabitance, as fungal species composition and abundance change with

133

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

succession. Successful establishment of moonwort species may be delayed until suitable mycorrhizal
symbionts are present (Anderson and Cariveau 2004).
As stated above, moonworts can be quite small, and are often found under other grass or forb species,
thus very difficult to detect. Typically, a surveyor must determine the habitat to be suitable and then drop
to their hands and knees and part the vegetation in order to detect these tiny plants. This intense survey
effort puts the rarity of several species in question, as to whether they are actually rare, or just under
surveyed. In the past couple years, the Montana Natural Heritage Program has re-evaluated the global and
state rankings (rarity) for moonwort species, and two of the three sensitive Botrychium species on the
BDNF were ranked one to two ranks lower than previously (less rare) based on recent population
information. The third species is suspected to be ranked lower in the future as well (personal
communication with Steve Shelly, Region 1 Botanist, November 10, 2011). These lower rankings could
make two to three of the sensitive moonworts no longer eligible for Region 1 sensitive plant status.
Identification of moonworts to the species level is very difficult, and many populations in Montana are
simply mapped as Botrychiums, without identification to the species level. In addition to the difficulties
in detecting them in the field and proper species identification, there are taxonomic questions that have
yet to be resolved among the moonwort experts (USDA Forest Service 2000b).
Wavy moonwort– Wavy moonwort is a sparsely distributed sensitive plant known from over 40
populations in Montana. Additional populations occur in Arizona, California, Idaho, Oregon, Nevada,
Utah, Washington, and Wyoming, as well as in Alberta and British Columbia, Canada (Wavy moonwort
2012). Prior to project surveys, there were several known locations of wavy moonwort on the Pintler
Ranger District of the BDNF, most within 5 miles of each other.
One new population of wavy moonwort was found during project surveys, occurring within an abandoned
logging road which bisects the proposed treatment units 32ST and 33C. The population consisted of
roughly 15 to 30 individuals within a half-acre area (2010). The site is located on the north side of a draw
with saplings encroaching into the road prism, and surrounded by much larger Douglas-fir and spruce.
The site was noticeably shadier than other wavy moonwort sites observed by the botanist. Wavy
moonwort is commonly found occupying roadsides, meadows, wet swales, and edges of marshes or other
open disturbed sites. With continued succession towards a dense, closed-canopy forest, moonwort
populations are known to decline (Ahlenslager and Potash 2007). With the current site conditions, it is
anticipated that continued encroachment and shading by conifers will reduce the viability of the habitat
and will likely lead to a reduction or loss of the population over time (Mincemoyer 2012, personal
communication).
Peculiar moonwort – Peculiar moonwort is a sparsely distributed species, being irregularly distributed in
the west in Canada, Oregon, Utah and Washington (Peculiar moonwort 2012). Over 24 populations are
known in Montana. It is associated with wet meadows of spruce and lodgepole pine forests, but is also
known to occur along roadsides on the BDNF. Life history and ecology is similar to that described above
for wavy moonwort.
The inconspicuous nature of peculiar moonwort, sometimes less than one inch tall (personal observation)
and moonworts in general make it very difficult to detect during project surveys, as mentioned previously.
There are known populations on the district as well as large areas of suitable habitat found within the
project area, and a presence of a wavy moonwort population within the project area. This makes a strong
case for there being peculiar moonwort in the project area. Therefore, peculiar moonwort will be analyzed
as if known occurrences are within the project area.

134

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Western moonwort– Western moonwort is a sparsely distributed species across its range where it occurs
in eastern and western North America. In the Rocky Mountains it extends from Arizona north into Alberta
and Saskatchewan. Roughly 30 populations are known in Montana (Western moonwort 2012). On the
BDNF, it is only known to occur on the Pintler Ranger District. Life history and ecology is similar to that
described above for wavy moonwort.
As with peculiar moonwort, the difficulty in detecting individuals, the amount of suitable habitat, and the
presence of wavy moonwort all make a strong case for not discounting western moonworts occurrence in
the project area. Therefore, western moonwort will be analyzed as if known occurrences are within the
project area.
Whitebark pine– Whitebark pine is a common conifer of subalpine forests and can be a dominant
species of treeline and Krummhotz habitats (Whitebark pine 2012). It can also occur in mid-elevation
mixed-conifer stands.
Project-specific surveys were completed for whitebark pine within the Flint Foothills Project area, and
identified approximately 683 acres of whitebark pine, located in whitebark pine dominated stands or
mixed-conifer stands with whitebark present (Vegetation section). Many of the mature whitebark pine
trees observed within the project area have been moderately to severely impact by a combination of
blister rust (Cronartiam ribicola) and mountain pine beetles (Dendroctonus ponderosae). Forest wide
monitoring has shown a substantial amount of whitebark pine regeneration established under more pure
whitebark pine stands, and mature whitebark pine trees persisting in the face of both beetle and blister rust
pressure (USDA Forest Service 2011f). This establishment of whitebark pine seedlings underneath dead
whitebark mature trees has been observed in the project area.
Whitebark pine occurs most commonly at the highest elevations in the project area, with a few scattered
individuals or in smaller (0.25-acre) patches down to the mid-elevations (Vegetation section). Stand
exams identified whitebark pine within three mid-elevation burn units 3B, 4B and 5B. No whitebark pine
was found within harvest units (Bruce Schuelke 2014, personal communication).
In upper subalpine habitats, whitebark pine functions as a keystone species because of its various roles in
supporting community diversity, and as a foundation species for its roles in promoting community
development and stability. These roles include: providing snow capture and retention; carbon storage;
increasing biodiversity; and serving as a good food source for wildlife. Conifer encroachment into
whitebark pine habitat, resulting from extensive mortality due to exotic white pine blister rust, the native
mountain pine beetle infestation, and wildfire exclusion is occurring range wide (Vegetation section).
Warming temperatures are thought to further increase the rate of mortality due to favorable conditions for
white pine blister rust and mountain pine beetle (Greater Yellowstone Coordinating Committee (GYCC)
2011). Several agencies are planning and implementing protection and restoration efforts within
whitebark pine stands across its range. Some of these include: protecting apparently rust-resistant trees
and seed cones; planting rust-resistant trees back into the communities; reducing fuels and canopy cover
around whitebark pine stands; and incorporating fire management into whitebark pine stand protection
(GYCC 2011).
Monitoring whitebark pine stands on the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest began in 2010 and is
planned to expand and continue on the Forest. Nine plots were established across the Forest and data
collected included: number of seedlings, number of live trees over 4.5 feet tall, number of dead trees over
4.5 feet tall, percent live with blister rust, percent live with mountain pine beetle infection, and percent
live without either blister rust or mountain pine beetle. The initial data collected showed the majority of
trees at the nine monitoring plots in the seedling stage (49 percent) representing good regeneration, and

135

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

73 percent were live without mountain pine beetle or blister rust infestation (Vegetation section) (USDA
Forest Service 2011f).
Of all the things ailing whitebark pine, timber harvest was not identified as a threat or a source for its
decline ( FR76 42631). Fire management policies were however determined to be inadequate to reduce or
eliminate the threat of fire suppression across the entire range of whitebark pine. Fire Management
policies include both suppression activities and prescribed fire. Of most concern for whitebark pine is
continued fire suppression. Specific mitigation designed to protect concentrations of whitebark pine in the
proposed burn units is included. Though some individuals may be lost, the project may also open up
additional habitat for whitebark pine regeneration.

Desired Condition
The desired condition is derived from laws and FS policy. The National Forest Management Act (NFMA)
of 1976 directs the FS to provide for diversity of plant and animal communities (biodiversity). Forest
Service direction ( Forest Service Manual 2600, Chapter 2672 – see project file) requires programs or
activities be reviewed for potential effects on sensitive species. Under this manual direction, agency
decisions must avoid or minimize impacts to sensitive plants. If adverse impacts cannot be avoided, the
significance of the potential impacts must be analyzed and must not result in a loss of species viability, or
create significant trends toward federal listing.
The desired condition as it pertains to sensitive plants is stated in the Forest Plan, and directs the BDNF to
maintain and restore sensitive plant populations and their habitat. Large core populations or fringe-ofrange populations of sensitive plants are to be conserved in research natural areas, botanical special
interest areas, or protected as populations in conservation strategies or project design specifications (FP, p.
43).

Environmental Consequences
Methodology
A pre-field review of the BDNF Sensitive Plants Program files, GIS resources , and the Montana Natural
Heritage database (MNHP 2009-2011) was conducted to identify any known populations of sensitive
plants within the project area, and to determine potential habitats (A list of all sensitive plants on the
BDNF, which identifies presence of populations and suitable habitat, is included in Appendix B of the
sensitive plant report in the project file). Prior to project-specific surveys, no sensitive plant populations
or protected, managed habitats were known to occur within the treatment units. Proposed units containing
potential habitat for sensitive plants were identified through this pre-field review and selected for field
survey.
During 2010 and 2011 field seasons, a total of 55 units were surveyed, as well as ten miles of roads,
covering 3,339 acres, or 59 percent of the total proposed acres and miles in the proposed action (acres of
each unit and miles of each road surveyed are in Appendix A of the sensitive plant report in the project
file). Botanical surveys consisted of the intuitive–controlled survey method 38. Two survey periods were
38
Intuitive controlled surveys are intensive searches in those portions of the project area with the highest potential
for locating the target species. The surveyor walks through the project area enough to see a representative crosssection of all the major habitat types and environmental conditions, looking for the target species while en route
between different areas. When the surveyor arrives at an area of potential habitat (that was determined in the prefield review or encourntered during the field visit), an intensive search is made.

136

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

completed in 2010, one in June targeting the early-blooming species and one in August targeting the lateblooming sensitive plant species. In 2011, only August and September surveys were conducted.
As stated previously, wavy moonwort was found along an abandoned logging road intended for use
during project activities, and whitebark pine is known to occur in approximately 683 acres across the
project area. Peculiar moonwort and western moonwort are also likely to occur within the project area.
Incomplete and Unavailable Information
A concerted effort was made to identify potential sensitive plant habitats using GIS, satellite imagery,
field visits and local knowledge. Surveys were scheduled to overlap with sensitive plant flowering
windows as much as possible. However, there is always a low possibility of an individual or small
population going undetected during surveys.
This Biological Evaluation was prepared based on presently available information. If the action is
modified in a manner that causes effects not considered, or if new information becomes available that
reveals that the action may impact sensitive plants in a manner or to an extent not previously considered,
a new or revised Biological Evaluation may be required.
Spatial and Temporal Context for Effects Analysis
The spatial analysis boundary for direct and indirect effects includes all National Forest System lands
within the project area. The focus of analysis is more on treatment units because impacts to sensitive
plants are more likely to occur where project treatments are planned. The spatial scale is limited to the
project area since no impacts to sensitive plants from proposed project activities are anticipated outside
the project area boundary.
The cumulative effects analysis spatial bounds includes both National Forest System lands and lands of
other ownerships within the project area boundary, so as to capture other activities that may affect
sensitive plants cumulatively within the analysis area.
The temporal boundary covers the immediate effects at the time of implementation and extends into the
future 50 years. The temporal scale is based on the progression period of sensitive plant habitats being
encroached by conifers, the period required for sensitive plants to colonize new disturbances (Ahlenslager
and Potash 2007), and the time stated in the Vegetation Section.
Past, Present, and Reasonably Foreseeable Activities Relevant to Cumulative Effects Analysis
Table 26 at the beginning of chapter 3 discloses the present and reasonably foreseeable actions within the
project area that are relevant to this FEIS analysis. Past and present actions that affect sensitive plant
habitats include fire suppression, timber harvest, roadside hazard tree removal, prescribed burning,
livestock grazing, invasive plants control, recreation activities, and storm and damaged road and culvert
repair. These actions have contributed to the existing vegetation and habitat conditions and will likely
continue into the future, and will be considered in the cumulative effects analysis.

Alternative 1– No Action
Direct, Indirect and Cumulative Effects
Under alternative 1, there would be no direct, indirect or cumulative effects to the sensitive plants from
the Flint Foothills Vegetation Project because no project activities are proposed.

137

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

The no-action alternative provides a means for evaluating the current ecosystem conditions as a baseline.
The proposed salvage of dead and dying lodgepole pine stands, seed tree harvest and commercial thin of
Douglas-fir/ponderosa pine stands, and precommercial thinning and prescribed burning of mid-elevation
mixed conifer stands would not occur. The no-action alternative would result in the continued mortality of
dense Douglas-fir and lodgepole stands as due to insects and disease.
The lack of treatment would allow conifer and other herbaceous species to increase in density and canopy
layering (see the Vegetation section). The impacts to sensitive plants could include fuel loading and
increased fire severity, changed habitat conditions and competition; however it may take decades for
sensitive plant populations and their suitable habitats to experience these impacts.
Sensitive Moonworts - The known wavy moonwort population would continue to occur along the
abandoned logging road for some time. Moonwort habitats are known to be ephemeral (Zika et al. 1995),
and therefore, the continued trend of conifer encroachment into wavy moonworts habitat would likely
reduce the abundance and viability of the current population by over-shading and lead to an eventual loss
of the population (Mincemoyer 2012). Loss of the population could potentially occur within 50 years,
pending the lack of a natural disturbance such as fire, or blow-down. This loss is unrelated to project
activities, but a natural progression of the disturbed site, and a natural cycle of the species.
Zika (1995) states that a number of moonwort habitats were historically maintained by fire; fire
suppression has led to vegetative succession and fuel loading, which has reduced habitat. Zika presumes
that moonworts must either withstand some degree of fire or readily recolonize burned areas from
adjacent populations. Under the no-action alternative, no prescribed burning would occur, allowing
vegetation conditions to exist in their current state or progress into a later-seral condition.
Western moonwort and peculiar moonwort, if present, would experience similar conditions from conifer
encroachment as those described above. Though much of this discussion is speculation, we will assume
that habitat for sensitive moonworts will come and go with natural succession and natural and man-made
disturbance events, as discussed by the literature (Zika et al. 1995; Ahlenslager and Potash 2007; and
Beatty et al. 2003).
Whitebark Pine - Whitebark pine populations would continue to experience blister rust and mountain
pine beetle infections and infestations, conifer encroachment and fire suppression (Keane and Parsons
2010). These impacts are unrelated to the lack of treatment occurring within the project area and would
not constitute an indirect effect since they will occur regardless, as this is not a whitebark pine restoration
project. The continuation of current conditions may reduce population abundance and habitat within the
project area, but would not be related to project activities or lack thereof.
Austin’s knotweed, Missoula phlox and California false-hellebore - These species all prefer open habitats.
Under the no-action alternative, in the absence of natural disturbance such as fire, conifer encroachment
may continue to occupy open habitats. Assuming that sensitive plants would occupy these open habitats
in the future is entirely speculation and cannot be known for several years or decades. Since none of these
species are known to occur within the project area, conifer encroachment into potential habitat will not be
considered an indirect impact to the species.
Since there are no direct or indirect impacts to sensitive plants associated with the no-action alternative,
there are no cumulative impacts to consider.

138

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Summary of Effects - No Action
Federally Listed Plants
Due to the lack of federally listed plant species within the Flint Foothills Project area, and on the Forest in
general, implementation of the no-action alternative would have no effect on listed plants.
Forest Service Sensitive Plants
Wavy Moonwort- In the relative short term (i.e., next 10-20 years), wavy moonwort would not be
impacted by the no-action alternative. However, due to the low viability of the habitat, it is unlikely that
the population will survive in the long term (i.e., over 50 years) due to the natural colonization of the site
by conifers without a natural disturbance such as fire. This reduction in abundance and viability is
unrelated to project activities. As mentioned previously, the ephemeral nature of moonwort populations
makes this loss a natural event. Therefore, the no-action alternative would have no impact on wavy
moonwort (Botrychium crenulatum).
Peculiar and Western Moonworts - Though not found during project surveys, it is likely that peculiar
and western moonworts occur within the project area. Impact to these species would be similar to those of
wavy moonwort. Therefore the no-action alternative would have no impact to either peculiar moonwort
(Botrychium paradoxum) or western moonwort (Botrychium hesperium).
Whitebark Pine - Whitebark pine is experiencing decline across the west. Under the no-action
alternative this decline—reduced abundance—would naturally continue. The Flint Foothills Project was
not designed with whitebark pine restoration in mind, and though design features are included to protect
them within treatment units, it is unlikely that the lack of treatment would be detrimental to whitebark
pine. Therefore, the no-action alternative would have no impact on whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis).
Austin’s Knotweed– Austin’s knotweed was not found within the project area, however suitable habitat
was present on a few shale slopes. Encroachment into these habitats could continue under the no-action
alternative regardless of project activities without a natural disturbance such as fire. The no-action
alternative would have no impact to Austin’s knotweed (Polygonum douglasii var. austiniae) as none are
known to occur within the project area.
Missoula Phlox– Missoula phlox was not found during project surveys, but potential habitat was found in
open windswept meadows. Potential habitat could be impacted by the continued encroachment of conifers
into open meadows. This would occur regardless of project activities, pending no natural disturbance such
as fire. The no-action alternative would have no impact on Missoula phlox populations as none are
known to occur within the project area.
California False-Hellebore – California false-hellebore was not found during project surveys, but
potential habitat was found in open wet meadows. Potential habitat could be impacted by the continued
encroachment of conifers into open wet meadows. This would occur regardless of project activities,
without a natural disturbance such as fire. The no-action alternative would have no impact on California
false-hellebore populations as none are known to occur within the project area.

139

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Alternative 2– Proposed Action
Direct and Indirect Impacts
Sensitive moonworts - Moonworts species typically require early successional habitats with periodic
disturbances. Timber harvest and road maintenance or construction can both harm moonwort populations
by directly damaging individuals or their habitat, while also benefiting the species by creating future
suitable habitats (Beatty et al. 2003; Ahlenslager and Potash 2007). Ahlenslager and Potash (2007)
suggest that physical disruption of the soil surface organic horizon is the greatest threat to moonworts
from timber harvest activities, and changes in hydrology may be another associated concern. Vanderhorst
(1997) states that several wavy moonwort populations in Montana have been lost or threatened by timber
activities. Despite these threats, it is also known that moonwort species commonly occur in old logging
roads which resulted from timber activities, and that thinning activities can create openings to enhance
existing populations or create new habitat for moonworts (Beatty et al. 2003; Ahlenslager and Potash
2007). Under the proposed activity, the abandoned logging road where wavy moonwart occurs in units
32ST and 33C would be re-opened and utilized during the proposed activities. By utilizing this road, most
of the known population would be removed during implementation.
The current habitat of the one known wavy moonwort population is experiencing conifer encroachment
and is not expected to persist long term (i.e., beyond 50 years) ), pending no other natural disturbance.
This population of wavy moonwort is not of conservation significance because of its occurrence on an
existing road prism and its low habitat viability. Three new populations of wavy moonwort have been
found on the forest since 2010. With the increasing number of populations being found (lowered ranking
for the species), and the large number of populations, (more than 40) within the state, and the number of
intact populations on the district, the loss or damage to this one population is not significant to the overall
viability and trend of the species as a whole (personal communication with Steve Shelly, Region 1
Botanist, on 11.10.11). Potentially the re-opening of the existing road prism and removal of surrounding
trees will create suitable habitat for wavy moonwort to recolonize as it did following the original road
construction and harvest. Overall, in the short term, population abundance is expected to be greatly
reduced during and following project activities. In the long term (10-30 years post disturbance), suitable
habitat availability will increase and population abundance may stabilize if the population resumes the
disturbed habitat.
Peculiar and western moonworts may experience similar impact if present (undetected) within the project
activity area.
Prescribed burning could directly harm moonwort individuals and indirectly create more open habitat if
individuals are present within the burn units (undetected during surveys). Zika et al. (1995) state that a
number of moonwort habitats were historically maintained by fire and fire suppression has led to
vegetative succession and fuel loading, reducing habitat. Since moonworts are known to occur in post-fire
habitats, it is presumed that moonworts must either withstand some degree of fire or readily recolonize
burned areas from adjacent populations. Short-term impacts to moonwort species from prescribed burning
could be direct removal of above-ground structures. Long-term impacts could be improved habitat for the
next 10-50 years.
Whitebark pine- Approximately 683 acres of whitebark pine occur within the project area, primarily in
the higher elevations, but also at mid-elevations and in prescribed burning units 3B, 4B and 5B. The
felling of conifers prior to burning activities would avoid areas within units that have concentrations of
whitebark pine, and therefore would reduce potential impacts to whitebark pine. Fire ignition patterns
would also avoid the use of fire directly in areas of units that have concentrations of whitebark pine.
Some incidental burning of small seedling and sapling individuals could occur.
140

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Wildfire is important for whitebark pine regeneration, as whitebark pine survives low intensity fires and
can benefit from stand replacing fire where regeneration is most successful. Arno (1986) suggests that fire
is important in perpetuating an abundance of whitebark pine. Keane et al. (1994) have found that other
conifer species tend to replace whitebark pine in the absence of fire. Although burning in whitebark pine
stands can assist in whitebark pine regeneration, it is not an objective of the proposed treatment. Direct
impacts to whitebark pine from prescribed burning can include damage or death of individual trees as a
result of burning. Concentrations would be avoided through mitigation. Indirect impacts to whitebark pine
could include the creation of canopy openings conducive for caching whitebark seed by Clark’s
nutcracker birds; hence, increasing potential whitebark pine regeneration and abundance. Conducting the
prescribed burning during spring conditions controls fire spread. The potential effects to whitebark pine
could be greater with fall burning, as fire spread with ground vegetation would be more difficult to
control. See the Vegetation Section for further information on impacts.
Timber projects have been shown to benefit whitebark pine by reducing competition and allowing for
more rapid growth (Keane et al. 2007). Reducing high fuel loads around whitebark pine stands can also
reduce the potential for high-severity wildfires, which can be detrimental to whitebark pine if
regeneration is not successful (76 FR 42631).
Austin’s knotweed, Missoula phlox and California false-hellebore - These species all have suitable
habitats within the project area. These habitats may be improved by implementation of the project
activities, as encroaching conifer species would be removed, providing more open areas. It cannot be
known whether these species will occupy disturbance areas in the future, but reducing canopy cover
coupled with soil disturbance can provide opportunity in some situations. Stating that suitable habitat may
be increased or improved does not result in an impact to the species because no individuals of Austin’s
knotweed, Missoula phlox or California false-hellebore are known to occur within the project area. With
no direct or indirect impacts occurring to these species, there are no cumulative impacts.
Cumulative Impacts for Alternatives 2 and 3
Relevant past, present, and future processes and activities have occurred and will continue to occur on
Forest Service, private, and state lands within and adjacent to the proposed project area. The proposed
activities of the alternatives combined with Roadside 4 Hazard Tree Removal, timber harvest, livestock
grazing and recreational activities (hiking, OHV, hunting, etc.), invasive plants control, wildfire
suppression, mining, aspen treatments, prescribed burning and storm damaged road and culvert repairs
could incrementally increase impacts to sensitive plant populations.
Moonworts - Timber harvest has occurred previously in the units where wavy moonwort occurs along the
abandoned logging road in units 32ST and 33C. This previous disturbance likely made the habitat suitable
for wavy moonwort and other moonworts to occupy. Natural and man-made disturbances, including fire,
are known to create suitable moonwort habitats (Zika et al. 1995). The Roadside 4 Hazard Tree Removal
project, which has some units overlapping into the Flint Foothills Project area, was found to have
sensitive moonworts occupying a gravel road pull-out. This population is located outside the Flint
Foothills analysis area by Georgetown Lake, but is being discussed as context. Additional habitat will
likely be created by the Roadside 4 Hazard Tree Removal project, as it will open up the canopy creating
an early successional, disturbed habitat that is favorable to moonwort species 10-30 years in the future.
Livestock grazing occurs within the project area, and includes the area where wavy moonwort is present
(the Hall Allotment). Livestock can impact moonwort species directly by grazing above ground
structures, removing reproductive structures, and by trampling (Beatty et al. 2003). Indirectly, livestock
can impact moonwort habitat by compacting soils, facilitating the spread of weeds and by changing the

141

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

plant community (ibid). Currently, the population of moonwort found within the project area shows no
signs of being impacted, or even utilized, by livestock.
Conifer canopy removal may attract livestock to the population area and increase grazing intensity, which
could reduce the chances of the wavy moonwort population returning to the site, or reduce the abundance
of wavy moonwort if present.
The Douglas Cabin, roughly 0.25 mile from the wavy moonwort population, is located in the project area,
and recreation activities such as hiking, horseback riding, OHV use and hunting could occur within the
wavy moonwort population area. However, these activities take place at low to moderate levels, and
should have little impact on the moonwort population. No signs of recreation use were observed near the
population during surveys.
Invasive plant species can make occupied and suitable habitats unsuitable for sensitive plant species
causing long-term impacts and reducing biodiversity (CEQ 1993). The treatment of invasive plants
through various means can benefit sensitive plants by eradication, control, or containment in their
habitats. However treatment methods, such as broadcast spraying, can cause short-term harm to sensitive
plants if they come into contact with the chemical (USDA Forest Service 2000b). The Noxious Weed
Control Program Record of Decision for the BDNF (USFS 2002) protects sensitive plants by employing
the following mitigation measure:
“No herbicide will be applied directly on sensitive plants during spot applications and a 100’
buffer will be employed around known populations of sensitive plants during broadcast
applications (including aerial). All aerial treatment areas will be surveyed for sensitive plants
prior to initial spraying.”

Invasive plant species treatment activities do occur within the project area, but not within the immediate
vicinity of the known wavy moonwort population, as no invasive plants were observed. Invasive plant
treatment activities are not known to be posing impacts to sensitive plants within the project area at this
time.
If aspen treatments were to occur within the project area, in areas where sensitive moonwort are present
(currently unknown populations), there may be incidental damage or removal of individuals or
populations. Likely the treatment of aspen stands for increased resiliency will also benefit sensitive
moonworts, by removing encroaching conifers and maintaining an open canopy. Short-term impacts to
individuals may occur, with subsequent long-term benefits to the population through habitat
improvement. The newly opened stand and increase in aspen suckers may attract livestock and wildlife
into the area if barriers are not in place. Mitigation measures will be incorporated into aspen treatments
where sensitive moonwort populations occurs to minimize impacts from treatment activities and the
potential increase in livestock and wildlife use of the population area. The one known population of wavy
moonwort within the treatment units does not occur within an aspen stand.
Fire suppression can impact sensitive moonwort species by allowing conifer encroachment to alter their
existing and suitable habitats (Beatty et al. 2003), making it too shady for their existence. Prescribed
burning in the past, likely created suitable habitat for sensitive moonwort species by reducing canopy
cover, and may create additional suitable habitat in the future as a result of project activities.
Proposed activities for storm damaged roads and culvert replacement could impact sensitive moonwort
populations if they occur along these routes or adjacent to the culvert footprint. None are known to occur
at this time.

142

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Overall, the incremental cumulative impacts to sensitive moonwort species would be minimal. Fire
suppression and the resulting conifer encroachment and successional changes over the next 50 years could
have moderate impacts on existing sensitive moonwort populations within the project area, regardless of
project activities.
Whitebark pine- Fire is an important component of whitebark pine ecology, as described in the
Vegetation section. The continued suppression of wildfires can cause an increase in fire severity in these
high-elevation whitebark pine stands, which can have mixed results for whitebark pine. A high-severity
fire would likely kill all the whitebark pine individuals in the fire area, as whitebark pine cannot usually
withstand such fires. In addition, high-severity fires could have the undesirable effects of burning healthy
rust resistant individuals of whitebark pine. However, if seed producing individuals are somewhat nearby,
it could provide opportunity for Clark’s Nutcracker to cache seeds in the newly burned area for
regeneration (FR76 42631). At this time of whitebark pine decline, regeneration is of great importance.
Proposed mining activities (Collin’s Road) within the project area would remove some whitebark pine
within the proposed road construction area. The amount of whitebark pine removed, less than 50 trees,
would be insignificant in the project area and rangewide, as it would entail a single swath through a stand.
Additional whitebark pine may be removed during other mineral activities within the project area as well
if present. These activities would be small and cause minimal removal of whitebark pine.
If aspen treatments were to occur within the project area, there may be incidental removal of individual
whitebark pine seedling and saplings during treatment activities, if present. The newly opened stand and
increase in aspen suckers may attract livestock and wildlife into the area if barriers are not in place. It is
thought that few whitebark pine would occur within aspen treatment units and therefore impacts to
whitebark pine would be very small. All mature cone-bearing individuals will be retained.
Livestock grazing, recreation activities, and invasive plants and treatment activities within whitebark pine
habitat would have little if any impact. Overall, short-term cumulative impacts to whitebark pine would
be minimal, with the continued fire suppression and the resulting conifer encroachment having the
potential for moderate impacts within the next 50 years.
Summary of Effects
Federally Listed Plants
Due to the lack of federally listed plant species within the Flint Foothills Project area, and on the Forest in
general, implementation of the proposed action shall have no effect on listed plants.
Forest Service Sensitive Plants
As stated, direct, and indirect impacts to sensitive plants can result from implementing vegetation
management projects.
Wavy Moonwort– Due to the extent of known populations of wavy moonwort in Montana and
surrounding states, and the low viability of the population habitat along the abandoned logging road in
units 32ST and 33C, implementation of the proposed action, hence removal of the known population, in
combination with cumulative impacts, may impact individuals or habitat, but will not likely
contribute to a trend towards federal listing or loss of viability to the population or species of wavy
moonwort (Botrychium crenulatum). Though this alternative would cause a loss in population viability, it
is believed that the viability of the population is at risk even under the no-action alternative due to habitat
decline.

143

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

The known population of wavy moonwort that would be impacted by alternative 2 is not of conservation
concern due to its location within an existing road prism and low habitat viability. The loss of this one
population would not impact the viability of the species as a whole due to the larger distribution of the
species in the State and on the District, as described above. Moonworts are known to be ephemeral,
having habitats change with succession. Older populations fade out while new populations appear in new
disturbances. It is possible that the species would return to the site 10-30 years post disturbance.
Peculiar and Western Moonworts – Due to the likelihood of peculiar and western moonworts occurring
within the project area, direct and indirect impacts are possible. Impacts would be similar to wavy
moonwort if present. Therefore, implementation of the proposed action may impact individuals or
habitat, but will not likely contribute to a trend towards federal listing or loss of viability to the
population or species of peculiar and western moonwort (Botrychium paradoxum and B. hesperium). It
is possible that the species would return to sites 10-30 years post disturbance.
Whitebark Pine– Approximately 683 acres of whitebark pine occur within the project area, primarily in
the higher elevations, but also at mid-elevations. Project-specific design features and mitigation measures
(chapter 2) are in place to protect clusters of whitebark pine, and to avoid concentrations in burn units;
however some individuals may incidentally be impacted. Implementation of the proposed action in
combination with cumulative impacts may impact individuals or habitat, but will not likely contribute
to a trend towards federal listing or loss of viability to the population or species of whitebark pine
(Pinus albicaulis). The incidental loss of some whitebark pine during project implementation would not
be significant to the species as a whole as this species is very common across the forest and the western
states.
Austin’s Knotweed– Austin’s knotweed was not found within the project area. Suitable habitat was
present on a few shale slopes. Suitable habitat could be improved or increased by the removal of
encroaching conifers. However, the influx of Austin’s knotweed into these treated areas is very
speculative. As such, implementation of the proposed action alternative would have no impact on
Austin’s knotweed (Polygonum douglasii var. austiniae).
Missoula Phlox– Missoula phlox was not found during project surveys, but suitable habitat was found in
open windswept meadows. Suitable habitat could be improved or increased by the removal of
encroaching conifers. However, the influx of Missoula phlox into these treated areas is very speculative.
Implementation of the proposed action alternative shall have no impact on Missoula phlox (Phlox kelseyi
var. missoulensis).
California False-Hellebore – California false-hellebore was not found during project surveys, but
suitable habitat was found in open wet meadows. Suitable habitat could be improved or increased by the
removal of encroaching conifers. However, the influx of California false-hellebore into these treated areas
is very speculative. Implementation of the proposed action alternative would have no impact on
California false-hellebore (Veratrum californicum).

Alternative 3
Direct and Indirect Impacts
Sensitive moonworts - Moonworts species typically require early successional habitats with periodic
disturbances. Timber harvest and road maintenance or construction can both harm moonwort populations
by directly damaging individuals or their habitat, while also benefiting the species by creating future
suitable habitats (Beatty et al. 2003; Ahlenslager and Potash 2007). Ahlenslager and Potash (2007)

144

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

suggest that physical disruption of the soil O-horizon is the greatest threat to moonworts from timber
harvest activities, and changes in hydrology may be another associated concern. Vanderhorst (1997) states
that several wavy moonwort populations in Montana have been lost or threatened by timber activities.
Despite these threats, it is also known that moonwort species commonly occur in old logging roads which
resulted from timber activities, and that thinning activities can create openings to enhance existing
populations or create new habitat for moonworts (Beatty et al. 2003; Ahlenslager and Potash 2007).
Under alternative 3, the abandoned logging road where wavy moonwort occurs in units 32ST and 33C
would be re-opened and utilized during the proposed activities. By utilizing this road, most of the known
population would be removed during implementation.
The current habitat of the one known wavy moonwort population is experiencing conifer encroachment
and is not expected to persist long term (i.e., beyond 50 years), pending other natural disturbances.
This population of wavy moonwort is not of conservation significance because of its occurrence on an
existing road prism and low habitat viability.
With the increasing number of populations being found (lowered ranking for the species), and the large
number of populations (more than 40) within the State, and the number of intact populations on the
District, the loss or damge to this one population is not significant to the overall viability and trend of the
species as a whole (personal communication with Steve Shelly, Region 1 Botanist, on 11.10.11). Likely
the re-opening of the existing road prism and removal of surrounding trees will create suitable habitat for
wavy moonwort to recolonize as it did following the original road construction and harvest. Overall, in
the short term, population abundance is expected to be greatly reduced during and following project
activities. In the long-term (10-30 years post disturbance), suitable habitat availability will increase and
population abundance may stabilize if the population resumes the disturbed habitat.
Peculiar and western moonworts may experience similar impact if present, but undetected, within the
project activity area.
Prescribed burning could directly harm moonwort individuals, or indirectly create more open habitat.
Zika et al. (1995) state that a number of moonwort habitats were historically maintained by fire; therefore,
fire suppression has led to vegetative succession and fuel loading reducing habitat. Since moonworts are
known to occur in post-fire habitats, it is presumed that moonworts must either withstand some degree of
fire or readily recolonize burned areas from adjacent populations. Short-term impacts to moonwort
species from prescribed burning could be direct removal of above ground structures. Long-term impacts
could be improved habitat.
Whitebark pine- Approximately 683 acres of whitebark pine occur within the project area, primarily in
the higher elevations, but also at mid-elevations and in proposed units 3B, 4B and 5B. The felling of
conifers prior to burning activities would avoid areas in units that have concentrations of whitebark pine.
Fire ignition patterns would also avoid the use of fire directly in areas of units that have concentrations of
whitebark pine (EIS design features and mitigation measures).
Wildfire is important for whitebark pine regeneration, as whitebark pine survives low-intensity fires and
can benefit from stand-replacing fire where regeneration is most successful. Arno (1986) suggests that fire
is important in perpetuating an abundance of whitebark pine. Keane et al. (1994) have found that other
conifer species tend to replace whitebark pine in the absence of fire. Although burning in whitebark pine
stands can assist in whitebark pine regeneration, it is not an objective of alternative 3. Direct impacts to
whitebark pine from prescribed burning can include damage or death of individual trees as a result of
burning. Concentrations would be avoided through mitigation . Indirect impacts to whitebark pine could
include the creation of canopy openings conducive for caching whitebark seed by Clark’s nutcracker

145

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

birds; hence, increasing potential whitebark pine regeneration. Conducting the prescribed burning during
spring conditions controls fire spread. The potential effects to whitebark pine could be greater with fall
burning, as fire spread with ground vegetation would be more difficult to control. See the Vegetation
Section for further information on whitebark pine.
Timber projects have been shown to benefit whitebark pine by reducing competition and allowing for
more rapid growth (Keane et al. 2007). Reducing high fuel loads around whitebark pine stands can also
reduce the potential for high-severity wildfires from occurring, which can be detrimental to whitebark
pine if regeneration is not successful (76 FR 42631).
Austin’s knotweed, Missoula phlox and California false-hellebore all have suitable habitats within the
project area. These habitats may be improved by implementation of alternative 3, as encroaching conifer
species would be removed, providing more open habitats. It cannot be known whether these species will
occupy disturbance areas in the future, but reducing canopy cover coupled with soil disturbance can
provide opportunity in some situations. Stating that suitable habitat may be increased or improved does
not result in an impact to the species because no individuals of Austin’s knotweed, Missoula phlox or
California false-hellebore are known to occur within the project area. With no direct or indirect impacts
occurring to these species, there are no cumulative impacts.
Cumulative Impacts
Cumulative impacts would be the same as for the proposed action alternative and are addressed
previously.
Summary of Effects
Federally Listed Plants
Due to the lack of federally listed plant species within the Flint Foothills Project area, and on the Forest in
general, implementation of alternative 3 shall have no effects on listed plants.
Forest Service Sensitive Plants
As stated, direct, and indirect impacts to sensitive plants can result from implementing vegetation
management projects.
Wavy Moonwort– Due to the extent of known populations of wavy moonwort in Montana and
surrounding states, and the low viability of the population along the abandoned logging road in units
32ST and 33C, implementation of alternative 3, hence removal of the known population, in combination
with cumulative impacts may impact individuals or habitat, but will not likely contribute to a trend
towards federal listing or loss of viability to the population or species of wavy moonwort (Botrychium
crenulatum). Though this alternative would cause a loss in population viability, it is believed that the
viability of the population is at risk even under the no-action alternative due to habitat decline.
The known population of wavy moonwort that would be impacted by alternative 3 is not of conservation
concern due to its location within an existing road prism and low habitat viability. The loss of this one
population would not impact the viability of the species as a whole due to the larger distribution of the
species in the State and on the District. Moonworts are known to be ephemeral, having habitats change
with succession. Older populations fade out while new populations appear in new disturbances. It is
possible that the species would return to the site 10-30 years post disturbance.

146

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Peculiar Moonwort and Western Moonwort – Due to the likelihood of peculiar moonwort and western
moonwort occurring within the project area, direct and indirect impacts are possible. Impacts would be
similar to wavy moonwort if present. Therefore, implementation of alternative 3 may impact individuals
or habitat, but will not likely contribute to a trend towards federal listing or loss of viability to the
population or species of peculiar and western moonwort (Botrychium paradoxum and B. hesperium). It is
possible that populations would return 10-30 years post disturbance.
Whitebark Pine– Whitebark pine is known to occur within the project area. Project design features and
mitigation measures (chapter 2) are in place to protect clusters of whitebark pine, as described above;
however some individuals may incidentally be impacted. Implementation of alternative 3, in combination
with cumulative impacts, may impact individuals or habitat, but will not likely contribute to a trend
towards federal listing or loss of viability to the population or species of whitebark pine (Pinus
albicaulis). The incidental loss of some whitebark pine during project implementation would not be
significant to the species as a whole as this species is very common across the Forest and the western
states.
Austin’s Knotweed– Austin’s knotweed was not found within the project area. Suitable habitat was
present on a few shale slopes. Suitable habitat could be improved or increased by the removal of
encroaching conifers. However, the influx of Austin’s knotweed into these treated areas is very
speculative. As such, implementation of alternative 3 would have no impact on Austin’s knotweed
(Polygonum douglasii var. austiniae).
Missoula Phlox– Missoula phlox was not found during project surveys, but suitable habitat was found in
open windswept meadows. Suitable habitat could be improved or increased by the removal of
encroaching conifers. However, the influx of Missoula phlox into these treated areas is very speculative.
Implementation of alternative 3 would have no impact on Missoula phlox (Phlox kelseyi var.
missoulensis).
California False-Hellebore – California false-hellebore was not found during project surveys, but
suitable habitat was found in open meadows. Suitable habitat could be improved or increased by the
removal of encroaching conifers. However, the influx of California false-hellebore into these treated areas
is very speculative. Implementation of alternative 3 would have no impact on California false-hellebore
(Veratrum californicum).

Compliance with Forest Plan and Other Relevant Laws, Regulations, Policies and Plans
Beaverhead-Deerlodge Land and Resource Management Plan (Forest Plan)
Although a Forest Plan goal for sensitive plants is to maintain and restore sensitive plant populations, the
proposed action and alternative 3 call for the re-opening of a road that would remove a population of the
sensitive wavy moonwort. The wavy moonwort population occurs on an existing road prism and its
habitat is increasingly becoming less viable as conifers encroach into the roadway and surrounding area.
The current status of wavy moonwort within the State suggests that it is less rare than previously thought
and will potentially be removed from the sensitive species list in the future due to continued discovery of
more populations. Since 2010, three new populations of wavy moonwort have been found on the BDNF.
Existing populations elsewhere on the Forest are being protected from project activities (Roadside 4
Hazard Tree Removal).
By removing the existing population through road construction, it is likely that the disturbance type that
originally created habitat for wavy moonwort, will create future habitat for wavy moonwort 10 30 years

147

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

down the road (the time period typically required for moonworts to occupy disturbance habitats
(Ahlenslager and Potash 2007). Regardless of whether this happens, the population was not deemed for
conservation due to its occurrence on a road prism and the declining habitat.
Some incidental loss of whitebark pine may occur, even though mitigation measures are in place for
protection of individuals. These minor losses will not reduce the viability of whitebark pine populations
within the project area or as a whole, as whitebark pine is quite common on the forest, with many healthy
populations observed through monitoring. Of all the things ailing whitebark pine, timber harvest was not
cited as one of them (FR76 42631).
An additional goal for sensitive plants is to conserve large core populations or fringe-of-range populations
of sensitive plants in research natural areas and botanical special interest areas, or protect as populations
in conservation strategies, or project design specifications. Neither the whitebark pine nor the moonwort
populations within the project area is considered a large core or fringe-of-range population.
Forest Service Manual 2600 Wildlife, Fish and Sensitive Plant Habitat Management
Forest Service Manual 2600 directs the biological evaluation process as a means to ensure that Forest
Service actions avoid or minimize impacts to sensitive plants. If adverse impacts cannot be avoided, the
significance of the potential impacts must be analyzed and must not result in a loss of species viability, or
create significant trends toward federal listing. The significance of the loss of the wavy moonwort
population was analyzed and determined to be of low significance for the species as a whole and will not
trend the species toward federal listing (see above). Some incidental loss of whitebark pine is of low
significance for the species as a whole and will not trend the species toward federal listing (see above).

Invasive Plants
This section analyzes the impact of proposed project activities on invasive plants and noxious weed
species within the Flint Foothills Project boundary.
According to Forest Service Manual 2900 Invasive Species Management, invasive species are defined as
“…an alien species whose introduction does or is likely to cause economic or environmental harm or
harm to human health.” The term “noxious weed” typically describes species of plants that have been
determined to be undesirable or injurious in some capacity. Federal noxious weeds are regulated by
USDA-Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) under the Plant Protection Act of 2000
(Appendix A of the Invasive Plants Report in the project file).
State statues for noxious weeds vary widely but Montana is a progressive state, defining laws and
regulating noxious weeds. According to the Montana Weed Management Plan (2008), a weed attains a
“noxious” status by Rule as described in the Montana County Weed Control Act (revised October 2011).
It further defines noxious weeds as “…plants of foreign origin that can directly or indirectly injure
agriculture, navigation, fish or wildlife, or public health.” Currently there are 32 weeds on the statewide
noxious weed list. Each noxious weed is placed into a category based on the priority of eradication,
containment, and education (more information is available in Appendix B of the Invasive Plants report in
the project file). Priority 1 weeds are either not present in Montana or have limited presence in Montana.
Management criteria require eradication and education. Priority 2 weeds are common or abundant in
Montana. Management criteria require eradication or containment and management is prioritized by local
weed districts. Priority 3 weeds are not Montana listed noxious weeds but are regulated plants. The State
recommends research, education and prevention to minimize the spread of the regulated plant.

148

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

To simplify terminology, all invasive plants and noxious weeds referenced in this analysis will
collectively be called invasive plant species. This will include all the species listed on the Federal and
Montana Noxious Weed lists as well as cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) and musk thistle (Carduus nutans).

Overview of Issues Addressed
The establishment and spread of invasive species is considered to be one of the top threats to National
Forest System ecosystem health. The threat from invasive plant species to native plant communities,
especially arid rangeland plant communities, has been well documented (Zouhar 2001 and 2003).
Several comments expressed concern over the potential spread of invasive plant species caused by
treatment activities. One concern was road construction and the subsequent use could create ideal
conditions for weed establishment. The commenters encouraged minimizing or eliminating construction
of both temporary and system roads because roads could cause establishment of weeds. To address this
concern, alternative 3 was developed to exclude new road construction. The action alternatives differ by
the miles of NFS road construction, and the miles of temporary road construction. Other examples of
concerns received during scoping were the presence of invasive plant species on roads within burn units,
the chance of invasive plant species expansion within prescribed burn units, the impacts of current
invasive plant species infestations within the project area, invasive plant species overtaking native plant
populations, and long-term commitment to treating invasive plant species. These concerns and more will
be addressed in this section.
It is well documented that disturbed soil is highly susceptible to the establishment of invasive plant
species and that invasive plant infestations can alter the composition and function of native plant
communities (Prieur-Richard & Lavorel 2000). In addition, certain management actions can potentially
increase the density and spread of invasive plant species. Due to these factors, the following measurement
indicators will be used to help identify the risk of invasive plant species spread and establishment within
the project area:

Measurement Indicators
The following indicators are factored into the overall risk of invasive plant species becoming established
and/or spreading in proposed treatment units within the project area (see Methodology).
•

Acres of ground disturbance such as skid trails, log landings and burn piles susceptible to
establishment by invasive plant species

•

Susceptibility of an environment to the establishment of invasive species (invasibility)

•

Miles of road construction

•

Presence or absence of invasive plant species within proposed treatment unit

•

Effectiveness of past and future invasive plant species control efforts

Affected Environment
Existing Condition
An aggressive invasive plant species management program has been in place on the Pintler Ranger
District since the mid-1980s. This program has included a variety of control and management efforts

149

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

including education, as well as mechanical, biological, and chemical treatments. These efforts have been
effective in reducing the total acres of invasive plant species within the Flint Foothills Project area.
In 2000, the Pintler Ranger District inventoried invasive plant species (only the species found on the
Montana Noxious Weed List in 2000) for the BDNF Noxious Weed Control Plan (USFS 2002) and again
in 2011 (all priority categories on the current Montana Noxious Weed List). These inventoried
populations of invasive plant species consist mostly of point, linear, and polygon infestations within the
project area. Point infestations generally consist of widely scattered individual plants. Linear infestations
typically consist of widely scattered populations of invasive plant species along motorized routes.
Polygon infestations consist of measurable areas of less than 0.1 acre in size to several acres.
The 2000 inventory identified 1,675 acres of invasive plant species within the Flint Foothills Project area
(table 55). Invasive plant species found during that inventory included spotted knapweed (Centaurea
maculosa), musk thistle (Carduus nutans) and yellow toadflax (Linaria vulgaris). The 2011 inventory
identified 802 acres of invasive plant species within the project area, predominantly within rangeland
vegetation types, along abandoned roads, old log landings and along existing roadsides. Invasive plant
species identified in the 2011 inventory include musk thistle, spotted knapweed, yellow toadflax, Canada
thistle (Cirsium arvense), houndstongue (Cynoglossum officinale), oxeye daisy (Chrysanthemum
leucanthemum), common tansy (Tanacetum vulgare) and cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum).
Spotted knapweed is the predominant invasive plant species present within the project area. It is mainly
located in mountain grassland plant communities, along roads, and in the drier open-canopy forest plant
communities. Musk thistle is found in low densities within mountain grassland communities. Many of
these individuals were found where excessive rodent activity had disturbed the soil allowing musk thistle
to establish. The increase in musk thistle is due to the difference in mapping technique. For the 2011
inventory, sporadic locations of musk thistle were lumped to make polygons rather than individual points.
For example, a 15-acre mountain-grassland park may contain one musk thistle plant per acre (on a gopher
mound) and be mapped as a 15-acre polygon rather than 15 individual points. This displays as an increase
in acres infested with musk thistle, but it is important to note that musk thistle is not invading native plant
communities, rather being opportunistic with disturbed microsites. Musk thistle and Canada thistle were
also found in isolated patches where past burn piles existed. All other invasive plant species were found in
small patches or as individuals and mostly tied to motorized, wheeled, vehicle routes. Figure 28 that
follows displays current locations for the invasive plant species in this analysis.

2013 Montana Noxious Weed List has yellow toadflax listed as a Priority 2B, while musk thistle and cheatgrass are not considered
noxious. However, cheatgrass is considered a regulated plant and categorized as Priority 3. Refer to the “Introduction” section for
definitions of the priorities.

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

The 2011 inventory found little to no invasive plant species expansion within historic lodgepole pine and
Douglas fir harvest units. The majority of invasive plant species found within those units were in burn
piles and open and closed haul routes.
These inventories indicate that the Pintler Ranger District Invasive plant species Control Program has
reduced invasive plant species infested acres by 48 percent over the last 10 years. Existing infestations
within the project area are currently being treated with herbicides on an annual basis by Forest Service
invasive plant species control crews, or by contract, and will continue to be treated into the foreseeable
future. The current invasive plant species control program is operating under the 2002 BDNF Noxious
Weed Control Environmental Impact Statement and Record of Decision (USFS 2002). The invasive plant
species control program on the Pintler Ranger District has been funded through National Forest
Appropriation funding, Resource Advisory Committee (RAC) grants, Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation,
Sikes Act grants and Knutson-Vandenberg (KV) funds. KV funds are funds that the Forest Service is
allowed to collect from harvest activities for resource enhancement, protection, and improvement work in
the vicinity of the harvest area.
Several biological control agents have been introduced into invasive plant species infestations within the
project area. Urophora affins is a fly that attacks the flower head of spotted knapweed. Cyphocleonus
achates is a weevil that attacks the roots of spotted knapweed. In addition, Larinus minutus is a seed head
eating weevil that is established in this area. Although none of these insects were observed during the
2011 inventory, they are believed to exist within the project area. In 2010, the United States Forest
Service Rocky Mountain Research Station released Mecinus janthinus, a stem mining weevil to control
yellow toadflax. The Research Station will study the effects of this agent on yellow toadflax in this area
and local climate.

Desired Condition
The 2009 BDNF Land and Resource Management Plan (Forest Plan) identified the following applicable
Forestwide goals for invasive plant species:
Invasive Plants/Noxious Weeds
• The influx of persistent nonnative species is minimized by using native plants, seed, and
vegetative propagules for Vegetation Management work (Forest Plan, p. 43)
•

Diagnosed pest problems are addressed with an integrated pest management approach, which
allows monitoring, prevention, cultural, mechanical, biological, genetic and chemical
techniques (Forest Plan, p. 43)

•

Prevent, reduce, or eliminate infestations of nonnative or noxious weed species with emphasis
on areas where there is a high likelihood of establishment and spread. Manage noxious weeds
using integrated pest management techniques as described in the most current BeaverheadDeerlodge Noxious Weed Control Record of Decision (Forest Plan p. 44).

Invasive plant species inventories completed in 2000 and 2011 within the project area indicate that
infestations are still present but total acres infested has been reduced by 48 percent under the current weed
control program. Suppressing invasive plant species is vital in order to protect biodiversity and enhance
native vegetation. Therefore, invasive plant species monitoring and treatment needs to continue to
effectively control the establishment and spread of invasive plant species as well as decrease the number
of infested acres within the project area.

Environmental Consequences
Methodology
Discussions of environmental direct and indirect effects will focus on the “risk” of invasive plant species
becoming established and/or spreading in proposed treatment units within the project area. In the context
of this analysis, risk is defined as the probability, or potential (i.e., low, moderate, high), that (1) invasive
plant species seed would be transported and then deposited into areas that are currently not infested by
weeds, and (2) proposed treatment activities would increase the density and spread of invasive plant
species within the project area.
Understanding the interactions among invasive plant species, native plant communities and the proposed
treatments of this project requires an understanding of invasibility. Invasibilty is the susceptibility of a
plant community to invasion (Smith and others 2008). This is determined by many factors including the
existing vegetation, available nutrients, availability of seed from invasive plants, and amount of past
human activity in the area. Generally, within this project area, the areas in the lower elevations have
increased likelihood of invasion than the higher elevation areas. This is mainly due to the associated
human activities in the area such as roads, livestock grazing, recreation as well as the readily available
seed source from existing invasive plant species.
During the summer of 2011, the project area was surveyed and invasive plant species mapped using onthe-ground field observations (more information is available in Appendix A of the Invasive Plants report
in the project file). The surveys were completed by District Range Technicians whose primary job is weed
treatment as well as the District’s Rangeland Management Specialist who manages the invasive plant
species program. If invasive plant species were detected, a location was recorded with a GPS unit and
data was collected regarding the species, gross area, percent infested, percent canopy cover, and any

153

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

associated invasive plant species present. Risk level includes the proximity of the infestations to the
proposed treatment units, haul routes, unauthorized routes, and the invasibility of the land.
Incomplete and Unavailable Information
Although a thorough survey was completed within the project area for invasive plant species, it is
possible that not all weed infestations were detected. Small infestations with very few plants can be
extremely hard to detect and map.
Spatial and Temporal Context for Effects Analysis
To effectively describe the environmental effects of project actions on invasive plant species, the
environmental consequences, including cumulative effects discussions, will focus on National Forest
System (NFS) lands within the boundaries of the project area. Specific emphasis will be placed on
activity areas where vegetation treatment and road construction are proposed.
This analysis will discuss both short-term (1 year or less), and long-term (greater than 1 year) project
effects to invasive plants within the project area. The analysis will focus on potential establishment and
spread within proposed treatment units and connected actions associated with treatment activities such as
temporary road construction.
Invasive plant species can have persistent, long-lasting effects on native plant communities. The duration
of these effects is highly dependent upon the severity of the infestation and the difficulty in controlling
certain invasive plants. For the Flint Foothills Project, the temporal boundary for project effects would be
approximately 10 years. This boundary takes into account the approximate life of the project, including
potential activities such as invasive plant species control within treatment units.
Past, Present, and Reasonably Foreseeable Activities Relevant to Cumulative Effects Analysis
Appendix D discloses the present and reasonably foreseeable actions within the project area that are
relevant to this FEIS analysis. Past and present activities such as motorized vehicle access, invasive plant
species control and livestock grazing have influenced the spread and establishment of invasive species
within and adjacent to the project area. All three have played a role to introduce new species and expand
the distribution of existing species. In addition, all three are expected to continue into the future, and will
be analyzed in cumulative effects.

Alternative 1– No Action
Direct, Indirect and Cumulative Effects
Under alternative 1, there would be no direct, indirect or cumulative effects to invasive plants from the
Flint Foothills Project because no project activities are proposed. However, previously approved and
ongoing activities such as livestock grazing, motor vehicle travel, and firewood cutting would continue.
These activities would continue to provide potential vectors for weed spread and establishment. Even in
the absence of these ongoing activities there would be potential for weeds to invade. Invasive plant
species such as spotted knapweed and cheatgrass can establish shortly after disturbance or invasion can be
accelerated by disturbance. In addition, they can also invade relatively undisturbed perennial native plant
communities where there is natural ground disturbance from rodents or predators digging in the soil and
weed seeds can be dispersed over long distances by animals and birds (Zouhar 2001 and 2003).

154

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Livestock Grazing
Livestock and native ungulates can act as dispersal agents for weed seed movement. Livestock grazing
activities can also result in ground disturbance that is susceptible to invasion by weeds (Frost &
Launchbaugh 2003). There is low potential for livestock grazing activities to result in measureable spread
of invasive plant species into uninfested lands within the project area because of existing levels of
invasive plant infestations, ongoing treatment efforts, and the effectiveness of past invasive plant species
control efforts.
Invasive Plant Species Control
In accordance with the BDNF Noxious Weed Control EIS (2002), treatments of existing invasive plant
species infestations would continue to occur annually. The Pintler Ranger District has an active and
proven effective weed control program which would continue to benefit native plant communities within
the project area by containing and reducing the coverage and density of existing and future invasive plant
species infestations.
Public Actions on National Forest System Lands (Motor Vehicle Travel)
Current and future motor vehicle travel on open roads would result in a continued, long-term threat of
invasive plant species being introduced and spread within the project area. Motorized vehicles have a
potential for spreading invasive plants because they carry seeds and propagules in tires and underneath
the vehicle. Roads are a primary source for seed dispersal because they offer disturbed ground. Although
the Forest Service (FS) requires certain weed prevention practices be followed by its employees and
contractors, it does not require the general public to adhere to weed prevention practices. However, the
Forest Service does expend money and time educating the public on the importance of not spreading
invasive plant species and proper weed prevention practices. There is low potential for continued use of
open, motorized roads by the public to result in measureable weed spread into uninfested lands within the
project area because of existing levels of invasive plant species infestation, ongoing treatment efforts, and
the effectiveness of past invasive plant species control efforts,
Summary of Effects
Implementation of the no-action alternative would not result in any additional risk of invasive plant
establishment and spread over what is currently occurring within the project area. Based on existing levels
of invasive plant species infestation, ongoing treatment efforts, and the effectiveness of past invasive
species control efforts, the cumulative potential of ongoing and reasonably foreseeable future activities is
expected to result in a low risk of weeds being spread. Treatment of existing invasive plant species
infestations would continue to occur annually in accordance with the BDNF Noxious Weed Control EIS
(2002).

Alternative 2– Proposed Action
Direct and Indirect Effects
Table 56 displays the proposed treatment units where invasive plant species were found during the 2011
invasive plant species inventory.
In addition to the units in table 56, a small component or a few individuals of invasive plant species were
found along the majority of existing NFS roads that would be used as haul routes. It was also observed
during the 2011 inventory of units within the project area, that invasive plant species were along
abandoned temporary routes and burn piles but were not expanding out into the moister open-canopy
forest and closed-canopy forest units. The most common weeds found along the temporary routes and

155

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

burn piles were Canada thistle and musk thistle. Spotted knapweed was located in random areas, mainly
in dry mountain-grassland and southern aspect open-canopy forest sites.

The 2011 inventory determined that invasive plant species and seed could be dispersed within the project
area by the activities in this proposal. Specifically, areas of concern for the greatest risk of establishment
by invasive plant species are the newly constructed temporary roads (7.2 miles), the newly constructed
NFS road (1.3 miles), skid trails, log landings, and high-severity burned areas such as burn piles. It is also
expected that invasive plant species would increase along haul routes due to the increased traffic on the
roads associated with the proposed treatments.
Based on the 2011 inventory and referenced literature, there is high risk for spotted knapweed, musk
thistle and Canada thistle to become established in the areas of concern. This is due to increased vehicular
travel and increased potential for soil disturbing activities from logging operations. This may occur during
the treatment itself or indirectly by wind, wildlife, cattle, and humans following treatments. The
remaining invasive plant species have a low potential to establish in the areas of concern because these
species are infrequent and in low densities. In addition, there is low potential for all invasive plant species
to become established outside of disturbed areas of concern within treatment areas.
This alternative also proposes approximately 1,990 acres of prescribed burn treatments as well as postharvest underburning in the commercial thin units and seed tree with reserves units. Prescribed burning as
well as post-harvest underburning typically occurs in the spring or fall. Burning during these seasons
usually produces a low-severity burn. Low severity refers to fires that cause little alteration to the soil,
and little mortality to underground plant parts or seed banks (Smith et al. 2008). Most literature supports
the notion that invasive plant species have a lower potential of establishment and expansion following
low-severity fires (Ferguson & Craig 2010). In addition, the risks of invasion increases if the pre-fire
vegetation already has a significant component of invasive plant species present (Goodwin et al. 2002).
The mid-elevation and north facing prescribed burn units have a low invasibility rating due to the existing
closed-canopy vegetation, higher elevation, shorter growing season, cooler temperatures, less humancaused disturbances and ultimately fewer existing weed infestations. However, the low elevation and
south facing burn units have a higher invasibility rating because of a more open canopy, longer growing
season, higher percentage of existing invasive plant species cover and more human-caused disturbances.
The two main species of concern associated with prescribed fire is spotted knapweed and Canada thistle.
All the other inventoried invasive plant species are of little concern because they have a very low
potential of invasion or make up a small percentage of infested acres.
Research has found that spotted knapweed is not a serious threat in lodgepole/subalpine fir forest
following fire (Ferguson & Craig 2010), and its abundance was not changed by early spring prescribed
burning in Montana (Smith et al. 2008). The 2011 inventory showed little spotted knapweed expansion
into past prescribed fire units. Therefore, spotted knapweed has a low risk to establish or expand within
the burning units except for Units 2B and 7B. They are lower-elevation units and have existing
infestations of spotted knapweed in or adjacent to them. Due to this fact, spotted knapweed has a
moderate risk of expanding in the western portion of unit 7B and all of unit 2B.
156

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Invasive plant species with small, wind-dispersed seed such as Canada thistle and musk thistle tend to
increase 2 to 4 years after fire, after which their numbers decline (Smith et al. 2008). After a fire in Grand
Teton National Park, Canada thistle cover increased to 5 percent but by 17 years post fire, had decreased
to less than 1 percent. Canada thistle would have the opportunity to become established in all of the burn
units but evidence from the 2011 inventory and referenced research demonstrated that it would not persist
within a unit. However, it may persist within high-severity burns such as burn piles. Therefore, Canada
thistle has a moderate potential to expand into burn units but should decrease with time and only persist in
areas of high burn severity such as burn piles.
Therefore, based on project design features, mitigation measures, and the presence of mostly small, lowdensity invasive plant species infestations in 27 of the 93 proposed units, as well as effectiveness of
ongoing and past control efforts, this alternative is estimated to have an overall low risk of increasing the
density and spread of invasive plant species into uninfested lands, and a moderate risk of invasive plant
species spreading and establishing in the areas of concern (highly disturbed). This moderate risk rating
would also apply to haul routes used for project activities. The rationale for the low risk rating is:
1. Existing weed infestations within the proposed treatment units are small.
2. Monitoring and treatment of infestations within treatment units, burn piles, haul routes and temporary
roads would occur as necessary focusing on the areas of concern.
3. The invasive plant species control program has been successful in reducing invasive plant species
infestations despite past uses such as livestock grazing, recreation and timber harvest activities.
Present and past invasive plant species treatments have been effective in reducing acres of invasive
plant species infestations by 48 percent within the project area
4. Commitment to post-activity monitoring and treatment of invasive plant species infestations found
within proposed units would result in a high success potential for controlling these weed occurrences
within three to five years post treatment
5. Greater attention and funding to control invasive plant species in the project area would result from
this alternative.
In the long term, the persistent treatment of invasive plant species infestations would continue to reduce
the size and density of existing infestations.
Cumulative Effects
Livestock Grazing
Livestock and native ungulates can act as dispersal agents for seed movement. Livestock grazing
activities can also result in ground disturbance that is susceptible to invasion by weeds (Frost &
Launchbaugh 2003). There is low potential for livestock grazing activities to result in measureable weed
spread into uninfested lands within the project area because of existing levels of invasive plant species
infestation, ongoing treatment efforts, and the effectiveness of past invasive plant species control efforts.
Weed Control
In accordance with the BDNF Noxious Weed Control EIS, treatments of existing invasive plant species
infestations would continue to occur annually. The Pintler Ranger District has an active and effective
weed control program that would continue to benefit native plant communities within the project area by
containing and reducing the coverage and density of existing and future invasive plant species
infestations.

157

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Public Actions on Forest Service Lands (Motor Vehicle Travel)
Current and future public actions such as motor vehicle travel on open roads, forest product gathering,
hunting, and recreation would result in continued, long-term threat of invasive plant species being
introduced and/or spread within the project area. Motorized vehicles have a potential for spreading
invasive plants because they carry seeds and propagules in tires and underneath the vehicle. Roads are a
primary source for seed dispersal because they offer disturbed ground. Although the Forest Service (FS)
requires certain weed prevention practices be followed by its employees and contractors, it does not
require the general public to adhere to weed prevention practices. However, the FS does expend money
and time educating the public on the importance of not spreading invasive plant species and proper weed
prevention practices. There is low potential for continued use of open, motor vehicle routes by the public
to result in measureable weed spread into uninfested lands within the project area because of existing
levels of invasive plant species infestation, ongoing treatment efforts, and the effectiveness of past
invasive plant species control efforts.
The cumulative potential of ongoing and reasonably foreseeable future activities as well as the
implementation of the proposed action is expected to result in low risk of invasive plant species being
spread and established within the treatment units, but moderate risk of invasive plant species being spread
and established on the areas of concerns. Treatment of existing invasive plant species infestations as well
as new infestations would continue to occur in accordance with the BDNF Noxious Weed Control EIS
(2002). A high success rate is expected because past weed control efforts have been successful in limiting
the rate of spread, infested acres, and reducing plant density within the project area. Present and past
control efforts have reduced infested acres of invasive plant species by 48 percent within the project area.
In addition, the identified project design features and mitigation measures (chapter 2) would lower the
risk of invasive plant species spread and establishment
Summary of Effects
Implementation of the proposed action, as well as continued livestock grazing and public actions such as
motorized vehicle travel would likely increase the number of small infestations of spotted knapweed,
Canada thistle and musk thistle in isolated areas of concern (highly disturbed). No invasive plant species
are likely to expand into the treatment units where there is little ground disturbance; however, where there
is disturbance, there will be a higher probability of the three species becoming established.
The cumulative potential of ongoing and reasonably foreseeable future activities as well as the
implementation of the proposed action is expected to result in low risk of invasive plant species being
spread and established within the treatment units but moderate risk of being spread and established on the
areas of concerns.
Monitoring Recommendations
Post-activity monitoring and treatment should occur as long as necessary to ensure that existing
infestations do not expand and new infestations are controlled. It is recommended that the units, haul
routes, temporary roads, and burn piles be identified as high priority monitoring and treatment areas.

Alternative 3
Direct and Indirect Effects
The direct effects are similar for alternative 3 as described in the alternative 2 discussion previously, with
one main exception. Alternative 3 was developed without the road component that is in alternative 2 (7.2
miles of newly constructed temporary road and 1.3 miles of newly constructed NFS road). Therefore, the
areas of concern for this alternative would be limited to skid trails, log landings, and high-severity burned

158

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

areas such as burn piles. This alternative would decrease the overall opportunity for invasive plant species
to spread or become established, thereby reducing the number of expected new small infestations.
However, this alternative is expected to increase the number of small infestations of invasive plant species
within the project area compared to the no-action alternative.
Several units have been dropped in this alternative. However, none of the dropped units contained
invasive plant species that were found with the 2011 inventory.
Therefore, based on project design features, mitigation measures, and the presence of mostly small, lowdensity invasive plant species infestations in 27 of the 83 proposed units, as well as effectiveness of
ongoing and past control efforts, this alternative is estimated to have an overall low risk of increasing the
density and spread of invasive plant species into uninfested lands, and moderate risk of invasive plant
species spreading and establishing in the areas of concern (highly disturbed). This moderate risk rating
would also apply to haul routes used for project activities. The rationale for this low risk rating is:
1. Existing weed infestations within the proposed treatment units are small.
2. Monitoring and treatment of infestations within treatment units, burn piles, and haul routes would
occur as necessary, focusing on the areas of concern.
3. The invasive plant species control program has been successful in reducing invasive plant species
infestations despite past uses such as livestock grazing, recreation and timber harvest activities.
Present and past treatments have been effective in reducing acres of invasive plant species
infestations by 48 percent within the project area.
4. Commitment to post-activity monitoring and treatment of invasive plant species infestations found
within proposed units would result in high success potential for controlling these weed occurrences
within 3 to 5 years post treatment.
5. Greater attention and funding to control invasive plant species in the project area would result from
this alternative
In the long term, the continued treatment of invasive plant species infestations would continue to reduce
the size and density of existing infestations.
Cumulative Effects
Livestock Grazing
Livestock and native ungulates can act as dispersal agents for seed movement. Livestock grazing
activities can also result in ground disturbance that is susceptible to invasion by weeds (Frost &
Launchbaugh 2003). There is low potential for livestock grazing activities to result in measureable weed
spread into uninfested lands from the project area because of existing levels of weed infestation, ongoing
treatment efforts, and the effectiveness of past weed control efforts.
Weed Control
In accordance with the BDNF Noxious Weed Control EIS (2002), treatments of existing invasive plant
species infestations would continue to occur annually. The Pintler Ranger District has an active and
proven effective weed control program which would continue to benefit native plant communities within
the project area by containing and reducing the coverage and density of existing and future invasive plant
species infestations.

159

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Public Actions on National Forest System Lands (Motorized Vehicle Travel)
Current and future motorized vehicle travel on open roads would result in a continued, long-term threat of
invasive plant species being introduced or spread within the project area. Motorized vehicles have
potential for spreading invasive plants because they carry seeds and propagules in tires and underneath
the vehicle. Roads are a primary source for seed dispersal because they offer disturbed ground. Although
the Forest Service requires certain weed prevention practices be followed by its employees and
contractors, it does not require the general public to adhere to weed prevention practices. However, the FS
does expend money and time educating the public on the importance of not spreading invasive plant
species and proper weed prevention practices. There is low potential for continued use of open, motorized
roads by the public to result in measureable invasive plant species spread into uninfested lands within the
project area because of existing levels of invasive plant species infestation, ongoing treatment efforts, and
the effectiveness of past invasive plant species control efforts.
The cumulative potential of ongoing and reasonably foreseeable future activities as well as the
implementation of alternative 3 is expected to result in low risk of invasive plant species being spread and
established within the treatment units, but moderate risk of being spread and established on the areas of
concerns. Treatment of existing invasive plant species infestations would continue to occur in accordance
with the BDNF Noxious Weed Control EIS (2002). A high success rate is expected because past weed
control efforts have been successful in limiting the rate of spread, infested acres, and reducing plant
density within the project area. Present and past control efforts have reduced infested acres of invasive
plant species by 48 percent within the project area. In addition, the identified project design features and
mitigation measures (chapter 2) would decrease the potential of invasive plant species spread and
establishment
Summary of Effects
Implementation of the alternative 3, as well as continued livestock grazing and public actions such as
motorized vehicle travel would likely increase the number of small infestations of spotted knapweed,
Canada thistle and musk thistle in isolated areas of concern (highly disturbed). No invasive plant species
are likely to expand into the treatment units where there is little ground disturbance; however, where there
is disturbance, there will be a higher probability of the three species becoming established.
This alternative reduces the potential for invasive plant species to spread and become established
compared to the proposed action because it does not include newly constructed road. However, all the
other proposed activities are similar to the proposed action. Therefore, a similar outcome is expected, but
with fewer small infestations in isolated areas.
The cumulative potential of ongoing and reasonably foreseeable future activities as well as the
implementation of alternative 3 is expected to result in low risk of invasive plant species being spread and
established within the treatment units but moderate risk of being spread and established on the areas of
concerns.

Compliance with Forest Plan and Other Relevant Laws, Regulations, Policies and Plans
Beaverhead-Deerlodge Land and Resource Management Plan (Forest Plan)
Both action alternatives comply with the Forestwide goals stated in the Forest Plan in regards to invasive
plant species. The Forest Plan provides direction for management of invasive plant species in regards to
prevention, reduction, or elimination of infestations of nonnative or noxious weed species with emphasis
on areas where there is high likelihood for establishment and spread. The plan also directs that weeds are
managed through an integrated pest management approach as described in the most current BeaverheadDeerlodge Noxious Weed Control Record of Decision. Under the proposed action alternative, an

160

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

integrated pest management approach would continue to be used to control invasive plant species within
the project area.
Forest Service Manual 2900 - Invasive Plant Species Management
Forest Service manual 2900 gives direction which sets forth National Forest System policy,
responsibilities, and direction for the prevention, detection, control, and restoration of effects from aquatic
and terrestrial invasive plant species (including vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, and pathogens). Under
the proposed action alternative, an integrated pest management approach would continue to be used to
manage invasive plant species on the Pintler Ranger District.

Wildlife
This section provides an evaluation of the environmental baseline, direct, indirect and cumulative effects
to terrestrial wildlife from implementation of the proposed project’s range of alternatives. It also serves as
the Biological Evaluation for Forest Service (FS) Sensitive Species and serves to assess potential impacts
to any wildlife that are federally listed as threatened, endangered, candidate or experimental/nonessential. In addition, management indicator species (MIS) designated in the Forest Plan (FP) are
considered. Lastly, several other species of interest and unique habitats are evaluated.

Overview of Issues Addressed
Through the public scoping process, Montana Fish, Wildlife, and Parks (MFWP) identified the need to
contain wildlife attractants at project implementation sites. Other issues identified in scoping include
threatened, endangered and sensitive species (hereafter TES); northern goshawk and big game and their
habitats; snag and coarse wood retention, old-growth habitat and road impacts to wildlife.

Methodology & Assumptions
Data Sources
ArcGIS (ESRI software) was used to create various habitat suitability models based on preferences of
individual species. Original models and metadata can be found in the project file. Vegetation information
was derived from the following sources: Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) plots, FSveg, and Image
Server photo interpretation. Species biological and habitat information sources include occurrence records
from inventory and monitoring efforts, hunting and trapping records, informal observations, and the
scientific literature. Results from northern goshawk, flammulated owl, great gray owl, and woodpecker
surveys are in Appendix F.
The Ecosystem Research Group (ERG, 2010) analyzed vegetation changes due to mountain pine beetle
across the BDNF and the effect this would have on habitat under treatment and no-treatment scenarios for
selected wildlife species over the next fifty years. This information is incorporated into the analysis where
appropriate.
Both action alternatives propose similar treatments with variation in the amount of commercial thinning
and salvage and associated transportation. The exception in similarity is not building any new temporary
roads resulting in less old growth enhancement treatments under Alternative 3. Due to the similarities,
alternatives 2 and 3 are analyzed concurrently to compare and contrast effects to species. Any notable
distinctions between the effects of the alternatives are identified.

161

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Spatial and Temporal Context
The Flint Foothills project area totals 44,500 acres and is located within the northern portion of the Flint
Creek Range on the Pintler Ranger District. Land ownership within the project area boundary is
predominantly National Forest (>80%). The area is bounded to the north, east, and west by open valleys
and to the south by higher elevations within the Flint Creek Range. Elevations range from approximately
4,430-9,250 feet. The analysis area used for direct, indirect, and cumulative effects is limited to the
project area for most species, which encompasses the affected areas of the proposed treatments, and is
large enough in scale to include one or more home ranges of most of these species. Species with larger
home ranges such as grizzly bears, wolves and wolverines were analyzed at a larger scale. The spatial
bounds for these species is 353,900 acres (Analysis Area Map, Appendix F). Hunting units are used
where Open Motorized Roads and Trail Densities (OMRTDs) are the basis for effects analysis, consistent
with FP direction. Analysis for lynx is based on Lynx Analysis Units (LAUs).
Generally, short-term effects are associated with disturbance from activities, and immediate changes to
habitat after treatment. Long-term effects will consider changes to potential habitat over time, dependent
on specific species habitat needs. Timeframes for project activities vary by type of activity. The
commercial harvest units (salvage of lodgepole pine and thinning of Douglas-fir) are expected to take 5
years while precommercial thinning, prescribed burning, and other post-treatment activities may take up
to 10 years.
There are several vegetation types and activities proposed in this project. Because each species has
specific habitat requirements, not all activities have the potential to affect each species. For example,
flammulated owls may benefit from thinning in Douglas-fir but be unaffected by salvage of lodgepole
pine. Relevant activities will be considered for each species, as appropriate.
Measurement Indicators
The indicators used to evaluate impacts of alternatives vary by wildlife species and consist, at least in
part, of: Acres of habitat affected, including secure areas; Open motorized road and trail densities
(OMRTDs); Density of habitat resources such as snags and downed logs. Measures for changes in habitat
will be acres of treatments compared to the amount of suitable habitat available.
Connected Actions, Past, Present, and Foreseeable Activities Relevant to Cumulative Effects
Analysis
The effects of past management and environmental conditions are considered until those effects are no
longer measurable or discernible. Past management practices such as timber harvest and grazing are
reflected in existing vegetative conditions as discussed in further detail in the vegetation section of this
EIS. Though all past, present or reasonably foreseeable actions within the analysis area were considered,
only specific effects of those actions that have spatial or temporal overlap with the direct or indirect
impacts resulting from project alternatives are discussed in detail where appropriate. Other projects that
have the potential to have cumulative effects are categorized and evaluated in conjunction with other
similar actions rather than a project-by-project basis. Appendix D displays past, ongoing and foreseeable
future activities considered in this analysis.

Regulatory Framework
Forest Plan (FP) standards for wildlife, project level compliance, and monitoring requirements are
provided in Appendix F. The FP identifies twelve distinct landscapes within its management jurisdiction.
The landscapes are further subdivided into Management Areas (MA), each with unique objectives and
some with additional standards, in addition to forest wide objectives and standards. The Flint Foothills
MA is managed for timber production, livestock grazing and dispersed recreation. There are no additional
standards associated with this MA.
162

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

An objective in the FP encourages consideration of the following sources when designing projects that
may affect TES: Management Plan and Conservation Strategies for Sage-Grouse in Montana; Northern
Region Conservation Assessment for Northern Goshawk, Black-backed woodpecker, Flammulated owl,
and Pileated woodpecker; Montana Comprehensive Wildlife Conservation Strategy; Grizzly Bear
Conservation for the Greater Yellowstone Area (GYA) National Forests; Northern Rocky Mountain Gray
Wolf Recovery Plan; and the Montana Bald Eagle Management Plan. These plans and strategies are
considered throughout the TES analysis where appropriate.

Affected Environment
Existing Condition of Wildlife Habitats
Several vegetation types occur in the Flint Creek Mountains ranging from subalpine and whitebark pine
habitats to grasslands at lower elevations. Several habitat attributes, including wildlife secure areas, snag
retention, and old growth availability define suitability for a number of species and are evaluated below.
The habitats below are vegetation types that are unique on the landscape. See the Vegetation section for
detailed information for these and the more common forest types and for a thorough description of the
existing and desired vegetation condition, including acreage and size classes of each cover type.
Old Growth Ponderosa Pine and Douglas-fir
Old growth forests are distinguished by old trees and structural characteristics developed over time
(Green, Hann, Zack, & Naumann, 1992, errata corrected 2007). It is estimated that about 20% of the
Clark Fork-Flints landscape is old growth (Bush, Lundberg, & Berglund, 2006). Frequent, low intensity
fires historically sustained open, large tree dominated stands with diverse and productive understories;
however, in the project area Douglas-fir stands are continuous, mid-successional, densely stocked with
reduced vegetation heterogeneity and associated biodiversity, putting unique habitats (most importantly
old growth, aspen, and ponderosa pine) at risk of irreversible habitat conversion. Highly dense stands of
Douglas-fir have been affected by western spruce budworm and an increase of individual trees killed by
Douglas-fir bark beetle along with mortality of very large ponderosa pine has been documented through
stand exams. Along with dry grassland parks, Douglas-fir with very little ponderosa pine dominates the
low to middle elevations of the project area
Quaking aspen
The amount and quality of aspen has been declining for many years in portions of the interior West
(Bartos, 2001) including the BDNF and is considered a community at risk. The FP includes an objective
to increase the aspen component on over 67,000 acres. Aspen distribution within the project area consists
of small, scattered patches, with concentrations occurring in the eastern-most portion of the project area.
Whitebark pine
Blister rust has accelerated succession to subalpine fir by killing mature WBP. This coupled with a lack of
fire as a recycling agent has caused a major shift in the landscape composition and structure from one of
pine to fir and spruce (Keane, 2000). Warming temperatures are thought to further increase rate of
mortality due to favorable conditions for blister rust and Mountain Pine Beetle (MPB).
WBP is located in higher elevations around Emery Ridge and Rose Mountain in the southern portion of
the project area. MBPs have killed many of the mature WBP leaving predominantly 5-15 inches dbh trees.
However, there is evidence of WBP regeneration in more pure stands and mature trees persist in the face
of both the bark beetle and blister rust. This species is a minor component within the project area.

163

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Insects and Snags
Mountain pine beetle populations have increased substantially due to above average winter and spring
temperatures. Within the Flint Foothills project area, virtually all of the lodgepole pine stands 5 inches in
diameter and larger have been affected by mountain pine beetle and literally millions of smaller snags are
being created annually by the outbreak; though, not all areas are being targeted for treatment. This has
resulted in a shift from a project area dominated by mature structure to one with high percent of stand
initiation structure and standing dead trees. Mortality in Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine stands due to
Western spruce budworm and Douglas-fir beetle is also occurring as a result of recent drought coupled
with interspecific competition. Stand exams conducted within proposed commercial harvest units indicate
that availability of snags 15 inches dbh varies greatly among stands, with densities less than required in
the FP. For this reason, additional live trees greater than 15” will be retained for snag recruitment equaling
8.5 trees per acre greater than 15” according to FP standard 3. See Vegetation Design Features.

Desired Condition of Wildlife Habitats
The desired condition for ponderosa pine and Douglas- fir is large trees and open-grown stands that are
resilient to inherent disturbance regimes (insects and fire). Many of these stands would have old growth
characteristics with more than 20% of the stand being comprised of ponderosa pine. Thinning would
improve growing conditions for the remaining trees, decrease susceptibility to western spruce budworm
and Douglas-fir beetle, thereby increasing stand resiliency and promoting opportunity for quicker
development of old growth stands. Aspen are of ecological importance to many species of wildlife such as
elk, deer, moose, beaver, migratory birds and bats; and is second only to riparian areas in terms of
biodiversity. In coniferous forests, they provide cooler microsites, cover, forage and nesting structure and
are a source of snags for cavity nesters. In addition, removal of conifer competition to upland aspen
clones improves growing conditions; thus resiliency of aspen.
The seed tree harvest would create an early seral component of ponderosa pine leaving large diameter
ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir as seed trees. The treatment would remove much of the understory and
light under burning would remove the remaining ladder fuels not removed with harvest. Not all of these
stands are a pure ponderosa pine-Douglas-fir type; some stands contain a component of bark beetle
infected lodgepole pine that would be salvaged. The final action in these units would be planting
ponderosa pine seedlings. The desired condition is to increase the ponderosa pine component over the
long-term and lower the susceptibility to bark beetles through reducing stand density.
Processes by which mountain pine beetle can affect wildlife habitat include: 1) beetles as a food source;
2) defoliation of tree canopy; 3) loss of bark; 4) cessation of cone production; 5) proliferation of standing
dead trees; 6) fall down of dead trees; and 7) increased production of understory vegetation (ChanMcLeod 2006). Factors affecting the nature of effects include 1) time since death, 2) residual green
component, 3) ecosystem types, and 4) landscape effects.
The desired condition for lodgepole pine is to perpetuate a more open and relatively evenly spaced stand
to improve individual tree growth and vigor; reduce crown fire potential; promote younger age class of
wind-firm, bark beetle-resistant trees; and increase the quantity of longer-lived species such as Douglasfir and aspen. The desired composition mix is mostly lodgepole pine, Douglas-fir and aspen, with an
occasional Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir. Understory vegetation would be similar to what currently
exists on site. In addition to increasing the resiliency of these stands, the FP objective for the lodgepole
pine type is to increase the number of acres in the 0-5 inch dbh class where insect-infested stands are dead
or dying.
The desired condition for mid-elevation mixed-conifer stands is to maintain a patch mosaic of forested
size classes. Heterogeneous vegetation structure provides the basis for maintaining or restoring forested
ecological communities of sufficient diversity to provide for the viability of the majority of forest species

164

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

that occur the BDNF. Whitebark pine (WBP) is a foundation species for high-elevation ecosystems
providing snow capture and retention, carbon storage, increased biodiversity and serving as critical food
source for many wildlife species including birds, small mammals, and bears. Their seeds have several
features that make them a valuable food, they are large and therefore more energetically rewarding, the
nutrients are less perishable compared to other sources, and they are a rich source of dietary fat (WPEF,
2010). Although this proposal targets mid-elevation stands rather than high-elevation stands, there would
be opportunities for whitebark pine establishment (which is highly desired) through Clark’s nutcracker
seed caching. Prior to burning, up to 10 percent of each unit would have small-diameter (4 to 12 inches
dbh) conifers slashed (cut down). Slash created as a result of these activities would be strategically
located to facilitate a mosaic of mixed severity burned areas with the objective of 50 percent mortality in
the overstory trees. Fires would ensure a richer mosaic of stands in different successional stages,
contributing to the long-term viability of the early seral whitebark pine (Murray et al. 2000) and
lodgepole pine.

Environmental Consequences
Effects to species will be analyzed by looking at changes in habitats (stand age, structure, species
composition etc.), as well as considering disturbance to individuals associated with the activities
including smoke and haul routes. Actions with potential for direct effects on habitat include salvage,
commercial thinning in Douglas-fir, seed tree harvest, prescribed burning within and outside timber
harvest units, and precommercial thinning. Indirect effects after project implementation include changes
in vegetation structure over time.

Connectivity, Corridors, & Linkage
Survival costs and movement rates of individuals vary among species with divergent life histories; thus,
components of effective linkage, connectivity, and corridors differ among species and are discussed in
individual species assessments where appropriate. The FP includes several goals related to connectivity,
and linkage:
•

Connectivity is defined as “the degree to which similar but separated vegetation components
of a landscape are connected. The FP includes a goal to maintain connectivity by providing
secure habitat at the landscape scale to facilitate large animal movements. There are no
specific routes identified in the FP, as there is no empirical data to delineate such routes.

•

Linkage is defined as “Route that permits movement of individual plants (by dispersal) and
animals from a Landscape Unit and/or habitat type to another similar Landscape Unit and/or
habitat type”. Linkage areas for Canada lynx were identified for the Northern Rockies
Planning Area (USFS 2007). Linkages mapped through the Clark Fork-Flints landscape
include one between Georgetown Lake and Anaconda connecting the southern and central
portions of the landscape across State Highway 1, and one connecting the central portion of
the landscape to portions in the John Long Mountains, across State Highway 1. These linkages
are estimates and not substantiated by empirical data on lynx movement.

•

A Biological Corridor is defined as “Landscape elements that connect similar patches of
habitat through an area with different characteristics. For example, streamside vegetation may
create a corridor of willows and hardwoods between meadows or through a forest”. There is
no empirical data supporting design or delineation of buffer zones and corridors for large
ungulate or carnivore movement or biological reserves on the BDNF.

Overall, given the small size and patchy distribution of units compared to the vast acreages of
surrounding forested and non-forested habitat not proposed for treatment; project implementation is not
expected to affect wildlife connectivity, linkage or corridors at the project or landscape scale.

165

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Habitat Security
Security is important for a range of mammals, including elk, bears, wolverines, and lynx. Increasing
access and use of an area causes increasing conflicts and risks to wildlife resources that can be displayed
in four broad categories: habitat alteration, disturbance, increased vulnerability to mortality, and increased
noxious weed establishment.
Wildlife Security (FP Goal)
The FP goal for wildlife security is to manage year-round OMRTD by landscape at or below identified
densities. The Clark Fork-Flints landscape OMRTD is 1.9 mi/mi2 and is compliant with the FP and will
remain so during and post implementation of action alternatives.
Wildlife Secure Areas and Connectivity (FP Goal)
The FP goal provides secure areas and connectivity for ungulates and large carnivores, while recognizing
a variety of recreational opportunities. Secure area is based on road buffers synthesized from the Grizzly
Bear Amendment definition, recreation buffers and Wisdom et al. (2005). Secure Areas are 1/3 of a mile
from a route open to motorized vehicles and are larger than 10 acres. The majority of secure area is found
at higher elevations, south of the proposed units (Secure Area Map, Appendix F). Secure area exists on
approximately 35% of the HU with approximately 6,400 acres within the project area. There are some
proposed units and haul routes that fall into delineated secure area and a variety of species using this area
may be temporarily disturbed at the time of implementation; however, ample secure area exists adjacent
to the project units. Alternative 2 treatment and associated activities will affect about 500 acres or 1% of
the secure area during implementation. Alternative 3 will affect about 25 acres during implementation
with no net change from existing condition under either action alternatives at the completion of the
project. See Table 57 and Map Section in Appendix F.
On Montana DNR lands in the Douglas Creek area, and on Montana State Prison lands, timber harvest
could affect secure areas on adjacent NFS land; however, the potential for, and location of, future road
developments on lands of other ownership is not predictable. Because the distance of effect is 0.33 mile,
the potential impacts to secure area at the project-level are minor.
Routes
Motorized routes and trails can affect many species in a variety of ways such as direct collisions,
increased distribution of exotic plants, increased trapper access, increased access for competing predators,
reduced security, and increased fragmentation. The FP restricts year-round, wheeled motorized travel off
designated routes or areas and motorized vehicles are not allowed in summer or winter non-motorized
allocations except for permitted or administrative use. Seasonal restrictions are largely based on
minimizing impacts to wildlife
Under Alternative 2, new roads would be constructed for hauling timber and subsequently included in the
NFS road inventory, but would be closed to public access and managed as Level 1 for potential future use.
No new temporary or NFS road construction would occur under Alternative 3 though some UR routes
will be used during implementation. Table 57 displays the changes in road use for hauling timber during
and after implementation for both alternatives. Because existing UR routes currently open to motorized
use were included in overall road density calculations, no increased access would result from inclusion in
the project.

Routes within the project area are unpaved and narrow, vehicle speeds are generally low, and vegetative
cover is common along travel routes. The wildlife species analyzed here are highly mobile; therefore, the
potential for barriers to movement and edge effects are minimal. Road reconstruction and reconditioning
associated with this proposal are not expected to increase potential for direct mortality or create barriers to
movement for the same reasons listed above.
During project activities, vehicle and equipment use of newly constructed roads (temporary and System)
and use of URs (existing temporary roads) would increase wildlife disturbance temporarily. Use of all
new and temporary routes for project implementation is not expected to occur simultaneously and routes
are closed to public motorized access during implementation. Newly constructed temporary roads would
be decommissioned by obliteration, whereas existing temporary roads would be decommissioned
primarily with signs and berms under both action alternatives. The Forest Service assumes that when a
road is signed as closed to public use, that the public is law abiding and such closures are honored. In
addition, most of the project area is in an October 15 – December 2 area restriction, where motorized use
is restricted to fewer routes during the hunting season.
Construction of temporary roads would temporarily increase mileage, but due to the low number of miles
of road, there would be no measureable change during project activities. Although Alternative 2 would
ultimately reduce open roads by 0.6 mile, OMRTDs under both alternatives at the landscape and hunting
unit scales would remain essentially unchanged after project completion. See Table 57.

Snag Habitat
The successional stage of the surrounding plant community influences the way wildlife use snags;
therefore, utilization of snags retained within treatment units will vary by wildlife species. Some species,
like bluebirds, house wrens and olive-sided flycatchers will use cavities in a snag that occurs in the grassforb stage or shrub-seedling state and will not ordinarily use a snag if it is surrounded by more advanced
successional stages. Other species, such as the pileated, hairy, and northern three-toed woodpeckers nest
in snags surrounded by trees and tend to avoid nesting in snags in earlier successional stages (Thomas,
1979). While not all cavity-nesting species may use the snags retained in the units for nesting, existing
cavities in retained trees would be used by other secondary cavity nester species that prefer snags in open
areas.
Tree and snag crevices and cavities can provide suitable roosting habitat for bats. As with other types of
roosts, microclimate plays a major role in the selection of tree roosts. Crevices beneath loose bark can be
efficient in trapping heat whereas cavities provide more stable temperatures and humidity and offer large
spaces for rearing young. Woodpecker abundance and excavation preferences are often important factors
in the creation of cavities used as bat roosts (Barclay & Kurta, 2007; Kalcounis & Brigham, 1998;
Mattson, Buskirk, & Stanton, 1996; Vonhof & Barclay, 1996; Rancourt, Rule, & O'Connell, 2007). Trees
and snags used for roosting generally have exposure to solar radiation (e.g. protruding from the canopy, in
a canopy gap, or on the edge of the canopy); are large in diameter; surrounded by large numbers of other
snags; and are in early to intermediate stages of decay (Johnson, Edwards, Ford, & Gates, 2009; Brigham,
Vonhof, Barclay, & Gwilliam, 1997; Barclay & Brigham, 2001; Olson & Barclay, 2013). Roost may also
be selected for smooth interior wall texture, size of cavity and multiple cavities, presumably for predator

167

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

avoidance (Clement & Calstleberry, 2013). The species of tree appears to be important as it relates to
decay characteristics, which affect both the amount of loose bark present and formation of cavities and
thermoregulation (Lacki, Johnson, & Baker, 2013). Snag roosts are inherently ephemeral; particularly for
bats that roost underneath loose bark as once the bark begins to exfoliate it falls off rapidly (Vonhof &
Barclay, 1996; Lacki, Baker, & Johnson, 2012; Rabe, Morrell, Green, deVos, & Miller, 1998a). Stand age
and structure is less predictive of bat use than is large snag densities, though greater snag densities are
commonly indicative of older forests. Proximity to foraging and drinking is also varied thus availability
of suitable tree roosts is likely more important to bats than access to other resources (Barclay & Kurta,
2007).
The snag direction in the Forest Plan is based on density and distribution of snags by various areas,
habitat types, dominance groups and seral stages. Potential impacts of timber harvest and human access
on snag density is considered. The actual snag retention numbers in the Forest Plan are based on snag
densities from wilderness/roadless lands on the eastside forests (Vegetation Section). The direction
focuses on retention of uncommon and rare elements; large diameter standing dead trees, (smaller
diameter dead trees are abundant across the forest due to the mountain pine beetle epidemic) and large,
living trees.
Additionally, ERG modeled changes in vegetation and wildlife habitat as a result of the mountain pine
beetle epidemic under different potential future vegetation management scenarios. At the Forest scale
there was little difference in cover type, tree size, and structure and density between treatment and no
treatment scenarios (1-2%) (ERG, 2010). In the Clark Fork-Flint landscape, beetle activity was present in
approximately 19% of the landscape, through 2009 (ERG 2010). Snag habitat for wildlife would continue
to be widespread and abundant at the Forest, landscape and project-scales. See the woodpecker section for
more detailed information on effects to snag habitat.
Commercial thinning treatments would decrease stand densities, thereby accelerating future tree growth.
This would also reduce the potential for tree mortality due to insects and disease, wildfire, and growth
suppression. While total snag numbers generated in a thinned stand may be less than an un-thinned stand
initially, because trees in the thinned stand will be ultimately be larger, recruitment of larger snags is
expected. Larger snags are more valuable to a wider range of species as they provide cavity, roosting and
denning habitat.
Within the commercial treatment units, snags would be retained at numbers prescribed by FP Wildlife
Standard #3. Snags retained would be clumped to reduce both the potential for wind throw as well as to
increase suitability for wildlife. FP Wildlife Standard #4 applies to seed tree treatments and will be met
through the retention of large Douglas-fir and Ponderosa pine trees (see Vegetation Section for more
detailed snag analysis). Additionally, abundant snags outside of treatment areas and larger snags retained
within treatment units ensure that both action alternatives would maintain habitat for cavity nesting
species across the project area.

Large Openings
Both action alternatives propose harvest of several units that would create large openings. The wildlife
species analyzed here are highly mobile; therefore, these openings may alter species movements locally
(i.e. at the stand level), but units are not expected to affect movements at the landscape level. In the longterm, these units would have less downed wood in the form of jackstraw trees on the ground (as compared
to unsalvaged lodgepole pine stands), thereby potentially enhancing mobility for some large species such
as elk.

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Climate change
Changes in climate may change the amount, quality and distribution of broad-scale vegetation types or
may affect forest structure and various successional stages associated with drought, insects, diseases
and/or fire (see Vegetation Section). As a driver of biotic systems, climate affects individual fitness;
population dynamics; species abundance and distribution; and ecosystem composition, structure, and
function. Wildlife can respond in three ways; they can respond in place through genetic, physiological or
behavioral adaptations; they can move to a new location (distributional shifts); or they may be unable to
do either and be unable to reproduce successfully and may face local extirpation or extinction. There are
numerous sources of uncertainty when trying to predict the effect of climate change. A few include
variability in physical systems; uncertainty in vegetative community shifts; interactions between climate
and non-climate stressors; and variation in species life history strategies, physiological tolerance and
dispersal abilities (Hahn, 2009). Climate change is addressed as a cumulative effect for species in this
analysis where applicable.

Threatened, Endangered & Proposed Species
Canada Lynx
Legal and Management Status
The USFWS lists Canada lynx as a threatened species, identifying the main threat as “the lack of
guidance for conservation of lynx and snowshoe hare habitat in National Forest Land and Resource Plans
and BLM Land Use Plans”. Following the listing, the FS signed an agreement to consider the Lynx
Conservation Assessment and Strategy (LCAS) during project analysis, and to not proceed with projects
that would be “likely to adversely affect” lynx until the plans were amended. In 2007, the FS completed
the Northern Rockies Lynx Management Direction (NRLMD) FEIS which incorporates the LCAS
(Ruediger, et al., 2000). The NRLMD directs management to conserve and promote recovery, by reducing
or eliminating adverse effects from the land management activities, while preserving the overall multipleuse direction in existing land use plans. This direction applies to activities in occupied habitat and
unoccupied forests should consider the management direction, but are not required to follow it until such
time as they are occupied (USFS, 2007c).
An area is considered to be occupied when: 1) there are at least two verified lynx observations or records
since 1999, unless they are verified to be transient individuals; or 2) there is evidence of reproduction
(USFS, 2007c). Secondary areas are those with historic records of lynx presence with no record of
reproduction, or areas with historical records and no recent surveys. Lynx surveys were conducted on the
BDNF between 1999 and 2001 as part of a National Lynx Survey effort. Through this effort, no lynx were
detected and the BDNF was determined to be unoccupied, secondary habitat (USFWS & USFS, 2006)
and currently considered “transient; secondary/peripheral lynx habitat”. However, the FP directs
consideration of the NRLMD and in 2009, the Regional Forester issued a memo that directed forests
currently considered unoccupied, including the BDNF, to consider the management direction in the
NRLMD (Tidwell, 2009).
The revised LCAS stratifies the objectives and conservation measures by core areas and
secondary/peripheral areas to help managers prioritize their conservation efforts and states that it is “not
necessary to delineate LAUs in secondary/peripheral areas” (ILBT, 2013). Secondary or peripheral areas
might contribute to lynx persistence by supporting successful dispersal or exploratory movements and
habitat. These areas appear to be inherently more patchy and less productive and the amount and quality
of habitat required to support an independent adult or sub-adult disperser is less than is necessary to
support reproduction and sustain a local population (ILBT, 2013). The focus of management in secondary
areas is on “providing a mosaic of forest structure to support snowshoe hare prey resources for individual
lynx that infrequently may move through or reside temporarily in the area” and that landscape
169

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

connectivity should be maintained to allow for movement and dispersal (ILBT, 2013). Individuals, if
found in the analysis area, are considered transient or short-term residents and these lynx generally do not
establish home ranges and do not attempt or are unsuccessful at reproduction.
Biological Information
Primary vegetation that contributes to lynx habitat is lodgepole pine, subalpine fir and Engelmann spruce
(Squires, Decesare, Kolbe, & Ruggiero, 2010; Berg, Gese, Squires, & Aubry, 2013). In central Idaho,
Douglas-fir on moist sites at higher elevations may also be considered primary vegetation. Secondary
vegetation, when interspersed within subalpine forests that may also contribute to lynx habitat includes
cool, moist Douglas-fir, grand fir, western larch and aspen forests. Dry forest types (e.g., ponderosa pine,
Douglas-fir or lodgepole pine with a grass-like understory) do not provide lynx habitat (Squires,
Decesare, Kolbe, & Ruggiero, 2010).
Snowshoe hares are the primary prey of lynx, comprising 35 to 97 percent of the diet. Dense saplings or
mature multi-layered maximize availability of food and cover for snowshoe hares at varying snow depths
throughout the winter. Natural disturbance processes that create early successional stages exploited by
snowshoe hares include fire, insect infestations, wind throw, and disease outbreaks. Both timber harvest
and natural disturbance processes provide foraging habitat for lynx when the resulting stem densities and
stand structure meet the habitat needs of snowshoe hare (ILBT, 2013). Landscapes with varying age
classes and high horizontal cover, particularly mesic spruce-fir forests, support high snowshoe hare
populations and therefore provide lynx habitat (Squires, Decesare, Kolbe, & Ruggiero, 2010; Berg, Gese,
Squires, & Aubry, 2013).
Horizontal structure is also a key component for den site selection as lynx use a variety of types of large
woody debris, such as downed logs, root wads and windfall to provide security and thermal cover for
kittens Invalid source specified.. In the Greater Yellowstone Area, the majority of lynx occurrences are
in moist, contiguous Douglas-fir and western spruce/fir forests between 4,920-6,560 feet Invalid source
specified..
Individual lynx maintain home ranges ranging between 12 to 83 mi2. The size of lynx home ranges varies
depending on abundance of prey, gender and age, season, and the density of lynx populations. When
densities of snowshoe hares decline, for example, lynx enlarge their home ranges to obtain sufficient
amounts of food to survive and reproduce. In addition, lynx are highly mobile and have a propensity to
explore and disperse long distances, particularly when prey becomes scarce Invalid source specified..
For this reason, movement is not impeded between preferred habitats.
Population and Habitat Status and Distribution
There is no critical lynx habitat in the analysis area (Fed Register, Vol. 74, No. 36, February 25, 2009, pp.
8616 to 8702). The entire BDNF is within secondary/peripheral habitat where evidence of reproduction,
recent or historic, does not exist (USFWS, 2015). Any individuals in the analysis area are considered
transient or short-term residents who do not establish home ranges; nor attempt or are successful at
reproduction.
Squires et al. (2003) began what was to be a lynx survey in the Pioneer, Anaconda-Pintler and Flint Creek
mountain ranges in 2001 (to the south, west, and north of the analysis area). Rigorous winter snow track
surveys were conducted as a first step to determine the presence and distribution of lynx. They only found
a single possible lynx track throughout the three mountain ranges. Although data show that lynx were
historically present in the area, the area did not support a resident population at the time of their survey.
Because lynx were absent or at such low densities, and they detected numerous wolverines, that study
shifted to wolverines.

170

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Nate Berg (Greater Yellowstone Lynx Study) identified and surveyed a few areas of lynx habitat using
track surveys. Two routes were run in the Flint Creek mountain range, two routes in the
Sapphire/Anaconda-Pintler, one route in the Boulder Mountains, two routes in the Pioneers and one route
on the Mt Haggin WMA (Berg N. , 2009). One possible set of lynx tracks were found on the West Fork
Rock Creek (Sapphire Mountains), but poor snow conditions precluded positive identification. Another
group, Wild Things Unlimited, conducted hair snare and remote camera system surveys in the Flint
Creek, Pioneer and Boulder mountains in 2009 (Porco, 2009). None of the surveys resulted in
confirmation of lynx presence.
Satellite locations following reintroductions of lynx in Colorado show numerous locations in Montana,
including southwest Montana (Devineau, et al., 2005); however, these locations, as substantiated by Jake
Ivan (Colorado Division of Wildlife), are clearly transient animals that did not stay in Montana. Eight of
218 reintroduced lynx in Colorado made 10 forays into Montana lasting between 1 and 217 days (no
Colorado-born kittens went to Montana) “One individual localized for about 2 weeks in the Madison
Range, but other than that these animals were most definitely traveling” (Ivan, 2012). The Madison Range
is approximately 75 miles southeast of the Flint Foothills project. None of the locations were in the
analysis area and cannot be construed as establishing occupancy for the BDNF.
ERG (2010) found that currently only 0.1 percent of the forested landscape on the BDNF provides multistoried potential habitat for lynx (spruce-fir-lodgepole pine stands greater than 5 inches dbh/ two-storied
or multi-storied stands. This is due to: (1) eastside lodgepole pine (BDNFs predominant cover type)
seldom having multi-storied stands; and (2) mesic spruce/fir stands are a minor type on the BDNF.
The BDNF conducted lynx hair snare survey following the National Lynx Detection Protocol (McKelvey,
Claar, McDaniel, & Hanvey, 1999) from 2012 - 2014, as per terms and conditions in the Biological
Opinion and ROD for the Lynx Amendment. Based on previous monitoring information and vegetation
modeling, the Upper Rock Creek landscape contains some of the most likely lynx habitat on the BDNF.
Hair samples were collected from 14 scent stations and sent to the Rocky Mountain Research Station for
identification through DNA analysis. No samples were identified as lynx over the 3 years of surveys.
Environmental Consequences to Canada Lynx

Alternative 1– Direct, Indirect, and Cumulative Effects

Dry Douglas-fir/ponderosa pine forests do not provide preferred habitat and changes to these vegetation
types are not anticipated to effect lynx. Consistent with conditions described for the Fleecer Mountains
Project (Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest project), proposed units where stand growth was initiated
approximately 35 years ago still provide suitable snowshoe hare habitat due to lack of self-pruning and
green branches accessible given the measured snow depths. However, as these stands age, self-pruning
will decrease suitability of hare habitat.
Of the habitat types proposed for treatment, the mid-elevation mixed conifer has the best potential to
contain the multi-story mature or late succession forests preferred by lynx. Without treatment, these
stands will continue to become more dense, increasing susceptibility to insect and potential wildfire.
Though these disturbance events may contribute denning material in the form of downed logs, reduced
resiliency in the stand or potential loss of large tracts of mature forest (wildfire) could negatively affect
lynx habitat in the long-term. However, this potential indirect effect is discountable because of the
unlikely establishment of lynx in the area.

Alternatives 2 and 3– Direct and Indirect Effects

The project occurs in secondary lynx habitat. Although disturbance is possible, the transient nature of
lynx and the fact that no lynx have been found in over 30 years in the analysis area indicate the likelihood
of this effect to be unlikely. The NRLMD directs management to conserve and promote recovery, by

171

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

reducing or eliminating adverse effects from the land management activities, while preserving the overall
multiple-use direction in existing land use plans.

All S1

Standard All S1 states: “New or expanded permanent developments and vegetation management projects
must maintain habitat connectivity in an LAU and/or linkage area”.
Given the surrounding open range and agriculture land, the action area is less ideal as a linkage area to the
North than south of the analysis area through mid-elevation forested habitat. Most of the analysis area is
in a stem exclusion structural stage (See Lynx Habitat Map, Appendix F), which does not currently
provide horizontal cover necessary for suitable hare habitat. Dry Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine forests
in lower elevations do not provide suitable horizontal cover for hare and harvest and burn treatments in
this forest type are not expected to impact potential linkage. Proposed treatments in mid-elevation stands
will diversify age classes and improve resiliency, maintaining or promoting horizontal cover and
improving connectivity within the LAU in the long-term. Salvage and pre-commercial thinning in
lodgepole pine will create large open area that may detour lynx movement locally; however, connective
forest elements are available outside of the treatment areas. See Veg S5 for additional discussion of
precommercial thin units. Downed woody debris will be retained to meet Plan direction, providing
additional horizontal structure.

Veg S1

Veg S1 states “that unless a broad-scale assessment has been completed, if more than 30 percent of the
lynx habitat is currently in a stand initiation structural stage that does not yet provide winter snowshoe
hare habitat, no additional habitat may be regenerated by vegetation projects. Though LAU 36 is close to
30% in stand initiation due primarily to bark beetles, no regeneration activities are proposed in that LAU.
Table 58 shows that this standard is being met.

Seed tree prescriptions proposed meet the NRLMD definition of “regeneration” and were calculated for
action alternatives by LAU. Standard VEG S2 applies to all vegetation management projects that
regenerate timber, except for fuel treatment projects within the wildland urban interface (WUI) as defined
by HFRA, subject to the following limitation:
Fuel treatment projects within the WUI that do not meet Standards VEG S1, VEG S2, VEG S5, and VEG
S6 may occur on no more than 6 percent (cumulatively) of lynx habitat on each administrative unit (a unit
is a National Forest).
For fuel treatment projects within the WUI see guideline VEG G10.

172

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Veg S2 states that timber management projects shall not regenerate more than 15 percent of lynx habitat
on NFS lands in an LAU in a ten-year period. Table 58 displays percent of stands in regeneration status
for each LAU; all between 0 – 7 percent, complying with Veg S2.

Veg S5

The snowshoe hare occurs in overstocked stands of lodgepole pine (and other stands with dense
vegetative cover). The standard reads “precommercial thinning projects that reduce snowshoe hare
habitat, may occur from the stand initiation stage (harvest) until the stands no longer provide winter
snowshoe hare habitat only within…” and then lists exceptions. None of these exceptions apply to this
project.
Proposed commercial thin units where stand growth was initiated approximately 35 years ago still
provide suitable snowshoe hare habitat due to lack of self-pruning and green branches accessible given
the measured snow depths. Field review conducted in 2012 and 2015 shows that four units (25P, 36P, 39P,
and 45P) contain suitable snowshoe hare habitat and therefore Alternatives 2 and 3 do not meet Standard
S5 as currently proposed; the Record of Decision does not select these units for implementation. In
addition, a design feature has been added to both action alternatives that retains full-crowned trees with
green branches within one foot of the ground in pre-commercial thinning units. This would retain those
trees that are providing cover or forage for snowshoe hares during the winter.

Veg S6

Veg S6 states, “Vegetation management projects that reduce snowshoe hare habitat in multi-story mature
or late-successional forests may occur only:
1. Within 200 feet of administrative sites, dwellings, outbuildings, recreation sites, and special
use permit improvements, including infrastructure within permitted ski area boundaries; or
2. For research studies or genetic tree tests evaluating genetically improved reforestation stock;
3. For incidental removal during salvage harvest (e.g. removal due to location of skid trails).
Walk thru stand exams and horizontal cover plot surveys were conducted (available in project file). These
field surveys identified several harvest units and portions of the prescribed burn units with mature multistory habitat therefore Alternatives 2 and 3 do not meet Standard S6 as currently proposed; the Record of
Decision does not select these units for implementation or boundaries were modified to remove ignition
zones to avoid removing mature multi-story habitat; thus, this standard is met.

Cumulative Effects

Several past and ongoing activities that could cumulatively affect lynx habitat were considered (appendix
D). Some of these activities have or will have positive effects such as road decommissioning projects,
which reduce habitat fragmentation, increasing security and connectivity. Past vegetation management
activities have temporarily removed and now provide both snowshoe hare and red squirrel habitat in the
analysis area. Extensive insect infestations are creating stand initiation phases and have increased the
accumulation of down wood providing structural components lynx select for denning. The extensive
mortality also serves to increase the risk of large-scale wildfires that could significantly reduce
availability of suitable lynx habitat. Over time, the forest will continue to regrow and provide early
successional forests needed by snowshoe hares where site conditions allow. Conversely, some of this
fragmentation could reduce connectivity between habitats. Foreseeable FS projects with the potential to
affect lynx habitat would be subject to the lynx management direction standards and additional
consultation with USFWS; and therefore, are not expected to contribute cumulative impacts to lynx
habitats at the LAU scale.
Timber harvest has occurred on State and private lands and future harvest activities are anticipated due to
insect mortality. Past activity can be seen in the summary of existing structural condition (Lynx Habitat

173

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Map, Appendix F). In general, state and private lands within the cumulative effects area occur at lower
elevations in dry forest types and provide little suitable lynx habitat.
The NRLMD Standards and Guidelines provide a means of measuring potential impacts to lynx habitat
and ensures meaningful thresholds of key habitat components are not exceeded, including past, present,
and ongoing effects in conjunction with activities proposed under this project. Habitat availability and
habitat treated are within thresholds identified for Veg S1 and Veg S2; therefore, direct/indirect effects to
key habitat components for lynx generated by this project in combination with effects of past, present,
reasonably foreseeable future actions considered are not significant as they do not exceed the limits
provided for in the NRLMD, and as such are discountable.
Determination of Effects
There will be No Effect on designated Critical Habitat for Canada lynx as the Flint Foothills project is not
within designated Critical Habitat. The entirety of the BDNF is classified by the USFWS as
secondary/peripheral habitat.
Guidance provided in the Endangered Species Consultation Handbook indicates that a Not Likely to
Adversely Affect call is the appropriate conclusion when effects on listed species are expected to be
discountable, insignificant, or completely beneficial. Discountable effects are those that are extremely
unlikely to occur. Insignificant effects relate to the size of the impact and should never reach the scale
where take occurs. Beneficial effects are positive effects without adverse effects to the species. The
determination is based on the following rationale:
•

The project occurs in secondary lynx habitat. Although disturbance is possible, the transient
nature of lynx and the fact that no lynx have been found in over 30 years in the analysis area
indicate the likelihood of this effect to be unlikely (discountable effect).

•

The project maintains a mosaic of forest structures and successional stages, which is the
conservation measure described in the draft revised LCAS for vegetation management in
secondary areas (ILBT, 2013). The scale of habitat changes (less than 2 percent of the analysis
area) is very small (insignificant effect).

•

The project has been modified to remove units and minimize effects to prey habitat (insignificant
effect).

•

The standards and guidelines of the NRLMD are met.

Implementation of the proposed Federal Action May Affect, but is not Likely to Adversely Affect Canada
lynx.

Grizzly Bears
Legal and Management Status
In April 2012, sightings of a grizzly bear on the north part of the BDNF prompted a re-initiation of
consultation with USFWS on the FP. The USFWS issued a BO on the FP and identified the following key
categories of forest management that have potential to adversely affect grizzly bears: 1) motorized access,
2) foods and attractants storage and 3) livestock grazing. Vegetation management, fire management and
oil and gas exploration were also considered; but adverse impacts were not anticipated through those
activities unless implementation included changes to the above categories (USFWS, 2013). The USFWS
concluded that implementing the FP is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the grizzly bear
and would reduce the potential for or minimize incidental take. No additional reasonable and prudent
measures are necessary and no terms and conditions were identified (USFWS, 2013).

174

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Because the action area is not within the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem (NCDE) or the Greater
Yellowstone Recovery Zones (see Grizzly Bear Recovery Zone Map, Appendix F), none of the
regulatory mechanisms or requirements in these conservation plans apply to this project. The Draft
NCDE Grizzly Bear Conservation Strategy delineates Priority Conservation Areas and 3 additional zones
with guidelines specific to each area (USFWS, 2013). The large carnivore analysis area is closest to Zone
2, which includes a small portion of the Clark Fork-Flints Landscape east of Deer Lodge. The objective in
Zone 2 is “to maintain existing resource management and recreational opportunities and allow agencies
to respond to demonstrated conflicts with appropriate management actions. Public lands in Zone 2 will be
managed to provide the opportunity for grizzly bears, particularly males which are more likely to disperse
long distances, to move between the NCDE and adjacent ecosystems via current direction in USFS
Management Plans.”.
Biological Information
The closest population of grizzly bears is the NCDE population; the natural history information and status
of this population will be discussed in reference to the overall population, status and distribution of
grizzly bears in this analysis. However, grizzly bears outside of the NCDE recovery zone are likely to
have different habitat needs and ability to adapt to different habitat than that within the NCDE since they
have successfully moved into areas outside the recovery zone in low densities consistent with the draft
conservation strategy (USFWS, 2013).
Grizzly bears excavate dens as early as September or prior to entry in November. Dens are usually dug on
steep slopes where wind and topography cause an accumulation of deep snow and where snow is unlikely
to melt during warm periods. Dens are generally found at high elevations well away from human activity
and development.
Grizzly bears are opportunistic feeders and will prey or scavenge on almost any available food. Plants
with high crude protein content and animal matter are important food items. The search for food has a
prime influence on grizzly bear movements. Upon emergence from the den, grizzlies move to lower
elevations, drainage bottoms, avalanche chutes, and ungulate winter ranges where their food requirements
can be met. Throughout spring and early summer, grizzlies follow plant phenology back to higher
elevations. In late summer and fall, there is a transition to fruit and nut sources, as well as herbaceous
materials. This is a general pattern; however, bears will go where they can meet their food requirements.
The home ranges of adult male grizzlies are generally two to four times larger than adult females and may
overlap. The home ranges of females are smaller while they have cubs, but increase when the cubs
become yearlings. Mace and Roberts (2011) reported that female grizzly home ranges in the NCDE were
smallest for females with cubs of the year (avg. = 40 mi2) and largest for subadults (avg. = 93 mi2). Home
ranges vary in relation to food availability, weather conditions, and interactions with other bears. Grizzly
bears have low reproductive rates, long generational times (i.e., 10 years), and are slow to disperse across
landscapes.
The amount of secure habitat as well as road densities outside secure habitat within a grizzly bear’s home
range were important factors in predicting bear survival (Schwartz, Haroldson, & White, 2010). Though
grizzly bears can and do survive in roaded areas if available resource benefits outweigh the risks; large
areas of secure habitat (free of motorized traffic) are the primary component of ideal grizzly bear habitat
(ICST, 2007). In general, roads can affect grizzlies in several ways such as increased mortality (collisions
and hunter access), displacement, habitat fragmentation, reduced cub recruitment, and changes in
population and distribution (ICST, 2007). Secure habitat may also be impacted by motorized winter
activity and possible effects include den abandonment, loss of young, increased energetic demands, death,
and learned displacement from suitable habitat (USFWS, 2013). In addition to road related mortalities;
mistaken identity during legal black bear hunting season, self-defense, management removal of food
habituated bears, or killing for malicious purposes also contribute to human interaction being the main

175

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

cause of grizzly bear mortality in the NCDE and in the lower 48 states. Livestock grazing (mostly sheep)
in particular provide food attractants, which may result in removal of the offending bear (Knight & Judd,
1983).
Population Status and Distribution
The historic range of the grizzly bear in the contiguous 48 States extended from the central Great Plains,
west to California, and south to Texas and Mexico. Between 1800 and 1975, grizzly bear populations in
the lower 48 states declined from over 50,000 to less than 1,000. As European settlement expanded
westward, the grizzly was extirpated from most of its historical range.
Five areas in the lower 48 states currently support grizzly bear populations; these areas are located in
Montana, Wyoming, Idaho, and Washington and include the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE),
Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem (NCDE), Cabinet-Yaak Ecosystem, Selkirk Ecosystem, and
Northern Cascades Ecosystem. These areas represent less than two percent of the grizzly’s former range
(USFWS, 1993).
Habitat and Use of the Analysis Area
The project is approximately 30 miles south of the NCDE recovery zone, 50 miles East of the Bitterroot,
and about 100 miles northwest of the GYE (Grizzly Bear Recover Zone Map, Appendix F).
The area between John Long Mountains, Flint Creek range and the Pintler range is described as having
the capability of becoming a key grizzly linkage zone between the Boulder/Garnet mountain range
complex and the Anaconda-Pintler Wilderness (Jonkel & Edge, 2009).
Verified observations of grizzly bears or their tracks have occurred on the northern and western portions
of the BDNF since 2010 including a female with a cub in Cataract Meadows in 2015, Northeast of the
project area. Nine additional observations have been north of Butte in Elk Park, in the headwaters of the
Little Blackfoot River, in the headwaters of Cottonwood Creek, in the Lockhart Meadows area, in the
Boulder River watershed, the divide between Blackfoot Meadows and the Boulder Drainage and north
and west of Anaconda in the Philipsburg and Rock Creek drainage area. It is unknown if these verified
observations represent individual grizzly bears. All DNA evidence indicates these grizzly bears came
from the NCDE population.
Basis for Effects Analysis
The USFWS (2013) identified the following key categories of forest management that have potential to
adversely affect grizzly bears: 1) motorized access, 2) foods and attractants storage, and 3) livestock
grazing. Livestock management will not be changed by the Flint Foothills project and therefore will not
be discussed further.
Motorized Access Management
Motorized access has long been recognized as a major factor affecting grizzly bears. Grizzly bear habitat
across the Northern Region is best described in terms of the availability of large tracts of relatively
undisturbed land that provides some level of security from human depredation and competitive use of
habitat by humans (including roads, logging, grazing, and recreation) (USFWS 1993). To that end, secure
habitat is a useful metric to assess habitat suitability for grizzly bears. Though secure area in the NCDE is
defined as 2,500 acres, direction to maintain such large blocks are only applicable to Priority
Conservation Areas where the objective is “continual occupancy by grizzly bears and maintenance of
habitat conditions that are compatible with stable to increasing grizzly bear population. This is the area
where the most conservative habitat protections apply. Here, large blocks of secure habitat would be
maintained and no net increases in motorized route densities, developed sites, or livestock allotments
would be allowed on Federal lands.” This is based on research on habitat needs specific to the NCDE and

176

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

reflects available foraging opportunities and existing unroaded conditions within the study area, which
contains large tracts of designated Wilderness. In places where foraging opportunities are more readily
available such as the Yellowstone ecosystem with abundant elk and bison, as little as10 acres of unroaded
habitat provides the grizzly bear secure habitat. In this analysis area, no empirical data based on actual
bear use is available to determine secure habitat due to the rarity of bear use in this area and lack of
research investment due to its relatively low priority in the recovery scheme for the species.
The NCDE Draft Conservation Strategy determined that “Because we know that management direction in
current USFS and BLM land management plans in Zone 2 did not preclude male grizzly bears from
occupying this area in low densities, existing direction will continue to apply.” The FP road density goals
and objectives provide security and areas of connectivity for large ungulates and forest carnivores,
including the grizzly bear and defines secure habitat is a 10 acre polygon more than 1/3 mile from an
open motorized road. The distance from a motorized route is a slightly modified, more conservative,
version of that used in the NCDE and GYA, which use a 500-meter buffer (145 feet greater than 1/3 mi).
This modified calculation does not measurably change the amount of secure area at the analysis area
scale. The FP definition was adopted to accommodate mapping for quiet recreation and depicts less area
of secure habitat than would be available under the GYA calculation and will be used for the remainder of
this analysis to assess secure area availability.
Seasonal habitat use by grizzly bears is also an important consideration in access management. Because
spring habitat tends to be at lower elevations, increased potential exists for conflict between bears and
humans due to greater access into those areas by humans. Roads located in riparian zones, for example,
may result in indirect habitat losses through avoidance behavior by bears. Riparian zones are heavily used
by grizzlies for feeding and travel corridors. During fall, female bears use mid- and high-elevation
habitats and strongly avoid high densities of roads, suggesting that seasonal road closures aimed at
minimizing traffic in important seasonal habitats may benefit grizzly bears.
Food Storage
Human food, garbage, mechanical lubricants, and livestock feed are attractive to grizzly bears and may
cause changes in bear behavior leading to habituated and/or food-conditioned bears. Habituation to
human foods and attractants in turn increases the potential for conflicts between people and grizzly bears.
This project has incorporated a design feature that requires food storage, as well as storage and cleanup of
mechanical lubricants that could attract bears to work sites. The BDNF has a food storage order (Forest
Supervisor's Order Requiring Safe Storage, Possession and Handling of Food and Attractants) that applies
Forest-wide regardless of activity (recreation, contract work, etc.).
Vegetation Management
Several studies have addressed the effects of created openings on grizzly bears. Wielgus and Vernier
(2003) reported that grizzly bears in the Selkirk Mountains did not select against clearcuts. Servheen
(1983) and Mace et al. (Mace, Waller, Manley, Lyon, & Zuuring, 1996) also reported that most grizzly
bears were neutral or selected for clear-cuts. Zager et al. (Zager, Jonkel, & Habeck, 1983) found that bears
avoided cutting units affected by open roads, whereas bears used cutting units isolated from human
disturbance. Cutting unit size was not a factor in grizzly bear use, but bears were noted to utilize areas
close to existing cover (i.e. within 50 meters). Cutting units in the Swan Mountains, Montana were used
by bears very little during the spring, but use increased in summer and fall with increased forage
availability (Waller & Mace, 1997). In the Flathead River drainage of British Columbia and Montana,
regenerating forest cut-blocks (age less than 40 years since harvest) were the habitat type least-selected by
bears during summer and fall seasons (McLellan & Hovey, 2001). Because there is conflicting results as
to whether grizzly bear use is affected by vegetation changes due to logging in other areas and no known
research on the topic has occurred near the project area, effects are considered in terms of disturbance
impacts to individual bears during implementation.

177

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Fire Management
Management practices that encourage fire suppression have altered the natural succession of many forests
and have resulted, in many cases, in a reduction or elimination of early successional stages. This has had a
negative impact on grizzly bear food production (Holland, 1986). Low intensity prescribed fire in grizzly
bear habitat can be beneficial to maintaining whitebark pine through reduction of competing conifers. In
the Yellowstone area after a large wildfire, grizzly bears use of lodgepole pine forest varied widely by
season, year, and structural condition (McLellan & Shackleton, 1989). Recently disturbed open sites were
used mainly for travel and avoided for bedding, while foraging activities in other structural types included
excavation and consumption of invertebrates (mostly ants), grazing on grasses and forbs, consumption of
ungulates, and consumption of whitebark pine nuts. As with vegetation management, changes in forest
structure as a result of fire management is inconsistent and effects are considered in terms of disturbance
to individual bears during implementation.
Environmental Consequences
Alternative 1– Direct, Indirect, and Cumulative Effects
There would be no direct disturbance to transient grizzly bears from the no action alternative. Indirectly,
as canopies close, understory growth of grasses and forbs will continue to decline affecting forage value
for ungulate prey. The reduction of winter range could cause big game to move further north where open
parks are not experiencing as significant canopy closures as found within proposed treatment units,
therefore any transient bears may have to travel further for a spring food source. Further travel distances
could tax bears already in a weakened state from hibernation and could make them more susceptible to
human interactions. Additionally, closure of stands may impede travel and detour grizzly bears from using
the area. However, this indirect effect is expected to be insignificant due to the unlikely grizzly bear use
and abundant elk and adjacent intact winter range.
Alternatives 2 and 3– Direct and Indirect Effects

Motorized Access

Temporary road use and construction does not affect the measure of take as this mileage in combination
with other BDNF projects is under the 70 miles of temporary roads that was analyzed in the FP
consultation (USFWS, 2013).
Although overall road miles will be reduced at the completion of the project, secure areas and OMRTDs
at the landscape and hunting unit scales would remain essentially unchanged after project completion and
below the 1.9 mi/mi2 Forest Plan goal. This goal is existing FP direction and therefore consistent with the
draft NCDE Conservation Strategy recommendations for this Landscape. The analysis area affords the
grizzly bear nearly 63,000 acres of secure area (Wildlife Secure Area Maps, Appendix F) with additional
riparian vegetation stringers creating secure corridors between meadows or through a forest.
Therefore, increased road miles during implementation may cause temporary displacement of, or
avoidance by, grizzly bears if they are present in proximity to project activities (Table 57). However, the
likelihood of grizzly bear proximity to active treatment areas is low due to the transient nature and lack of
established occupancy within the Clark Fork-Flints landscape.

Vegetation Treatment

In salvage units, dead trees lacking green overstory would be removed, thereby increasing sight distance
and reducing horizontal cover. Potential value for salvaged stands for foraging and bedding use by
grizzlies would decrease, but salvage units may still be utilized for travel. The effects of reduced foraging
and bedding effectiveness would last 5-15 years, which is the period where existing snags would have
fallen if the stand were left untreated.

178

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Seed tree harvest in Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine types as well as commercial thinning in Douglas-fir
stands would have similar effects in that residual stand structures would be more open, thereby decreasing
cover for bedding, but facilitating travel. In addition, canopies that are more open would stimulate
understory growth of grasses and forbs, improving forage for ungulate prey.
Some timber harvest units may contain individual or scattered whitebark pine. Timber harvests have been
shown to benefit whitebark pine by reducing competition and allowing for more rapid growth (Keane &
Parsons, 2007). Reducing high fuel loads around whitebark pine stands can also reduce the potential for
high-severity wildfires, which can be detrimental to whitebark pine if regeneration is not successful
(USFS 2011f). Project Design Features would retain all existing whitebark pine within harvest units.
Precommercial thinning (PCT) units currently contain high densities of small tree boles that present an
obstacle to travel and little forage value. While precommercial thinning would reduce stem densities,
residual slash retained within treatment units may deter bear movement until the slash deteriorates in
subsequent years.
Based on the literature, grizzly bear avoidance of created openings is not expected unless the unit is
associated with an existing disturbance factor, such as an open road. Interior portions of larger openings
may go unutilized by bears due to distance to hiding cover; however, openings are not expected to be a
barrier to bear movements due to the species’ inherent mobility; and may provide less resistance to
movement than that of adjacent dense stands with accumulated jackstraw downed wood.

Prescribed Burning

Habitat effects resulting from prescribed burning treatments varies by elevation and unit. Burning in
lower elevation stands would consume the grass, herb and shrub understory communities, along with the
killing of seedling and sapling sized conifers in the understory; stimulating senesced understory
communities, and increasing grass-forb vigor and forage value for both ungulate prey and grizzly bears
(Zager, Jonkel, & Habeck, 1983).
Although burning in whitebark pine stands can assist in whitebark pine regeneration, it is not an objective
of the proposed treatment. Direct impacts to whitebark pine from prescribed burning can include damage
or death as a result of burning individual trees. Indirect impacts to whitebark pine could include the
creation of canopy openings conducive for caching whitebark seed by Clark’s nutcracker birds; hence,
increasing potential whitebark pine regeneration. The felling of conifers prior to burning activities would
minimize the use of fire directly in areas that have concentrations of whitebark pine; both regenerating
and established mature stands (see project design features).
Increased human presence in addition to project activities such as sawing, hauling, hand ignition and
helicopter use during implementation may cause temporary displacement of or avoidance by, grizzly
bears if they are present in proximity to project activities. However, because management activities would
be distributed in space and time throughout the analysis area and roads would be closed to public use and
obliterated or closed upon completion, displacement is expected to be minimal. In addition, most of the
analysis area is in an October 15 – December 2 area restriction, where motorized use is restricted to fewer
routes during the hunting season.

Cumulative Effects

Actions including natural forest succession, wildfires, wind events, insects, disease, development, travel
management, vegetation management and agriculture were reviewed (Appendix D). These activities were
also considered in the BA prepared for the Forest Plan and USFWS concurrence was received. The
USFWS determined effects to grizzly bear and grizzly bear habitat are primarily from motorized use, food
attractants, and presence of livestock, which may be in the form of avoidance (human presence), or
attractants (livestock or human). Those are the activities considered for in conjunction with direct and
indirect effects. The analysis area contains established human activities, including, road management,
179

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

private land activities/development and recreational use as well as others. High levels of human activity
usually have a negative effect on the grizzly bear population due to the greatest cause of grizzly bear
mortality in the NCDE being from conflicts with humans.
The Flint Foothills analysis area lies between the GYE, Bitterroot and NCDE recovery zones for grizzly
bears. Overall, given the small size and patchy distribution of units in a roaded area with high human
activity compared to the vast acreages of surrounding forested and non-forested habitat not proposed for
treatment project implementation is not expected to affect connectivity, linkage or corridors between these
ecosystems for mobile species such as the grizzly bear.
Cumulative effects generated by ongoing livestock use, temporary increases in disturbance, and
temporary decreases in security areas combined with other activities would be discountable because: 1)
grizzly bear use of the area is expected to be low (outside of the Recovery Zones); 2) project
implementation is short in duration; 3) there are no FS sheep allotments anywhere on the Deerlodge
portion of the BDNF and no reported depredations of livestock on FS allotments in the analysis area; and
4) a forest-wide food storage order is in place.
Determination of Effects
Because there is no designated critical habitat for grizzly bears associated with this project,
implementation will have No Effect on grizzly bear designated critical habitat.
No observations of grizzly bears have been reported within the analysis area. However, recent increases in
sightings on and near the northern portion of the BDNF may indicate a higher potential for grizzly bear
occurrence in the future. Effects to grizzly bears and their habitats may occur as a result of temporary
increase in road miles, temporary reduction in secure areas, project-related disturbance, and vegetation
modification.
Guidance provided in the Endangered Species Consultation Handbook indicates that the Not Likely to
Adversely Affect determination is the appropriate conclusion when effects on listed species are expected
to be discountable, insignificant, or completely beneficial. Discountable effects are those that are
extremely unlikely to occur. Insignificant effects relate to the size of the impact and should never reach
the scale where take occurs. Beneficial effects are positive effects without adverse effects to the species.
The determination is based on the following rationale:
•

Although disturbance is possible, the lack of occupancy of grizzly bears suggests that effects are
unlikely (discountable effect).

•

Project would not alter access management in the long-term (insignificant effect).

•

Food and attractant storage as a risk factor for grizzly bears due to project activities would be
reduced or eliminated due to a project design feature that requires attractant storage (beneficial
effect).

Based on the above rational in combination with the environmental baseline, implementation May Affect,
but is not Likely to Adversely Affect grizzly bears. A Biologcal Assessment was submitted to USFWS on
November 23, 2015.
North American Wolverine
Direction, Guidelines and Recommendations
Federal actions concerning the wolverine date back to 1995 and culminated in a proposal to list the
wolverine DPS as threatened on February 4, 2013 (78 FR 7865). Global climate change in concert with
legal and incidental trapping were identified as primary threats to wolverines. “Wolverines are not thought

180

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

to be dependent on specific vegetation or habitat features that might be manipulated by land management
activities, nor is there evidence to suggest that land management activities are a threat to the conservation
of the species” Human activities in wolverine habitat such as snowmobiling, backcountry skiing, and land
management activities like timber harvest and infrastructure development, which do not constitute threats
to the species, would not be prohibited or regulated. After further review of all available scientific and
commercial information, the USFWS subsequently withdrew that proposal, and published their
determination on August 13, 2014, that adding the North American wolverine occurring in the contiguous
United States as a distinct population segment to the Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and
Plants was not warranted (79 FR 47522). Recently, the wolverine was again proposed for federal listing
and the Northern Region received concurrence on a programmatic biological assessment for a variety of
projects routinely conducted on National Forest System lands that are not likely to jeopardize the
continued existence of the species.
Biological Information
The wolverine has been characterized as one of North America's rarest mammals and least known large
carnivores. Within its geographic range, wolverines occupy a variety of habitats including those altered by
management activities and fire and can persist in areas with dispersed or developed summer or winter
recreation activities and are not tied to specific vegetative or geologic habitat features. However, a general
trait of areas occupied is their remoteness from humans and human developments (Fisher, et al., 2013).
Typically, wolverines are associated with backcountry or wilderness, but are known to cross areas of
human habitation (usually at night). Wolverines are opportunistic feeders and consume a variety of foods
depending on availability. They primarily scavenge carrion, but also prey on small animals and birds, and
eat fruit, berries and insects (78 FR 7867).
Deep, persistent, and reliable spring snow cover (April 15 to May 14) is the best overall predictor of
wolverine occurrence in the contiguous United States. Persistent spring snowpack plays a role in food
availability and reproductive denning and the upper limit of thermoneutrality and is concordant with
wolverine occurrence in both the winter and summer (Copeland, et al., 2010; Inman, Magoun, Persson, &
Mattisson, 2012). No records exist of wolverines denning anywhere but in snow, despite the wide
availability of snow-free denning opportunities within the species range (78 FR 7867). The deep,
persistent spring snow layer in the Copeland et al. (2010) model captures all known wolverine dens in the
DPS (78 FR 7868). However, it should be noted that this model depicts areas that are snow covered
through May 15 in at least 1 out of 7 years (79 FR 47534). Additionally, except for denning females
(denning habitat is not considered scarce or limiting to wolverine reproduction), wolverines are
occasionally observed in areas outside the modeled deep, persistent snow zone, and factors beyond snow
cover may play a role in dispersal and overall wolverine distribution (79 FR 47534).
In southwest Montana, females selected natal den sites in glacial cirque basins or at the vegetation/rock
interface at higher elevations and commonly left dependent kits at rendezvous sites comprised of large
boulder talus or riparian areas associated with mature over story and dense deadfall (Copeland, 1996).
Additionally, low-elevation, xeric habitats within ungulate winter range were avoided by radio-marked
wolverines, even though they contained an abundant food source especially during summer when all
elevations >2,400 m were used more than expected (Copeland, et al., 2007). Valley bottom habitat
appears to be used only for dispersal movements and not for foraging or reproduction (78 FR 7868).
Home ranges of adult wolverines in North America range from 100 km² to over 1500 km² (Copeland,
1996; Inman, et al., 2007). The variation of home range sizes among studies is related to differences in
sex, with males ranging further than females, and in the abundance and distribution of food. Home ranges
of adult males and females overlap extensively, with the range of one male covering the ranges of two to
six females. Home ranges of sub adults, especially males, are transitory areas used before dispersal, which
often is over long distances for males. Young females typically establish residency next to or within the
natal home range.
181

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Population Status and Distribution
Wolverines occur naturally in low densities of about one wolverine per 58 square miles, and are difficult
to observe, even within known occupied areas; thus, current population levels and trends are not
definitely known (78 FR 7868). However, there is evidence that their population is increasing (79 FR
47524) and that wolverines are expanding both within areas currently occupied as well as suitable habitat
not currently occupied (79 FR 47536). McKelvey et al. (2011) suggests that wolverine will persist
throughout the species range at least for the first half of the 21st century, but populations will likely
become smaller and more isolated primarily in response to reduced persistent spring snowpack. In
Montana, wolverines were thought nearly extinct by 1920 from over-trapping, then appeared to increase
in number from 1950 to 1980, presumably from reduced trapping seasons on other furbearers and
increased dispersals from Canada (McKelvey, et al., 2014). Today, the wolverine is still considered rare in
distribution and numbers. The last remaining stronghold in the lower 48 states is in western Montana and
parts of Idaho.
Remote, alpine habitats exist in island-like fashion in Southwest Montana, which may provide important
linkage zones between populations (Inman, et al., 2013). The patchy nature of these habitats along with
huge territory requirements and naturally low densities of the species often results in small local
populations (Inman, et al., 2007). Any geographic isolation of wolverines seems unlikely because of their
extensive movements and re-colonization of vacant habitats is not a concern (Banci, 1994).
Habitat and Use of the Analysis Area
While virtually all of the BDNF landscapes have wolverine detections, the Pioneer, Anaconda-Pintler and
North Flint mountains appear to have the most vigorous populations. However, the project area has a
generally moderate quantity of habitat due to limited areas where there is persistent spring snow. The
areas to the south (central Flint Creek Range) contain larger more contiguous habitats (Persistent Spring
Snowpack Map, Attachment F).
Environmental Consequences
Wolverines are not thought to be dependent on specific vegetation or habitat features that might be
manipulated by land management activities; nor is there evidence to suggest that land management
activities are a threat to the conservation of the species. The available scientific information does not
indicate that other potential stressors such as land management, recreation, infrastructure development,
and transportation corridors pose a threat to the DPS based both on the scale of the impacts and the
activities themselves (78 FR 7865).
Trapping mortality (including incidental trapping) undoubtedly can impact local population levels of
wolverine, but in their withdrawal of the proposed ESA listing, the USFWS concluded that based on the
best scientific and commercial information available the mortality level from trapping (including
incidental trapping in Montana and Idaho) is a secondary threat to the wolverine population (79 FR
47522) and currently prohibited. Small population size was also determined to be a secondary threat with
climate change and inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms to climate change identified as primary
threats.

Alternative 1– Direct, Indirect and Cumulative Effects

Because wolverines are not associated with specific vegetation types and continued mortality in lodgepole
pine, declines in aspen or increased Douglas-fir densities are not expected, there will be No Effect to
wolverines.

Alternatives 2 and 3– Direct, Indirect and Cumulative Effects

The findings in the Federal Register clearly show that there is nothing associated with FS management
actions that would create a trend toward Federal listing. Furthermore, the evidence presented suggests that

182

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

FS management actions, at almost any scale, including the FP area where NFMA viability determinations
are made, have very little impact to wolverines. As such, it would be very difficult for the FS to engage in
activities that would represent a loss of viability. The USFWS recognizes 6 categories of impacts to
wolverine habitat (FR at 7874-7877): Climate change, habitat impacts due to human use and disturbance
(including dispersed recreation, permanent infrastructure, transportation corridors, and land management
activities such as forestry), trapping, disease and predation, inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms
to climate change, and small population size. Of these threats considered, disturbance associated with
land management activities such as forestry, or fire/fuels reduction activities is relevant to this project and
the USFWS determined that to not a threat and would not likely jeopardize the continued existence of the
wolverine. Of all the actions, human disturbance in the form of roads and trails has the greatest potential
to affect wolverine movements. Differences between Alternatives 1 & 2 routes, security and secure area
are evaluated in the Habitat Security Section above. Snowmobiling activity may occur during the winter
season; though, preferred persistent spring snow habitat is primarily located within a winter nonmotorized area, thereby reducing risk of snowmobile disturbance to wolverine denning. The action
alternatives would not affect hunting or trapping access and is removed from persistent spring snowpack
located at higher elevations.
Activities may cause short-term avoidance by an individual at higher elevations, but there would be no
long-term changes in wildlife secure areas, connectivity areas, or areas of persistent spring snow from
action alternatives. Wolverines can travel long distances and are not adverse to crossing open spaces;
therefore, if temporarily displaced, they can easily move into the large areas of undisturbed habitat that
surround the project. Proposed actions may affect individuals but are of little consequence due to the
flexibility of habitat use shown by wolverines and their large home range size. Any effects to individual
wolverines caused by this project would not be elevated directly, indirectly, or cumulatively to a level that
would represent a loss of viability.
The determination is based on the following rationale:
•

Forest management activities are not identified by USFWS as a primary or secondary threat

•

Project activities and cumulative actions will result in relatively small-scale disturbances in
relation to the large wolverine home range size and wolverine are able to adjust to and co-exist
with moderate levels of disturbance

•

The project and cumulative effects will not result in barriers to dispersing individuals

Based on the above rational in combination with the environmental baseline, implementation is not likely
to jeopardize the continued existence of the wolverine.
Yellow-billed Cuckoo
The western distinct population segment of the Yellow-billed Cuckoo was listed as Threatened west of the
Continental Divide in Montana under the Endangered Species Act by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
on November 3, 2014 (79 FR 192). In the listing decision, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service noted the
primary factors threatening the western distinct population segment as loss and degradation of habitat for
the species from altered watercourse hydrology and natural stream processes, livestock overgrazing,
encroachment from agriculture, and conversion of native habitat. No critical habitat or special rules were
included in the listing decision (79 FR 192).
Biological Information
The migratory western yellow-billed cuckoo nests almost exclusively in low to moderate elevation
cottonwood-willow riparian habitats that cover 50 acres or more within arid to semiarid landscapes.
Yellow-billed cuckoos may be restricted to these extensive, moist habitats because of humidity
requirements for successful hatching and rearing of young.

183

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Population Status and Distribution
In the northern Great Plains—from the Canada border south through Colorado—the yellow-billed cuckoo
is ‘‘extremely rare and local’’ as a breeding bird both east and west of the Rocky Mountains. While the
species breeds locally in river valleys in southern Idaho, southwestern Wyoming, western Colorado, and
in Utah, it is quite rare or absent within the higher Rocky Mountains. An examination of the distributional
records for the Rocky Mountain region indicates that the area has had few records of yellow-billed
cuckoos and the species is even scarcer at elevations above approximately 6,000 feet and almost never
breeds above 7,000 feet.
In the United States the DPS includes the area west of the Continental Divide, south through Montana,
Wyoming, Colorado, and along the watershed divide between the upper and middle Rio Grande and
Pecos Rivers in New Mexico and Texas, south to Big Bend in southwestern Texas, and extending to the
states of the west coast (ibid.). The project area is located west of the Continental Divide and is
encompassed by the area delineating the western yellow-billed cuckoo DPS.
Habitat and Use of the Project Area
The project area is completely devoid of large expanses of cottonwood/willow galleries preferred by
Yellow-billed cuckoos. There are no known recent or historic sighting records of yellow-billed cuckoos
within the project area or within Granite or Powell counties.
All Alternatives
There are no known recorded occurrences of the species within or adjacent to the project area. The project
area also lacks suitable yellow-billed cuckoo habitat. Therefore, implementation of the project will no
effect on the western DPS of the species.

Species Not Carried Forward For Detailed Analysis
The American peregrine falcon, harlequin duck, Great Basin pocket mouse, northern bog lemming,
pygmy rabbit, and trumpeter swan are not carried forward for further analysis because of lack of suitable
habitat within the analysis area, distance from known locations, or lack of potential impact to the species
or its habitats. This proposal would have “no impact” on these species.
Sage-grouse are only known to occur on the Beaverhead portion of the BDNF. The nearest potential lek is
39 miles south in Soap Gulch south of the Highland Mountains (it was last surveyed in 2004 and
unconfirmed based on FWP data). The project area is well outside of the average 18 km distance used for
nesting. Sage-grouse will not be carried forward for further analysis. This proposal would have no impact
on this species or habitat under any alternative.
Bald Eagle
Biological Information
Bald eagles are associated with aquatic systems including estuaries, large lakes, reservoirs, and major
rivers. In Montana, bald eagle nest sites typically occur around the periphery of lakes and reservoirs >80
acres or in forested corridors within 1mile of major rivers (Wright & Escano, 1986). Bald eagles
demonstrate a remarkable ability to use various habitats, which makes it difficult to identify specific
habitat requirements and nesting behaviors throughout their range. Availability of suitable trees or sites
for nesting, perching, and roosting near open bodies of water is critical for reproductive success.
Human disturbance can temporarily displace bald eagles, causing long-term changes in habitat use, or
appear to have no effect. Responses may vary by individual depending on a number of factors such as
age, sex, breeding status, weather, or topography. Typically, eagles are most sensitive to direct human
disturbance during the nest building, egg-laying and incubation periods (February 1st to May 30th).
186

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Breeding pairs of bald eagles show a high degree of nest-site fidelity (Jenkins & Jackman, 1993). Human
activities in close proximity to the nest may cause abandonment of the nest by the adults causing egg
failure. Once young have hatched, a breeding pair is less likely to abandon the nest. However, eagles may
leave the nest due to prolonged disturbances, exposing young to predation and adverse weather
conditions.
Lead toxicity (or poisoning) has been identified as a concern for a number of bird species, including bald
eagles. Despite a 1991 federal ban on lead shot for waterfowl hunting, lead poisoning remains a problem
for birds through the hundreds of tons of lead deposited in the environment annually by upland game bird
hunting; deer, elk, bear and other mammal hunting; and fishing (Harmata, 2011; Wayland & Bollinger,
1999; Hunt, et al., 2006). In southwest Montana, lead and other contaminants rates have increased since
this ban (Harmata, 2011) and spent ammunition affects a variety of scavengers (Watson & M. Fuller,
2009).
Population Status and Distribution
Bald eagles are now widely distributed across the United States. Montana has the third highest population
in the lower 48 states west of the 100th meridian.
Habitat and Use of the Analysis Area
There is one known nest site along Flint Creek located northwest of the project area. Although no
sightings have been reported, foraging may occur at Flint Creek, which is located approximately 0.9 mile
from proposed treatments. No winter bald eagle observations are reported in proximity to the project area.
The nearest reported nonbreeding or winter occurrence is located along the Clark Fork River,
approximately 5 miles from the project area boundary. Distances of proposed activities to known or
potential bald eagle nest sites exceed distance buffers recommended by the Montana Bald Eagle Working
Group (MBEWG, 2010).
Environmental Consequences

Alternative 1– Direct, Indirect and Cumulative Effects

With ample foraging and nesting potential throughout the analysis area, continued forest succession
would have No Impact to the Bald Eagle

Alternatives 2 and 3– Direct, Indirect and Cumulative Effects

The FP has an objective to consider the Montana Bald Eagle Management Plan, (MBEWG, 2010) and the
Montana Comprehensive Wildlife Conservation Strategy (MFWP, 2005). These plans provide guidance
for management activities around active nest sites or communal roost sites including seasonal restrictions
and buffers. There are not any known eagle nests or roosts in the project area, though nesting does occur
on the Flint Creek. Implementation of this project and reasonably foreseeable activities would not cause
an increase in the amount of housing development, road construction, logging, or hunting all factors that
increase the risk of eagle disturbance or mortality through various eagle/human interactions or
introduction of contaminants. No large trees or snags (>20” dbh) would be removed through proposed
actions. The project would not affect available habitat around lakes, rivers, or ponds in the analysis area.
Changes in ungulate carcass recruitment would be minimal and not likely to influence eagle use in those
units given available foraging throughout the Flint Creek corridor. The preferred alternative would have
no direct or indirect impacts; thus, no cumulative impacts. Therefore, No Impact on the bald eagle or its
habitat is anticipated from either action alternative.

Bighorn Sheep
Biological Information
Bighorn sheep are adapted to a wide variety of habitats but three elements are essential to quality habitat:
(1) escape terrain; (2) high visibility; and (3) winter ranges in low-elevation, south-facing slopes, with
escape cover in close proximity to foraging areas (MFWP, 2010). Bighorn sheep forage opportunistically
with few exceptions, utilizing forbs heavily in the spring when they are readily available. As forbs
desiccate during summer, diets switch to more grass and grass-like plants.
Population Status and Distribution
The overarching threat to maintaining healthy bighorn sheep populations is disease transmission from
domestic sheep (WAFWA, 2010). Montana had approximately 5,700 bighorn sheep prior to the die-offs
that began in 2009. The winter 2009-2010 Montana die-offs in Rock Creek to the west and Lost Creek to
the east were all disease related (MBEWG, 2010). While there are an estimated 1,299 domestic sheep in
Granite and Powell counties, there are no FS sheep allotments anywhere on the Deerlodge portion of the
BDNF. The location of domestic sheep operations in the county is not specified. Bighorn sheep is
considered S4-Apparently secure, though it may be quite rare in parts of its range, and/or suspected to be
declining.
Habitat and Use of the Analysis Area
The Garrison herd utilizes a core area containing winter range and lambing habitat on private lands
located about 3 miles east of the project area. The core area is separated from mountainous terrain on the
BDNF by open intermountain grasslands and gradual benches descending from the Flint Creek Range
(MFWP 2010). Occurrence of some ram groups and a few yews is reported for the higher mountains and
rams have also been found in the western portion of the project area above Maxville and south of the
project area at Powell Mine demonstrating long exploratory movements into the Flint Creek Range. The
herd was first reported in the 1980s. As of 2008, the herd was estimated to total 65 animals (MFWP
2010). This population did not experience a die-off event in the winter of 2009-2010 (WAFWA 2010).
About 18,000 acres of mapped bighorn sheep distribution occur within the project area.
Risk factors identified for Garrison bighorn sheep herd include exposure to disease in domestic sheep and
goats, forest succession or woody plant encroachment into former grasslands or shrub grasslands,
development, and noxious weeds (MFWP 2010).
Environmental Consequences

Alternative 1 – Direct, Indirect and Cumulative Effects

Existing condition of bighorn sheep habitats in the project area are partially a function of past activities.
Past road development has decreased wildlife security; wildfire suppression has allowed conifer
encroachment into potential foraging habitats. Continued forest succession in this marginal habitat will
have No Impact to bighorn sheep.

Alternatives 2 and 3– Direct, Indirect & Cumulative Effects

While proposed treatments are located within the distribution of bighorn sheep, units are located in forest
environments, outside suitable bighorn sheep habitats. There may be slight improvement on potential
foraging habitat through opening of the stands. Project activities would not contribute to risk of disease
transmission from domestic livestock. There is potential for disturbance if a bighorn happens to move
through when treatment occurs, but the potential for disturbance is low, and the duration would be shortterm.
Actions that might affect bighorn sheep and/or habitats within the project area are livestock grazing, weed
control, and wildfire suppression. All FS allotments are under a rest-rotation grazing system. Appropriate
188

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

grazing management will be achieved through implementation of the FP that states, “Use of forage by
domestic livestock will maintain or enhance the desired structure and diversity of plant communities on
grasslands, shrub lands, and forests. Use will be managed to maintain riparian function as defined in the
allotment management plan”. There are no domestic sheep allotments on the Deerlodge portion of the
BDNF. Continued treatment of existing weed infestations is expected to benefit habitat suitability for
bighorn sheep. Wildfire suppression would reduce the potential for mortality of conifers encroaching into
suitable foraging habitats.

Summary of Effects

Activities associated with the project may cause short-term avoidance by individuals, but there would be
no long-term changes in secure areas or measurable changes habitat suitability. Implementation of either
action alternative May Impact Individuals or Habitat, but will not likely result in a trend toward federal
listing or reduced viability of the population or species.
Black-backed Woodpecker
Biological Information
Black-backed woodpeckers are primary cavity nesters, excavating their own cavities in April and May,
often in dead or dying conifers. Mature and old-growth coniferous forests with decadent trees, snags and
fallen logs are important to provide heart-rot in trees and snags for nests and roosts. The young depart
from the nest from early June through early July.
They are highly responsive to forest fire (Rota, Millspaugh, Rumble, Lehman, & Kesler, 2014) and other
disturbance processes, such as spruce budworm or mountain pine beetle outbreaks, resulting in high
concentrations of wood-boring beetles occur (Arnett, Altman, & Erickson, 1997a; Arnett, Altman, &
Erickson, 1997b; Dixon & Saab, 2000; Murphy & Lehnhausen, 1998). Post-burn area studies in Oregon,
Montana, Idaho, and South Dakota consistently report that wood-boring beetles that occur in abundance
(2 to 8 years) following a fire are an important food source for the woodpecker; and insect outbreak
studies (without fire) suggest the species is attracted to food abundance (summarized in Samson 2006a).
Conversely, the black-backed also appears in relatively undisturbed, live forests (Ibarzabal & Desmeules,
2006; Harris, 1999). In fact, Hoyt and Hannon (2002) reported black-backs in old forest stands long
distances from any burned areas, further suggesting the species is not “restricted” to post-burn areas.
Population Status and Distribution
The black-backed woodpecker breeds from central Alaska and northern Canada south to the mountainous
regions of California, Wyoming, Black Hills, upper Great Lakes and New England states and into
Newfoundland.
Tree mortality caused by insects, disease, and fire are ecological processes that are important for blackbacked woodpeckers. These processes operate at relatively large scales both in time and in space due to
factors such as climate. The species itself is adapted to irruptive movements over large distances to new
sources of habitat. This suggests that a viability strategy for the black-backed woodpecker should be
regional in scale; that distribution of habitat is not a limiting factor; and that lack of habitat in the BDNF
at some points in time would not impair the viability of the species as a whole if such habitat existed
elsewhere.
Black-backed habitat has increased across the Region in the last decade due to fire and insect outbreaks.
Habitat on the BDNF is approximately 13.4 times the amount needed to meet the threshold for viability
across the entire Northern Region (Bush and Lundberg 2008).

189

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Bonn et al. (2007) summarized Key Findings: (1) populations appear to be increasing in the United
States; (2) habitat is abundant and well-distributed across the Region and by Forest; (3) habitat has
recently increased and is expected to continue to increase as fires and outbreaks continue; (4) the level of
salvage timber harvest is insignificant across the Region; and (5) the amount of habitat required for a
minimum viable population compared to that available indicates that it far exceeds that needed, given the
natural distribution of the species and their habitat.
Habitat and Use of the Analysis Area
Within the project area, virtually all of the lodgepole pine stands 5 inches or greater dbh have been
affected by mountain pine beetle, with the outbreak first starting in 2007 (Vegetation section). Though
insects continue to work the area, the infested trees become less valuable as a food source for blackbacked woodpeckers after 5 years and will eventually fall. There have been no wildfires in the project
area in suitable habitats within the last 10 years. There have been no confirmed observations of blackbacked woodpeckers in the project area during field reviews, though three-toed woodpeckers were
detected.
Environmental Consequences

Alternative 1– Direct, Indirect and Cumulative Effects

Continued infestations of mountain pine beetle (and other insects) would provide foraging and nesting
habitat in the short-term. However, after a few years, the dead trees no longer provide habitat for beetles
(once the wood is dried out) and foraging habitat would decline. Dead lodgepole pine trees would
eventually fall (5-15 years). While local reductions in foraging habitat may occur over time, adequate
amounts of potential habitat are expected to remain available at the landscape scale in the long-term.
Based on projected habitat availability, this alternative would have No Impact on this species or habitat.

Alternatives 2 and 3– Direct, Indirect & Cumulative Effects

Prescribed burning treatments of mid-elevation conifers have the potential to increase snag presence.
Crown mortality in patches up to 20 acres in size is the objective on about 40 percent of treatment units
providing black-backed woodpecker habitat. Direct effects to woodpeckers are possible during prescribed
burning from smoke and possibly loss of nest trees. Mechanized ground disturbing activities will occur
outside of the breeding season. Habitat within mid-elevation burn units is expected to improve for about
five years where tree mortality provides nesting structure and an influx of prey species. Given that blackbacked woodpeckers appear in low densities in unburned habitats, and none were documented surveys,
the chance of direct effects is low. If a nest is found, a timing restriction during the breeding season would
be implemented; June 1 – August 15 to prevent nests, eggs, or nestlings from being destroyed (Bonnot,
2006).
It is recommended to retain snags <9” dbh at about 42-50 snags per acre after harvest (Dixon & Saab,
2000; Wisdom, et al., 2000). Within the regeneration (seed tree) harvest, 47 >15” dbh snags per acre will
be retained for snag recruitment (PDFs). However, snag retention is below these recommendations in the
salvage units. Salvage of lodgepole pine would occur on approximately 5 percent of potential habitat
(including spruce-fir) with both action alternatives with about 100 less acres salvaged in Alternative 3.
Salvage of these dead and dying trees (snags) would reduce foraging or nesting habitat within the units, as
the only lodgepole pine trees to be retained would be those larger than 15 inches dbh (and other species).
In a study of black-backed woodpeckers in the Black Hills, Bonnot (2006) found that recent occurrence of
salvage logging near a nest site did not appear to affect nest survival. Greater than 50 percent of the nests
observed were in areas where logging had occurred within the last 5 years.
Effects of past timber management actions on mature forests are represented in existing condition
described in the vegetation report. About 80% of the forested portions on private inholdings have been

190

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

harvested in the 1980s. It is not known whether additional acres of private harvest would occur; however,
comparatively little forest exists outside of the FS administered boundary and private inholdings.
Of the actions listed in appendix D, firewood cutting and hazard tree removal are mostly likely to affect
snag availability. Hazard tree removal at developed sites would continue until the hazards are abated.
Personal use firewood gathering by the public would continue based on the BDNF firewood permit
system and could increase as a result of timber harvest (Wisdom & Bate, 2008). With the recent mountain
pine beetle mortality, firewood cutting has increased resulting in loss of snags for wildlife habitat. As the
beetle mortality spreads, more trees will be killed and available for firewood, where accessible along
roadway corridors. There have been no wildfires in suitable habitat in the project area within the last 10
years and preferred post-fire habitats within the project area are lacking.
Cumulatively, treatments proposed in lodgepole pine under this project in addition to ongoing and
foreseeable hazard tree removal and firewood cutting equates to approximately 10 percent of mid- to lateseral lodgepole pine, leaving approximately 90 percent of the host stands as potential habitat. Habitat for
black-backed woodpeckers would remain widespread and abundant, as long MPB (and secondary beetles
such as woodborers) are present.

Summary of Effects

Proposed harvest treatments would remove small amounts of existing foraging habitat, while burning may
also provide additional nesting habitat through creation of snags. Snags would be retained in treated areas
according to FP direction. Habitat for the woodpecker has increased dramatically in the last decade.
Unsalvaged potential habitat would continue to be widespread and abundant in the project area, as well as
Forest-wide and Region-wide. Based on the above, implementation of the action alternatives May
Impact Individuals or Habitat but will not likely result in a trend toward federal listing or reduced
viability of the population or species.
Fisher
Biological Information
Fishers prefer a variety of late-successional mesic forests with canopy cover greater than 40 percent
(Bush & Lundberg, 2008). Horizontal cover in the form of riparian areas, fallen logs, stumps, and
seedlings, shrubs and herbaceous cover is important for habitat suitability. Fishers clearly avoid nonforested areas, large forest openings, recent salvages, and areas above timberline (Schwartz et al. 2006).
Dens are found in dead or living tree cavities and in hollow logs. Fishers appear to be restricted to areas
with relatively low snow accumulation (Ruggerio, Aubry, Buskirk, Lyon, & Zielinski, 1994). Fisher home
range size for females average about 6,000 acres in the Rocky Mountains (Schwartz, Ulizio, & Jimenez,
2006), with the project area accommodating several home ranges.
Population Status and Distribution
The present range of fishers is reduced from pre-European settlement times predominantly due to trapping
and habitat loss with the BDNF is at the southernmost fringe of Montana’s population. Mesic forests are
inherently rare on the BDNF (ERG 2010). Stands comprising potential habitat are largely within the
spruce/fir cover types and are not vulnerable to mountain pine beetle. Modeling indicates there is little
habitat capability to support long-term fisher persistence in the BDNF (USFS, 2014).
Habitat and Use of the Analysis Area
Much of the larger diameter lodgepole pine trees are dead or dying due to MPB activity. Stands are
currently very open with little understory vegetation and are being converted to early-successional stages,
limiting habitat suitability. Because much of the lodgepole pine forest is already converting to earlysuccessional stages, it would be more than one hundred years before a mature, dense, high canopy cover

191

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

forest reoccupies those sites. Currently, the stands likely suitable for fishers consist of Douglas-fir and
subalpine fir 10 inches dbh or greater with canopy closures greater than or equal to 40 percent. Mesic
forests types along riparian corridors occur in small patches throughout the project area. About 15 percent
of the project area is modeled potential habitat (USFS, 2014).
In 1959 fisher were released at Moose Lake on the Pintler RD, but have not been confirmed on the BDNF
since. Fisher hare-snare surveys (Schwartz, Ulizio, & Jimenez, 2006) were completed across the northern
portion of the BDNF in 2007, 2008, and 2010; however, no fishers have been confirmed. Due to the low
number of verified records for the BDNF despite surveys, the project’s distance from the last relocation
efforts (32 miles to the south at Moose Lake) and lack of records for the BDNF, it is unlikely that fishers
are established in the project area.
Environmental Consequences

Alternative 1– Direct, Indirect and Cumulative Effects

Because fisher presence is unlikely and habitat conditions in proposed units are marginal to unsuitable
and are not expected to improve until far beyond the temporal scale of this analysis (100 years), there
would be No Impact to fisher or fisher habitat

Alternatives 2 and 3– Direct, Indirect & Cumulative Effects

Douglas-fir and lodgepole pine stands proposed for thinning are largely in a stand initiation stage that is
currently lacking complex understories and is not suitable fisher habitat. The salvage units will have less
horizontal cover in the form of downed jackstraw pine; however, lodgepole pine is not a preferred forest
type. Several treatments will create openings that fisher avoid; the lack of dense downed log
accumulations within treatment units would reduce stand-level suitability. However, forested cover is
available outside these units and connectivity will be maintained at the landscape scale.
Subalpine fir and spruce provide the most suitable structure and composition to provide habitat for fisher
and are not targeted for treatment. Prescribed burning in mid-elevation mixed conifer stands may
incidentally remove small patches of subalpine fir; however, healthy mature subalpine fir is a minor
component of forest composition, will be retained where possible, and is available outside of proposed
units. A mechanized seasonal operating restriction is included to minimize direct effects to potentially
denning animals; however, the prescribed burning may negatively affect individuals, especially during
denning season. Maintaining a patch mosaic of forested age classes will improve resilience in the longterm.
Past fire suppression has led to present day dense stands of Douglas-fir estimated to exceed historical
amounts. There are no ongoing or foreseeable projects that are expected to affect availability of mature
Douglas-fir or subalpine fir stands. Most firewood cutting occurs in lodgepole pine (abundant and easier
to cut and split). Wildfire suppression at lower elevations where most Douglas-fir stands occur decreases
the potential for loss of dense habitat structure, but maintains uncharacteristic fire return intervals in
stands where long-term sustainability of dense forest structure may not be possible. Given the lack of
known fisher occurrence, trapping is unlikely. Cumulative effects of the reduced canopy closure under the
action alternatives combined with direct and indirect effects are expected to be minor and not
quantifiable.

Summary of Effects

The potential for fisher occurrence within the project area is low. Both action alternatives would treat
mixed conifer stands with interspersed subalpine fir resulting in modest reductions in available habitat
post-treatment. However, treatments are anticipated to improve overall forest resiliency, benefiting a
variety of forest dwelling wildlife. A change in trapping is unlikely due to no change in access. Therefore,

192

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

activities proposed under both action alternatives May Impact Individuals or Habitat, but will not
likely result in a trend toward federal listing or reduced viability of the population or species.
Flammulated Owl
Biological Information
Flammulated owls prefer low to mid-elevation montane forests with low to moderate canopy closure, a
large trees and snags with cavities (commonly pileated woodpecker and Northern flicker) for nesting
(McCallum, 1994). Although older ponderosa pine forests appear to be favored (Linkhart, Reynolds, &
Ryder, 1998), they have also been found breeding in older Douglas-fir forest types and other forest types
to lesser degree (Reynolds & Linkhart, 1992; Dunham, Butcher, Charlet, & Reed, 1996; Powers, et al.,
1996), including quaking aspen stands (McCallum, 1994; Marti, 1997). Flammulated owls are long-lived
(Linkhart & Reynolds, 2004), have high mate (Arsenault, Stacey, & Hoelzer, 2002) and site fidelity
(Linkhart & Reynolds, 2007) and will use the same cavity for several years. They appear to require
relatively open areas, or patches of openings for foraging proximate to dense patches of usually younger
trees or dense foliage (e.g., mistletoe) for roosting (Goggans, 1986) with a home range average from 25 to
47 acres.
Flammulated owls are found where there is an abundance of nocturnal arthropod prey, specifically
noctuids, which are large, cold-hardy nocturnal moths that appear more abundant in spring and summer
than other arthropods (McCallum, 1994; Hayward & Verner, 1994; Powers, et al., 1996). There is also
evidence that these moths are more abundant in ponderosa pine/Douglas fir forests than in other western
conifer forest types (Reynolds & Linkhart, 1987; McCallum, 1994).
A habitat modeling study in the Kamloops area of British Columbia in Douglas-fir/ponderosa pine forest
type found three variables to be significant predictors for owl occupation: elevation (between 2,800 and
3,800 feet), age class (older stands), and 40 to 50 percent canopy closure (Christie & vanWoudenberg,
1997).
Population Status and Distribution
Flammulated owls inhabit mountainous forests of western North America and are “perhaps the most
common raptor of the montane forests of the western United States.” (McCallum, 1994). The species is
considered globally secure, though rare in distribution in some areas (G4). Little to no population trend
information is available for flammulated owls on the BDNF.
Habitat and Use of the Analysis Area
ERG (2010) estimated that at the Forest-scale only 4 percent of forested acres meet the criteria as suitable
for this species. The greatest amount of ponderosa pine on the BDNF occurs west of the Continental
Divide in the Northern Flint Creek Range, where a group of singing males were documented during the
summer of 1995, and in the northern John Long Mountains where a group of singing males were also
documented in 1995 and again in 2004. The Regional Landbird Program surveyed the BDNF in 2005
with additional detections recorded in the Pioneer, Highlands, Tobacco Roots, and Gravelly landscapes
(Cilimburg, 2006). They have also been documented nesting in Douglas-fir at low to mid elevations
throughout the BDNF (MNHP, 2015). Flammulated owl surveys were conducted during the summers of
2010 and 2011 in the project area. Detections were recorded in or adjacent to units 1ST, 20C, 23C, 24C,
and 25C.

193

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Environmental Consequences

Alternative 1– Direct, Indirect & Cummulative Effects

Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine stands would continue to increase in density and canopy layering, shading
out grasses and small shrubs, which support the owl's prey species. In addition, the typical hawk-like
foraging maneuvers of the owl may be difficult in such structure.
Where the stands are densest, individual trees may die from competition or insects. Over time, canopy
gaps would fill in and result in a decline of other species (aspen, shrubs, herbaceous vegetation). Higher
stand densities and development of ladder fuels would increase the risk of wildfire, bark beetle
infestations, and in some areas, successional replacement by shade-tolerant competitors. Existing old
growth may be reduced due conversion from multi-story to single story, with large ponderosa pine trees
potentially becoming scarce with some stands falling out of old-growth status without treatment within 50
years (Vegetation section). It is expected that under the no-action alternative, mortality in overstocked
Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine would continue at an increasing rate given the current trend in local
climatic conditions coupled with the existing dense and multi-layered stand conditions (Vegetation
section). Habitat is predicted to continue to decline in the Clark Fork-Flints landscape in both the short
and long-term (ERG 2010).
Based on predicted trend for reduced habitat availability, the no-action alternative May Impact
Individuals or Habitat but will not likely result in a trend toward federal listing or reduced viability of
the population or species.

Alternatives 2 and 3– Direct, Indirect & Cumulative Effects

Surveys documented flammulated owl presence in and adjacent to several proposed treatment units.
Flammulated owls are very tolerant of humans, nesting close to occupied areas and nest abandonment is
rare (McCallum, 1994). A limiting mechanized operating period has been included in the design of this
project to minimize direct effects to breeding birds. If logging operations occur before August 15, surveys
will be conducted to locate nests. Direct negative impacts to individuals may occur from the prescribed
burning during implementation through smoke disturbance; however, large trees that could potentially
have nests are not targeted by the low intensity under burn. If a nest is found, an operating restriction
from May 15– August 15 in a 35 acre buffer around the nest would be applied to protect post-fledging
area when owlets can still be found in the vicinity of the nest (See PDFs). Project implementation may
disturb individuals outside of the critical nesting period during implementation; however, it is expected
that the long-term benefits of improving resiliency will outweigh the short-term potential disturbance
cause by project implementation.
Commercial thinning and prescribed burning in stands classified as old growth under alternative 2 would
result in widely-spaced (20- 50% canopy cover), large diameter trees with small trees primarily occurring
in clumps. Average diameters for these stands would more than double. While thinning treatments are
expected to improve nesting and foraging habitats in stands with canopy closures exceeding 35 percent,
some roosting habitat in the form of dense multi-storied forest patches would be removed but will remain
available adjacent untreated stands. Alternative 3 would provide about 500 fewer acres of stand opening
through thinning. Additional mature large trees would be retained to perpetuate large trees on the site;
providing large snag recruitment potential. Prescribed fire would stimulate re-growth of senesced grass,
herb and shrub understory communities, and increase vigor for the remaining conifers. Commercial
treatments would retain all green trees greater than 20 inches dbh and would maintain the snag component
according to FP standards. Opening of the stand and invigorating the understory will improve foraging
and nesting conditions while retaining proximate roosting habitat.
Seed tree treatments would result in very open stands with canopy closures below levels identified as
suitable, thereby removing less than 4 percent potentially suitable habitat on under both action
alternatives. However, treatments would retain ponderosa pine presence and provide for development of
194

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

suitable nesting and foraging habitat in the long-term. The long-term benefits of maintaining Douglas-fir
and Ponderosa pine forest types outweigh the short-term indirect effects of lost canopy closure in this
treatment type.
Effects from not treating old-growth in Alternative 3 are expected to be the same as the no action
alternative; Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine and aspen stands would continue to increase in density and
canopy layering, thereby reducing available flammulated owl foraging habitat within those units.
However, given the small scale of dropped habitat improvement units in Alternative 3, effects are
expected to be comparable to the preferred alternative.
Past actions consisting primarily of fire suppression, and to a lesser extent logging of mature Douglas-fir,
have led to reduced amounts of open and moderately dense Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine that
constitutes suitable flammulated owl habitat. There are no ongoing or reasonably foreseeable future
projects that would measurably affect mature Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine stands. Hazard tree removal
at developed sites and most firewood cutting occur primarily in lodgepole pine. Both spruce budworm
and Douglas-fir beetle would continue to cause mortality in the mature Douglas-fir stands. Some level of
snags provides habitat within these stands, but at some point, the loss of live canopy cover would
decrease suitability of the stand (when live canopy cover is less than 35 percent). The forested habitat on
private land is comparatively minor to what exists on public land and snag and timber management are
not expected to cumulatively affect available quality Douglas-fir habitat.
Continued wildfire suppression would reduce the potential for low or moderate-intensity fires that may
enhance structural suitability, but would also reduce the potential for high-intensity stand replacing
wildfires that would remove existing suitable flammulated owl habitat in both treated and non-treated
areas. Proposed thinning treatments would open stands and increase suitability, thereby counteracting the
negative impacts of wildfire suppression on a relatively small portion (20 percent) of Douglas-fir stands.
Implementing the forest-wide aspen treatment project will improve habitat, especially if done at a large
scale. The cumulative effects of the thinning treatments and continued wildfire suppression on suitable
habitat are not easily quantifiable because suppression also reduces risk of stand-replacement fires with
potential to remove habitat. The untreated units in Alternative 3 will have effects similar to the no-action
alternative.
Summary of Effects for Alternatives 2 and 3
Treatments are expected to improve and retain old-growth characteristics and improve overall resiliency
in both the short and long-term; thereby reversing the trend described for the no-action alternative where
existing old-growth stands will lose multi-storied old growth characteristics. However, without additional
future disturbances that approximate the natural fire intervals of the past (i.e. low intensity fire every 20
years on average), stands would revert to conditions reducing available flammulated owl habitat as
described in the no-action alternative. Alternative 3 would treat approximately 200 acres less of oldgrowth resulting in a trajectory of conversion to a non-old growth status. Given treatments are anticipated
to improve habitat in both the short and long-term and direct effects are minimized through design
features, implementation of either action alternative will have a May Impact Individuals or Habitat, but
will not likely result in a trend toward federal listing or reduced viability of the population or species.
Gray Wolf
Biological Information
Gray wolves are habitat generalists. They generally use areas that lack human disturbance (corresponding
to low road densities) and have abundant prey (primarily elk). In Montana, deer, elk and moose make up
the majority of wolf diets. Smaller mammals can be an important alternative to large game in the snowfree months. Wolves die from a variety of causes: malnutrition, disease, injuries, and interpack

195

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

aggression; however, human factors accounted for 87 percent of reported wolf mortality in southwestern
Montana based on carcass analysis from 2007-2010 (Sime, et al., 2011).
Packs generally consist of a socially dominant pair, their offspring of the previous year, and new pups.
Pack size varies and may include as few as 3 and as many as 37. Breeding usually occurs only between
the dominant pair. Young are born in late April in an underground burrow that has been abandoned by
other mammals or dug by wolves. Young vacate the den when they are about 3 months old and move to a
series of rendezvous sites throughout the packs territory. Pack activity is centered around the den site and
nearby rendezvous sites from late April until September.
Population Status and Distribution
The gray wolf has been delisted under the ESA, are now on the sensitive species list, and is now subject
to hunting and trapping as regulated by MFWP. Populations have continually increased in Montana in the
face of multiple use activities across Federal, State, and Private (Bradley, et al., 2014). By the end of
2013, there were approximately 26 packs in the Montana portion of the Central Idaho experiment area,
which encompasses the project.
Habitat and Use of the Analysis Area
The Flint Creek wolf pack was first documented in 2007. Its territory is located at the north end of the
Flint Creek Range. The pack contained at least two wolves, not identified as a breeding pair. Sightings in
2010 were reported from the prison ranch area west of Deer Lodge through Gold Creek and Douglas
Creek. No depredations have been attributed to this pack (Sime et al. 2011). The analysis area provides
year-long habitat for elk, along with a diversity of alternate prey species.
Environmental Consequences
The FP has an objective to consider the Northern Rocky Mountain Gray Wolf Recovery Plan, (USFWS,
1987). Measures for potential effects to wolves include sufficient year round prey base (elk), suitable and
somewhat secluded denning and rendezvous sites (wet meadows), and sufficient space with minimal
exposure to humans (secure areas). There are no known den or rendezvous sites in the project area and
this measure will not be addressed further.

Alternative 1– Direct, Indirect and Cumulative Effects

Wolves are not tied to particular vegetation types or structure. The continued succession in absence of
treatment pose No Impact to the gray wolves.

Alternatives 2 and 3 - Direct, Indirect and Cumulative Effects

Wolves are not associated with particular forest stand structures, so the vegetation treatment proposed will
not result in impacts to gray wolves. In addition, no negative impacts to prey species are expected as a
result of project activities. Most big game species are present across the project area, including elk, mule
deer and moose, providing a year-round prey base for wolves. See the elk analysis in the MIS section for
more information on prey base.
Road density is assumed a direct index of potential for human caused mortality. Currently OMRTD
direction is being met on both the HU and the landscape scales at 1.4 mi/mi2. The action alternatives
would not result in increased OMRTD post-project and would remain consistent with FP guidance (See
Security Habitat section). Implementation of this proposal might include disturbance effects (temporary
displacement) due to increased traffic, human activity, and equipment use during project activities.

Summary of Effects

Some activities are proposed in secure areas; however, given the abundant adjacent secure habitat and
wolves’ ability to move great distances, impacts during project implementation are expected to be

196

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

temporary and inconsequential. Neither action alternative would increase wolf/human interactions in the
long-term, impact key wolf habitat components, and would maintain the wolf prey base (see elk section
below). Therefore, the preferred alternative May Impact Individuals or Habitat, but will not likely
result in a trend in federal listing or reduced viability for the Gray wolf.
Spotted Bat
Biological Information
The spotted bat is a large insectivorous bat that primarily forages on noctuid moths and sometimes beetles
(Easterla & Whitaker, 1972; Wai-Ping & Fenton, 1989). Key habitat components required by all bat
species are roost, forage, and water features. Spotted bats are most often associated with cliffs and rocky
outcrops; though they are also found in caves, buildings and trees (Rabe, Siders, Miller, & Snow, 1998b;
Sherwin & Gannon, 2005; Hester & Grenier, 2005; Bradley, O’Farrel, Williams, & Newmark, 2006; Luce
& Keinath, 2007).They are most often associated with semi-arid habitats; but are not restricted to
particular vegetation types as they have been reported in coniferous forest to desert scrub, to alpine
meadows (Luce & Keinath, 2007; Rodhouse, McCaffrey, & Wright, 2005; Geluso, 2000; Harvey,
Altenbach, & Best, 1999; Navo, Gore, & Skiba, 1992; Worthington, 1991; Wai-Ping & Fenton, 1989;
Pierson & Rainey, 1998a; Rabe, Morrell, Green, deVos, & Miller, 1998a). With this apparent
indiscriminant use of vegetation types, structural features likely contribute to determining preferred
habitat. Roosting habitat in the form of cliffs and rocky crevices is thought to be the primary limiting
factor in determining distribution (Pierson & Rainey, 1998a; Luce & Keinath, 2007).
Spotted bats show fidelity to roosts and foraging routes (Wai-Ping & Fenton, 1989; Harvey, Altenbach, &
Best, 1999). Given this fidelity, there is some evidence that suggests the spotted bat is sensitive to even
minimal human disturbance though failure to return to sites of capture (Luce & Keinath, 2007).
Population Status and Distribution
Spotted bats are rare, yet widely distributed across western North America (Fenton, Tennant, & Wyszecki,
1987; Navo, Gore, & Skiba, 1992). This species ranges statewide, but there is virtually nothing known of
its abundance, movement, and roost site selection in Montana (MNHP, 2015). Of 21 acoustic surveys
conducted in 2007 by R1 bat program across the BDNF, three yielded spotted bat detections on the Dillon
and Wise River Ranger Districts. In 2008, additional surveys were conducted across the BDNF and no
spotted bats were captured. However, advances in acoustic detection technology and deployment of longterm detectors across the Region have resulted in a significant increase in detections (MNHP 2015)
Habitat and Use of the Analysis Area
Numerous short cliffs, talus slopes and small rock outcroppings provide spotted bat roosting habitat.
Riparian foraging habitat is available and well-distributed throughout the analysis area.
Environmental Consequences

Alternative 1– Direct, Indirect and Cumulative Effects

Given their indiscriminant use of vegetation, continued forest succession under the No Action alternative
would have No Impact to the spotted bat.

Alternatives 2 and 3– Direct, Indirect & Cumulative Effects

All activities associated with the project would occur during the day; therefore, any bats that may use the
project area at night would not be disturbed. Smoke from prescribed burning could displace roosting bats
during implementation and may temporarily disrupt insect population (attract or discourage); however,
because prescribed burning will occur during the spring and fall, outside of critically breeding and
hibernation seasons, effects to roost sites will be reduced.

197

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Summary of Effects

No spotted bats have been detected in the project area. Activity would not occur during foraging hours
and roosting disturbance is temporary. Because nearby cliffs capable of supporting seasonal roosting
could be subjected to disturbance from smoke, the preferred alternative May Impact Individuals or
Habitat, but Will Not Likely Result in a Trend in Federal Listing or Reduced Viability for the spotted bat
population or species.
Townsend’s Big-eared Bat
Biological Information
The Townsend’s big-eared bat requires spacious cavern-like structures for roosting during all stages of its
life cycle (Pierson & Rainey, 1998b). Typically, they roost in caves and mines, but have also been
documented in large tree hollows, attics, buildings, and under bridges (Fellers & Pierson, 2002; Adam &
Hayes, 2000; Hendricks & Kampwerth, 2001; Reid, Hill, Clarke, Gwilliam, & Krebs, 2010).
Temperatures within roosting structures are particularly important, as well as roost dimensions, amount
and sizes of openings, light quantity, extent of airflow Invalid source specified. and distance to
ephemeral water source (Gillies, Murphy, & Matocq, 2014). Hibernacula occur in caves or mines with
stable, cold temperatures and moderate airflow at temperatures between -2° and 13° C (summarized in
(Pierson, et al., 1999). Maternity colonies occur in warm areas of caves, mines, or occasionally buildings.
Summer maternity and winter hibernating colonies range in size from a few to several hundred
individuals. Males appear to remain solitary during the maternity period while the sexes intermix during
hibernation. Roost fidelity is high with individuals often returning to the same site or group of sites year
after year (Pierson, et al., 1999; Sherwin, Ganon, & Altenbach, 2003).
Beyond the constraint for cavernous roosts, habitat associations become less well defined. Townsend’s
big-eared bat is a moth specialist with over 90 percent of its diet composed of lepidopterans usually taken
in the air, often near foliage, with a few reports of gleaning directly from foliage (Whitaker, Maser, &
Cross, 1981; Ober & Hayes, 2008). Although Townsend’s big-eared bat forages in a variety of habitat
types, its flight and echolocation style makes it well suited to forage among the canopies, along streams
and along the edges of a variety of wooded habitat (Christy & West, 1993). This species typically does not
use large clear-cuts or regenerating stands in early seral stages (Gruver & Keinath, 2006).
During the summer months, bats are most active during the crepuscular periods of the day and often travel
larges distances while foraging, including movements of over 150 kilometers during a single evening
(Piaggio, 2009).
Population Status and Distribution
Townsend’s big-eared bats range throughout the west, from southern British Columbia south along the
Pacific Coast to central Mexico, east to the Great Plains. Elevations range from sea level to nearly 11,000
feet. The species is known to occur throughout Montana, although the complete range extent within the
State is unknown. Globally, the species is ranked as secure (G4), but is classified “at risk” (S2) in
Montana due to rarity of occurrence and specialized habitat needs.
Habitat and Use of the Analysis Area
General habitat associations include coniferous forest, mixed forest, deserts, prairies, riparian
communities, active agricultural areas, and coastal habitat types (WBWG 2005). The project area contains
no known caves, but does include known abandoned lode mine sites and old buildings, potentially
providing suitable roost habitat. Several of these sites are located within units proposed for treatment.
Potential foraging habitat consisting of a wide range of forest, riparian and non-forested vegetation types
is distributed throughout the project area. Larger snags (greater than 15 inches dbh) are present within the
project area, estimated to occur at a rate of less than 2.9 per acre.

198

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Environmental Consequences

Alternative 1– Direct, Indirect and Cumulative Effects

Given their indiscriminant use of vegetation, continued forest succession under the No Action alternative
would have No Impact to Townsend’s big-eared bat.

Alternatives 2 and 3– Direct, Indirect & Cumulative Effects

Abandoned mines that are large enough to maintain contestant temperatures and offer suitable roost
habitat typically have some form of wooden structure to support the opening. Heritage PDFs protecting
these structures will also protect potential roost habitat. Smoke from prescribed burning could displace
roosting bats during implementation and may temporarily disrupt insect population (attract or
discourage); however, because prescribed burning will occur during the spring and fall, outside of
critically breeding and hibernation seasons, effects to roost sites will be reduced.
To a lesser extent, Townsend’s big-eared bat roosting may also occur in snags and large hollow trees.
Commercial thinning treatments would decrease stand densities, thereby accelerating future tree growth.
This would also reduce the potential for tree mortality due to insects and disease, wildfire, and growth
suppression. While total snag numbers generated in a thinned stand may be less than an un-thinned stand,
snags in the thinned stand are more likely to be larger. Alternative 3 would thin about 500 fewer acres and
these stands will continue toward single-storied less resilient stand characteristics. Direct effects to tree
and snag-roosting bats by timber harvest activities are reduced because all trees larger than 20 inches dbh
would be retained. The frequency of Townsend’s big-eared bat use of green trees and snags as roosting
sites within the project area is unknown, but expected to be low since this species is more commonly
associated with utilizing caves and abandoned mines as roost sites. Some disturbance to bats may occur
due to noise during harvest activity, but the duration of disturbance would be short-term.
Hazard tree removal may affect snag availability in very limited areas associated with developed sites for
lodgepole pine. This would constitute only a minor local impact. Therefore, no cumulative impacts would
result due to overlap between past, present, or reasonably foreseeable activities and activities proposed.

Summary of Effects

No known Townsend’s big-eared bat records, maternity colonies, or hibernacula occur within the project
area. Several abandoned mines and buildings in addition to existing larger snags may be capable of
supporting seasonal roosting and could be subjected to disturbance from smoke. However, project design
features minimize the potential for adverse impacts to the species. Therefore, implementation of either
action alternative May Impact Individuals or Habitat, but will not likely result in a trend toward federal
listing or reduced viability of the population or species.

Management Indicator Species
The FP identifies MIS that are used to judge effects of land management activities on various habitats.
The Wildlife Habitat Objective for MIS states: “Maintain habitat conditions for elk security and winter
habitat integrity for wolverine and mountain goat as reflected by changes in abundance of these
Management Indicator Species (MIS)”. This objective is applicable at the Forest Level. Monitoring
Elements specific to the three MIS are found in annual Monitoring Reports. Wolverines were selected as a
MIS to indicate changes in motorized winter recreation use levels because they use high, isolated areas
for denning. Impacts to wolverines are considered in the Threatened, Endangered, & Proposed species
section. Elk occur in every habitat type and virtually every elevation across the BDNF and are readily
displaced from motorized activity. This is a useful species to monitor the effectiveness of motorized use
management and changes in secure habitat.

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Rocky Mountain Elk
Recommendations provided in MFWP & USFS (2013) “apply only on the Custer, Helena, Lewis and
Clark, and Gallatin National Forests” and are designed specifically to provide contemporary management
direction for those FPs, developed in the 1980’s; as substantial changes have occurred in elk numbers,
distribution, habitat, hunting and literature in the last 3 decades. These contemporary concepts informed
the direction of the FP and are included in this analysis.
The Flint Creek Range provides year-round habitat for elk. Hunting unit (HU) 212 comprises a portion of
the Flint Creek Elk Management Unit, which includes the project area. Elk numbers in Hunting Unit 212
are currently about 2.7 times above management objectives. Harvest rates, thus population fluctuation, are
exclusively controlled by MFWP.
Elk Security (FP Goal)
Security is described in the Elk Monitoring report as the protection inherent in any situation that allows
elk to remain in a defined area despite an increase in stress or disturbance associated with the hunting
season or other human activities. Security is a state of being, a condition or functional concept most
important when viewed in relation to the hunting season. Additionally, forested vegetation does not
statistically provide security for hunted populations of elk, whereas open motorized roads/trails are indeed
significant. Based on thorough review of Unsworth et al. (1993) , Hayes et al. (2002), Cook et al. (2005),
Rumble and Gamo (2011), which constitute a body of best available science postdating Hillis (1991),
forested cover for both hiding and thermal benefits do not appear to be persuasive metrics for elk analysis,
particularly for hunted populations.
Furthermore, Proffitt et al. (2013) evaluated effects of hunter access, security habitat as defined by the
Hillis paradigm, and other landscape attributes on adult female elk resource selection during the prehunting, archery, rifle, and post-hunting periods in 2 different Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) elk
herds (East Madison Valley and West Paradise Valley). They found that female elk selection for areas
restricting public hunting access was stronger than selection for security habitat in both study areas, and
that the densities of roads open to motorized use was the strongest predictor of elk distribution.
Habitat effectiveness is defined as the percentage of available habitat that is useable by elk outside the
hunting season. MFWP & USFS (2013) recommend 50% or greater (less than 2 mi/mi2) where elk are
one of the primary resource considerations and recommend using route density as a proxy for habitat
effectiveness.
The FP goal is to manage density of open motorized roads and trails (OMRTD) by MTFWP Hunt Units
(HU) during the fall rifle big game season, to achieve levels at or below identified densities. Hunting Unit
212 OMRTD is 1.4 mi/mi2 and is compliant with the FP for the general hunting season and will remain so
during and post implementation.
Total miles of open motorized routes by alternative are detailed in the Route Section, Table 57. There is a
very small difference between the alternatives and despite short-term increases in road miles used, longterm secure areas and OMRTD would remain unchanged and consistent with FP guidance.
Secure Area
In the summer, or general season, there are approximately 63,310 acres of wildlife secure areas within FS
administrative boundary in HU 212, primarily south of the proposed units. In the fall, there are an
additional 15,630 acres, which is over 50% of FS administered land (Table 60). Secure areas represent a
smaller component when considered in the project area scale given the low elevations and proximity to
private land with approximately 34% secure area in the fall. Additionally, less than 2 percent of the fall
secure acres are in blocks smaller than 250 acres (Appendix F).

Cover, Winter Range, Calving, and other key features
In the past, thermal cover was considered an important habitat component for elk on winter range.
However, studies have looked at use of thermal cover in winter (and summer) and found no significant,
positive effect of thermal cover on condition of elk (Cook, Irwin, Bryant, Riggs, & Thomas, 2005). They
found: 1) no positive physiological benefits to elk from presence of thermal cover; 2) little to no effect of
forest canopy of ambient temperature or relative humidity; 3) that there is virtually no support for the
thermal cover hypothesis from experimental research specifically designed to establish cause and effect
relations; and 4) elk in the dense forest stands lost the most weight and mass (ibid). They recommended
that the focus for elk management should be forage resources related to production potential of forest
successional stages and vulnerability of ungulates to harvest and harassment. MFWP & USFS (2013) also
concluded that specific quantifiable cover recommendations are not supported by the scientific literature
and previous specific recommendations have never been empirically tested. Impacts to cover are
considered; however, based on literature, this impact is not a main variable driving the conclusion of each
effects analysis.
Elk winter ranges are located at lower elevations that flank the northeast and northwest portions of the
project area, including private and public (FS, BLM and state) land. Calving season generally runs from
mid-May through mid-June. No treatments are proposed under any alternative in elk winter range;
therefore, winter range habitat would not be affected. While several proposed timber haul routes cross
through elk winter range, spring breakup prevents hauling during the latter part of the winter and calving
period.
Livestock grazing and invasive plant species treatments can affect winter range; however, the Montana
State Elk Plan (MFWP, 2004) has not identified any livestock grazing issues for winter range on HU 212.
All FS allotments are under a rest/rotation or deferred rotation grazing system. Each allotment
management plan (AMP) contains riparian mitigation measures as well as riparian and upland use
parameters (Range Resources section). Existing invasive plant species infestations are currently being
treated on an annual basis and will continue to be treated into the foreseeable future.
Aspen are a valuable food source for elk and other ungulates. Advancing succession, increased conifer
encroachment, changes in climate, and increased disease and insects have resulted in declining aspen
health across Montana and within the project area (Anderegg, Anderegg, Sherman, & Karp, 2012; Steed
& Kerns, 2010). Disruption of fire return intervals and domestic and wild ungulate grazing also contribute
to reduced aspen vigor. Removing competing conifers will improve aspen resiliency.
The distribution of elk has become a primary management issue in some areas of Montana where elk are
present and spending significant amounts of time on private lands. Contributing factors to this
disproportionate use include differences in access for hunting, habitat conditions, hunting regulations, and
other factors such as predation, climate change, stochastic events, and/or inherent habitat differences.

201

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Alternative 1– Direct, Indirect & Cumulative Effects
There would be no direct effects to elk under this alternative because there are no proposed activities.
Indirect effects could result from long-term successional changes in vegetation in the lower elevation
areas that provide winter and early spring habitat for elk. Douglas-fir would continue to increase in the
understory of Douglas-fir stands and in the grassland parks, potentially reducing forage for elk. Forage
however, is not a limiting factor for elk in this area and elk are not specifically tied to vegetation types, so
this is not expected to have measureable impacts to elk at the Hunting Unit scale.
Secure areas would continue to be present and evenly distributed across the project area and open
motorized road and trail densities would remain within the objectives set by the Forest Plan. In the
timbered areas, trees will continue to be impacted by mountain pine beetle and impacted trees would be
expected to fall in 5-15 years. Over time as trees fall in these areas, cover for elk could be provided by
regenerating lodgepole pine trees. A review of the literature could find no correlation between elk
densities and extensive stands with high levels of coarse woody debris that would occur under this
alternative (ERG 2010), so impacts to elk densities are not expected.
Cumulatively, the primary activities effecting elk population and distributions are hunting (as determined
by the State); recreation and travel management; while livestock grazing and weed management could
affect forage quality. Existing weed infestations are currently being treated with herbicides on an annual
basis and will continue to be treated into the foreseeable future, which will improve forage by maintaining
native vegetation.

Alternatives 2 and 3– Direct, Indirect & Cumulative Effects
Timber units that propose understory thinning would improve growing conditions for the remaining trees
by removing competition, decrease susceptibility of these trees to western spruce budworm and Douglasfir beetle, and increase stand resiliency. This would benefit elk as it would maintain and prevent it from
being lost to insect and disease or a large scale wildfire. Understory grasses, forbs and shrubs would
respond positively to increased sunlight, which would increase available forage in these units, benefiting
elk.
The lodgepole pine salvage units currently provide marginal winter range habitat as most of the trees in
these stands are dead and dying (snags) and are densely stocked, conditions not preferred by wintering
elk. Salvage of these units would provide cover and forage for elk sooner than unsalvaged dead and dying
(snags) lodgepole pine stands.
Effects to elk under both action alternatives are similar because existing travel restrictions pertaining to
wildlife will be followed and no actions are proposed in winter range. Alternative 2 treatment and
associated activities will affect about 500 acres or 1% of the secure area during implementation.
Alternative 3 will affect about 25 acres during implementation with no net change from existing condition
under either action alternatives at the completion of the project. Because so little secure area is being
impacted and for a short duration; displacement during implementation to private land could occur, but is
not expected to significantly alter elk distributions. A project design feature has been added to comply
with existing wildlife-related travel restrictions and there would be no activities in fall secure areas during
the hunting season when human disturbance is the greatest.
A review of the ongoing and foreseeable actions found that aspen treatments, livestock grazing and weed
control could affect forage habitat; and hunting, recreational use and travel management might cause
disturbance or affect secure areas. Existing weed infestations are currently being treated with herbicides
on an annual basis, will continue to be treated into the foreseeable future, and are expected to benefit elk.
Implementing the forest-wide aspen treatment project will improve foraging opportunities, especially if
done at a large scale. Displacement effects from this project are not expected to add measureable

202

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

cumulative effects to elk because activities are short and affect a small portion of secure area. These
actions, when compared with past, present and future actions in the analysis area, will not add measurable
negative cumulative effects to elk because the treatments benefit elk habitat and in the long term maintain
secure areas for this species within the hunting unit and the landscape.
Southwestern Montana is home to over 40% of the state elk population and gets the bulk of hunting
pressure and harvest. Current 2011 estimates of elk numbers for those Hunting Units encompassing
BDNF lands have reached 139% of the 2004 MT Elk Plan objectives for those units. In 2011 in hunting
district 212 alone, elk populations exceed State objectives by nearly three times and have consistently
done s, representing a robust presence in the Flint Foothills. Elk are widely distributed throughout the
forest and are at stable to increasing numbers in every unit.
Mountain Goat
Mountain goats inhabit areas within the subalpine and arctic alpine zone of the northern Rocky Mountains
and coastal ranges. The rugged terrain is comprised of cliffs, ledges, projecting pinnacles, and talus
slopes. Goat range is associated with areas having well-defined glaciation at elevations between 4,500 and
10,000 feet. They prefer to remain high on mountains and forage on windblown slopes; however, deep
snows will force them to lower elevations. Water requirements for goats are generally satisfied by snow
and melt water. The diets of mountain goats are quite broad and vary somewhat throughout their range;
they utilize the most nutritious portions of grasses, sedges, rushes, forbs, shrubs, ferns, and mosses and
lichens. Grassy slide-rock slopes are major use areas in spring, summer, and fall. Alpine meadows are
used most in mid-summer when vegetation on cliffs is sparse. Timbered areas are used during summer
and fall by scattered single goats and by females in spring prior to parturition. During winter, conifers can
be a major portion of the goat diet. Mountain goats usually remain at or above the timberline and within
reach of rocky outcrops utilized for retreat from danger. In general, goats tend to make use of higher
elevations during summer and lower ones in winter.
All Alternatives
General distribution of this species overlaps the southern portion of the project area; however, no
mountain goat occurrences are shown for the northern portion of the Flint Creek Range. Mountain goat
hunting in the northern Flint Creek Range has been closed since 2007. Suitable habitats are located in
steep, rocky, alpine habitats outside of proposed treatment units. Potential for mountain goat occurrence
within treatment units is unlikely. Therefore, all alternatives would have no impact to populations or
habitat trend.

Other Species of Interest
A few additional species are addressed in this analysis because they are species of public interest; or are
species with additional direction for analysis at the forest (northern goshawk and great grey owl) or
national level (migratory birds).
Northern Goshawk
Clough (2000) investigated habitat parameters associated with nesting goshawks in the northern portion
of the Clark-Flints landscape area that includes the Flint Foothills project area. Results showed that, in
general, goshawks nested in multi-storied stands with higher densities of large trees (greater than 15
inches dbh) dominated by either Douglas-fir or lodgepole pine. Only 3 of 19 occupied stands exhibited
characteristics indicative of old-growth. Nests in lodgepole pine cover types were located at the lower
extent of lodgepole pine distribution, whereas nests in Douglas-fir were found throughout the elevation
range of this cover type. Nest sites were located primarily on northerly aspects (82.6 percent). Nest stand
canopy closures ranged from 48-82 percent. Goshawk diets consist of a variety of bird and mammal
species. As determined by total biomass, primary goshawk prey species in the northern Flint Creek Range

203

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

include snowshoe hare (53 percent), red squirrel (14 percent), Columbian ground squirrel (9 percent) and
blue grouse (12 percent, ibid).
The northern goshawk was removed from the Sensitive Species list based on a review of the best
available science regarding the ecological status of the species, estimated amounts and distribution of
habitat in the Region, results of a 2005 regional inventory, and the completion of a Regional Overview
and was revised in 2009 (NGWG, 2009), with new habitat estimates, a discussion of impacts of timber
management and validity of activity timing restriction dates. This document is incorporated by reference.
The overview found that based on recent broad-scale habitat and inventory and monitoring assessments
conducted in Region 1, breeding goshawks and associated habitats appear widely distributed and
relatively abundant.
Additionally, goshawk nest habitat is estimated to be 13.8 times that needed for Regional viability (Bush
& Lundberg, 2008). ERG (2010) estimates goshawk habitat in the Clark Fork-Flints landscape to over 6
times that needed for Regional viability in this landscape alone.
Because habitat is currently widespread and abundant, and predicted to continue to be widespread and
abundant over the next 50 years, despite the current mountain pine beetle outbreak, this evaluation
focuses on the FP standard for protection of known active nest sites and applies mitigation guidelines
described in the Regional Overview.
Goshawk surveys in 2010 and 2011 focused on status of historic nest sites. Nine historic sites were
surveyed, none of which showed active nesting. Surveys were also conducted in units 27 and 43 with
negative results. One new site with active nesting was discovered along Gird Creek in 2011 adjacent to
units 56C, 57C, and 68C (Gird Creek Nest Map, Appendix F). No activity will occur within the 40-acre
nest buffer for 10 years after last documented active nesting.
Mechanized ground disturbing activities will not occur during nesting season; however, direct impacts
from prescribed burning may occur. If activities occur between April 15th and August 15th, a survey to
determine nest locations will be conducted prior to implementation. If an a nest is determined to be active,
mitigation measures for both the nest stand and the Post Fledgling Area will be applied to protect the
goshawk pair and young from disturbance during the breeding season until fledglings are capable of
sustained flight. (Woodbridge & Hargis, 2006). See PDFs.
Great Gray Owls
The great gray owl (GGO) forages in open areas where scattered trees or forest margin provides suitable
sites for visual searching. Their home ranges are often small, and depend on food supply. Duncan and
Hayward (1994) describe GGO habitat as mid to late-successional forests, usually with a component of
wet meadows, marshes, lakes or other openings, including clear-cuts, that support a high prey base (e.g.,
small mammals). Great gray owls use a variety of forest types throughout their range. In this portion of its
range, it is estimated that nearly 80 percent of GGO use lodgepole pine/Douglas-fir/aspen habitats
(Franklin, 1988). There is no evidence that the GGO is dependent on “old growth” forest; however, nests
are typically located in large diameter trees, dead or alive. Nesting begins early, starting in March or
April. For nest sites, this owl often uses old hawk or raven stick nests or natural depressions on brokentopped snags or stumps (Bull & Henjum, 1990; Nero, 1993). Thus, the actual nest structure and its
support can be unimportant in nest site selection versus the nest site habitat and availability of nearby
foraging habitat. Because fledglings leave the nest before they can fly, both trees that are well off the
ground, leaning over to other trees and are deformed but that are near meadows and openings (but still in
timber) provide good habitat (Bull & Henjum, 1990).
Salvage treatments are not expected to affect available nesting habitat because this species is not known
to utilize stands of dead lodgepole pine for nesting. Because GGOs use denser stands for nesting,

204

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

commercial thinning treatments and seed tree harvest have the potential to remove nesting habitat.
However, no large trees or snags would be removed. Post-treatment condition is projected to contain the
larger trees with canopy closures ranging from 20-50 percent, which provides suitable foraging habitat
(Bull & Henjum, 1990). This project is expected to improve foraging habitat in the long-term by
maintaining adjacent open parks and meadows that the owls prefer.
The GGO is not on the R1 Sensitive Species list or the USFWS Birds of Conservation Concern (USFWS,
2008); however, Wildlife Habitat Standard 9 (pg. 49) states that nests would be protected; and includes
the owl. For this reason, the evaluation focuses on the FP standard for protection of known nests.
Units were prioritized for surveys based on proximity to meadows or parks. Surveys were conducted in
2011 in units 1ST, 5ST, 20C, 24C, and 59C with no detections. However, great gray owls were detected in
Unit 1ST in 2010 and in or near units 20C, 24C, and 25C in 2011 during flammulated owl surveys. In late
August and early September 2011 (after the nesting season), GGOs were observed in units 10C and 49S.
One GGO was heard from unit 25C during flammulated owl surveys.
Mechanized ground disturbance activities will not occur between breeding or fledgling season (March 15
– July 15). Direct impacts may occur during prescribed burn; therefore a PDF is included to protect nests
or fledged owlets, as they are capable of leaving the vicinity of the nest by mid-July. (See PDFs).
Migratory Birds
Within the National Forests, conservation of migratory birds focuses on providing a diversity of habitat
conditions at multiple scales and ensuring that bird conservation is addressed when planning for land
management activities. A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the USFS and USFWS
strengthens migratory bird conservation by identifying and implementing strategies that promote
conservation and avoid or minimize adverse impacts on migratory birds.
Forest Service responsibilities relative to project-level planning outlined in the MOU are as follows:
Within the NEPA process, evaluate the effects of agency actions on migratory birds, focusing first
on species of management concern along with their priority habitat and key risk factors. To the
extent practical: evaluate and balance long-term benefits of projects against any short-term or
long-term adverse effects; pursue opportunities to restore or enhance the composition, structure,
and juxtaposition of migratory bird habitats in the project area; consider approaches for
identifying and minimizing incidental take (altering season of activities; retaining snags where
underrepresented; retaining integrity of known breeding sites); and coordinate with FWS when a
project is likely to have a negative effect on migratory bird populations.
The project falls within Bird Conservation Region 10 where birds of conservation concern have been
identified by the USFWS (78 FR 9282). Three of the species identified in this region have already been
addressed as sensitive species (bald eagle, peregrine falcon and flammulated owl). The rest of the species
that may be in the project area that have not already been considered and a summary of anticipated effects
are found in Table 61.

Direct impact from prescribed burning
to breeding birds.

Several factors influence the richness and diversity of bird species in a stand, including the structure and
composition of living and dead vegetation. In western dry coniferous forests, bird community
composition depends on the heterogeneity of habitats available, proximity to water, fire history and
silviculture legacy (Pilliod, Bull, Hayes, & Wales, 2006). The species most likely to be affected by
vegetation treatments are those with nesting and foraging habitats associated with the vegetation being
affected, and species that either prefer or avoid disturbed areas.
Hejl et al. (1995) reviewed species abundance following silviculture treatments. Each species responded
uniquely to the harvesting treatments. Of the forest-associated species listed above that they considered,
calliope hummingbirds showed a positive response to partial cuts; olive-sided flycatchers showed a
positive response to low-shrub and tall-shrub salvages and partial cuts; and Cassin’s finch showed no
change in low-shrub salvages, a decrease in tall-shrub salvages and positive responses in pole-sapling
salvages and partial cuts.
Openings created by lodgepole pine salvage and stand density reductions in Douglas-fir/ponderosa pine
thinning units, and seed tree harvest are expected to improve habitats for olive-sided flycatchers. Large

206

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

conifer and snag retention in thinning units would retain suitable nest sites for Williamson’s sapsuckers.
In addition, aspen improvements associated with Douglas-fir thinning and seed tree harvest would
increase future nesting opportunities in aspen for this species. Implementing the forest-wide aspen
treatment project will improve habitat suitability, especially if done at a large scale. Stand density
reductions generated by thinning, seed tree harvest, and prescribed burning in Douglas-fir and ponderosa
pine stands would increase suitable habitats for Cassin’s finch.
Past and ongoing activities such as timber harvest, road construction, livestock grazing, mining,
prescribed fire and wildfire suppression have contributed to the existing condition and may affect
migratory birds. Because acreage affected by activities is minor at the project scale, cumulative effects
resulting from ongoing and foreseeable activities are not expected to impact migratory bird populations.
Summary of Effects
A limiting operating period for mechanized disturbance has been included in the design of this project to
minimize direct effects to breeding birds. Direct impacts to breeding birds can be expected if prescribed
burn occurs during breeding season. Project implementation may disturb individuals outside of this
critical period at the time of implementation; however, it is expected that the long-term benefits of
improving resiliency will outweigh the short-term potential disturbance cause by project implementation.
FP vegetation management direction is designed to restore, maintain and retain a range of landscape
conditions under which species evolved. Potential impacts of activities are minimized by adherence to FP
standards for habitat components including snags, large woody debris and buffers from mechanized
equipment in riparian areas. Overall, both action alternatives would maintain or improve habitats and
would not negatively affect migratory landbird populations or their habitats.

Soil Resources
This section describes the geology, landforms, and soil present in the Flint Foothills Project area, and
analyzes the impact to the soil resource from implementation of the proposed actions. The main issues
concerning the soil resource include existing soil disturbance from previous activities within the project
area, and the potential direct, indirect, and cumulative effects of the commercial timber harvest and
prescribed burn components of the proposed action to the soil resource.
The precommercial thin component of the proposed action is not discussed in detail because no effects to
the soil resource are expected. All work would be done by hand (i.e., hand felling of trees and hand
piling); no mechanical treatments would occur.

Overview of Issues Addressed
Issues associated with soil productivity and quality include evaluation of existing detrimental soil
disturbances from past and present activities, as well as potential effects to the soil resource from new
disturbances related to implementation of proposed commercial harvest and prescribed burning activities.
Potential soil productivity effects from the commercial timber harvest component of the proposed action
are soil erosion, compaction, rutting, and displacement from machinery during felling, bunching, yarding,
loading logs and temporary road construction, as well as soil heating from slash burning, and reduction in
site nutrient capital due to the removal of woody material from the site. Potential soil productivity effects
from the prescribed burning component of the proposed action are soil heating and potential accelerated
erosion as a result of loss of surface cover due to burning.

207

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Measurement Indicators
The measurement indicators used to evaluate impacts of alternatives:
As defined by the Region 1 Soil Quality Standards (1999), detrimental soil disturbance (DSD) includes
the effects of compaction, rutting, displacement, severe burning, surface erosion, loss of surface organic
matter, and soil mass movement. At least 85 percent of an activity area must have soil that is in
satisfactory condition. An activity area is defined as: “A land area affected by a management activity to
which soil quality standards are applied. Activity areas must be feasible to monitor and include harvest
units within timber sale areas, prescribed burn areas, grazing areas or pastures within range allotments,
riparian areas, recreation areas, and alpine areas. All temporary roads, skid trails and landings are
considered part of an activity area” (USDA Forest Service 1999).
Detrimental soil conditions include:
•

Compaction: Detrimental compaction is a 15 percent increase in natural bulk density. The
cumulative effects of multiple site entries on compaction should also be considered since
compacted soils often recover slowly.

•

Rutting: Wheel ruts at least 2 inches deep in wet soils are detrimental.

•

Displacement: Detrimental displacement is the removal of 1 or more inches (depth) of any
surface horizon, usually the A horizon, from a continuous area greater than 100 square feet.

•

Severely-burned soils: Physical and biological changes to soil resulting from high intensity
burns of long duration are detrimental. This standard is used when evaluating prescribed fire.
Guidelines for assessing fire intensity are contained in the Burned-Area Emergency
Rehabilitation Handbook FSH 2509.13 (USDA Forest Service 1995).

•

Surface Erosion: Rills, gullies, pedestals, and soil deposition are all indicators of detrimental
surface erosion. Minimum amounts of ground cover necessary to keep soil loss to within
tolerable limits (generally less than 1 to 2 tons per acre per year) should be established locally
depending on site characteristics.

•

Soil Mass Movement: Any soil mass movement caused by management activities is
detrimental.

The R1 SQS refers to the Burned-Area Emergency Rehabilitation Handbook FSH 2509.13 (USDA Forest
Service 1995) for assessing fire intensity. However, more currently, fire effects to the soil are defined in
terms of soil burn severity in order to differentiate between post-fire soil properties from fire effects on
vegetation (Parsons et al. 2010). This distinction is important as fire intensity and soil burn severity do not
necessarily correlate directly. High soil burn severity would be considered detrimental soil disturbance.
The following definitions from Parsons et al. 2010 will be used in the effects analysis.
•

Soil burn severity: The effect of a fire on ground surface characteristics, including char,
depth, organic matter loss, altered color and structure, and reduced infiltration (Lentile and
others 2006; DeBano and others 1998; Ryan and Noste 1985 in Parsons et. al 2010). The
classification of post-fire soil condition is based on fire-induced changes in physical and
biological soil properties.

•

Low soil burn severity: Surface organic layers are not completely consumed and are still
recognizable. Structural aggregate stability is not changed from its unburned condition, and
roots are generally unchanged because the heat pulse below the soil surface was not great
enough to consume or char any underlying organics. The ground surface, including any
exposed mineral soil, may appear brown or black (lightly charred), and the canopy and
understory vegetation will likely appear “green.”

208

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

•

Moderate soil burn severity: Up to 80 percent of the pre-fire ground cover (litter and ground
fuels) may be consumed but generally not all of it. Fine roots (up to 0.1 inch or 0.25 cm
diameter) may be scorched but are rarely completely consumed over much of the area. The
color of the ash on the surface is generally blackened with possible gray patches. There may
be potential for recruitment of effective ground cover from scorched needles or leaves
remaining in the canopy that will soon fall to the ground. The prevailing color of the site is
often “brown” due to canopy needle and other vegetation scorch. Soil structure is generally
unchanged.

•

High soil burn severity: All or nearly all of the pre-fire ground cover and surface organic
matter (litter, duff, and fine roots) is generally consumed, and charring may be visible on
larger roots. The prevailing color of the site is often “black” due to extensive charring. Bare
soil or ash is exposed and susceptible to erosion, and aggregate structure may be less stable.
White or gray ash (up to several centimeters in depth) indicates that considerable ground cover
or fuels were consumed. Sometimes very large tree roots (greater than 3 inches or 8 cm
diameter) are entirely burned extending from a charred stump hole. Soil is often gray, orange,
or reddish at the ground surface where large fuels were concentrated and consumed.

Existing and Predicted Soil Disturbance
Soil disturbance is an indicator of departure from natural conditions and may negatively affect soil
productivity when detrimental. Soil productivity is defined as “the inherent capacity of the soil resource to
support appropriate site-specific biological resource management objectives, which includes the growth
of specified plants, plant communities, or a sequence of plant communities to support multiple land uses”
(USDA Forest Service 2010). The Region 1 Soil Quality Standards (USDA Forest Service 1999) defines
the degree and aerial extent of soil disturbance to maintain soil productivity, thus meeting the intent of
NFMA. The Forest Soil Disturbance Monitoring Protocol (FSDMP) was used to assess existing,
management-caused soil disturbance in the proposed harvest units (USDA Forest Service 2009b).
Existing soil disturbance is displayed as a percentage of each proposed harvest unit.
Soil disturbance resulting from implementation of the proposed action was predicted for each proposed
harvest unit using assumptions based on local monitoring data, literature, and risk ratings from the
landtype inventory soil map. Predicted soil disturbance is displayed as a percentage of each proposed
harvest unit.

Coarse Woody Debris
Coarse woody debris (CWD) is one soil quality indicator which influences soil hydrology, biology,
nutrient cycling, and soil stability and support functions which are indicators of soil productivity (USDA
Forest Service 2010). The removal of woody material from the site is common due to whole tree
harvesting practices. The R1 supplement to FSM 2550 recommends following the guidelines set forth in
Graham et al. (1994) in determining the amount of coarse woody debris to be left onsite. Coarse woody
debris is defined as pieces 3 inches or greater in diameter. Baseline coarse woody debris measurements
(in tons/acre) were taken in the proposed harvest units to address coarse woody debris recommendations.

Affected Environment
Soils, Landforms, and Geology
Soil development is affected by climate, parent material, topography, living organisms, and the amount of
time the soil has developed. Local climate near the project area in Deer Lodge, MT is cold and relatively
dry, with an annual average maximum temperature of 55.6 degrees, an annual average minimum

209

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

temperature of 26.0 degrees, and an annual average of 10.78 inches of precipitation (Western Regional
Climate Center, accessed 1/23/12). In general, the combination of a cold, moderately dry climate, and a
relatively short time for development have resulted in somewhat moderately developed soils. The
majority of the soils in the proposed harvest units have formed in undifferentiated parent material (mostly
consisting of calcareous and noncalcareous sedimentary and metasedimentary materials) on mountain
slopes and moraines. The most common soil type found within the commercial harvest units is Loamyskeletal, mixed, superactive Typic Eutropcryepts (Table 62).

No commercial harvest units, precommercial thin units, or prescribed burn units fall within landtypes with
a major wet soil component (USDA Forest Service 2007a). Eight landtypes list wet soils as a minor
component comprising 15 percent or less of the map unit (21UC3 – 5% of the map unit; 21UD2 – 5%;
22UCD – 14%; 37UD2 – 10%; 75GC3 – 5%; 85E – 3%; 299E – 3%; 299F – 3%). These map units have
limited areas of wet soils and the casual observer would not be aware that wet soils were a component of
the landtype. Furthermore, the vegetative components associated with the minor wet components
(subalpine-fir/bluejoint and meadows) do not correspond to the vegetation where treatments will occur.

Landtype Inventory Soil Map and Interpretations
The landtype inventory soil map is an appropriate scale to display soil interpretations for management.
Soil survey data are interpreted to estimate the risk that management activities will affect soils. These risk
estimates, or risk ratings, are called soil interpretations (USDA Forest Service 2007a, USDA Forest
Service 2011a).

Soil Hazard Ratings: Erosion, Rutting, Compaction, and Mass Movement
Soils were rated for their susceptibility to erosion, rutting, compaction, and mass movement (USDA
Forest Service 2007a, USDA Forest Service 2011a). These ratings, or interpretations, for the landtype
inventory are qualitative ratings based on field observations of past activities, the inherent characteristics
of each landtype (such as texture or rock content), and assumptions about the general modifications that
would occur in the landtype as a result of management activities. Field observations of soil impacts on
various landtypes formed the core of data used to develop the interpretive ratings. The landtypes with the
field observations were rated first. The remaining landtypes were rated relative to those with field
observations. Landtype characteristics were used as criteria for comparison and evaluation in the rating
process.
The landtype inventory soil map was used to determine risk ratings for each commercial timber harvest
unit associated with the proposed action for both alternative 2 and alternative 3 (table 63). Many of the
proposed commercial timber harvest units contain more than one landtype, often resulting in multiple risk
ratings for one unit. Each unique risk rating representing at least 0.50 acre is displayed. Risk ratings are
defined in Appendix A of the Soils report in the project file.

address coarse woody debris recommendations in the R1 supplement to FSM 2550 (Graham et al. 1994;
Brown 1974). Coarse woody debris measurements within the proposed harvest units ranged from 1 to 17
tons/acre, with an average of 6 tons/acre (table 65).

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Desired Condition
The desired condition for the soil resource is the maintenance of soil productivity. Under NFMA, the
Forest Service may harvest timber from national forests only where “soil, slope, or other watershed
conditions will not be irreversibly damaged” (16 U.S.C. § 1604(g)(3)(E)(i)).
The Beaverhead-Deerlodge Forest Plan states that ground based yarding shall not be allowed on slopes
exceeding 35 percent without site-specific environmental analysis that shows damage is unlikely and soil
goals and objectives can be met (USDA Forest Service 2009c). The plan also states that the most current
Region 1 Soil Quality Standards (SQS) are adopted as Forest Plan soil standards.
Region 1 soil quality standards address NFMA by requiring that new activities do not create detrimental
soil conditions on more than 15 percent of an activity area following project implementation and
restoration activities (USDA Forest Service 1999). Restoration is defined as treatments that restore vital
soil functions to their inherent range of variability. Restoration treatments could include, but are not
limited to, tillage, ripping, subsoiling, seeding, mulching, recontouring of temporary roads, and water
barring. Activity areas are defined as the proposed harvest units, including landings, skid trails, and
temporary road construction, and the proposed prescribed burning units. As defined by the Region 1 Soil
Quality Standards, detrimental soil disturbance includes the effects of compaction, displacement, rutting,
severe burning, surface erosion, loss of surface organic matter, and soil mass movement.
According to the R1 supplement to FSM 2550, coarse woody debris objectives should follow research
guidelines such as those contained in Graham et al. 1994. Leaving 7-25 tons/acre of pieces with a
diameter of 3 inches or greater meets recommendations set forth in Graham et al. for habitat types present
in the project area. For practical purposes, a range of 7-12 tons/acre should be left in each unit (project
design features and mitigation measures, chapter 2).

Environmental Consequences
Methodology
Existing Detrimental Soil Disturbance
Existing detrimental soil disturbance (DSD) was determined by Forest Service soil scientists with onsite
visits to timber harvest units occurring August 2010, August through October 2011, and July through
August 2012. The Forest Soil Disturbance Monitoring Protocol (FSDMP) was used to assess existing,
management-caused soil disturbance in the proposed harvest units (USDA Forest Service, 2009b). The
FSDMP is applied to areas disturbed by management activities, and is a presence/absence (1 = present, 0
= absent) method of collecting visual attribute data in order to assess soil disturbance. Attributes
evaluated include forest floor impacts, surface soil displacement, mixed surface soil/subsoil, rutting,
burning (only management prescribed burning is assessed), compaction, and platy or massive structure.
If previous management activities or disturbance were evident, 30 sample plots were spaced across the
unit to obtain an estimate of the amount and extent of soil disturbance. A sample plot consisted of a 6-inch
diameter circular area. Determinations of detrimental soil disturbance were based on the Region 1 Soil
Quality Standards (USDA Forest Service 1999). If no evidence of past management or disturbance was
present, then a walk-through of the unit was conducted and documented.
Coarse Woody Debris
Baseline coarse woody debris measurements (in tons/acre) were taken in most of the proposed harvest
units following Brown 1974. Random azimuth transects were run at plots 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 for those

218

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

units with 30 sample plots. Three to five random azimuth transects spaced throughout the unit were run in
walk-through units.
Predicted Detrimental Soil Disturbance
To predict the amount of detrimental soil disturbance (DSD) associated with the proposed action, the
following assumptions were made:
•

Projected DSD associated with the proposed action is assumed to be 10 percent for each
activity area (commercial harvest unit) harvested under dry conditions in the summer. This
assumption is based on local data, which shows that DSD is typically less than 10 percent in
the summer (USDA Forest Service 2004; USDA Forest Service 2008; USDA Forest Service
2009a; USDA Forest Service 2009d). The estimate above includes landings, skid trails, and
temporary road construction associated with the activity areas. Detrimental soil disturbance
associated with burning slash piles is also included with these figures since landings were
included in the post-implementation monitoring. Projected DSD associated with broadcast
burning in the commercial thin and seed trees units is assumed to be 0 percent. This
assumption is based on local data which has shown low soil burn severity (not detrimental) is
typical of broadcast and concentration prescribed burning (Fletcher 2011b).

•

In addition to the baseline 10 percent (summer harvest) assumed for each activity area, DSD
due to temporary road construction associated with each harvest unit was calculated. Acres of
disturbance were calculated by multiplying a width of 14 feet by the length of proposed road.
This may result in an overestimation of DSD, but aids in displaying the effects of temporary
road construction needed for some of the harvest units. All temporary road construction is
considered DSD. Existing roads that would be maintained or reconstructed are not counted
towards DSD, since they are already removed from the productive soil base. Existing
unauthorized routes to be used as haul roads that would not be added as System roads are
counted towards DSD. Newly constructed temporary roads would be obliterated, and hence
restored to some degree (assuming 50 percent effectiveness—see Effectiveness to Restore
DSD that follows) after harvest is completed. Existing unauthorized routes would be
decommissioned by use of signs and berms; therefore 0 percent of these temporary roads
would be restored after harvest is completed.

•

Net DSD reflects cumulative DSD as a result of project implementation. Net DSD is predicted
by adding existing DSD, projected DSD, and DSD associated with haul routes on nonsystem
roads (includes temporary roads), and then crediting the restoration (50 percent) of haul routes.
It is important to note that these figures are likely an overestimation of cumulative DSD at the
end of project implementation. In units with existing skid trails and landings, DSD is
essentially double-counted. The existing skid trails and landings are likely to be reused rather
than disturbing new areas; however, the existing disturbances are counted under existing DSD
and projected DSD.

•

Projected DSD associated with the proposed action is assumed to be 0 percent for each
prescribed burn unit. This assumption is based on local data, which shows low soil burn
severity (not detrimental) is typical of broadcast and concentration prescribed burning
(Fletcher 2011b).

Soils Restoration Plan
• For all units with newly constructed temporary roads (12C, 20C, 27ST, 34S, 35S, 41S, 42C,
46S, 48C, 49S, 51S, 52S, 55C, 56C, 57C, 61S, 68C, 71C, 72S, 73S, 77S,78S,79S) all
temporary roads (new construction) would be ripped or subsoiled, seeded with native seed,
and blocked at the entrance. Roads would be recontoured where needed.
219

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

•

For three units (27ST, 32ST, and 41S) additional restoration may be required to comply with
the regional soil quality standards. In these units existing and/or new skid trails would be
subsoiled to reduce compaction. Restoration activities would focus on skid trails and landings
and would occur on suitable acres, excluding areas that are too rocky, wet, or have other
limiting factors. Restoration would be implemented on the number of acres needed to meet
soil quality standards; actual acres restored may be higher or lower than what is shown (Table
67). Treatments would occur within 3 years of completion of harvest.

•

Actual acres to be restored would be determined by post-harvest monitoring to determine the
actual percent detrimental soil disturbance from which actual acres to be restored can be
calculated. These units would need to be monitored to ensure that SQS are met within 3 years
of the conclusion of the project.

Predicted Soil Erosion Using Disturbed WEPP
The Disturbed WEPP model (Elliot and Hall 2010) was run to generate predicted erosion rates for the
existing condition and following implementation of the proposed harvest. The following assumptions
were made:
•

Units with the greatest erosion hazard (high) were used to represent the worst case scenario for
the proposed actions (Table 63); only these units were modeled.

•

The Deerlodge, MT local climate was modified to reflect elevation within the project area. All
runs were based on 50 years of climate.

•

Proposed commercial harvest units were assigned a vegetation/treatment category of thin or
young forest, which reflects an area that has been harvested (Elliott et al. 2000).

•

Eighty-five percent ground cover was assumed for harvest units to reflect no more than 15
percent DSD in each unit modeled (ground cover is likely disturbed or removed if the soil is
detrimentally disturbed).

Design Feature and Mitigation Measure
Effectiveness of Preventing Detrimental Soil Disturbance
Monitoring conducted on previous vegetation management projects has proven soil and water
conservation practices (SWCPs) to be effective in controlling the amount of DSD in activity areas. For
example, the FY 2004 Monitoring Report (USDA Forest Service 2004) documents monitoring of BMP
effectiveness on the West Face Timber Sale. Harvesting began on the West Face Timber Sale in winter
2001. The project area is in the Pioneer Mountains and soils are generally derived from the Pioneer
Batholith, which is broadly quartz-monzonite composition. Quantitative monitoring of the West Face Sale
showed that “detrimental disturbance was estimated at less than 10 percent overall” (FY 2004 Monitoring
Report, p.30). The report attributes reductions in DSD found in recent projects, compared to ‘historic’
timber projects, to logging in the driest times of the summer and over snow, excluding harvest during the
wetter spring months. Logging when the soil is dry or frozen is listed above in “Design Features and
Mitigation Measures” for the proposed action, and is captured under SWCP 13.06.
The FY 2004 Monitoring Report also included monitoring in the Joe/Fox Sale. Soils in the Joe/Fox sale
are more uniformly susceptible to compaction than the soils found in the Flint Foothills project area,
because they have surface layers of volcanic ash mixed in where soils in the Flint Foothills project area do
not. Soils in the Joe/Fox sale also had a soil water content of 18 to 20 percent on the date sampled,
moisture levels which increase susceptibility to compaction. Monitoring results demonstrated that 15
passes of normal machinery on moist soil caused a 6.2 percent and 9.4 percent increase in surface and

220

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

subsurface bulk density, respectively. These values are considerably lower than the 15 percent threshold
for detrimental compaction (USDA Forest Service 1999). The percentage change is expected to be even
less on frozen or drier soils. Allowing soils to dry before using heavy equipment, has been shown to be
effective in minimizing soil compaction both locally as described above, and in the literature as well (Han
et al. 2006). Designating skid trails (SWCP 14.08) has been shown to reduce soil compaction to 10
percent or less of an activity area from 25-30 percent of an area if skid trails are not designated (Adams
and Froehlich, 1981). Monitoring of the Butte South Salvage Sale demonstrated the effectiveness of
designating skid trails, allowing soils to dry prior to harvest activities, and placing slash on skid trails
(USDA Forest Service 2007b). Ground cover in the units ranged from 87-93 percent after slash was
placed on skid trails.
Burning slash piles when the soil is frozen or moist has been shown to protect the soil. Two landings in
the West Face Timber Sale were monitored for detrimental burning. The piles were moist and were
burned in the fall with frozen soil and 6 inches of snow. No severely burned soils were noted and
vegetation is already returning (USDA Forest Service 2006). Burning slash piles when soils are
approaching saturation near the surface reduces the heat load to the soil. A fuel pile burned on a wet
mineral soil had 20 percent heat load compared with the heat load of a fuel pile burned on a dry mineral
soil (Frandsen and Ryan 1986).
Effectiveness to Restore Detrimental Soil Disturbance
Compaction reduces infiltration rate of water into the soil, potentially reducing plant available water and
affecting soil productivity. Compaction is the major detrimental soil condition associated with temporary
roads, landings and skid trails. Restoration activities that reduce compaction will restore infiltration and
available water, thereby reducing the potential effects on productivity.
Subsoiling has been shown to be an effective tool in treating compacted soils over many soils and site
conditions (Andrus and Froehlich 1983). Subsoiling fractures the compacted layer of soil by slightly
lifting the compacted layer using shanks or wings. This allows for root penetration, improved moisture
infiltration and retention, and increased air spaces without turning over the soil layers (as in tilling)
minimizing soil mixing and surface layer disturbance. Carr (1989) found that subsoiling successfully
reduced the soil density of compacted soils on landings. Davis (1990) found that subsoiling areas
compacted by brush piling reduced bulk density values to undisturbed levels. McNabb (1994) had only
“moderate” success decompacting temporary roads and landings, and attributed the results to soil
moisture levels being too high during subsoiling, which reduced the effectiveness of the treatment. Kolka
and Smidt (2004) found that subsoiling roads as a method of decommissioning resulted in significantly
greater white pine diameter growth and yellow-poplar height and diameter growth than the control
treatment (planting cover crops) after two years. Much of the published research on the effectiveness of
subsoiling comes from the Pacific Northwest; however, it is likely to work well on soils in the project
area, as the technique has been proven successful on a variety of soil textures (Andrus and Froehlich
1983). Further, the Bitterroot NF has been successfully using subsoiling to treat their compacted soils for
a few years (Mayn 2008). The Bitterroot National Forest Soil Scientist visited the BDNF to assess local
soils in 2008; he predicted that subsoiling would be successful as long as the water content of the soils
during treatment was optimal (not too dry or too wet).
Temporary road obliteration and subsequent reseeding has been shown to be an effective means of soil
compaction restoration on the BDNF. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of temporary road
obliteration, temporary roads from the Butte South Salvage Sale were monitored 1 year after obliteration.
Obliteration occurred in 2009 and included recontouring where necessary, seeding with native seed, and
blocking the entrance of the road to prevent use. One year after obliteration, cover in the form of slash
and native grasses was adequate (Fletcher 2011a). Areas of road that were recontoured did not have

221

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

compacted soil within the top 12 inches of the surface. Where recontouring was not necessary, the top 4-6
inches of soil were not compacted, allowing vegetation to take hold (Fletcher 2011a).
The planned obliteration of constructed skid trails, temporary roads, and landings in the proposed action
would re-establish slope hydrology and deter surface erosion that hinders natural recovery (Switalski et
al. 2004). Using infiltration as a proxy for the recovery of compaction, road rehabilitation led to roughly
40 percent of the natural soil infiltration rate (Luce 1997, Foltz and Maillard 2003). Unreclaimed surfaces
typically have almost no infiltration.
Restoration techniques improve the recovery trajectory. Standard timber sale contract/stewardship
contract provisions for erosion control are proposed for constructed skid trails, temporary roads, and
landings. Leaving slash on skid trails ensures hydrological and biological soil processes have been set up
for recovery. For these road restoration treatments, 50 percent effectiveness is assumed for calculation of
the DSD.

Spatial and Temporal Context for Effects Analysis
This analysis is largely focused on the commercial timber harvest component of the proposed action, as
the activities associated with these treatments have greater potential to affect soil productivity than
precommercial thin treatments and prescribed burn treatments.
The spatial context for the discussion of direct, indirect, and cumulative effects of the proposed action are
the harvest units (activity areas), including skid trails, landings, and temporary roads associated with the
proposed units. Effects to soils are generally confined to the site-specific location of activities (e.g., a
harvest unit, a landing, etc.). With few exceptions, soil cumulative effects occur only when management
activities occur on the same site.
Analyzing effects to soil at a landscape scale (i.e., by watershed) is inappropriate as it does not analyze
soil disturbance using a site-specific activity area approach as considered under the Region 1 Soil Quality
Standards (USDA Forest Service 1999). Additionally, due to the inherent variability of soil properties
such as texture, organic matter and surface cover, and the variable soil response to previous management
activities, it is not feasible to analyze past management effects on the soil at the landscape scale in a
meaningful way.
The temporal context considered for soil effects analysis is 3 years. As described previously, the Region 1
Soil Quality Standards (USDA Forest Service 1999) address the National Forest Management Act
(NFMA) by ensuring that soils will not be irreversibly damaged. Since soil quality standards are required
to be met within 3 years of the close of the project (USDA Forest Service 2011b), soil productivity would
be maintained over the short term. Additionally, soil recovery would occur in the years following
implementation as vegetation reestablishes. For example, in comparing detrimental soil disturbance after
post-fire salvage logging, a location that had a few years to recover before monitoring had less
detrimental disturbance (4 percent) compared to a site that was monitored 1 year after the project was
completed (28 percent) (Dumroese et al. 2006a). The study cited vegetative recovery as a reason for the
difference between the locations. However, not all soils recover at the same rate. Recovery is largely
dependent on the type of disturbance and the inherent characteristics of the soil in question. After 5 years,
the surface 10 cm of severely compacted coarse-textured soils experienced some recovery while finetextured soils showed little recovery in the same timeframe (Dumroese et al. 2006b). Similarly, after 16
years, a loamy soil showed no improvement in detrimental compaction found in skid trails (Rawinski and
Dumroese 2008).
To assess the potential longer-term effects of post-fire salvage logging on soil quality, and to gauge soil
recovery, a 7.5-acre unit less than 1 mile from Homestake Pass that burned in 1988 and was logged in
1989 was assessed in October, 2008 (internal monitoring). The unit currently meets lodgepole pine
222

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

stocking levels. Thirty-four plots were taken across the unit; no detrimental disturbance was found. Soils
in the unit are poorly developed sandy loams. The average litter depth was 1.58 cm; the average litter
depth of a nearby unburned control was 2.5 cm. Live plants and fine woody debris were present in 94
percent of the plots. Bare mineral soil was present at 14.7 percent of the plots, but was not detrimental.
Interestingly, 73.5 percent of the plots had some sort of biological soil crust present (e.g., moss and/or
lichen species). Usually the crust was present along with grasses or other plants. Common and important
in arid environments, biological soil crusts can take years to recolonize a site after fire (DeBano et al.
1998). The site appears to have mostly recovered since the fire and subsequent harvest. The harvest
activities took place during the time when soil quality standards were in the beginning stages of
development. At this time, awareness of the importance of reducing soil disturbance was increasing, but
the current Region 1 numerical standards did not exist. The fact that no detrimental soil disturbance was
noted when this unit was monitored in 2008 speaks to the effectiveness of minimizing soil disturbance to
protect long-term soil productivity, thus meeting the intent of NFMA.
Soils in the Homestake area were probably more detrimentally disturbed after salvage harvest (due to the
combination of effects from wildfire and harvest) than soils found in the project area are projected to be
after project implementation. Given these factors, and complying with the soil quality standards, and soil
and water conservation practices (see Design Features and Mitigation Measures previously in this
section), it is likely that the soil will have recovered to a large degree within 20 years of project
implementation.
Past, Present, and Foreseeable Activities Relevant to Cumulative Effects Analysis
Past management activities such as thinning and salvage have occurred throughout the project area;
several units had existing detrimental soil compaction from past harvest activities. The effects from past
timber management activities have been captured during onsite visits and are reflected in the existing
detrimental soil disturbance.
Grazing is an ongoing activity within the project area; at least one the proposed harvest units have
existing detrimental soil rutting attributed to livestock activity. The effects from ongoing grazing activities
have been captured during onsite visits and are reflected in the existing detrimental soil disturbance.
Recreational activities such as fire wood retrieval and dispersed camping are also ongoing activities
within the project area. The effects from recreational activities have been captured during onsite visits and
are reflected in the existing detrimental soil disturbance.
For more information about cumulative effects for this analysis, see the Cumulative Effects section
starting on page 228.

Alternative 1– No Action
Direct, Indirect and Cumulative Effects
Under alternative 1, there would be no direct, indirect or cumulative effects to the soil resource because
no project activities are proposed. Natural processes would continue. Ongoing activities including
recreational activities, grazing, and invasive plant species control would continue. Recreational activities
such as firewood retrieval and dispersed camping may result in minor, localized ground disturbance.
Cattle activity would generally be limited to cattle trails and comprise a very small amount of disturbance.
The Invasive Plant section describes a low risk of spread and effective treatment of invasive plant species;
therefore, the potential impact on soil productivity would be expected to be minimal (Invasive Plant
report).

223

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Soil cumulative effects generally occur only when management activities occur on the same site. Under
the no-action alternative, there are no direct or indirect effects to the soil resource from project activities,
and therefore no cumulative effects.

Alternative 2– Proposed Action
Direct Effects
Commercial Timber Harvest
Potential direct environmental effects of the commercial timber harvest component of the proposed action
on soil productivity include compaction, displacement, and rutting from machinery use during felling,
bunching, skidding, processing and loading logs, as well as soil heating from slash and understory
burning. All soils affected by commercial harvest are resistant to compaction and rutting when dry or
frozen. Projected detrimental disturbance for each proposed harvest unit in alternative 2 was determined
as described in the methodology section previously. Results for each unit are presented in table 66.

Haul routes on nonsystem roads include proposed newly constructed temporary roads and open and
closed unauthorized routes. Proposed temporary roads would be obliterated, and hence restored to some
degree (assuming 50 percent effectiveness, see Effectiveness to Restore DSD previously) after harvest is
completed. Open and closed unauthorized routes would be decommissioned (Table 66).
Implementation of the proposed action creates the potential for three harvest units (161 acres or 6 percent
of the proposed harvest acres) to exceed R1 Soil Quality Standards of 15 percent detrimental soil
disturbance per activity area (table 66, column E).
Subsoiling would occur on the following units to ensure compliance with the soil quality standards: 27ST
(20.6 percent DSD), 32ST (16.7 percent DSD), and 41S (20.7 percent DSD). The number of acres to be
treated would vary by unit depending on unit size and projected DSD (Table 67).

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Prescribed Burning
Potential direct environmental effects of the prescribed burn component of the proposed action (eight
prescribed burn units and post-harvest burning in commercial thin and seed tree units) are soil heating and
loss of surface cover due to burning. The potential for detrimental soil heating is low given that the
burning would occur in the spring or fall when soil moisture content is high. Spring burning is preferable
when the potential for long duration, high intensity burns is lower due to higher fuel moisture levels.
However, fall burning is also acceptable and the potential for soil heating is minimal if the prescribed
burn is implemented within proper prescription parameters and mitigation measures are followed.
Monitoring of the McVey and Doolittle prescribed burns on the BDNF indicates that prescribed burning
implemented in the spring resulted in an overall low soil burn severity (Fletcher 2011b). The surface
organic layers are not completely consumed and are still recognizable in areas of low soil burn severity;
therefore, the potential for detrimental soil disturbance due to loss of surface cover (i.e. organic matter) is
low. Detrimental soil disturbance due to soil heating or loss of surface cover is not expected in any of the
prescribed burn units.
Indirect Effects
Commercial Timber Harvest
Ground disturbing activities associated with the commercial timber harvest component of the proposed
action have the potential to expose mineral soil to overland flow and subsequent erosion. Probability of
erosion and estimated erosion rates was modeled for alternative 2 using Disturbed WEPP (assumptions
listed above in the methodology section). The probability of erosion reflects the occurrence of erosion
only for the year following harvest. Generally, for all harvest units, the probability of erosion would
decline every year following harvest due to natural vegetative regeneration.
The probability of erosion increases in one unit, 73S, from 0 percent to 2 percent. However, model results
for the proposed action - alternative 2 indicate an average annual erosion rate of 0 tons/acre/year for each
modeled harvest unit.
The Region 1 SQS state that the tolerable soil loss rate (average annual) is generally less than 1 to 2 tons
per acre per year (USDA Forest Service 1999). Based on the WEPP modeling, SQS for surface erosion
would continue to be met in all units under the proposed activities for alternative 2. Additionally, the
WEPP results do not take into account SWCPs listed in the Soil Resources project design features and
mitigation measures, chapter 2; in particular, providing drainage control and slash placement on skid
trails. These SWCPs will ameliorate disturbance associated with harvest, reduce erosion potential, and
hasten soil recovery.
Ground disturbing activities associated with the commercial timber harvest component of the proposed
action have the potential to spread invasive plant species into new, previously uninfested areas. The
potential areas of invasive plant species spread would be on soils disturbed by temporary road and skid
trail construction and landings. Based on a 2011 inventory, Canada thistle, common tansy, houndstongue,
musk thistle, oxeye daisy, spotted knapweed, and yellow toadflax are present in the Flint Foothills project
area mostly in rangeland and along roads; however, occurrences were noted in harvest units 1ST, 5ST, 6C,
19S, 20C, 22C, 24C, 25C, 27ST, 31C, 66C, 50S, 61S, and 79S (Invasive Plants report). These weed
species have the potential to affect soil productivity through competition for resources such as space,
light, water, and nutrients; and also through allelopathy. Allelopathy is defined as “chemical interactions
among and between plants that do not include positive effects” (Foy and Inderjit 2001). Allelopathic
invasive plant species exude chemicals that can have a negative effect on native plant species. Canada
thistle and spotted knapweed are known to be allelopathic (Foy and Inderjit 2001).

227

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

While the potential for impacts to soil productivity exists as a result of invasive plant species infestation,
the actual impact to long-term soil productivity is likely minimal, due to the following:
•

The Invasive Plant Species section describes a low risk of noxious weeds becoming
established and/or spreading in proposed treatment units within the project area.

•

The mitigation measures listed in chapter 2 include monitoring and treatment for invasive
plant species within units and along roads.

•

Treatment of invasive plant species with herbicides on the BDNF has been effective (infested
acres reduced by 48 percent over the last 10 years on the Pintler Ranger District) (Invasive
Plants section).

Prescribed Burning
Potential indirect environmental effects of the prescribed burn component from the proposed action are
potential accelerated erosion as a result of loss of surface cover due to burning, and loss of soil
productivity due to invasive plant species spread. Surface cover is an important attribute in determining
susceptibility to erosion. Work in burned forest soils by Noble (1965) and Orr (1970), as cited in
Robichaud and others (2000), found that 30 percent cover reduces erosion by half compared to bare soil
and 60 percent cover reduced sediment movement to negligible amounts. Monitoring of the McVey and
Doolittle prescribed burns on the Beaverhead-Deerlodge indicate post burn surface cover ranging from
96-100 percent. The potential for accelerated erosion as a result of loss of surface cover due to
implementation of the proposed action is low as surface cover post burn is expected to be more than
adequate.
The potential for increasing the density and spread of invasive plant species, and in turn negatively
affecting soil productivity is low. Project design features and mitigation measures for invasive plants
(chapter 2) would lead to low risk of increasing the spread and density of invasive plant species.
Cumulative Effects
The cumulative impact of past disturbance in addition to proposed harvest activities and prescribed burn
treatments under alternative 2 would not likely lead to long-term impairment of soil productivity, since
the Region 1 SQS would be met. Cumulative impacts may be greatest where ground vegetation and
ground cover is disturbed. Cumulative effects due to the proposed action activities and continued grazing
are possible; however, additional cumulative effects from cattle activity following harvest are not
expected because (1) no increases in cattle numbers or lengthening of the season of use would occur with
implementation of the proposed action, (2) trailing through the unit would likely use existing cattle/game
trails, and (3) allotments will be monitored for compliance with established grazing standards. Any
cumulative effects due to cattle activity and proposed harvest that may occur in units would generally be
limited to cattle trails and comprise a very small amount of disturbance.
Cumulative effects due to the proposed commercial timber harvest under alternative 2 and previous
harvest activity was projected to exceed SQS in three harvest units (27ST, 32ST, and 41S). These figures
do not take into account the fact that some of the existing disturbance in the harvest units due to old skid
trails and landings would probably be reused instead of creating additional DSD by constructing new skid
trails and landings. These units would need to be monitored to ensure that SQS are met at the conclusion
of the project. After project implementation, any harvest unit that does not meet standards would be
restored to ensure that 85 percent of the harvest unit is in satisfactory soil condition; this would assure
that productivity effects are reduced in the near term and eliminated over the long term.
Cumulative effects due to recreation would be limited to areas where proposed harvest units are also used
for recreational activities. Effects from firewood gathering are generally limited to a 50 to 100-foot

228

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

corridor from existing roads where firewood cutting activity has occurred. These effects are localized and
generally minor. No dispersed camping sites were noted within the proposed harvest units, and
obliteration of temporary roads would prevent unauthorized motorized access. Therefore, no cumulative
effects from recreational activities would be expected.
Roadside Hazard Removal #4 was recently completed. Some of the areas harvested under Roadside
Hazard Removal #4 are adjacent to harvest units under the Flint Foothills proposed action. Cumulative
effects, if they occur, would be limited to any skid trails used for the Flint Foothills units that also pass
through the roadside salvage units.
The cumulative effects of the proposed harvest and temporary road construction in addition to existing
effects from previous harvest and grazing are shown in Table 66, column E. This column displays the
effects before restoration measures are applied. In four harvest units a restoration plan has been developed
to assure compliance with the soil quality standards. The cumulative effects of existing detrimental soil
disturbance, DSD created by this project, and restoration of DSD is shown in Table 66, column G. All
units would meet the regional SQS. Monitoring would occur to ensure SQS are met.
Summary of Effects
Three harvest units (out of 65) are projected to exceed Region 1 SQS due to indirect, direct, and
cumulative effects from the proposed action. However, with the identified project design features and
mitigation measures, specifically restoration activities, all harvest units would meet the Region 1 SQS
requiring that new activities do not create detrimental soil conditions on more than 15 percent of an
activity area following project implementation and restoration activities, or in areas where more than 15
percent detrimental soil conditions exist from prior activities, the cumulative detrimental effects from
project implementation and restoration should not exceed the conditions prior to the planned activity.
Compliance with Forest Plan and Other Relevant Laws, Regulations, Policies and Plans
Alternative 2 would meet the standards to protect soil productivity set forth in the Region 1 Soil Quality
Standards (USDA Forest Service 1999) and referenced in the Beaverhead-Deerlodge Forest Plan (USDA
Forest Service 2009c).
o

No ground based yarding would occur on slopes greater than 35 percent that have not had
a site-specific analysis showing that damage is unlikely.

o

Alternative 2 would result in at least 85 percent of each activity area having soil that is in
satisfactory condition after any needed restoration measures are applied.

o

Mitigation measures used are shown to be effective

Alternative 3
Direct Effects
Commercial Timber Harvest
Table 68 displays the potential direct environmental effects of the commercial timber harvest component
of the proposed action on soil productivity including compaction, displacement, and rutting from
machinery use during felling, bunching, skidding, processing and loading logs, and soil heating from
slash and understory burning. These soils are resistant to compaction and rutting when soils are dry or
frozen. Projected detrimental disturbance for each proposed harvest unit was determined as described in
the methodology section above.

Haul routes include open and closed unauthorized routes. No proposed temporary roads would be
constructed in alternative 3 (new construction). Temporary roads on open or closed unauthorized routes

Implementation of alternative 3 would create the potential for two harvest units (157 acres or 8 percent of
the proposed harvest acres) to exceed R1 Soil Quality Standards of 15 percent detrimental soil
disturbance per activity area (table 68, Column E). Sub-soiling would occur on the following units to
ensure compliance with the soil quality standards: 27ST (20.0 percent DSD) and 32ST (16.7 percent
DSD). The number of acres to be treated would vary by unit depending on unit size and projected DSD
(table 69).

Units 27ST and 32ST would contain enough potential suitable acres for restoration treatments to ensure
that R1 SQS would be met post restoration. Unsuitable acres would include areas of existing disturbance
with impacts from livestock or mining, and inoperable ground such as rock outcrops and wet areas.
Prescribed Burning
Potential direct environmental effects of the prescribed burn component of the proposed action (eight
prescribed burn units and post-harvest burning in commercial thin and seed tree units) are soil heating and
loss of surface cover due to burning. The potential for detrimental soil heating is low given that the
burning would occur in the spring or fall when soil moisture content is high. Spring burning is preferable
when the potential for long-duration, high-intensity burns is lower due to higher fuel moisture levels.
However, fall burning is also acceptable and the potential for soil heating is minimal if the prescribed
burn is implemented within proper prescription parameters and mitigation measures are followed.
Monitoring of the McVey and Doolittle prescribed burns on the BDNF indicates that prescribed burning
implemented in the spring resulted in an overall low soil burn severity (Fletcher 2011b). The surface
organic layers are not completely consumed and are still recognizable in areas of low soil burn severity;
therefore, the potential for detrimental soil disturbance due to loss of surface cover (i.e., organic matter)
would be low. Detrimental soil disturbance due to soil heating and/or loss of surface cover is not expected
in any of the prescribed burn units.
Indirect Effects
Commercial Timber Harvest
Ground disturbing activities associated with the commercial timber harvest component of the proposed
action would have the potential to expose mineral soil to overland flow and subsequent erosion.
Probability of erosion and estimated erosion rates because of alternative 3 activities was modeled using
Disturbed WEPP (assumptions listed above in the methodology section). The probability of erosion
reflects the occurrence of erosion only for the year following harvest. Generally, for all harvest units, the
probability of erosion would decline every year following harvest due to natural vegetative regeneration.
The probability of erosion increases in one unit, 73S, from 0 percent to 2 percent from the existing
condition. However, model results for alternative 3 indicate an average annual erosion rate of 0
tons/acre/year for each modeled harvest unit.
The Region 1 SQS state that the tolerable soil loss rate (average annual) is generally less than 1 to 2 tons
per acre per year (USDA Forest Service 1999). Based on the WEPP modeling, SQS for surface erosion
would continue to be met in all units under the proposed action for alternative 3. Additionally, the WEPP
results do not take into account SWCPs listed in the Soil Resources project design features and mitigation

232

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

measures, chapter 2, in particular, providing drainage control and slash placement on skid trails. These
SWCPs will ameliorate disturbance associated with harvest, reduce erosion potential, and hasten soil
recovery.
Ground disturbing activities associated with the commercial timber harvest component of the proposed
action have the potential to spread invasive plant species into new, previously uninfested areas. The
potential areas of invasive plant species spread would be on soils disturbed by skid trail construction and
landings. Based on a 2011 inventory, Canada thistle, common Tansy houndstongue, musk thistle, oxeye
daisy, spotted knapweed, and yellow toadflax are present in the Flint Foothills project area mostly in
rangeland and along roads; however, occurrences were noted in harvest units 1ST, 5ST, 6C, 19S, 20C,
22C, 24C, 25C, 27ST, 31C, 66C, 50S, 61S, and 79S (Invasive Plants report). These weed species have the
potential to affect soil productivity through competition for resources such as space, light, water, and
nutrients; and also through allelopathy. Allelopathic weed species exude chemicals that can have a
negative effect on native plant species. Canada thistle and spotted knapweed are known to be allelopathic
(Foy and Inderjit 2001).
While the potential for impacts to soil productivity exists as a result of noxious weed infestation, the
actual impact to long-term soil productivity is likely minimal, due to the following:
•

The Invasive Plant section describes low risk of invasive plant species becoming established
and/or spreading in proposed treatment units within the analysis area.

•

The project design features and mitigation measures listed in chapter 2 include monitoring and
treatment of invasive plant species within units and along roads.

•

Treatment of invasive plant species with herbicides on the BDNF has been effective (infested
acres reduced by 49 percent on the Pintler Ranger District) (Invasive Plants report).

Prescribed Burning
Potential indirect environmental effects of the prescribed burn component of the proposed action are
potential accelerated erosion as a result of loss of surface cover due to burning and loss of soil
productivity due to noxious weed spread. Surface cover is an important attribute in determining
susceptibility to erosion. Work in burned forest soils by Noble (1965) and Orr (1970), as cited in
Robichaud and others (2000), found that 30 percent cover reduces erosion by half compared to bare soil,
and 60 percent cover reduced sediment movement to negligible amounts. Monitoring of the McVey and
Doolittle prescribed burns on the BDNF indicate post-burn surface cover ranging from 96 to100 percent.
The potential for accelerated erosion as a result of loss of surface cover due to implementation of the
proposed action is low as surface cover post burn is expected to be more than adequate.
The potential for increasing the density and spread of invasive plant species and in turn negatively
affecting soil productivity is low. Project design features and mitigation measures described for invasive
plant species (chapter 2) lead to a low risk of increasing the spread and density of noxious weeds.
Cumulative Effects
The cumulative impact of past disturbance in addition to proposed harvest activities and prescribed burn
treatments under alternative 3 would not likely lead to long-term impairment of soil productivity, since
the Region 1 SQS would be met. Cumulative impacts may be greatest where ground vegetation and
ground cover is disturbed. Cumulative effects due to the proposed action and continued grazing are
possible. However, additional cumulative effects from cattle activity following harvest are not expected
because (1) no increases in cattle numbers or lengthening of the season of use would occur with
implementation of the proposed action, (2) trailing through the unit would likely use existing cattle/game
trails, and (3) allotments will be monitored for compliance with established grazing standards. Any

233

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

cumulative effects due to cattle activity and proposed harvest that may occur in units would generally be
limited to cattle trails and comprise a very small amount of disturbance.
Cumulative effects due to the proposed commercial timber harvest under alternative 3 and previous
harvest activity was projected to exceed SQS in two harvest units (27ST and 32ST). These figures do not
take into account the fact that some of the existing disturbance in the harvest units, due to old skid trails
and landings, will probably be reused instead of creating additional DSD by constructing new skid trails
and landings. These units will need to be monitored to ensure that SQS are met at the conclusion of the
project. After project implementation, any harvest unit that does not meet standards will be restored to
ensure that 85 percent of the harvest unit is in satisfactory condition; this will assure that productivity
effects are reduced in the near term and eliminated over the long term.
Cumulative effects due to recreation would be limited to areas where proposed harvest units are also used
for recreational activities. Effects from firewood gathering are generally limited to a 50 to100-foot
corridor from existing roads where firewood cutting activity has occurred. These effects are localized and
generally minor. No dispersed camping sites were noted within the proposed harvest units. Therefore, no
cumulative effects from recreational activities would be expected.
Roadside Hazard Removal #4 was recently completed. Some of the areas harvested under Roadside
Hazard Removal #4 are adjacent to harvest units under the Flint Foothills proposed action. Cumulative
effects, if they occur, would be limited to any skid trails used for the Flint Foothills units that also pass
through the roadside salvage units.
The cumulative effects of the proposed harvest and temporary road construction in addition to existing
effects from previous harvest and grazing are shown in table 68, column E. This column displays the
effects before restoration measures are applied. In three harvest units a restoration plan has been
developed to assure compliance with soil quality standards. The cumulative effects of existing detrimental
soil disturbance, DSD created by this project, and restoration of DSD is shown in table 68, column G. All
units would meet regional SQS. Monitoring would occur to ensure SQS are met.
Summary of Effects
Two harvest units (out of 55) are projected to exceed Region 1 SQS due to indirect, direct, and cumulative
effects from the proposed action. However, with the identified project design features and mitigation
measures, specifically restoration activities, all harvest units would meet the Region 1 SQS requiring that
new activities do not create detrimental soil conditions on more than 15 percent of an activity area
following project implementation and restoration activities, or in areas where more than 15 percent
detrimental soil conditions exist from prior activities, the cumulative detrimental effects from project
implementation and restoration should not exceed the conditions prior to the planned activity.

Compliance with Forest Plan and Other Relevant Laws, Regulations, Policies and Plans
Alternative 3 would meet the standards to protect soil productivity set forth in the Region 1 Soil Quality
Standards (USDA Forest Service 1999) and referenced in the Beaverhead-Deerlodge Forest Plan (USDA
Forest Service 2009c).
•

No ground based yarding would occur on slopes greater than 35 percent that have not had a
site-specific analysis showing that damage is unlikely.

•

Alternative 3 would result in at least 85 percent of each activity area having soil that is in
satisfactory condition after any needed restoration measures are applied.

•

Mitigation measures used are shown to be effective.

Hydrology
This section documents existing conditions and the analysis of potential environmental effects to
hydrologic resources from the proposed Flint Foothills Project. Potential effects addressed consist of
impacts to water quality and stream channel morphology.

Overview of Issues Addressed
The public expressed concerns during scoping that permanent and temporary road construction could
affect water quality. To understand the tradeoffs of road construction Alternative 3 was developed to
exclude all new road construction. Both the proposed action and Alternative 3 are discussed in the
following report. Specific issues relevant to the analysis and associated indicators and measures are
discussed below.

Overview of Analysis
There are three hydrology -related questions commonly asked when land management projects are
proposed on the BDNF. Those questions include;
•

How will the project affect water quality

•

How will the project affect stream function

•

What are Project Related Effects on Floodplains

To better understand the answer to these questions we identified indicators and measures to that pertain to
the questions above.

Analysis Indicators and Measures
Analysis Question 1– What are Project Related Effects on Water Quality
Vegetation management activities proposed as part of this project have the greatest potential to influence
water quality by increasing sedimentation or temperatures in surface waters. Increases in sedimentation
are most likely to occur during timber harvest, log hauling or prescribed burns. Increases in water
temperatures are most likely to occur through removing riparian over-story and reducing shade.
Indicator 1- Effects from changes in sediment delivery to surface waters (streams, ponds and
wetlands).
Within the analysis area, ponds and wetlands are primarily located along stream corridors within their
RCAs. Our analyses estimated effects of sediment delivery to streams from proposed timber harvest
units, log hauling, new roads in RCAs, new stream crossings and from prescribed burning in RCAs. It
focuses on effects along stream corridors - within RCAs - where the potential for sediment to be
delivered to water is highest.
While analysis was not done to directly assess sediment delivery to isolated water bodies outside
stream corridors, we believe the effects described below are equally applicable. Forest Plan direction
establishes RCAs around all surface waters, and prescribes the same management within all RCAs.
Thus, the scope and magnitude of effects should be comparable.
The Disturbed WEPP model was used to estimate probabilities of sediment delivery to streams and
other surface waters for proposed harvest units.
For existing roads, the WEPP Roadmodel (Elliot et.al. 2000) was used to estimate current levels of
sedimentation, and those that would occur with higher traffic intensities during log hauling. Modeling
235

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

was done at nine sites that were currently delivering sediment from roads within the Gold Creek
watershed.
New roads can be a source of sedimentation where they are built near streams. We considered the
length of new road constructed within RCAs to help assess the potential for new sediment sources.
The most likely locations for sediment delivery from roads is at stream crossings. New crossings
created as part of this project are considered to help assess effects from sedimentation.
Prescribed burns will be ignited outside RCAs, but no fire lines will be constructed to prevent fire
from backing toward streams. We expect that fire would back into RCAs, however we don’t expect
them to back a substantial distance into RCAs with any great regularity.
The measures used to determine changes in sediment delivery to surface waters are:







Changes in sediment delivery to streams from timber harvest units
Changes in sediment delivery to streams from log- hauling
Miles of new roads within RCAs
Length of stream restoration using large wood placement
Number of new stream crossings
Length of RCA with prescribed fire burning within 100 feet of streams

Indicator 2– Effects from changes in water temperature
Change in exposure to solar radiation is the primary cause for increases in surface water temperatures.
Factors that influence exposure are stream channel orientation, water width, topographic shade and
vegetative shade (Cristea and Janisch 2007). The activities proposed for this project could only influence
vegetative shade, and this would only happen where vegetative canopy density is altered near the water’s
edge.
Cristea and Janisch (2007) stated that 120-foot buffers approximate canopy density in unharvested areas.
Beschta et. al. (1987) suggested a 98-foot-wide (30-m) buffer provides the same level of shading as that
of an old-growth stand. We chose the more conservative buffer width of 120 feet to evaluate water
temperature effects from newly created openings in vegetative canopy.
The measures used to determine changes in water temperature are:
 Total length of vegetation canopy opening created within 120 feet of streams from Timber
harvest units
 Total length of vegetative canopy opening created within 120 feet of streams from new road
construction
 Total length of vegetative canopy openings created within 120 feet of streams from
prescribed fire.
Indicator 3- Consistency of project effects with TMDL on Water Quality Limited Streams
Increases in water temperature, sedimentation and nutrients are the primary risks to water quality limited
streams, from the types of actions proposed by this project.
There are no streams within the analysis area impaired by high temperatures; therefore, no analysis for
effects of increased water temperatures on water quality limited streams was completed.
The measures used to determine consistency of project effects with TMDLs on Water Quality limited
Streams are:
 Changes in sediment delivery to sediment impaired waters, from timber harvest units

236

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement







Changes in sediment delivery to sediment impaired waters, from log hauling
Miles of new roads in RCAs of sediment impaired waters
Number of new stream crossings on sediment-impaired waters
Length of RCA with prescribed fire burning within 100 feet of sediment-impaired waters
Changes in nutrient delivery to nutrient impaired waters from prescribed fire

Analysis Question 2: What are Project Related Effects on Water Yield That Could Affect
Stream Channel Morphology
Indicator 1- Effects on water yield and peak flows from forest canopy removal
Where extensive timber harvest is concentrated within a watershed, there can be a notable decrease in
transpiration. There also is a substantial decrease in forest canopy and the interception of snow and rain
before it reaches the ground, decreasing the rate of evaporation. These changes can lead to increased
runoff and water yield (Troendle and King 1985). If water yield changes are substantial enough they can
affect channel form and stability. Montana DEQ (2012) states timber harvest should not increase the peak
water yield by more than 10 percent of historic conditions.
Stednick (1996) noted increased water yield could not be determined from stream flow measurements,
when forest cover reduction was less than 20 percent in a watershed. Grant et al. (2008) documented that
flow increases are generally not measurable until about 25 percent of the basal area of a forested
watershed has been harvested. These levels tend to be associated with a 10 percent increase in stream
flows; what Grant et. al. (2008) called a “10 percent detection limit” or the level of change required to be
measurable.
“Effective forest canopy removed” is a term introduced for this analysis, and is a quantification of the
reduction in canopy cover (in acres) from previous conditions.
For this project, forest canopy removal would occur from timber harvest, prescribed burning and forest
clearing for new roads.
The measures used to determine changes in water yield and peak flow are:





Acres of effective forest canopy removed from watersheds by timber harvest units
Acres of effective forest canopy removed from watersheds by temporary road construction
Acres of effective forest canopy removed from watersheds by prescribed fire
Percent of watershed acres with effective forest canopy removed

Analysis Question 3: What are Project Related Effects on Floodplains
Indicator 1- Effects on floodplains from new road construction
Adverse modification of a floodplain would primarily occur from the construction of new roads. The
greatest potential for negative impacts would be where a new road prism artificially confines flood waters
to a narrower corridor than evolved from natural events and processes.
The measure used to evaluate adverse changes to floodplains is:
 Miles of new road in RCAs

Affected Environment
Existing Condition
This section discusses those resources that may potentially be affected by the proposed project. Also
included are background data to provide context for later discussions of effects.

Watershed Description and Conditions
The project area totals 44,493 acres and is located within portions of the Barnes Creek, Clark Fork RiverDunkleberg Creek, Clark Fork River-Perkins Creek, Douglas Creek, Gold Creek, Lower Flint Creek-Gird
Creek and Pikes Peak Gulch 6th level watersheds, or HUC(Hydrologic Unit Code). The Hydrologic Unit
system is a standardized watershed classification system developed by U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in
the mid-1970s. Hydrologic units are watershed boundaries organized in a nested hierarchy by size. They
range in size from regions to the smaller cataloging units (HUCs), which are roughly equivalent to local
watersheds.
Past management activities with the project area that have influenced watershed conditions include placer
and lode mining, livestock grazing, timber harvest, prescribed fire treatments, and road construction and
maintenance. Mining has had detrimental effects on channels in some areas, with excessive sedimentation
leading to over-widened channels, such as seen in lower Douglas Creek. Ongoing impacts from existing
and past impacts from abandoned mines could include ground disturbance, sediment from access roads,
and minor forest clearing. Past impacts to water quality in mining areas in the project area have been
documented in several drainages and include heavy metal contamination in streams. Abandoned mine
sites may continue to be a source of water quality impairment.
Grazing can also impact streams, because cattle often congregate along streams and within riparian areas.
Watershed conditions were surveyed as part of this project, and within these grazing allotments conditions
appeared to be within FP grazing standards. Although none were observed, there are likely localized areas
where riparian areas are somewhat degraded or stream banks are modified by trampling and compaction.
Past vegetation and prescribed burning treatments were numerous within the project area. The list of past
treatments associated with ground disturbance is displayed in Appendix D. The earliest recorded harvest
treatments were completed between 1950 and 1959, with the most recent occurring in 2011. Douglas
Creek watershed has the highest percentage of area involved in past vegetation treatments at 8.2 percent.
Gold Creek, Lower Flint Creek-Gird Creek and Pikes Peak Gulch watersheds have 2.5, 4.1 and 1.5
percent of areas involved in past treatments, respectively. Barnes Creek, Clark Fork River-Dunkleberg
Creek and Clark Fork River-Perkins Creek all have less than 1 percent of watershed areas involved with
past vegetative treatments.
Currently, tree mortality in watersheds affected by mountain pine beetle ranges from 6 trees per acre at
Gold Creek watershed, to up to 310 trees per acre for Lower Flint Creek-Gird Creek watershed. This has
led to scattered mortality of overstory trees in some areas (Gump 2011). Currently, 100 percent of the
lodgepole pine stands with trees greater than 5 inches diameter at breast height ( dbh) in the Flint
Foothills watersheds have been affected by the mountain pine beetle, causing extensive tree mortality
(Vegetation section).
A stream system’s channel morphology, including streambed and streambank stability, reflects the
existing balance between stream flow, sediment input, and substrate/bank composition. If one of these
components varies, there is a corresponding change with the other two. When peak flow is increased,
there is an increase in the amount of energy available to transport sediment and erode streambanks. These
changes in turn can potentially result in modifications to water quality and aquatic habitat. Potential
changes in water yield can be found in the Environmental consequences section of this document.

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Historic stream surveys were completed on two project streams Pikes Peak Creek and the North Fork of
Douglas Creek. These stream surveys help us better understand stream channel stability and pick up early
indicators of morphology changes that could be attributed to anthropomorphic actions within the
watershed.
The results of these surveys show that both streams are functioning at risk with either static or slightly
upward trends. This is likely representative of most of the streams in the project area due to impacts from
grazing, mining, irrigation withdrawal, and roads primarily. Bankfull depths have increased slightly in the
North Fork of Douglas Creek (Pikes Peak Creek had irrigation withdrawals that masked changes) which
could indicate increased water yield from the mountain pine beetle epidemic although no effects have
been observed to indicate significant morphology changes or instability. Most of stream channels in the
project area have more well armored higher gradient channels that would respond even better to any
changes in water yield.

Water Quality
Water Quality across the project area is influenced by a number of factors including but not limited to
grazing, mining, road building, and natural sources. Montana DEQ under direction from the EPA is the
regulatory agency for determining water quality impairments and they are disseminated through TMDL
documents completed at the 4th code watershed level. The following information describes water quality
impairments in the project area.

Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs)
Water quality is defined by the level of impairment of designated beneficial uses for a given stream
drainage. Designated beneficial uses are defined under Title 17, Chapter 30, and Subchapter 6: “Surface
Water Quality Standards” in the Administrative Rules of Montana (ARM) (State of Montana, 2010a).
The waters within the proposed project boundary are classified as B-1 waters (State of Montana 2010a).
Water classified B-1 is suitable for drinking, culinary and food processing purposes, and after
conventional treatment; bathing, swimming and recreation; growth and propagation of salmonid fishes
and associated aquatic life, waterfowl and furbearers; and agricultural and industrial water supply.
For all streams, the State of Montana requires that "land management activities refrain from generating
pollutants in excess of those that are naturally occurring. Naturally occurring' is defined by the
Administrative Rules of Montana as that water quality condition resulting from runoff or percolation over
which man has no control or from developed lands where all 'reasonable' land, soil and water
conservation practices have been applied." Compliance with Montana water quality law requires: (1)
BMPs or project design features are applied, (2) Beneficial uses are not impaired, and (3) Monitoring
takes place to test whether BMPs are protecting beneficial uses.
Streams found to be impaired—not fully meeting water quality standards, or threatened—likely to violate
standards in the near future—are compiled with the State’s water quality standards, which are listed every
two years in the report required by Section 305(b) of the Clean Water Act. Impaired waters are often
referred to as “water quality limited” (WQL) and are identified in the “303(d) list”.
The 2011 GIS layer for 303(d) streams in Montana indicates that there are 16.2 miles of water quality
limited (WQL) streams within the project boundary including Barnes Creek, Dunkleberg Creek, North
Fork Douglas and Douglas Creeks and Gold Creek. Table 70 describes what is limiting water quality for
these streams.

Streams 303(d) listed must be scheduled for development of water quality improvement strategies. These
strategies are in the form of total maximum daily loads, or TMDLs intended to define the quantity of
pollutants that may be delivered to a water body without violating water quality standards. In practice,
they are plans to improve water quality in a listed water body until water quality standards are met (i.e.,
until designated uses are fully supported).

The sediment load allocation for Barnes Creek under the draft TMDL totals 461 tons/year, and allows for
1 ton of sediment delivered to the channel from all roads (Table 72). This represents an estimate of the
sediment expected to be delivered under all reasonable land, soil, and water conservation practices and
natural conditions.

The road sediment allocation represents a gross estimate of the sediment load once road BMPs are
applied. The TMDL assumes sedimentation from road treads, cutslopes, and fillslopes will be reduced to
100 feet on each side of a crossing once BMPs are applied. This distance is not a formal goal at every
crossing. For example, many roads may easily allow for a smaller contributing length, while others may
not be able to meet a 100-foot goal. Achieving this reduction in sediment loading from roads may occur
through a combination of methods.
The sediment load allocation for Douglas Creek under the draft TMDL totals 109 tons/year, and allows
for 1 ton of sediment delivered to the channel from all roads (Table 73).

Project Area Roads (Haul Routes) and Sediment
Existing roads within the analysis area provide the benefit of access for management activities and public
use including recreation, but can also have adverse impacts to the function of the watershed. Existing
water quality concerns relevant to the Flint Foothills analysis are primarily the result from sediment
delivered from roadways. Factors such as the condition of the road bed and its surface, its proximity to the
stream, and the interconnectedness of the road drainage with the stream system can influence sediment
delivery from area streams. Roads located along streams in RCAs can pose a higher risk of delivering
sediment to streams because there is less travel distance to infiltrate drainage leaving the road or cut- and
fill slope surface. Undersized culverts on roads in the project area, while not affecting current water
quality, are also a concern in that culvert failure during a large flow event would likely result in the
entrainment and deposition of large volumes of sediment within stream channels.

242

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

By intercepting subsurface water and routing it to the surface of the road, and through erosion of the road
surface and ditch networks, roads can alter physical processes in streams, leading to changes in flow
regimes, the movement and storage of sediment, bank stability and substrate composition. These changes
can have important biological consequences, affecting all stream ecosystem components (Furniss et al.
1991). The changes also can range from subtle to dramatic, depending on a variety of factors, including
the resilience of the watershed to disturbance, weather, traffic patterns, road surfacing material, condition
of the road surfacing, condition of the road profile (maintenance), and the interconnectedness of the road
drainage with the fluvial system.
Major fish bearing streams in the project area that may have been affected by existing road networks
include Dunkleberg Creek, Douglas Creek, SF Douglas Creek, MF Douglas Creek, NF Douglas Creek,
Gold Creek, NF Gold Creek, SF Gold Creek, Blum Creek, Crevice Creek, Pikes Peak Creek, and Gird
Creek. Refer to Figure 33 in the aquatics section for a map of these streams. Roads within each of the
watersheds have to some degree contributed sediment to stream channels, and altered hillslope drainage
patterns.
Field work in summer 2011 revealed a range of existing road conditions for potential haul routes. Roads
in valley bottoms, roads paralleling streams and within 300 feet of a stream, and roads with live stream
crossings generally pose the highest risk of contributing road-derived sediment. A road sediment survey
was conducted for the project area watersheds to evaluate existing rates of sedimentation. The survey
identified existing road segments that were hydrologically linked to stream channels, with a focus on
areas where roads crossed streams, and thus had the potential to deliver sediment to channels during
runoff events. These areas are summarized in detail in Table 74.
Road maintenance activities would include surface blading, vegetation removal, minor slump repair (5
cubic yards or less) and drainage structure cleaning, and installation. Reconstruction activities would
include the previous items as well as more significant roadway realignment, embankment and slump
repair over 5 cubic yards, curve widening, subgrade boulder or cobble excavation and removal, and
upgrades to accommodate safe timber haul. Refer to Figure 6 in Chapter 2 for a map of the road system in
the project area. Specific road maintenance and reconstruction activities for each road used as a haul route
are identified in Appendix A of the transportation report in the project file.

Existing Sedimentation from Roads: WEPP Roads
Road segments that are hydrologically linked to stream channels and thus have the potential to deliver
sediment to channels during runoff events were identified in the sediment source survey. Existing road
segments identified in the survey were modeled using the WEPP Roads model (Elliot et al. 1999). The
model’s output consists of predicted annual average sediment yield from the road prism, in terms of
pounds per year, based on site-specific climate data and road characteristics. The model estimated an
annual average sediment delivery to project streams under existing, current conditions. Results of
modeling are presented in Table 74.
The concept of an existing, current average annual sediment load is somewhat misleading in that sediment
delivery varies widely from year to year based mainly on runoff variability. In WEPP, the average annual
sediment load value is calculated based on a 2-year-return-interval runoff event—there is an equal
probability that the sedimentation could be greater or less than this value.
Comprehensive sediment management begins by identifying the existing primary sources of sediment and
developing a strategy that preferably minimizes or eliminates sources of sediment or the erosive action in
the first place. This can be accomplished by first reviewing all existing road segments posing sediment
delivery risk to the stream system, planning preventive measures that reduce or eliminate road-derived
sediment, and then implementing those measures. Identification of major sediment delivery sources to
streams on many roads in the Flint Foothills Project area are displayed in Table 74.

Water Quantity and Channel Stability
A stream system’s channel morphology, including streambed and streambank stability, reflects the
existing balance between stream flow, sediment input, and substrate/bank composition. If one of these
components varies, there is a corresponding change with the other two. When peak flow is increased,
there is an increase in the amount of energy available to transport sediment and erode streambanks. These
changes in turn can potentially result in modifications to water quality and aquatic habitat.
A review of the U.S. Geological Survey Water Information System Mapper indicates that there are no
U.S. Geological Survey (U.S.G.S) stream gaging stations within the project area. USGS gauging stations
are located on both sides of the project area on larger stream and rivers although are not a good indicator
of changes in water quantity within the project area.
In the Pintler Range, flows generally peak in the spring due to snow melt and rain on snow events. Low
base flows typically occur in the summer as temperatures increase and continue on into winter when
temperatures decrease, and precipitation tends to occur as snowfall. Smaller peak flows may be observed
in streams during the summer if convective thunderstorms occur and are associated with higher amounts
of rainfall.
Numerous studies have been done on water yield and streamflow changes after forest harvest. Bosch and
Hewlett (1982) found that streamflow changes correlated with the amount of the forest overstory canopy
removed (see Figure 29). Streamflow increases were highest in areas with greater amounts of mean
annual precipitation, and were generally short-lived as vegetation re-grew.

245

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Figure 29: Water yield relationship from Bosh and Hewlett 1982

According to the Flint Creek Planning Area Sediment and Metals TMDLs and Framework Water Quality
Improvement Plan (Montana 2012) timber harvest should not increase the peak water yield by more than
10 percent of historic conditions. If a natural disturbance, such as a forest fire or beetle kill, increases
peak water yield, the increase should be accounted for as part of timber harvest management.
The percentage of the watershed harvested is the most appropriate measure to determine potential effects
to water yield in a watershed. The current research (Grant et al. 2008) indicates that flow increases are
generally not measurable until about 25 percent of the basal area of a forested watershed has been
harvested in a 30 year period or less with a detection limit of 10%. Hydrologic recovery takes place
mainly as a result of vegetative re-growth where the flow or runoff patterns from watersheds return to
pre-disturbance conditions.
Past harvest has also occurred on private lands within the project area; when added to the percent
watershed harvested amounts shown in Table 75. The past harvest would not appreciably increase
changes in percent watershed harvested values. Private lands total 7,512 acres within the project area.
Currently, harvest on private inholdings has occurred on approximately 80 percent (about 5,500 acres) of
the forested portions. Most of the harvest on private land took place in the 1980s. Not all of the inholdings
are forested; about 10 percent are nonforested, dry grassland areas. Private land harvest would have to be
extensively and recently clearcut in order to increase percent harvest values to amounts needed to begin to
see flow increases because of project activities; this level of harvest was not observed on private lands
adjacent to the project area within the project watersheds.
Table 75 summarizes the percent of acres treated in the past for each of the 6th field watersheds. The
highest value is Douglas Creek at 6.1 percent. Full vegetation recovery from re-growth of vegetation
treatments is assumed at 30 years for stand clearcuts (Gump 2011). Recent clearcuts (within the last 10
years) can be observed in the project area; but they represent small acreage percentages and do not
appreciably affect watershed percent harvest. Some broadcast and underburning has occurred as part of
past projects. For the project area, past treatments are at various stages of recovery; depending on how
long ago they occurred.

Water yield changes from salvage harvested beetle killed stands
The percentage of a watershed harvested is important, especially for projects that have a significant
amount of green tree harvest but for salvage and stand resiliency projects like the Flint Foothils Project,
we need to use a different measure to truly understand water yield changes in the face of extensive beetle
killed timber.
The Flint Foothills project area has large stands of dead lodgepole where changes in water yield have
likely already occurred over much of the project area similar to what was found in the literature (Potts
1984).
The harvest of dead and dying lodgepole does not have an effect on water yield as it relates to water
uptake because it has already stopped with the trees death but the change in stand structure can have an
effect on water balances (Figure 30) as they relate to soil water content, interception, evaporation, and
drainage.
The effects on stand balance relates to the how moisture moves through the stand. For green forested
stands there are relatively equal components of interception, evaporation, and drainage. This is true
because green stands are able to uptake of snow and rain more effectively due to the extensive canopy,
provide more evaporation by holding water in there canopy which is more exposed to direct solar
radiation, and decrease drainage because of ample shading and water uptake that throughout the year.
For red stands that still have needles they still have the ability to intercept significant amounts of moisture
but are not able to utilize that water so drainage increases significantly. As a stand turns to grey the loss of
the needles decreases the ability of the stand to intercept moisture which leads to even greater drainage
but the evaporation is not as high as a salvage harvest because the tree structure provides some shading.
With a the overstory removal that comes with salvage that shading is gone so more of the incoming
moisture is loss to evaporation and therefore decreases drainage slightly when compared to grey stands.
This relationship is important to understanding the effects from salvage harvest on water yield. Drainage
directly relates to runoff and that is why we use different values in our analysis for various prescriptions
and do not analyze salvaging the same as green tree harvest.

247

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Figure 30: Modelled mean annual stand water balance for mature, red, grey, and salvage harvest lodgepole
pine stands (Huggard and Lewis 2007)

These differences can change the timing and magnitude of runoff although there are a number of variables
that can influence the runoff period including stand density, stand condition, slope, aspect, elevation, and
other environmental factors. Although there are a number of variables and factors that can influence the
timing and magnitude of runoff events, water yield is most closely correlated with the actual drainage
which is similar to dead lodgepole stands in various stages.
Short Term vs. Long Term
If MPB-attacked stands are left to deteriorate naturally, hydrologic change will be more gradual as trees
turn from green to red, drop their needles, turn grey, lose fine branches, and eventually fall to the ground
(Huggard and Lewis, 2007). At the same time, understory vegetation may release due to increased light
and reduced competition for nutrients and water. In contrast, salvage logging causes a more immediate
change to the site water balance through removal of the overstory. The hydrologic change associated with
salvage logging will also vary with the amount of ground disturbance, intensity and type of site
preparation, degree of drainage disruption, degree of understory damage, and rate of forest regrowth.

248

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

To address uncertainties around MPB impacts on stand-level hydrological recovery, Huggard and Lewis
(2007) used models of stand tree growth, field data on understory composition and measurements of
hydrologic recovery as snow accumulation and melt to generate recovery curves for various forest
management options in select IDF and MS subzones in the southern interior of BC. The results indicate
that salvage harvesting and planting results in the greatest increase in equivalent clearcut area (ECA) and
quickest recovery (12). Full retention of the dead stand has the lowest maximum ECA but the longest
recovery (Figure 31). In selecting a retention or salvage strategy it will be necessary to balance the risk of
a more intensive disturbance with the benefit of a quicker recovery (Huggard and Lewis, 2007).

Figure 31: Project Stand-level ECA of MPB-affected stands (pure pine stand)

The dotted lines in the figure above, are 95% confidence intervals (Huggard and Lewis 2007). Data for
the study came from more northern climates that need seeding for re-generation. That is not needed in the
Flint Foothills project area so salvaged and planted curves would be the same as just salvaged.
Canopy coverage is less in beetle killed dead lodgepole stands. After treatment, canopy would be
estimated to be 0-30 percent depending on the treatment type. Watershed scale changes in canopy would
not be expected to result in a measurable change to flow for several reasons. Recent beetle killed trees
may have contributed to canopy loss through mortality of overstory trees typically greater than 5 inches
dbh. This does not likely translate into full canopy loss in beetle killed stands however, because smaller
trees not affected by insect mortality may still occupy sites. These smaller trees often can function to
reduce evapotranspiration and decrease water yield. Further, the distribution of dead and dying trees
resulting from insect mortality was observed to be often not continuous and varies with difference in soil
moisture and other factors.
Water yield changes associated with the proposed project will be discussed in the cumulative effects
section of this report.

Riparian Areas and Riparian Conservation Areas
GIS data on riparian areas within the project area and the forest is limited. There is a “modeled” riparian
GIS layer. In this layer the presence of riparian vegetation is projected based on slope, aspect, and the use
of Digital Elevation Model (DEMs) and a portion of the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) wetlands
layer.
Riparian Conservation Areas (RCAs) are the portions of watersheds where riparian-dependent resources
receive primary emphasis. RCA definitions, goals, objectives and standards are defined in the Forest Plan.
In RCAs, management activities are subject to specific standards and guidelines. The Forest Plan (p. 300)
defines RCAs as, “300 feet from perennial streams and 50 feet from intermittent streams.” There are
many acres of intermittent and perennial RCAs in the project watersheds. These areas act as filters to
appreciably reduce the risk of sediment delivery to streams, provide a source of large woody debris for
channels, and help maintain cooler stream temperatures.

Wetlands
Springs and seeps occur throughout the project area although units were delineated to avoid wetlands or
springs in the project area. If unmapped and/or unidentified wetlands are observed during implementation
they will be avoided based on Forest Plan guidelines. National Forest System Road 636 between South
and North Gold creeks is on a north aspect slope and has a high density of springs. These springs are an
issue because of the need to maintain this road as a haul route for the project. The National Wetlands
Inventory (NWI) database helped to determine the presence of wetlands within the project area. This data
is summarized in the hydrology report in the project file. A small amount of wetlands were identified in
pre-commercial thinning units although no mechanical treatments will be used to complete this objective.

Desired Condition
Forest Plan direction for hydrologic resources that are applicable to this project are listed below.
Forestwide Goals for Aquatic Resources
Watersheds: Watersheds are maintained to ensure water quality, timing of runoff, and water yields
necessary for functioning riparian, aquatic ecosystems, wetlands, and to support native aquatic species
reproduction and survival. Watershed restoration projects promote long-term ecological integrity of
ecosystems, conserve genetic integrity of native species, and contribute to attainment of desired stream
function and support beneficial uses (IN 1).
Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs): Management actions are consistent with TMDLs. Where
waters are listed as impaired and TMDLs and Water Quality Restoration Plans are not yet established,
management actions do not further degrade waters. Water quality restoration supports beneficial uses.
Stream Channels: Stream channel attributes and processes are maintained and restored to sustain natural
desired riparian, wetland, and aquatic habitats and keep sediment regimes as close as possible to those
with which riparian and aquatic ecosystems developed (IN 2).
Instream Flows: Instream flows are secured to support functioning riparian and aquatic habitats, stable
and effective stream function, and ability to route flood discharges (IN 3).
Floodplains: The condition of floodplains, channels and water tables are maintained and restored to
dissipate floods and sustain the natural timing and variability of water levels in riparian, wetland, meadow
and aquatic habitats (IN 4).
Riparian Areas: Riparian habitat, species composition, and structural diversity of native and desired
nonnative riparian plant communities are maintained or restored to (IN 5-6):

aquatic-dependent species’ habitat needs and maintenance of metapopulations (IN 8).
Channel Integrity: Stream channel function and water quality are maintained or restored to support
designated beneficial uses on all reaches through management decisions, restoration projects or best
management practices as outlined in the Soil & Water Conservation Practices Handbook(1988).

total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) and their implementation plans for 303(d) impaired water bodies
influenced by National Forest System lands.
Road Drainage: Reconstruct road and drainage features that do not meet design criteria or operation and
maintenance standards, or are proven less effective for controlling sediment delivery, or retard attainment
of desired stream function, or increase sedimentation in Fish or Restoration Key Watersheds (RF 3a).
Roads: Close and stabilize or obliterate and stabilize roads not needed for future management activities
(RF 3c).

Environmental Consequences
Methodology
Field work was conducted to assess stream channel flow characteristics (perennial, intermittent, or
ephemeral), presence or absence of wetlands and overall watershed condition, and to examine these
characteristics relative to the location of the proposed action. In addition to field data, best available
science, literature reviews, Forest monitoring reports, geographical information system (GIS) data, and
professional judgment were also used to support report conclusions.
Field reconnaissance for hydrologic resources was conducted in August 2011 to evaluate existing
watershed conditions and the potential effects to these resources related to the proposed action. Proper
functioning condition data was noted for several of the stream drainages that were visited. This
information is provided in hydrology report in the project file.
The WEPP Road model was used to predict sediment transport from roads to stream channels. The
Disturbed land WEPP model was also used to evaluate hillslope erosion (Soils section). Input data used to
run these models were collected in the field during sediment surveys. The physical basis and performance
of the WEPP models is discussed in the model documentation (Elliot et al. 1999, 2000) as well as several
peer-reviewed papers (e.g., Larsen and MacDonald 2007; Laflen et al. 2004(=). Many, erosion prediction
models poorly predict sediment erosion from a road, hillslope, or watershed at time scales useful to land
managers. This is due mainly to a high degree of variability in site characteristics and in climatic
variables. An average erosion/sediment delivery rate prediction can encompass this variability to some
degree, although this value becomes much more useful when combined with a predicted probability that
erosion will occur. The WEPP models used in this analysis incorporate climate data tailored to the
individual site using PRISM data (Daly et al. 2001) and simulate daily events for a number of years
specified by the user (30 years in this analysis) to determine the probability of sediment leaving the unit.
The model incorporates individual precipitation event characteristics and antecedent conditions as well as
site characteristics into its prediction of average annual runoff, erosion, and sediment yield values.
Model results are used to indicate the magnitude of change that would likely occur following
implementation of treatments within a unit. The accuracy of predicted erosion generated by WEPP is at
best ±50%, because the processes driving erosion and sediment transport exhibit high spatial and
temporal variability. Numerous research endeavors have shown that erosion rates vary considerably for
identical plots, or from year to year for the same plot. The model results presented here are most useful
for the comparison of alternatives; they are not absolute or measured values of erosion generation or
delivery for units post-treatment.
Water yield Methodology
Where extensive forest canopy removal occurs in a watershed, there can be changes in runoff and water
yield (Troendle and King 1985; Winkler et al. 2010). If water yield changes are substantial they can affect
channel form and stability.
Changes in water yield tend to be proportional to reductions in canopy cover or to the percent of tree
basal area removed (Winkler et al. 2010). The reductions that occur in vegetative transpiration (from loss
or death of trees) and snow and rain interception and evaporation (from loss of canopy cover), and
increases in net precipitation reaching the ground are primary factors causing increases in water yield.
Thus, the extent of change in canopy cover caused by different events should be considered. For example,
a thinning prescription has a different potential for effect than clear-cutting green trees. Further, clear
cutting green trees would have a different level of effect than salvaging dead timber (Pugh and Gordon
2012; Redding et. al. 2008; Winkler et. al. 2010). This is because respiration would have already ceased
in dead trees, and (depending on how long the trees have been dead) the canopy cover may be
substantially different from what green trees provide.
253

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Large-scale beetle mortality in a watershed tends to have less effect on water yield than removal of green
trees (Winkler et al. 2010). This results from intermediate changes in transpiration, rain and snow
interception, evaporation and snowmelt processes, because: 1) beetles target larger trees leaving some
proportion of live trees in most stands, (2) harvesting results in immediate removal and change in most of
the factors that influence water yield, while beetle induced mortality results in a “phased” decline in those
processes. For example, the canopy slowly declines over 1-3 years as the needles fall off, allowing time
for understory vegetation to increase and assume some of the role the overstory played in hydrologic
processes, (3) clear-cut harvest essentially results in immediate 100 percent removal of the tree canopy
while beetle-killed trees remain standing for 15 to 20 years, providing some interception and shade, and
(4) harvesting using mechanical equipment tends to result in soil compaction which reduces water
infiltration rates and promotes overland flows.
For this analysis we considered (1) large scale removal of dead trees would have a smaller effect on water
yield and peak flows than removal of green trees; (2) large scale removal of beetle killed trees in the red
phase (dead with needles remaining) would have greater effects on flows than removal of trees in the gray
phase (dead with needles gone); (3) the different types of vegetative treatments proposed will result in
different levels of canopy removal and will be treated accordingly.
The timber harvest prescriptions proposed as part of this project are:
•

Salvage harvest

•

Commercial thinning

•

Precommercial thinning

•

Seed Tree Removal

We estimate 90 percent of the trees in salvage clear-cut units are dead and that approximately 70 percent
of them are in the red phase, retaining some portion of their original canopy characteristics (personal
communication - Rob Gump; Forest Silviculturist). Given this, we assumed canopy removal through
salvage clear-cut would exhibit about 65 percent of the effects on water yield and peak flows as clearcutting green trees.
Current canopy densities in the project area range from 30-50 percent. Meeting objectives for commercial
thinning would reduce green-tree canopy density to about 20 to 30 percent, resulting in about a 40 percent
reduction in canopy cover. Precommercial thinning would result in approximately the same 40 percent
reduction in canopy cover. Seed tree removal would reduce green tree canopy densities to about 5-10
percent resulting in an estimated 80 percent reduction in canopy cover.
Low-elevation prescribed burn units would target understory trees to reduce green-tree canopy density.
Overstory canopy would not be reduced by more than 10 percent based on prescriptions and vegetation
objectives. In mid-elevation burn units, an estimated 50 percent of forest overstory would be killed and
left standing or killed and removed (personal communication – Rob Gump; Forest Silviculturist).
We assume areas cleared for temporary roads will have the same effect as clear-cutting green trees; where
100 percent of the forest overstory would be removed over an estimated 20-foot wide swath for a distance
equal to the proposed length of road. We utilized the information above to prorate canopy removal based
on tree condition (green = live; red = dead with needles retained; gray = dead with no needles) and
vegetation prescriptions. We estimated “effective canopy removed” (ECR) based on the type of timber
harvest or burn treatment or clearing for temporary roads. For example:
•

In a commercial or precommercial thinning unit: ECR = Unit Acres x 0.4

•

In a salvage clear-cut unit: ECR = Unit Acres x 0.65

254

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

•

In a seed tree unit: ECR = Unit Acres x 0.8

•

In a mid-elevation prescribed burn unit: ECR = Unit Acres x 0.5

•

In a low-elevation prescribed burn unit: ECR = Unit Acres x 0.1

These adjustment factors were used to calculate the Effective Canopy Reduction (ECR) and were based
on general assumptions regarding the extent of tree removal that would occur with each type of
prescription (personal communication – Rob Gump; Forest Silviculturist)
For a temporary road: ECR=(length of temporary road (ft.) x width of tree clearing(ft.)) divided by
(43,560 (the number of square ft. in an acre)) x 1.0 (100 percent tree removal)

Spatial and Temporal Context for Effects Analysis
The spatial boundary for site specific direct and indirect effects is delineated by those portions of seven
6th-level watersheds occurring within the project boundary, plus the Lower Boulder Creek watershed
(Figure 32). Direct and indirect effects analyzed at the watershed level used the full extent of those eight
watersheds.
Cumulative effects are considered over the full extent of those eight watersheds. Effects within the last 3
years are considered short term. Long-term effects are expressed over periods longer than 3 years.

Past, Present, and Foreseeable Activities and Events Relevant to Cumulative Effects
Analysis
Cumulative effects represent the incremental impact of a proposed action, summed with other past,
present and reasonably foreseeable actions and events within the same watershed.
Past, present and reasonably foreseeable activities and events within the analysis area that may affect
water resources are displayed in Appendix D and include but are not limited to: timber harvest, prescribed
burning, livestock grazing, range improvements, mining, mine reclamation, water diversion, noxious
weed control, fish passage improvements, dispersed camping, the presence and use of roads and trails,
road and trail maintenance and improvements, beetle related tree mortality, wildland fire, wildland fire
suppression, and firewood cutting.
Cumulative effects are also considered under each alternative. Any activities and events not discussed,
lack the tendency for notable hydrologic effects within the analysis area.

256

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Alternative 1 – No Action
Direct, Indirect and Cumulative Effects
Since no activities are proposed for alternative 1, there would be no direct, indirect or cumulative effects
to water quality, or stream channel morphology from this alternative.
Existing conditions would not be immediately affected. Where sediment is currently being introduced to
streams and other surface waters, it would continue at a current or increased rate. Water yield changes
associated with the beetle epidemic would continue and recovery of the stands that would not be salvaged
may take a longer period of time to recover.
The no-action alternative would not conflict with TMDL requirements, but would also do nothing to help
meet the goals and objectives of the TMDL to reduce sedimentation and improve water quality in
impaired waters within the project area.
Since no activities are proposed in Alternative 1, there would be no direct, indirect or cumulative effects
to floodplains.

Alternative 2 – Proposed Action (Figure 5)
Direct and Indirect Effects
Analysis Question 1: What are the effects on water quality?
Indicator 1- Changes in sediment delivery to surface waters (streams, ponds and wetlands).
Measure –Changes in sediment delivery from timber harvest units: Disturbed WEPP modeling
(using required RCA buffers) for each proposed timber harvest unit, showed little likelihood of
measurable sediment delivery to surface waters from timber harvest units. Probabilities for
delivery ranged from 0 to 2 percent (Soils section).
Measure –Changes in sediment delivery from timber hauling: Estimates from the Road WEPP
model for nine stream crossings on project haul routes within the Gold Creek watershed represent
the range of likely effects from log hauling across the analysis area. Existing sediment delivery
for those sites (pre-project implementation) range from 26 to 623 lbs/year.
Based of review of BMP’s effectiveness in the project area, we believe approximately 20% of the
delivery sites would have small increases in sediment delivery during log-haul, approximately
50% of sediment delivery sites BMP’s would be effective in ensuring no additional sediment
delivery during haul with likely beneficial effects especially post haul, and at 30% of sites, best
management practices would fully compensate for haul- related sediment delivery with benefits
during and following timber hauling activities. Overall, the analysis indicated total sediment
delivery would be fully be accounted for with the implementation of BMP’s with some reduction
possible. After project implementation, BMP improvements would result in an estimated 40
percent reduction in total sediment delivery from current conditions.
Our observations and knowledge of the area indicate the situations modeled are representative of
the range of situations elsewhere in the analysis area. Thus estimates generated by the model
should be representative of the scope, frequencies and magnitudes of sediment deliveries from
existing roads in un-modeled locations within the analysis area.
Measure – Miles of new roads within RCAs: Default distances for RCAs (unless a site specific
analysis is conducted) are essentially: 1) 300 feet from a perennial stream; 150 feet from ponds ,
257

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

lakes and wetlands greater than 1 acre, and either 50 or 100 feet for intermittent and ephemeral
channels. Please refer to the glossary for more detailed descriptions. For this analysis we used
300 feet for perennial streams and 150 feet for intermittent and ephemeral channels, because there
may be wetlands associated with them.
Approximately 0.7 miles of temporary road would be constructed or reconstructed in RCAs
within the analysis area. The RCAs where 0.5 miles of temporary road work will occur lack a
defined stream channel. Any water flow is ephemeral and in nature.
Temporary roads T2 and T3 used to access Unit 55C would result in about 0.32 miles of road in
the RCA of an un-named tributary to Flint Creek, where there is no defined stream. The new road
would occur near the headwaters, in an ephemeral draw. While some sediment delivery is
expected to the RCA, we expect the effects to be nominal and the limited to the area adjacent to
the road, since there is no stream channel to act as a conduit for sediment transport. A fully
formed stream channel appears to be present below the Forest Boundary. However, water from
this tributary is fully diverted for irrigation 2.4 miles downstream and does not reach Flint Creek.
There would be about 0.2 miles of reconstruction on an existing road (T17) within the RCA of an
unnamed tributary to Dunkleberg Creek. As with the unnamed tributary to Flint Creek, there is no
defined stream channel where road construction would occur. With application of BMPs during
reconstruction, the amount of erosion and delivery to the RCA is expected to be minor, and would
not be transmitted to Dunkleberg Creek.
Temporary road (T21) proposed for construction near Gird Creek, to access harvest unit 68C.
About 0.17 miles of the road would be in the RCA. Gird Creek has a defined and flowing stream
channel that narrowly fails to meet RMOs for width/depth (10.6) and large wood (17
pieces/mile). With application of BMPs during road construction and decommissioning, the
amount of sediment introduction from the road would be minor and temporary.
Measure –Length of stream restoration: Stream restoration using placement of large wood would
occur in approximately 0.2 miles of stream where temporary road construction occurs in the RCA
of Gird Creek. Wood used for restoration would come from trees cut during road construction.
Placement of large wood would be done in a manner that creates and improves pool habitat,
promotes sediment capture and retention, and/or improves stream width to depth ratios. Wood
would be placed at a frequency that consistent with a minimum of 20 pieces per mile.
Minor amounts of sediment would be introduced from this restoration action. It would be
temporary and measurable where it settles out a short distance (within a couple hundred feet)
downstream of each treatment. The benefits of sediment capture and retention should fully
compensate for the minor and temporary effects of sediment delivered from temporary road
construction and reconstruction; and provide additional long-term benefits related to stream
function well into the future.
Measure – Number of new stream crossings: One new stream crossing would result from
temporary road T21 in Lower Flint Creek-Gird Creek, and another road T3 would cross the
ephemeral draw on the un-named tributary to Flint Creek. Increases in sediment delivery would
occur during construction and removal of the crossing. However, Streamside Preservation Act
(SPA) permits would be required and requirements common to these permits mitigate sediment
introduction to commonly accepted levels. Thus, effects are expected to be slight, but measurable
for a few hundred feet below the crossing and would persist only until the next annual or seasonal
high water event following placement and removal.

258

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Measure – Length of RCA with prescribed fire burning within 100 feet of stream: While there
would be no ignitions of prescribed burns within RCAs, there is potential for fire treatments to
back into RCAs, because fire lines would not be constructed to prevent this from happening.
However, RCAs tend to be wetter, with higher humidity and plant moisture levels than upland
areas. These characteristics tend to inhibit and stall fire progression.
Although we expect some level of fire entry into the RCAs, it would occur with relatively low
frequency, exhibiting burn patterns that are fragmented and scattered, and representative of the
spotty and undulating, mosaics commonly seen along the margins of fires.
Based on objectives and the way fire would be applied, where prescribed burn units are adjacent
to RCAs and mid-elevation prescriptions are applied, we estimate mid-elevation fire prescriptions
would back into the RCA between 0 and 10 percent of the linear length of streams. Low-elevation
prescriptions would back into the RCA between 20 and 30 percent of the stream length.
We estimate mid-elevation prescriptions would result in burning within 100 feet of the stream for
0-1 percent of the RCA’s length, and for low-elevation prescriptions, we expect this to occur from
1-5 percent of the RCA’s length. We do not expect fire to burn to the water’s edge under either
prescription within the analysis area.
The chance of sediment delivery increases once the fire gets to within 100 feet of a stream.
However, we expect the amount delivered would be much less than from a road that is a similar
distance away, because: (1) the expected prescriptions would result in the maintenance of largely
intact duff layers, which would allow a reasonable level of water percolation and filtration; and
(2) RCAs would not tend to have the continuous slope and homogeneous, largely impermeable
surface exhibited by roads. Surface irregularities from shrubs, trees, woody debris, and unburned
and burned grasses and sedges tend to fragment and slow surface flow. This discourages
concentration of water into flowing conduits that promote erosion and sediment transport.
Riparian conservation areas’ surface characteristics tend to promote slower moving, shallower
water with tendencies toward dropping sediment, rather than eroding and transporting it.
Based on our estimate above, prescribed fire treatments have the potential to back into RCAs and
burn within 100 feet of 11 different streams and 7 stream systems (named stream plus its unnamed tributaries) (Table 76).
The highest estimated length of stream with prescribed fire within 100 feet would be Blum Creek
(417 ft.). We estimate an additional 211 feet could occur within the Blum Creek stream system on
three un-named tributaries. Where this occurs, we assume there is some risk to exposed soils that
could result in sediment movement and transport; however, we expect delivery would occur only
occasionally and not in substantive amounts.
There will be long-term restoration benefits related to prescribed fires in RCAs. They are
associated with soil and vegetative rejuvenation and displayed through increased growth and
production of understory vegetation from nutrient recycling. This will provide benefits in
sediment filtering capabilities. There is also the likelihood of a low percentage of mortality to
over-story trees. Because of the limited scope and mosaic pattern of fire in RCAs, it would
promote a small level of large wood recruitment; that would bridge the longer periods of time
where natural ecological events cause overstory mortality at larger scales. The long term benefits
to the riparian area and stream channel will outweigh any short term impacts.

Indicator 1 Summary – Measurable levels of sediment are not expected to be delivered to surface waters
from timber harvest units.
Based of review of road BMP’s effectiveness in the project area, we believe approximately 20% of the
delivery sites would have small increases in sediment delivery during log-haul, approximately 50% of
sediment delivery sites BMP’s would be effective in ensuring no additional sediment delivery during haul
with likely beneficial effects especially post haul, and at 30% of sites, best management practices would
fully compensate for haul- related sediment delivery with benefits during and following timber hauling
activities.
About 0.17 mile of temporary road would be constructed in Gird Creek’s RCA with one stream crossing.
About 0.33 miles of temporary road would be constructed in the RCA of an unnamed tributary of Flint
Creek, and about 0.2 miles of reconstruction would occur on an unnamed tributary of Dunkleberg Creek.
With application of BMPs during construction and decommissioning, the amount of sediment
introduction to surface waters is expected to be minor and short term, with no measurable effects to Flint
and Dunkleberg Creeks. There would likely be a measurable change in sediment levels in Gird Creek for
a few hundred feet downstream of the road crossing, but the effects would persist only until the next
annual or seasonal high water event following placement and removal of the crossing LWD would occur
in approximately 0.7 miles of stream. The benefits of sediment capture and retention should fully
compensate for the minor and temporary effects of sediment delivered from temporary road construction
and reconstruction; and provide additional long-term benefits related to stream function well into the
future.
Based on WEPP modeling there will be no net increase in sediment delivery across the project area during
haul and a 40 percent reduction after the hauling is completed. These reductions would result from
implementing BMPs on all haul route segments in RCAs. A more detailed description of BMP
implementation can be found in the engineering section.
It is difficult to estimate sediment delivery to streams from the proposed prescribed fire units. We expect
some sediment to reach surface waters, however, we expect effects would be unmeasurable, for the
reasons described above. To validate this, we will monitor Blum Creek (the stream with the highest
estimated length of RCA that would be burned within 100 feet of the stream; to identify if treatments
result in any new sediment delivery sites.

260

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

In summary, we expect sediment introduction would occur in one new location within the analysis area
from construction and removal of a temporary road and stream crossing (road T21 along Gird Creek). The
increase in fine sediment would be minor, but may be measurable for several hundred feet of Gird Creek
and possibly for a similarly short distance in an unnamed tributary to Flint Creek. The increase would be
short term (less than 1 year each, for construction and removal). The benefits of stream restoration and
the the rejuvenating effects of prescribed fire on the soil and vegetation in RCAs would compensate for
the short term effects of sedimentation and will provide additional benefits into the future.
Indicator 2 – Change in water temperature39
Measure – Vegetation canopy openings created within 120 feet of streams from timber harvest
units: There would be no timber harvest in RCAs. Thus, there would be no vegetative canopy
openings created within 120 feet of streams.
Measure – Vegetation canopy openings created within 120 feet of streams from new road
construction: A segment of the temporary road proposed to access timber unit 68C would result
in the removal of forest canopy within 120 feet of Gird Creek, for an estimated distance of 900
feet. This segment of road (and the associated canopy removal) would angle toward the stream,
cross it and then terminate at its junction with existing NFS Route 666, shortly after the crossing.
We estimate the opening for the road would average approximately 50 feet from the stream.
Segments of temporary roads T2 and T3 would be within the RCA of an un-named tributary to
Flint Creek. They would be within 120 feet of the stream for a distance of 1200 feet, averaging
approximately 40 feet from the stream.
Measure – Vegetation canopy openings created within 120 feet of streams from prescribed fire:
Based on the prescriptions proposed, there would be no prescribed fire ignitions within RCAs, but
fire would be allowed to back into RCAs along adjacent streams in the project area. The burns
would be designed, so there may be mortality to a few over-story trees and or shrubs in RCAs,
but it would not occur at a level that would result in water temperature changes.
Indicator 2 Summary – There would be no forest canopy removal in RCAs from timber harvest. Thus,
there would be no loss of riparian canopy within 120 feet of streams.
Prescribed burning would not affect riparian canopy within 120 feet of streams to any level substantive
enough to cause increased water temperatures.
There are two locations where changes in riparian shading is likely to influence stream temperatures. The
first is along Gird Creek, where temporary road T21 would be constructed. The 900 foot clearing for the
road would reduce the riparian canopy (providing shade for the stream) to an average width of 50 feet.
Using this information, we extrapolated the likely change in maximum temperature from data presented
in Figure 11 of Cristea and Janisch (2007). We estimate the increase in maximum stream temperatures
would be about 0.5ᵒ F.
Temporary roads T2 and T3 would be constructed in the RCA of an unnamed tributary to Flint Creek for
about 1200 feet. The clearing for the road would reduce the riparian canopy to an average width of about
40 feet. If there were a live stream channel, we estimate the increase in maximum water temperatures
would be about 0.8ᵒ F. However, because of the ephemeral characteristics there would be no temperature
related effects. There is no potential for temperature related effects to be transmitted to Flint Creek

Riparian canopies that extend at least 120 feet from a stream’s edge provide shade at a level comparable to
unharvested conditions (Cristea and Janisch 2007).

39

261

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Johnson (2004) found that shading 200 meters of a small stream in Oregon reduced maximum
temperatures by as much as 1ᵒ C (1.8 ᵒF) from those upstream. Based on this, we believe any increase in
maximum temperatures created by the temporary road would persist for a short distance downstream
where canopy and shading would remain altered.
Indicator 3 – Consistency of alternative 2 effects with TMDLs on water quality limited streams.
No streams in the analysis area are impaired by high temperatures, so no further analysis will be done on
temperature effects to 303(d) listed streams.
Barnes and Douglas Creeks are the only streams that are impaired due to sediment.
Measure – Estimated changes in sediment delivery to Barnes and Douglas Creeks from timber
harvest units: Disturbed WEPP modeling for proposed timber harvest units showed little
likelihood of measurable sediment delivery to any stream; Barnes and Douglas Creeks included
(Soils section).
Measure – Estimated changes in sediment delivery to Barnes and Douglas Creeks from log
hauling: There are no haul routes within the RCA of Barnes Creek, so there would be no
measurable change in sedimentation related to log hauling.
Based of review of BMP’s effectiveness in the project area, we believe approximately 20% of the
delivery sites would have small increases in sediment delivery during log-haul, approximately
50% of sediment delivery sites BMP’s would be effective in ensuring no additional sediment
delivery during haul with likely beneficial effects especially post haul, and at 30% of sites, best
management practices would fully compensate for haul- related sediment delivery with benefits
during and following timber hauling activities.
Based on WEPP modeling we do not anticipate an increase in sediment delivery in the Douglas
Creek watershed. Although there are a number of sediment delivery sites identified in the
watershed recent road work and continued maintenance prior to implementation should account
for any change in traffic levels. We also anticipate a substantial reduction in sediment delivery
following hauling actions. These reductions would result from implementing BMPs on all haul
route segments in RCAs. A more detailed description of BMP implementation can be found in the
engineering section.
Measure – Miles of new roads within RCAs (300 feet of Barnes and Douglas Creeks): There
would be no new National Forest System or temporary roads within 300 feet of Barnes or
Douglas Creeks, so there would be no measurable change in sedimentation related to new road
construction in RCAs
Measure – Number of new stream crossings on Barnes and Douglas Creeks: There would be no
new stream crossings on Barnes or Douglas Creeks, so there would be no measurable change in
sedimentation from new crossings.
Measure – Length of RCA with prescribed fire burning within 100 feet of Barnes and Douglas
Creeks: There are no prescribed fire units proposed near Barnes Creek, thus, none of its RCA
would be burned within 100 feet of the stream.
Based on the assumptions outlined above in the Analysis of Indicators and Measures section of
the Overview of Analysis, we estimate about 49 feet of Douglas Creek’s RCA could burn within
100 feet of the stream; with a very low likelihood of any fire reaching the stream edge. Further,
we would not necessarily expect the estimated 49 feet of RCA would be continuous (i.e. all of it
would not occur in a single location) along a stream. Rather, it is more likely to be scattered over

262

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

several locations with the result an undulating, mosaic pattern commonly seen along the margins
of prescribed burns.
RCA surface characteristics (described previously) generally do not encourage the concentration
of water to an extent that it accelerates soil erosion and transports sediment. Rather they promote
slower moving, shallower water with tendencies toward dropping sediment.
Based on this, we expect little to no increase in sediment delivery to Douglas Creek, and no
measurable effects from sedimentation related to prescribed burning.
Measure - Changes in nutrient delivery to nutrient impaired waters from prescribed fire. Under
Alternative 2, there should be no measurable change in nutrients because physical characteristics
of RCAs tend to encourage deposition rather than transport of materials. Based on our analysis
aprroximately 127 feet could have prescribed fire backing within 100 feet of TMDL listed
streams, this small amount and adequate buffers will ensure no measurable impacts are observed.
Nutrient limited streams within the analysis area include Dunkleberg, Gold, Barnes and Douglas
Creeks. There are no proposed burn units near Dunkleberg, Gold or Barnes Creeks under
Alternative 2. As such there would be no risk of nutrient related effects. There are three proposed
units adjacent to Douglas Creek (1B, 2B and 6B), treating 15, 22 and 163 acres. Based on the
areas treated and the conditions under which prescribed burning is done, we expect no
measurable change in nutrient inputs into Douglas Creek. To validate this we will monitor water
quality during and after treatment, there.
Indicator 3 Summary: We expect no measurable change from existing sedimentation in Barnes Creek
from implementing this project. Application of BMPs to the road within RCAs along Douglas Creek
should be sufficient to account for any increase in sediment delivery during log hauling and substantial
decrease sediment delivery following project implementation.
We expect no measurable effects from sedimentation from prescribed fire back-burning into the RCA
along Douglas Creek. Neither do we expect any measurable effects from nutrient inputs into any water
quality limited stream, with nutrient related impairments.
As such, implementing alternative 2 would be consistent with TMDLs for water quality limited streams.
Analysis Question 1 Summary: During implementation of alternative 2, no sediment delivery to streams
is expected from timber harvest activities. Burning in RCAs could result in some sedimentation, but it is
unlikely and effects are expected to be unmeasurable.
There will be long-term restoration benefits related to prescribed fires in RCAs, associated with soil and
vegetative rejuvenation, increased sediment filtering capabilities and promotion of a small level of large
wood recruitment that would bridge longer periods of time where natural ecological events cause higher
levels of over-story tree mortality, across broader scales.
We expect measurable changes in sediment introduction into RCAs would occur in two new locations
from construction and removal of a temporary roads (road T21 along Gird Creek; and roads T2 and T3
along an unnamed tributary to Flint Creek); and in one other location from road reconstruction (about 0.2
miles of road T17) along an unnamed tributary to Dunkleberg Creek. We expect no measurable change in
habitat conditions to be transmitted from the un-named tributary to Dunkleberg Creek, because
sedimentation will be nominal and because there is no defined stream channel for transmission. Neither
would there be any sediment effects from the other un-named tributary to Flint Creek which also lacks a
defined channel and is 2.4 miles above Flint Creek.

263

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Thus, the only perennial stream with measurable changes in sedimentation from road construction and
decommissioning is Gird Creek. With application of BMPs during reconstruction, the amount of sediment
introduction to streams from road construction, reconstruction and decommissioning is expected to be
minor, measurable over a few hundred feet, and short lived, (we estimate less than 1 year each for
construction and removal).
Based on WEPP modeling we do not anticipate an increase in sediment delivery in the Douglas Creek
watershed. Although there are a number of sediment delivery sites identified in the watershed recent road
work and continued maintenance prior to implementation should account for any change in traffic levels.
We also anticipate a substantial reduction in sediment delivery following hauling actions. These
reductions would result from implementing BMPs on all haul route segments in RCAs. A more detailed
description of BMP implementation can be found in the engineering section.
When considered in conjunction with the application of BMPs on road segments in RCAs, we consider
sedimentation increase to be inconsequential and expect an overall improvement in water quality related
to sediment in Gird Creek. Besides Gird Creek and the 2 un-named tributary streams, no surface water in
the analysis area should see measurable increases in sedimentation.
Stream restoration using placement of large wood would occur in approximately 0.7 miles of stream. The
benefits of sediment capture and retention should fully compensate for any minor and temporary effects
of sediment delivered from temporary road construction and reconstruction; and provide additional longterm benefits related to stream function well into the future.
Riparian canopy removal associated with construction of temporary road T21 may cause a 0.5ᵒ F increase
in maximum stream temperatures along a segment of Gird Creek. The increase would probably persist for
less than a few hundred feet downstream.
Barnes and Douglas Creeks are the only streams that are impaired due to sediment. No water quality
limited stream segments are impaired due to water temperature.
We expect no change from existing sedimentation levels to Barnes Creek from implementing this project.
Reductions in road sediment delivery could be substantive enough to result in measurable positive effects
in some waters during implementation and after. As such, this alternative would be consistent with
TMDLs for water quality limited streams within the analysis area.
We expect no measurable effects from nutrient inputs into any water quality limited stream (with those
impairments).

Analysis Question 2: What are the effects on stream channel morphology?
Indicator 1 – Changes in water yield and peak flows within watersheds
A detailed description of criteria and methodology used to determine changes in water yield can be found
in the methodology section of this report.

Indicator 1 Summary: All watersheds in the project area would have some level of canopy removal
proposed under alternative 2, except for Lower Boulder Creek. Based on estimates of canopy removal
from timber harvest treatments, new road construction, and prescribed fire, the percentages of watershed
area affected ranged from 0 percent to 3 percent in project watersheds.
It is important to understand that the total acres of treatment are not effectively removing the same
amount of canopy. Most of these treatments support stand resiliency and health (see vegetation section)
and are generally beneficial to watershed resources by creating a diverse age class that can help maintain
watershed resiliency against stand replacing fire or future beetle infestations.
Analysis Question 2 Summary: When considering the potential for altering water yield and stream
flows, we analyzed effective forest canopy removal for eight watersheds.
Forest canopy removal of 20-25 percent of a watershed’s area is required to cause measurable change in
peak flows and/or water yield (Stednick 1996). Effective forest canopy removals of 0-3 percent of total
watershed acres would occur under the proposed action. This would not result in substantive enough
reduction in forest canopy in any watershed to cause a measurable change in water yield or peak flows.
From this, we expect no negative effect on stream morphology within the analysis area from direct and
indirect effects of implementing the proposed action.
Analysis Question 3: What are the Effects on floodplains?
Indicator 1- Changes in floodplains from new roads
Measure: Miles of new road in RCAs: The Proposed Action – Alternative 2, would result in
construction of 0.50 miles of new, temporary road construction in the RCAs of Gird Creek (0.17
miles) and an un-named tributary to Flint Creek (0.33 miles).

266

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Indicator 1 Summary: There is potential for up to 0.5 miles of floodplain to be influenced by
Alternative 2 (the amount of new roads proposed for construction within 300 feet of a stream; the default
value for RCA width). The scope of influence is limited to two segments of floodplain. One on Gird
Creek and an another along an unnamed tributary to Flint Creek. The roads are temporary and would be
decommissioned upon project completion.
Analysis Question 3 Summary: About 0.5 miles of new roads are proposed for construction in RCAs for
Alternative 2. However, floodplain width rarely spans 300 feet on each side of a stream in this landscape,
so the actual length of floodplain affected would tend to be substantially shorter. These roads are
temporary and would be decommissioned upon project completion. Because they are temporary and
limited in scope, the effects would be primarily limited to the period of project implementation. Beyond
the immediate and temporary effects to the floodplain, there should be no measurable stream or watershed
effects.
Roads in the floodplain have been minimized and because they are temporary, Alternative 2 is consistent
with direction regarding floodplain management; which is to “avoid, to the extent possible, adverse
impacts associated with the occupancy and modification of floodplains”.
Cumulative Effects
Table 26 and Appendix D display the past, present and reasonably foreseeable activities and events within
the analysis area. Several activities considered in the hydrology cumulative effects analysis deserve
specific mention.
Vegetation Treatments: There have been a substantial number of vegetation treatments (timber harvest,
pre-commercial thinning and prescribed burning (Table 66) within the analysis area on Forest lands
over the last 50 - 60 years. This has also been the case on State, private and BLM lands, adjacent to
the project area.
We categorize current effects of past timber harvest on water resources as “minor”, based on our
observations that most erosion and sediment delivery sites related to past harvest have stabilized and
dwindled to levels that are insubstantial.
The greatest potential for cumulative effects is associated with reductions in forest canopy that has
not been fully been restored (i.e. they occurred less than 30 years ago). While canopy reductions are
not at or near levels that would cause notable changes in stream function, we do consider the potential
for them to act cumulatively with beetle related mortality and alternative 2 actions to influence water
yield.
Mine Reclamation: Work was completed on the Forest Rose CERCLA project in 2013. This project
resulted in the clean-up of thousands of tons of mine tailings and reconstruction of about 0.5 miles of
Dunkleberg Creek.
Beetle Related Tree Mortality: Substantial pine beetle infestation has occurred within the analysis area.
Extensive tree mortality across an entire watershed may change forest canopy levels enough that
water yield can be affected. We estimated acres of beetle related mortality through photo
interpretation of timbered polygons. Polygons were categorized into the following mortality classes
(Table 81):
CL1 – no substantive tree mortality
CL2 – 1 to 39% tree mortality
CL3 – 40 to 84% tree mortality
CL4 – 85 to 100% tree mortality

267

Figures were not provided for the Boulder Creek watershed because there is no harvest proposed and no

Road Maintenance and Improvements: Road repairs were completed from 2011 - 2013 on the following
NFS roads within the analysis area:
Road 8402 – 6.9 miles
Road 1544 – 10.1 miles
Road 5123 – 1.6 miles
Road 707 – 8.8 miles
Road 666 – 2.6 miles
These repairs have reduced erosion and sediment introduction, into the South Fork and main fork of Gold
Creeks, Dunkleberg and Gird Creeks, and the South Fork, Middle Fork and main fork of Douglas Creeks.
Fish Passage Improvements: Fish passage improvements have occurred on the North Fork and Middle
Fork of Douglas Creek. These improvements are expected to provide moderate to substantial benefits
with regard to sedimentation and stream function.
Alternative 2 Cumulative Effects on Water Quality
We expect alternative 2 to result in a measurable increase in sediment introduction to RCAs in three new
locations within the analysis area from construction, reconstruction and decommissioning of temporary
roads (roads T2, T3, T17 and T21along un-named tributaries to Flint and Dunkleberg Creeks and Gird
Creek). The increases in fine sediment would be minor, but may be measurable over several hundred feet
in Gird Creek. Measurable effects are expected to be short lived (less than 1 year each, for construction
and removal). Effects to the un-named tributaries would not be transmitted to Flint or Dunkleberg Creeks.
LWD placement in Gird Creek would be done in a manner that creates and improves pool habitat,
promotes sediment capture and retention, and (where it is desired) to improve stream width to depth
ratios. The benefits of sediment capture and retention should fully compensate for the minor and
268

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

temporary effects of sediment delivered from temporary road construction and reconstruction; and
provide additional long-term benefits related to stream function well into the future.
There will be long-term restoration benefits related to prescribed fires in RCAs. They are associated with
soil and vegetative rejuvenation and the promotion of a small level of large wood recruitment that would
bridge the longer periods of time where natural ecological events that cause higher levels of tree mortality
at larger scales.
When considered cumulatively with recently completed road repairs, and additional application of BMPs
on road segments in RCAs through implementation of alternative 2, we consider the sediment increase to
Gird Creek to be inconsequential and expect an overall improvement in water quality conditions related to
sediment.
Based of review of BMP’s effectiveness in the project area, we believe approximately 20% of the delivery
sites would have small increases in sediment delivery during log-haul, approximately 50% of sediment
delivery sites BMP’s would be effective in ensuring no additional sediment delivery during haul with
likely beneficial effects especially post haul, and at 30% of sites, best management practices would fully
compensate for haul- related sediment delivery with benefits during and following timber hauling
activities. Overall, the analysis indicated total sediment delivery would be fully be accounted for with the
implementation of BMP’s with some reduction possible. After project implementation, BMP
improvements would result in an estimated 40 percent reduction in total sediment delivery from current
conditions.
Riparian canopy removal associated with construction of temporary road T21 would cause an estimated
0.5ᵒ Fincreases in maximum stream temperatures in a segment of Gird Creek,. It is doubtful whether this
level of change would be detectable, and the increases would probably persist for less than a few hundred
feet downstream of the opening created for the road.
Barnes and Douglas Creeks are the only streams classified by Montana DEQ as impaired due to sediment.
No water quality limited stream segments are impaired due to water temperature.
Based on WEPP modeling we do not anticipate an increase in sediment delivery in the Douglas Creek
watershed. Although there are a number of sediment delivery sites identified in the watershed recent road
work and continued maintenance prior to implementation should account for any change in traffic levels.
We also anticipate a substantial reduction in sediment delivery following hauling actions. These
reductions would result from implementing BMPs on all haul route segments in RCAs. A more detailed
description of BMP implementation can be found in the engineering section.
As such, Alternative 2 should not do anything to negatively influence water resources below the Forest
Boundary, or act cumulatively with other actions/events to cause measurable negative water quality
impacts. Rather, it is likely to improve downstream water quality conditions from reductions in
sedimentation.
Alternative 2 Cumulative Effects on Stream Morphology
Change in canopy is the primary factor affecting water yield and timing; and if changes in water yield are
substantial enough they can affect stream channel stability and channel morphology.
Effective canopy reduction (ECR) represents our assessment of the change in forested canopy that has
occurred. ECR is different than total acres of beetle killed trees in a watershed, because standing dead
trees sustain some proportion of canopy functionality provided by green trees. Clear-cut salvaging of
beetle killed trees only represents about a 60% reduction in forest canopy influence (Huggard 2007).

269

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

ECR is often different from the total acres of past timber harvest for two reasons: 1) because different
treatments remove different percentages of forest canopy; and 2) because vegetative regrowth
reestablishes forest canopy over time. We often estimate full canopy recovery from timber harvest or
other disturbance like wildfire occurs (relative to its effects on water yield) after 25 or 30 years.
Table 80 above displays the estimates of ECR from beetle mortality by watershed.
We captured effective forest canopy removal effects of past vegetation management projects within the
past 25 years within the project area in Table 82 by adjusting for treatment type. This helps us understand
what class project stands are in and how they got there. Historic treatments in Gold Creek have had the
greatest effect but only moved the stands form class 1 to class 2 which has limited effect on water yield
and other resource metrics.

Hydrologic recovery, or the return to pre-disturbance hydrologic regime, is difficult to measure or
estimate. Recovery is driven primarily by the return of the forest canopy’s leaf surface area to predisturbance levels (Winkler et. al. 2010). Recovery times of at least 10 years to over 30 years have been
reported for recovery from extensive timber harvest. Modeling in the Oregon Cascades suggested the
effects on stream flows would decrease by about 60% after 10 years and by 95% after 30 years (Harr et.
al. 1979; as cited in Winkler et. al. 2010).
Approximately 5,500 acres of private inholdings within the project area are estimated to have had timber
harvested on them, and most were harvested in the 1980s. This information was built into our model and
used to establish existing condition for the project area in Table 83.
Watershed changes in canopy from beetle mortality, past harvest, and harvest proposed in Alternative 2
are presented in Table 83 below. Based on our model we can see that half of the watersheds in the project
are exceed 25% canopy removal from beetle mortality alone which the literature suggests can result in
measurable changes in water yield and/or timing of runoff. Stednick (1996) noted increased water yield
could not be determined from stream flow measurements, when forest cover reduction was less than 20
percent in a watershed. Grant et al. (2008) documented that flow increases are generally not measurable
until about 25 percent of the basal area of a forested watershed has been harvested. These levels tend to be
associated with a 10 percent increase in stream flows; what Grant et. al. (2008) called a “10 percent
detection limit” or the level of change required to be measurable.

This level of change indicates that water yield changes have likely occurred in a number of the project
watersheds prior to treatments proposed in this project. Based on the literature (Potts 1984, Elliot et. al.
2010) we anticipate effects to shift the hydrograph so runoff occurs earlier in the year with slightly higher
water yields but more precise effects are difficult to predict given a large number of variables that affect
snow storage and melt patterns.
There is evidence of water yield changes in the project area including increases in springs within the
analysis area. However, changes in water yield are inherently difficult to validate. Sufficient baseline data
is needed and annual variability in snowfall, rainfall and spring/summer air temperatures complicate
assessments. Supportable determination often requires long-term, large data sets and/or modeling to
quantify the change. This isn’t possible for this analysis.
Given the assumption that water yield changes are being observed across the project area, understanding
the effects of the proposed treatments is important in understanding cumulative effects. Based on model
outputs in Table 90 you can see that the proposed actions account for a maximum increase of 3% change
from existing condition. This change is unlikely to have any effect on water yield and even more unlikely
to have any effect on stream morphology given that we have not seen any evidence of channel instability
in our stream assessments.
Forest Plan Goals provide direction associated with water yield and timing of run-off:
Watersheds: Watersheds are maintained to ensure water quality, timing of runoff, and water yields
necessary for functioning riparian, aquatic ecosystems, wetlands, and to support native aquatic species
reproduction and survival.
Floodplains: The condition of floodplains, channels and water tables are maintained and restored to
dissipate floods and sustain the natural timing and variability of water levels in riparian, wetland, meadow
and aquatic habitats (IN 4).
Channel Integrity: Stream channel function and water quality are maintained or restored to support
designated beneficial uses on all reaches through management decisions, restoration projects or Best
Management Practices as outlined in the Soil & Water Conservation Practices Handbook.

271

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Montana DEQ (2012) states timber harvest should not increase the peak water yield by more than 10
percent of historic conditions. This direction can be broad in its interpretation. Historic variability can be
quite large and easily encompasses the small changes in water yield we’ve observed.
The intent of Forest Plan and DEQ’s direction on water yield is to maintain stream channel stability and
function -- i.e. to prevent degradation. However, ecological degradation is seldom commensurate with the
smallest level of detectable environmental change. Thus, degradation or loss of function should not be
considered imminent or even likely just because it appears thresholds for measurable changes in water
yields are approached.
Streams and watersheds tend to be resilient and can typically cope with substantial variability in peak
flows. Through our observations, we’ve not, noted any differences in channel stability attributable high
peak flows; nor have we noted any changes in timing of run-off events. This suggests streams in the
analysis area are maintaining conditions. Since the effects of beetle mortality represent about 75-90% of
the cumulative ECR in the 4 watersheds noted, and they have existed for a number of years, with no signs
of increased channel instability; there seems to be a relatively low likelihood small additional changes in
canopy proposed by Alternative 2 would increase water yields sufficiently to cause detrimental effects or
violate Montana DEQ’s direction for streams within the analysis area.
That said, because this existing condition exceeds literature thresholds noted to cause change, there’s a
need for added awareness of stream tendencies, and for caution in the future when considering additional
management actions. Thus, we’ll monitor conditions and manage watersheds with the expectation that
some increases in water yields have/will occur.
Alternative 2 Cumulative Effects on Floodplains
About 0.5 miles of road construction and about 0.2 miles of reconstruction are proposed for temporary
roads in RCAs for Alternative 2. However, the amount of floodplain influenced should be substantially
less than this, since floodplain width rarely spans 300 feet on each side of a stream (the default RCA
width) in this landscape. These roads would be decommissioned upon project completion. Because they
are temporary and limited in scope, the effects would be primarily limited to the period of project
implementation. Beyond the immediate and temporary effects to the floodplain, there should be no
measurable stream or watershed effects.
The most notable, event or action that would act cumulatively with these roads to influence floodplains is
the likely to be dead trees falling in the floodplain. This should not negatively influence hydrologic
resources. Any trees that fall across the roads while they are in place would be removed and left in the
floodplain.
Summary of Effects
During implementation of alternative 2 no sediment delivery to streams is expected from timber harvest
activities. Burning in RCAs could result in some sedimentation, but it is unlikely and effects are expected
to be unmeasurable.
A measurable increase in sediment introduction is likely in three RCAs within the analysis area; (Gird
Creek, and un-named tributaries to Flint and Dunkleberg Creeks). Sediment would result from
construction and removal of temporary roads. The increase in sediment would be minor, but possibly
measurable over several hundred feet of Gird Creek. Effects are expected to be short term (less than 1
year each, for construction and removal).
Based on WEPP modeling there will be no increase in sediment delivery across the project area during
haul and a 40 percent reduction after the hauling is completed. These reductions would result from

272

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

implementing BMPs on all haul route segments in RCAs. A more detailed description of BMP
implementation can be found in the engineering section.
When considered in conjunction with the application of BMPs on road segments in RCAs, we consider
the sediment increase to be inconsequential and expect an overall long term improvement in water quality
conditions across the project area.
Riparian canopy removal associated with construction of temporary road T21 may cause a 0.5ᵒ F increase
in maximum stream temperatures along a segment of Gird Creek. The increase may not be measurable,
but even so would likely persist for less than a few hundred feet downstream. If the unnamed tributary of
Flint Creek was perennial where construction of temporary roads T2and T3 occurs, we estimate it would
result in an estimated increase in maximum stream temperatures of 0.8ᵒ F. However, because of the
ephemeral characteristics of RCA, temperature related effects would not occur. There is no potential for
temperature related effects to be transmitted to Flint Creek.
Barnes and Douglas creeks are the only streams that are impaired due to sediment. No water quality
limited stream segments are impaired due to water temperature.
We expect no change from existing sedimentation levels to Barnes Creek from implementing the Flint
Foothills Project.
Based on WEPP modeling we do not anticipate an increase in sediment delivery in the Douglas Creek
watershed. Although there are a number of sediment delivery sites identified in the watershed recent road
work and continued maintenance prior to implementation should account for any change in traffic levels.
We also anticipate a substantial reduction in sediment delivery following hauling actions. These
reductions would result from implementing BMPs on all haul route segments in RCAs. A more detailed
description of BMP implementation can be found in the engineering section.
Based on model outputs the proposed actions account for a maximum increase of 3% change from
existing condition. This change in unlikely to have any effect on water yield and even more unlikely to
have any effect on stream morphology given that we have not seen any evidence of channel instability in
our stream assessments.
Alternative 2 should not negatively influence water resources below the Forest boundary, or act
cumulatively with management actions or events to cause measurable negative water quality impacts.
Rather, it is likely to improve Forest and downstream water quality conditions through reductions in
sedimentation.

Alternative 3
Under alternative 3 no new road construction would occur (See Figure 8). Only existing NFS roads or
open and closed unauthorized routes would be used as haul routes. This has caused some vegetation
treatment units proposed under alternative 3 to be eliminated from consideration.
Direct and Indirect Effects

Analysis Question 1: What are the Effects on Water Quality?
Indicator 1- Change in sediment delivery to surface waters (streams, ponds and wetlands)
Measure- Changes in sediment delivery from timber harvest units: Disturbed WEPP modeling
for each proposed timber harvest unit, showed little likelihood of measurable sediment delivery to
surface waters from timber harvest units. Probabilities for delivery ranged from 0 to 2 percent
(see Soils section).

273

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Measure –Changes in sediment delivery from timber hauling: Estimates from the Road WEPP
model for nine stream crossings on project haul routes within the Gold Creek watershed represent
the range of likely effects from log hauling across the analysis area. Existing sediment delivery
for those sites (pre-project implementation) range from 26 to 623 lbs/year.
Based of review of BMP’s effectiveness in the project area, we believe approximately 20% of the
delivery sites would have small increases in sediment delivery during log-haul, approximately
50% of sediment delivery sites BMP’s would be effective in ensuring no additional sediment
delivery during haul with likely beneficial effects especially post haul, and at 30% of sites, best
management practices would fully compensate for haul- related sediment delivery with benefits
during and following timber hauling activities. Overall, the analysis indicated total sediment
delivery would be fully be accounted for with the implementation of BMP’s with some reduction
possible. After project implementation, BMP improvements would result in an estimated 40
percent reduction in total sediment delivery from current conditions.
Our observations and knowledge of the area indicate the situations modeled are representative of
the range of situations elsewhere in the analysis area. Thus estimates generated by the model
should be representative of the scope, frequencies and magnitudes of sediment deliveries from
existing roads in un-modeled locations within the analysis area.
Measure– Miles of new roads within 300 feet of perennial streams: There would be no new road
construction under alternative 3.
Measure– Number of new stream crossings: There would be no new stream crossings under
alternative 3.
Measure –Length of stream restoration: There would be no LWD placement because there is no
defined stream channel where temporary road T17 would be reconstructed in the RCA of an
unnamed tributary to Dunkleberg Creek.
Measure– Length of RCA with prescribed fire burning within 100 feet of stream: Prescribed
burn treatments are the same as proposed for alternative 3. We expect prescribed fire treatments
have the potential to back into RCAs and burn within 100 feet. The highest estimated length of
stream with prescribed fire within 100 feet would be Blum Creek (417 ft.). We estimate an
additional 211 feet could occur within the Blum Creek stream system on three unnamed
tributaries. Where this occurs, we assume there is some risk that exposed soils could result in
sediment introduction; however, we expect measurable levels of delivery are unlikely.
There will be long-term restoration benefits related to prescribed fires in RCAs. They are
associated with soil and vegetative rejuvenation and displayed through increased growth and
production of understory vegetation from nutrient recycling. This will provide benefits in
sediment filtering capabilities. There is also the likelihood of a low percentage of mortality to
over-story trees. Because of the limited scope and mosaic pattern of fire in RCAs, it would
promote a small level of large wood recruitment; that would bridge the longer periods of time
where natural ecological events cause mortality at larger scales. The long term benefits to the
riparian area and stream channel will outweigh any short term impacts.
Indicator 1 Summary: Measurable levels of sediment are not expected to be delivered to surface waters
from timber harvest units.
Based on WEPP modeling there will be no increase in sediment delivery across the project area during
haul and a 40 percent reduction after the hauling is completed. These reductions would result from

274

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

implementing BMPs on all haul route segments in RCAs. A more detailed description of BMP
implementation can be found in the engineering section.
There would be no sediment introduction from newly constructed roads or stream crossings.
The only location that a measurable increase in sedimentation would occur is where about 0.2 miles of
existing road T17 would be reconstructed and then decommissioned within the RCA of an unnamed
tributary to Dunkleberg Creek. With application of BMPs during reconstruction, the amount of sediment
introduction to surface waters from the road is expected to be minor, temporary in nature and would likely
be unmeasurable in Dunkleberg Creek.
LWD placement would occur in approximately 0.2 miles of stream. The benefits of sediment capture and
retention should fully compensate for the minor and temporary effects of sediment delivered from
temporary road reconstruction; and provide additional long-term benefits related to stream function well
into the future.
There will be long-term restoration benefits related to prescribed fires in RCAs. They are associated with
soil and vegetative rejuvenation, increased sediment filtering capability, and the promotion of a small
level of large wood recruitment that would bridge the longer periods of time where natural ecological
events that cause higher levels of over story tree mortality at larger scales.
Indicator 2 –Changes in water temperature. Riparian canopies that extend at least 120 feet from a
stream’s edge provide shade at a level comparable to un-harvested conditions (Cristea and Janisch
2007).
Measure - Vegetative canopy openings created within 120 feet of streams from Timber harvest
units: There would be no vegetation canopy openings created within 120 feet of streams from
timber harvest in RCAs.
Measure - Vegetative canopy openings created within 120 feet of streams from new road
construction: There would be no vegetation canopy openings created within 120 feet of streams
from construction of new roads.
Measure - Vegetative canopy openings created within 120 feet of streams from prescribed fire:
Based on the prescriptions proposed, there would be no prescribed fire ignitions within RCAs, but
fire would be allowed to back into RCAs along adjacent streams in the project area. There may be
mortality to a few over-story trees and or shrubs in RCAs, but it would not occur at a level that
would result in water temperature changes.
Indicator 2 Summary – There would be no Forest canopy removal in RCAs from timber harvest or
construction of new roads. Prescribed burning would not affect riparian canopy within 120 feet of streams
to any level substantive enough to cause increased water temperatures. There may be a few trees removed
during reconstruction of road T17 along an unnamed tributary to Dunkleberg Creek. Removals would not
be substantial enough to cause a change in stream temperatures.
There would be no changes in water temperatures from implementing Alternative 2.
Indicator 3 – Consistency of alternative 3 effects with TMDLs on Water Quality Limited Streams. No
streams in the analysis area are impaired by high temperatures, so no further analysis will be done on
temperature effects to 303(d) listed streams. Barnes and Douglas Creeks are the only streams that are
impaired due to sediment.
Measure – Estimated changes in sediment delivery to Barnes and Douglas Creeks from timber
harvest units: Disturbed WEPP modeling for proposed timber harvest units, showed little
likelihood of measurable sediment delivery to any stream; Barnes and Douglas Creeks included.

275

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Measure – Estimated changes in sediment delivery to Barnes and Douglas Creeks from log
hauling: There are no haul routes within the RCA of Barnes Creek, so there would be no
measurable change in sedimentation related to log hauling. Based on WEPP modeling we do not
anticipate an increase in sediment delivery in the Douglas Creek watershed. Although there are a
number of sediment delivery sites identified in the watershed recent road work and continued
maintenance prior to implementation should account for any change in traffic levels. We also
anticipate a substantial reduction in sediment delivery following hauling actions. These
reductions would result from implementing BMPs on all haul route segments in RCAs. A more
detailed description of BMP implementation can be found in the engineering section.
Measure – Miles of new roads within 300 feet of Barnes and Douglas Creeks: There would be no
new Forest system or temporary roads within 300 feet of Barnes or Douglas Creeks, so there
would be no measurable change in sedimentation related to new road construction in RCAs
Measure – Number of new stream crossings on Barnes and Douglas Creeks: There would be no
new stream crossings on Barnes or Douglas Creeks, so there would be no measurable change in
sedimentation from new crossings.
Measure – Length of RCA with prescribed fire burning within 100 feet of Barnes and Douglas
Creeks: There are no prescribed fire units proposed near Barnes Creek, thus, none of its RCA
would be burned within 100 feet of the stream. Based on the assumptions outlined above, we
estimate about 49 feet of Douglas Creek’s RCA could burn within 100 feet of the stream; with a
very low likelihood of any fire reaching the stream edge. Further, we would not expect the
estimated 49 feet of RCA would be continuous (i.e. all of it would not occur in a single location)
along a stream. Rather it’s more likely to be scattered over several locations; the result of an
undulating, mosaic pattern commonly seen along the margins of prescribed burns. RCA surface
characteristics generally do not encourage concentration of water to an extent that it accelerates
and erodes soil, and transports sediment. Rather they promote slower moving, shallower water
with tendencies toward dropping sediment. Based on these things we expect little to no increase
in sediment delivery to Douglas Creek, and no measurable effects from sedimentation, related to
prescribed burning.
Measure - Changes in nutrient delivery to nutrient impaired waters from prescribed fire: Under
Alternative 3, there should be no measurable change in nutrients because physical characteristics
of RCAs tend to encourage deposition rather than transport of materials. Based on our analysis
approximately 127 feet could have prescribed fire backing within 100 feet of TMDL listed
streams, this small amount and adequate buffers will ensure no measurable impacts are observed.
Nutrient limited streams within the analysis area include Dunkleberg, Gold, Barnes and Douglas
Creeks. There are no proposed burn units near Dunkleberg, Gold or Barnes Creeks under
Alternative 3. As such there would be no risk of nutrient related effects. There are three proposed
units adjacent to Douglas Creek (1B, 2B and 6B), treating 15, 22 and 163 acres. Based on the
areas treated and the conditions under which prescribed burning is done, we expect no
measurable change in nutrient inputs into Douglas Creek. To validate this we will monitor water
quality during and after treatment, there.
Indicator 3 Summary: We expect no measurable change from existing sedimentation in Barnes Creek
from implementing this project. Based on WEPP modeling we do not anticipate an increase in sediment
delivery in the Douglas Creek watershed. Although there are a number of sediment delivery sites
identified in the watershed recent road work and continued maintenance prior to implementation should
account for any change in traffic levels. We also anticipate a substantial reduction in sediment delivery
following hauling actions. These reductions would result from implementing BMPs on all haul route
segments in RCAs. A more detailed description of BMP implementation can be found in the engineering
section.
276

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

We expect no measurable effects from sedimentation or nutrient inputs into any water quality limited
stream (with those impairments) from prescribed fire.
As such, implementing alternative 3 would be consistent with TMDLs for water quality limited streams.
Analysis Question 1 Summary: During implementation of alternative 3 no sediment delivery to streams
is expected from timber harvest activities. Burning in RCAs could result in some sedimentation, but it is
unlikely and effects are expected to be unmeasurable.
There would be no effect on stream temperatures.
Barnes and Douglas Creeks are the only streams that are impaired due to sediment. No water quality
limited stream segments are impaired due to water temperature.
We expect no change from existing sedimentation levels to Barnes Creek from implementing the Flint
Foothills Project.
Based on WEPP modeling we do not anticipate an increase in sediment delivery in the Douglas Creek
watershed. Although there are a number of sediment delivery sites identified in the watershed recent road
work and continued maintenance prior to implementation should account for any change in traffic levels.
We also anticipate a substantial reduction in sediment delivery following hauling actions. These
reductions would result from implementing BMPs on all haul route segments in RCAs. A more detailed
description of BMP implementation can be found in the engineering section.
Reductions in road sediment delivery could be substantive enough to result in measurable positive effects
in some waters following implementation and account for increase in traffic during implementation. As
such, this alternative would be consistent with TMDLs for water quality limited streams within the
analysis area.
Dunkleberg, Gold, Barnes and Douglas Creeks are nutrient impaired streams within the analysis area.
There would be no measurable increase in nutrients from proposed burning treatments under Alternative
3. We will monitor water quality in Douglas Creek during and after prescribed burning treatments to
validate our effects determination.

Indicator 1- Changes in water yield and peak flows within watersheds
Measure –Acres of effective forest canopy removed by timber harvest units in each watershed:

from 101 acres in Perkins to 1,950 acres of treatment in Gold Creek. These acres figures represent
all silvicultural prescriptions except burning. The combination of ECA burn acres, ECA Timber
Harvest acres, and ECA temporary road clearing acres can be found in Table 80.

6th Level Watershed

Indicator 1 Summary: All watersheds in the project area would have some level of canopy removal
proposed under alternative 3, except for Lower Boulder Creek. Based on estimates of canopy removal
from timber harvest treatments, new road construction, and prescribed fire, the percentages of watershed
area affected ranged from 0 percent to 3 percent in project watersheds.
It is important to understand that the total acres of treatment are not effectively removing the same
amount of canopy. Most of these treatments support stand resiliency and health (see vegetation section)
and are generally beneficial to watershed resources by creating a diverse age class that can help maintain
watershed resiliency against stand replacing fire or future beetle infestations.
Analysis Question 2 Summary: When considering the potential for altering water yield and stream
flows, we analyzed effective forest canopy removal for eight watersheds.
Forest canopy removal of 20-25 percent of a watershed’s area is required to cause measurable change in
peak flows and/or water yield (Stednick 1996). Effective forest canopy removals of 0-3 percent of total
watershed acres would occur under the proposed action. This would not result in substantive enough
reduction in forest canopy in any watershed to cause a measurable change in water yield or peak flows.
From this, we expect no negative effect on stream morphology within the analysis area from direct and
indirect effects of implementing the proposed action.

Analysis Question 3: What are the Effects on floodplains?
Indicator 1- Changes in floodplains from new roads
Measure - Miles of new road in RCAs: Alternative 3 does not propose any new roads.
Analysis Question 3 Summary: There would be no new roads as part of this alternative. About 0.2 miles
of reconstruction are proposed for a temporary road along an un-named tributary to Dunkleberg Creek.
The amount of floodplain influenced would be substantially less than this. This road would be
decommissioned upon project completion. Because the road is temporary the effects would be primarily

279

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

limited to the period of project implementation. Beyond the immediate and temporary effects to the
floodplain, there should be no measurable stream or watershed effects.
Cumulative Effects
Past, present and reasonably foreseeable activities and events within the analysis area, that may affect
water resources include timber harvest, prescribed burning, livestock grazing, range improvements,
mining, mine reclamation, water diversion, noxious weed control, fish passage improvements, dispersed
camping, the presence and use of roads and trails, road and trail maintenance and improvements, beetle
related tree mortality, wildland fire, wildland fire suppression, and firewood cutting. Their general effects
are summarized and discussed under alternative 2 above.

Alternative 3 Cumulative Effects on Water Quality
During implementation of alternative 3 no sediment delivery to streams is expected from timber harvest
activities. Burning in RCAs could result in some sedimentation, but it is unlikely and effects are expected
to be unmeasurable; and there would be no effect on stream temperatures. Minor, but measurable amounts
of sediment deposition are likely in an un-named tributary to Dunkleberg Creek, due to reconstruction of
0.2 miles (and later decommissioning) of road T17 in the RCA. The effects would be temporary in nature
and would be unmeasurable in Dunkleberg Creek. Application of BMPs will limit effects and there
should be no substantive cumulative effects associated with this action.
The benefits of prescribed fire on the soil, vegetation and the sediment filtering capabilities in RCAs
would compensate for any effects of sedimentation from road reconstruction and prescribed fire, and
would provide additional benefits into the future.
Modeling indicated implementation of BMPs would result in reductions in sedimentation at existing
delivery sites and would more than compensate for the effects of log hauling. Overall reductions in
sedimentation during project implementation, and after, are estimated to occur in about 45 percent of
current delivery sites. Many of these sites are expected to see substantive enough changes to result in
measurable positive effects.
Barnes and Douglas Creeks are the only streams that are impaired due to sediment. No water quality
limited stream segments are impaired due to water temperature.
We expect no change from existing sedimentation levels to Barnes Creek from implementing the Flint
Foothills Project.
We expect no change from existing sedimentation levels to Barnes Creek from implementing this project.
Based on WEPP modeling we do not anticipate an increase in sediment delivery in the Douglas Creek
watershed. Although there are a number of sediment delivery sites identified in the watershed recent road
work and continued maintenance prior to implementation should account for any change in traffic levels.
We also anticipate a substantial reduction in sediment delivery following hauling actions. These
reductions would result from implementing BMPs on all haul route segments in RCAs. A more detailed
description of BMP implementation can be found in the engineering section.
Reductions in road sediment delivery should be substantive enough to result in measurable positive
effects in some waters during implementation and after. As such, this alternative would be consistent with
TMDLs for water quality limited streams within the analysis area.
As such, alternative 3 should not do anything to negatively influence water resources below the Forest
Boundary, or act cumulatively with other actions/events to cause measurable negative water quality
impacts. Rather, it is likely to improve downstream water quality conditions from reductions in
sedimentation.

280

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Alternative 3 Cumulative Effects on Stream Morphology
The effects from changes in effective canopy are detailed in alternative 2 cumulative effects discussion.
Watershed changes in canopy from beetle mortality, past harvest, and harvest proposed in Alternative 3
are presented in Table 87 below. Based on our model we can see that half of the watersheds in the project
are exceed 25% canopy removal from beetle mortality alone which the literature suggests can result in
measurable changes in water yield and/or timing of runoff. Stednick (1996) noted increased water yield
could not be determined from stream flow measurements, when forest cover reduction was less than 20
percent in a watershed. Grant et al. (2008) documented that flow increases are generally not measurable
until about 25 percent of the basal area of a forested watershed has been harvested. These levels tend to be
associated with a 10 percent increase in stream flows; what Grant et. al. (2008) called a “10 percent
detection limit” or the level of change required to be measurable.

This level of change indicates that water yield changes have likely occurred in a number of the project
watersheds prior to treatments proposed in this project. Based on the literature (Potts 1984, Elliot et. al.
2010) we anticipate effects to shift the hydrograph so runoff occurs earlier in the year with slightly higher
water yields but more precise effects are difficult to predict given a large number of variables that affect
snow storage and melt patterns.
There is evidence of water yield changes in the project area including increases in springs within the
analysis area. However, changes in water yield are inherently difficult to validate. Sufficient baseline data
is needed, and annual variability in snowfall, rainfall and spring/summer air temperatures complicate
assessments. Supportable determination often requires long-term, large data sets and/or modeling to
quantify the change. This isn’t possible for this analysis.
Given the assumption that water yield changes are being observed across the project area, understanding
the effects of the proposed treatments is important in understanding cumulative effects. Based on model
outputs in Table 87 you can see that the proposed actions account for a maximum increase of 3% change
from existing condition. This change in unlikely to have any effect on water yield and even more unlikely
to have any effect on stream morphology given that we have not seen any evidence of channel instability
in our stream assessments.

281

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Forest Plan Goals provide direction associated with water yield and timing of run-off:
Watersheds: Watersheds are maintained to ensure water quality, timing of runoff, and water yields
necessary for functioning riparian, aquatic ecosystems, wetlands, and to support native aquatic species
reproduction and survival.
Floodplains: The condition of floodplains, channels and water tables are maintained and restored to
dissipate floods and sustain the natural timing and variability of water levels in riparian, wetland, meadow
and aquatic habitats (IN 4).
Channel Integrity: Stream channel function and water quality are maintained or restored to support
designated beneficial uses on all reaches through management decisions, restoration projects or Best
Management Practices as outlined in the Soil & Water Conservation Practices Handbook.
Montana DEQ (2012) states timber harvest should not increase the peak water yield by more than 10
percent of historic conditions. This direction can be broad in its interpretation. Historic variability can be
quite large and easily encompasses the small changes in water yield we’ve observed.
The intent of Forest Plan and DEQ’s direction on water yield is to maintain stream channel stability and
function - i.e. to prevent degradation. However, ecological degradation is seldom commensurate with the
smallest level of detectable environmental change. Thus, degradation or loss of function should not be
considered imminent or even likely just because it appears thresholds for measurable changes in water
yields are approached.
Streams and watersheds tend to be resilient and can typically cope with substantial variability in peak
flows. Through our observations, we’ve not, noted any differences in channel stability attributable high
peak flows; nor have we noted any changes in timing of run-off events. This suggests streams in the
analysis area are maintaining conditions. Since the effects of beetle mortality represent about 75-90% of
the cumulative ECR in the 4 watersheds noted, and they have existed for a number of years, with no signs
of increased channel instability; there seems to be a relatively low likelihood small additional changes in
canopy proposed by Alternative 3 would increase water yields sufficiently to cause detrimental effects or
violate Montana DEQ’s direction for streams within the analysis area.
That said, because this existing condition exceeds literature thresholds noted to cause change, there’s a
need for added awareness of stream tendencies, and for caution in the future when considering additional
management actions. Thus, we’ll monitor conditions and manage watersheds with the expectation that
some increases in water yields have/will occur.
Alternative 3 Cumulative Effects on Floodplains
About 0.2 miles of reconstruction are proposed for temporary road T17 in RCAs for Alternative 3.
However, the amount of floodplain influenced should be substantially less than this, since floodplain
width rarely spans 300 feet on each side of a stream (the default RCA width) in this landscape. This road
would be decommissioned upon project completion. Because it is temporary and limited in scope, the
effects would be primarily limited to the period of project implementation. Beyond the immediate and
temporary effects to the floodplain, there should be no measurable stream or watershed effects.
The most notable, event or action that would act cumulatively with this road to influence floodplains is
the likely dead trees falling in the floodplain. This should not negatively influence hydrologic resources.
Any trees that fall across the road while it is in place would be removed and left in the floodplain.

282

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Summary of Effects
During implementation of alternative 3 no sediment delivery to streams is expected from timber harvest
activities, or construction of new roads or stream crossings. Burning in RCAs could result in some
sedimentation, but it is unlikely and effects are expected to be unmeasurable. There would be no effects
on stream temperatures.
Based on WEPP modeling there will be no increase in sediment delivery across the project area during
haul and a 40 percent reduction after the hauling is completed. These reductions would result from
implementing BMPs on all haul route segments in RCAs. A more detailed description of BMP
implementation can be found in the engineering section.
Barnes and Douglas creeks are the only streams that are impaired due to sediment. No water quality
limited stream segments are impaired due to water temperature.
We expect no change from existing sedimentation levels to Barnes Creek from implementing the Flint
Foothills Project.
Based on WEPP modeling we do not anticipate an increase in sediment delivery in the Douglas Creek
watershed. Although there are a number of sediment delivery sites identified in the watershed recent road
work and continued maintenance prior to implementation should account for any change in traffic levels.
We also anticipate a substantial reduction in sediment delivery following hauling actions. These
reductions would result from implementing BMPs on all haul route segments in RCAs. A more detailed
description of BMP implementation can be found in the engineering section.
Based on model outputs the proposed actions account for a maximum increase of 3% change from
existing condition. This change in unlikely to have any effect on water yield and even more unlikely to
have any effect on stream morphology given that we have not seen any evidence of channel instability in
our stream assessments.
Alternative 3 should not negatively influence water resources below the Forest boundary, or act
cumulatively with management actions or events to cause measurable negative water quality impacts.
Rather, it is likely to improve Forest and downstream water quality conditions through reductions in
sedimentation.

Aquatic Resources
This section documents existing condition and environmental consequences to aquatic resources from the
proposed Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Project. The analysis includes potential effects to Forest
Service sensitive and management indicator species (MIS), as well as aquatic species listed according to
the endangered species act (ESA). These species include westslope cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki
lewsi), western toad (Bufo boreas), arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus) and bull trout (Salvelinus
confluentus), western pearlshell mussel (Margaritifera falcata), and the mayfly, (Drunella doddsi).

Overview of Issues Addressed
All fisheries habitat within the analysis area is confined to streams. Amphibians are present in streams,
ponds, wetlands and their riparian areas, so all of these represent habitats that could be affected. Finally,
direction in the Forest Plan requires that we analyze the potential for new projects to increase the risk of
aquatic nuisance species introduction. Aquatic nuisance species introduction would result in mortality or
displacement of individual trout and amphibians.

Overview of Analysis
There are six aquatics-related questions we address in this analysis.
1. How would Stream Habitat Conditions change for Drunella doddsi (MIS) and other stream dependent
species?
2. How would Pond and Wetland Habitat Conditions change for Aquatic Species?
3. How would Persistence of Sensitive WCT populations be affected within the Analysis Area?
4. How would Bull Trout be Affected?
5. How would Persistence of Sensitive Western Toad Populations be affected?
6. Would there be a change in distribution of Aquatic Nuisance Species (ANS)?

Indicators and Measures
Analysis Question 1 - How would Stream Habitat Conditions change for Drunella doddsi (MIS)
and other stream dependent species?
Changes in the quality and quantity of stream habitat conditions, is directly related to how well a stream
functions. Stream function is primarily affected by sediment delivery, changes in riparian vegetation
(which influences stream temperature), and stream channel shape or morphology.
If the amount of sediment delivered to a stream increases beyond the stream’s capacity to transport it, it is
deposited on the stream bottom impacting conditions important for trout. Excessive deposition clogs
interstitial spaces between rocks on the bottom of the stream, restricting water movement through the
substrate. This reduces oxygen delivery to - and removal of metabolic wastes from – fish eggs increasing
mortality. Sediment laden stream bottoms also restrict the ability of young fry to move through the
substrate into the water column to begin active feeding. If sediment levels are too great, entombment
occurs and mortality increases.
Substantial sediment deposition can also prevent juvenile trout from using spaces between larger, cobble
sized rocks in the substrate as cover. Sediment can also fill pools, decreasing their depth and complexity.
This makes them less suitable for use by adults and juvenile fish. The combined result of excessive
sedimentation is a reduction in a stream’s ability to support a healthy fishery.

284

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Alterations in riparian vegetation can reduce shading for streams, resulting in increased water
temperatures. If temperature increases are substantial enough, they limit aquatic populations or even
change ecological balances represented by abundances of different species.
Where streams are functioning properly, stability in stream channel shape or morphology helps
maintaining an abundance and proper diversity of habitat conditions for different aquatic life stages.
The indicator and measures chosen to evaluate the effects of this project on DD and other stream
dependent species are:
Indicator - Change in stream function:
Measure - Changes in sediment delivery to streams from harvest units, roads and prescribed
fire
Measure - Changes in miles of motorized routes in RCAs
Measure - Changes in stream water temperatures
Measure - Changes in stream channel morphology
Analysis Question 2 - How would pond and wetland habitat conditions change for aquatic
species?
The aquatic species of concern that occupy pond and wetland habitats are primarily amphibians. Some
amphibians also depend on streams to meet their habitat needs. However, because they typically lay eggs
on submergent vegetation or on top of the substrate, sediment effects on reproductive success is less
immediate than with trout.
For these reasons, amphibian effects are primarily considered relative to project effects on ponds and
wetlands. Within the analysis area, ponds are limited in abundance, mostly occurring as beaver ponds.
Most wetlands are narrow, linear features associated with streams and their floodplains. For this reason,
stream RCAs are focus areas where there is the greatest likely-hood of effect and where the greatest
changes could occur.
The types of effects to ponds relative to sediment introduction and physical alterations are similar to
wetlands. Vehicle impacts along with sedimentation would mostly occur around the margins of ponds
where habitat characteristics are similar to—or actually representative of—wetland conditions; with
shallow water depths and emergent vegetation. With this in mind, this analysis will focus on effects to
wetlands, understanding that effects to ponds would be similar in nature.
Wetlands have the greatest potential to be impacted through sediment delivery, which makes them
shallower and smaller or physically by motorized vehicles traveling through them Substantive physical
alteration or loss of size and or depth is considered to be commensurate with a change in function.
The indicator and measures chosen to evaluate the effects of this project on pond and wetland conditions
for aquatic species are:
Indicator - Change in pond and wetland function
Measure - Changes in miles of motorized routes in RCAs
Measure - Changes in sediment delivery to ponds and wetlands from harvest units, roads and
prescribed fire

285

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Analysis Question 3 – How would persistence of sensitive westslope cutthroat trout populations
be affected within the analysis area?
The persistence of westslope cutthroat trout populations require protections against hybridization and
competition from nonnative species and an adequate quantity and quality of stream habitat to support
abundant numbers of fish in all life stages.
The Forest Service does not manage fish populations, the state of Montana does. Thus, the Forest Service
cannot alleviate threats non-native fish pose to WCT. We are, however, responsible for managing stream
habitat conditions on National Forest lands. The quality and quantity of habitat, is directly related to how
well a stream functions. Stream function is primarily affected by sediment delivery, changes in riparian
vegetation (which influences stream temperature), and stream channel morphology (i.e., shape).
The indicators and measures chosen to evaluate how WCT population persistence would be affected
within the analysis area are:
Indicator – Changes in habitat conditions for WCT occupied streams
Measure - Changes in sediment delivery to WCT occupied streams from harvest units, roads
and prescribed fire.
Measure - Changes in miles of motorized routes in RCAs
Measure – Changes in water temperatures in WCT occupied streams.
Measure - Changes in stream channel morphology
Analysis Question 4 – How would Bull Trout be affected within the Analysis Area
On July 10, 1998, bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) were listed as a Threatened Species, within the
Columbia River Basin, by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). Section 7(a) (2) of the
Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973 as amended requires all federal agencies to review actions
authorized, funded, or carried out by them to ensure such actions do not jeopardize the continued
existence of listed species. Bull trout were listed under ESA primarily due to habitat threats.

Habitat conditions are important in the recovery and conservation of bull trout. Spawning usually
occurs in third and fourth order streams, in low gradient areas (less than 2 percent) with gravel/cobble
substrate. Proximity of cover for the adult fish before and during spawning is an important habitat
component. Successful incubation of bull trout embryos requires water temperatures below 8ᵒ C,
spawning gravels with low amounts of fine sediment and high gravel permeability. Mortality of eggs or
fry can be caused by scouring during high flows, freezing during low flows, or deposition of fine
sediments.
On September 30, 2010, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service designated critical habitat (CH) for bull trout
throughout their U.S. range. Critical habitat includes those areas occupied by the species, on which are
found physical and biological features that are essential for conservation of an ESA listed species and
which may require special management considerations or protection.
The analysis area includes portions of bull trout CH. This CH occurs within Boulder Creek, Flint Creek
and the Clark Fork River. Log hauling would occur within the RCAs of Boulder Creek; and temporary
road construction, log hauling and road decommissioning would occur in the RCA of an unnamed
tributary to Flint Creek. Log hauling would also occur down Gold Creek, which has connectivity to the
Clark Fork River and Douglas Creek which connects to Flint Creek. The potential therefore exists to
impact bull trout CH in all three identified streams within this analysis area.

286

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

The indicators and measures chosen to evaluate how bull trout would be affected within the analysis area
are:
Indicator – Changes in bull trout Critical Habitat:
Measure – Changes in sediment delivery to designated Critical Habitat streams from harvest
units, roads, and prescribed fire.
Measure – Changes in water temperatures in designated Critical Habitat streams
Measure – Changes in stream morphology in designated Critical Habitat streams
Analysis Question 5 – How would persistence of sensitive western toad populations be affected
within the analysis area?
Data indicates western toads are widespread across the Forest but are relatively rare in occurrence.
Although they have not been documented in the project area, suitable habitat is present throughout. For
this reason, we assume they may occur in or along any of the streams ponds or wetlands within the project
area.
Possible effects to ponds, with regard to sediment introduction and physical alterations are similar to
wetlands. Most impacts would occur around the margins where habitat characteristics are similar to – or
actually representative of – wetland conditions; with shallow water depths and emergent vegetation. With
this in mind, this analysis will focus on effects to wetlands, assuming that effects to ponds would be
similar in type and extent.
Within the analysis area, ponds are limited in abundance, mostly occurring as beaver ponds. Most
wetlands are narrow, linear features associated with streams and their floodplains. For this reason, stream
RCAs are focus areas where there is the greatest chance for effect could occur.
Western toad habitats in ponds and wetlands have the greatest potential to be impacted by this project
from increased sediment delivery; making them smaller or shallower. For these reasons, the indicator and
measure chosen to evaluate changes in western toad habitats are:
Indicator – Change in western toad habitat conditions
Measure - Changes in sediment delivery to streams, ponds and wetlands
Under certain circumstances, toads are susceptible to vehicle related mortalities. This tends not to be
common, but the risk increases when roads and high traffic occurs next to areas where individuals are
concentrated; most notably breeding areas. We have not identified any breeding sites in the analysis area,
but it’s likely some are present.
Because all streams, ponds or wetlands, they are bordered by RCAs, the indicator and measures used to
evaluate possible effects of vehicle related mortality on toad populations are:
Indicator - Change in direct mortality to toads from motorized vehicles:
Measure - Changes in miles of motorized routes in RCAs
Measure –Miles of haul routes in RCAs
Analysis Question 6 – Would there be a change in distribution of aquatic nuisance species?
Aquatic Nuisance Species (ANS) are nonindigenous plant or animal species that threaten the diversity or
abundance of native and desired nonnative species and the ecological stability of the infested water. For
the purposes of this analysis, the ANS are Eurasian Water Milfoil, the New Zealand mud snail (NZMS),

287

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

and the parasite Myxobolus cerebralis, which causes whirling disease. Zebra mussels are nonindigenous
and can wreak havoc on native mussel populations, but have yet to be found in Montana.
Currently whirling disease has been found in over 95 bodies of water in Montana with severe infections in
the Madison River; middle Missouri River near Helena, Rock Creek near Missoula, Big Blackfoot River
and many smaller wild trout streams, but has not been identified in or adjacent to the project area.
The NZMS is native to New Zealand but long established in Australia and Europe. Population levels can
exceed 100,000 snails per square meter. New Zealand mud snails have become widely established in
Yellowstone National Park and in the Madison River Drainage in Montana. Modes of transport may
include hitchhiking on recreational equipment and other equipment used in water, on waterfowl and other
aquatic birds, and in the guts of transported fish,. NZMS degrade habitat through their extreme
colonization of stream bottoms and the subsequent impacts on invertebrate food sources. Fish receive
little, if any, nutritive value from eating the snail. It has an operculum that it closes when threatened,
which prevents digestive juices from reaching the soft tissue of the snail’s body when ingested by fish.
Risks of spreading ANS are associated with changing the potential for transport from sites they currently
occupy, into the analysis area. For this reason, the indicator chosen to evaluate the risk of changing ANS
distribution is:
Indicator - Changes in vectors of transport and introduction of ANS

Affected Environment
The following sections describe the existing condition of the affected environment for aquatic resources
in the Flint Foothills Project area and include the following: general watershed characteristics, overview
of analysis areas, watershed descriptions, fish distribution, special status fishes, and special status
amphibians. The existing condition of issue indicators is also described.

Watershed Description and Conditions
The Project Area totals 44, 493 acres and is located within portions of the Barnes Creek, Clark Fork
River-Dunkleberg Creek, Clark Fork River-Perkins Creek, Douglas Creek, Gold Creek, Lower Flint
Creek-Gird Creek and Pikes Peak Gulch 6th level watersheds. Although the project boundary includes the
upper portion of Barnes Creek, no vegetation or fuel management activities are planned in the Barnes
Creek watershed, therefore it will not be discussed further.
Overview of Stream and Watershed Characteristics
The existing condition of project area streams and fish populations reflect the influences of both natural
(climatic and geologic) conditions and human activities. Past management activities affecting aquatic
resources include road construction and maintenance, timber harvest, livestock grazing, water diversion
for irrigation, dispersed recreation, and historic mining.
The existing condition of riparian areas and wetlands are variable. Well-vegetated riparian areas filter
pollutants from overland flow; provide habitat for wildlife, and stabilize and shade stream channels,
which provide high quality habitat and minimize extreme variations in water temperature. Typically,
linear wetlands are found along the low-gradient stream reaches. These wetlands serve as habitat for
amphibians and other aquatic species, as well as storage for water during spring runoff. Wetlands release
cool, clean water to the channel during the later parts of summer.

Subwatersheds/6th Field HUC Descriptions
Upper Clark Fork River Basin Overview
Fisheries health within the landscape needs to be put into perspective of the conditions in the Upper Clark
Fork River Basin as a whole. The over-riding high risk factor to native salmonids in the Upper Clark
Fork River Basin is mining. Water pollution occurring prior to the turn of the century essentially
eliminated trout from much of the mainstem of the Clark Fork River. As recently as the early 1970s, the
river ran red from mine wastes that had been heaped along its headwaters by the copper industry in Butte
and Anaconda.
In 1992, EPA designated the Clark Fork River, from the outlet of Warm Springs Ponds to upstream of the
Milltown Reservoir, as a distinct operable unit of the Milltown Reservoir Superfund Site. An
investigation into the nature and extent of contamination of the Clark Fork River began in 1995.
According to EPA’s Ecological Risk Assessment (EPA 1999), historic impacts of mine waste on the
Clark Fork River were severe. The report indicates, “Essentially no fish existed in the upper Clark Fork
River dating from the late 1800s into the 1950s.” Fish populations began to reestablish to some degree
after construction of the third Warm Springs sediment pond in 1959, and a new water treatment system
for mine water discharge was installed in Butte between 1972 and 1975 that resulted in improved water
quality. Documented fish kills, however, continued as late as 1991 and State of Montana studies show a
significantly reduced trout population.
In May of 2004, the Environmental Protection Agency released a Record of Decision (ROD), for the
preferred method of cleanup for the upper Clark Fork River. The $120 million, ten-year cleanup decision
calls for a mix of toxic sediment removal and on-site treatment, bank stabilization, revegetation and weed
control. Currently, EPA is engaged in settlement discussions with the potentially responsible party,
Atlantic Richfield Company, in an effort to settle clean up responsibilities and costs associated with the
remedy proposed in the ROD. Dewatering from agriculture and interactions with introduced species also
rank as high concerns in the mainstem Clark Fork River. Other major risk factors include habitat
degradation from grazing in riparian areas and roads associated with forestry and mining. Warm water
temperatures in the river are also a major factor affecting native fish distribution (MBTSG 1995).
Clark Fork River Bull Trout
The The Upper Clark Fork bull trout Core Area includes the Upper Clark Fork River and all tributaries
upstream of the Blackfoot River (it was previously defined as everything upstream of Milltown Dam,
however, with the removal of the dam in 2008 the lower boundary was re-defined). Milltown Dam,
constructed in 1906, had isolated bull trout populations in the UCFCA from the rest of the basin for over
a century. Bull trout in the UCFCA probably originated historically as adfluvial spawning fish from Lake
Pend Oreille in northern Idaho. Following construction of Milltown Dam, bull trout stocks in the UCFCA
effectively became either fluvial or resident.

Bull Trout Status in the Upper Clark Fork River Core Area

Most of the bull trout in the Core Area are resident and the reason they primarily persist in tributary
streams is due to metals contamination and because much of the mainstem Clark Fork River and the
lower reaches of many tributaries are unsuitable for bull trout (warm and dewatered) in midsummer.
Widespread livestock grazing has had, and continues to have pervasive impacts on bull trout habitat.
Many stream channels have been straightened, and riparian corridors overgrazed. Unnaturally wide
stream channels and poor riparian vegetation conditions, combined with irrigation diversions that reduce
mid-summer flows, have disconnected stream segments and encouraged warm water temperatures. Lack
of water in the lower reaches of tributaries, and their affect on flows in the river is a major limiting factor
for bull trout in the UCFCA (MBTSG 1995). Numerous barriers and irrigation diversions reinforce
population isolation and the fragmented distribution of bull trout in this core area.

289

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

The substantial distance between populations and the suitability of habitat in the river and the lower end
of tributary streams as migratory corridors is a noted concern in the recovery of bull trout. However,
efforts are underway to arrest and clean up metal contamination in the Clark Fork River flood plain. This
should result in substantial improvements in water quality and bull trout habitat suitability (USDI 2004 p.
56).
Streams in the Upper Clark Fork River basin, when functioning properly, would provide an abundance
and diversity of habitats desired by bull trout, suggesting that the area historically supported a healthy,
well connected and widely distributed population. The Upper Clark Fork Core Area may have supported
1000 to 1500 redds prior to the 1850’s (USDA 2013).
Fish Sampling History and Pertinent Information
Over the past 30 years, Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks has regularly monitored trout populations in the
Upper Clark Fork River, focusing on two primary sections. These sections include the pH Shack section
near Warm Springs and the Williams-Tavenner. Since 2008, two sections were added to improve
documentation of fish distribution and densities throughout the upper river, and to establish better
baseline data prior to the beginning of superfund cleanup work on the Clark Fork River. The sections
added include the Phosphate Section near Phosphate (added in 2008) and the Below Sager Lane Section
located several miles upstream of Deer Lodge (added in 2010). All sampling has consisted of mark and
recapture electrofishing during the spring (typically during the month of April) with a boat mounted
electrofishing unit. In 1987, they continuously sampled the Upper Clark Fork River from Warm Springs
to Jens. A similar effort was completed by FWP in 2009 and in 2015.
Twelve bull trout were captured in the upper Clark Fork River between 1989 and 1994; eight of these fish
were found in vicinity of Warm Springs Creek and Racetrack Creek (PTS 2002; as cited in USFS 2013).
No bull trout were captured in either the 1987, 2009 or 2015 continuous sampling efforts. The only bull
trout recently captured by FWP was in 2012 a short distance upstream of Gold Creek.
Within this timeframe, FWP has received three substantiated reports of bull trout being captured by
anglers below Warmsprings Ponds ( Jason Lindstrom, personal communication; Jan 6, 2015). It is his
perspective that an occasional bull trout will move into the upper-most reach of the river from
Warmsprings Creek to take advantage of increased food – available because of elevated nutrients in the
outflow from warmsprings ponds. Fish that occasionally show up there likely move back into
Warmsprings Creek when warmer water temperatures in the river become unsuitable.
The data collected through substantial and regularly conducted electrofishing sampling in the Clark Fork
River from Gold Creek to Warmsprings Ponds, over the last 25 years; coupled with other pertinent
information, seems to reasonably support the assumption that bull trout are largely absent from this
stretch of river.
The Clark Fork is home to many other native and non-native fish. Westslope cutthroat trout are still
prensent though at low numbers. Non-native rainbow, brook and brown trout have invaded the system
with brown and rainbow trout taking up much of the bio-mass. Native salominds are mostly being
outcompted by these two large aggrisve trout. However, the straem still contains large numbers of native
mountain whitefish, sulpin, and longnose dace.
Clark Fork River – Dunkleberg Creek 6th Field Watershed
Dunkleberg Creek is a tributary to the Clark Fork River and enters the drainage at approximately river
mile 427.3. Land ownership in the drainage is primarily NFS lands in the upper portion of the drainage,
while the lower portion of the drainage is primarily private lands along with some State of Montana
school trust lands. The primary land use in the drainage is cattle grazing although some historic logging
was also observed.

290

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

A riparian assessment was conducted at RM 6.2 of Dunkleberg Creek (Lindstrom et al. 2008). The creek
was classified as a C channel type, and the habitat was in relatively good condition with some minor
degradation observed. The degradation that was observed was primarily due to reduced densities of
woody riparian vegetation throughout the reach and the absence of willows from the reach. Large woody
debris was also absent from the reach and deep pools were observed infrequently. This site appeared to
have been grazed heavily in the past, but was currently recovering from this disturbance. Signs of historic
logging in this reach were also observed that might have impacted fish habitat at this site.
Dunkleberg Creek supports brown trout as well as a genetically pure population of westslope cutthroat
trout. The Forest has previously invested in watershed improvements in Dunkleberg Creek. These
improvements include riparian fencing to exclude livestock access to the stream and willow planting to
enhance stream channel stability.
The unnamed tributary to Dunkleberg Creek where road temporary road T17 would be reconstructed
lacks a defined stream channel.
Clark Fork River – Perkins Creek 6th Field Watershed
Perkins Creek is a tributary to the Clark Fork River near river mile (RM) 285.3. This very small stream
drains for approximately 4.7 miles out of the Flint Range before reaching its terminus near Jens. Present
surface connection to the Clark Fork River is unlikely as the stream appears to be captured by an
irrigation ditch (originating on the Clark Fork River) prior to reaching the river. Land ownership along
Perkins Creek is comprised primarily of privately owned lands, with limited NFS land ownership in the
upper extent of the watershed. Most of Perkins Creek is accessible only through private land. The primary
land uses in the drainage are livestock grazing and timber harvest. Additionally, several
residences/farmsteads are located along the stream close to its mouth. Electrofishing surveys conducted in
Perkins Creek did not capture any fish (MFWP 2009).
Douglas Creek 6th Field Watershed
Douglas Creek is a tributary to Flint Creek and enters the drainage at approximately river mile 10.0.
Mainstem Douglas Creek begins with the confluence of the North and Middle Forks of Douglas Creek,
and flows for approximately 6.6 miles to its confluence with Flint Creek. Land ownership on Douglas
Creek is predominately private with the exception of a small parcel of land owned by the State of
Montana. The primary land use is cattle grazing, but historic mining and logging are also present in the
drainage. Below the project boundary, an old reservoir existed at approximately river mile 3.0, but it
appears that a new channel of Douglas Creek was constructed to flow around this old reservoir,
apparently as part of the past mining reclamation that has occurred in the drainage. It is speculated this
work was completed to prevent Douglas Creek from using its historic channel and floodplain, presumably
due to the polluted nature of these soils. A steep culvert was placed on Douglas Creek at the end of the
constructed reach to direct flow back into the historic channel below the dam and this structure is
currently functioning as a fish passage barrier limiting fish in the upper stream channel on NFS lands.
(Lindstrom et al. 2008). Douglas Creek contains brook trout, brown trout and a population of genetically
pure westslope trout.
Middle Fork Douglas Creek is a tributary to Douglas Creek and enters the drainage at approximately
river mile 6.3. The confluence of Middle Fork Douglas Creek with North Fork Douglas Creek forms
mainstem Douglas Creek. Land ownership in the Middle Fork drainage is comprised of both National
Forest and private lands. Land use in the drainage is primarily cattle grazing with historic mines present
throughout the drainage.
One section on Middle Fork Douglas Creek was electrofished in August 2008 (RM 0.5) (Lindstrom et al.
2008). This section was located on National Forest System land just upstream from the confluence of the

291

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

South Fork Douglas Creek (RM 0.5). Westslope cutthroat trout were the only fish species sampled on this
creek and suspected genetically pure as there is no record of stocking.
A riparian assessment was also completed on the Middle Fork Douglas Creek in 2008. Middle Fork
Douglas Creek at this site was classified as a B channel type, and the woody riparian vegetation at this
site consisted of Douglas-fir, alder, and lodgepole pine. Primary land use at this site was cattle grazing via
a Forest Service grazing allotment. The stream was well vegetated in most spots, however some cattle
hoof shear and bank erosion was observed. Fine sediment was relatively abundant in the reach and is
likely due to both upstream impacts and bank erosion within the sampled reach. Overall, the width to
depth ratio in this reach was low and pools were relatively abundant (Lindstrom et al. 2008).
South Fork Douglas Creek is a tributary to Middle Fork Douglas Creek and enters the drainage at
approximate RM 0.3. South Fork Douglas Creek flows entirely through National Forest System lands. A
grazing allotment exists on South Fork Douglas Creek, and cattle grazing was the primary land use
observed in the drainage.
One section on the South Fork Douglas Creek was electrofished in August 2008. This section was located
approximately 0.3 miles upstream from the confluence with Middle Fork Douglas Creek. No fish were
captured at this site. It is unknown why no fish were captured as no potential migration barriers were
observed downstream of this section and westslope cutthroat trout were captured in Middle Fork Douglas
Creek (Lindstrom et al. 2008).
A riparian assessment was also completed on the South Fork Douglas Creek in 2008. At this site, South
Fork Douglas Creek was classified as a B channel type and the woody riparian vegetation consisted of
Douglas-fir and alder. Bank erosion was high due to cattle hoof-shear and woody riparian vegetation was
sparse due to poor recruitment and heavy browse on young woody species. However, the creek was a
boulder dominated B-channel, and fish habitat remained good due to numerous boulder formed pools.
Many springs feed the creek in this reach likely keeping water temperatures low in the summer.
Gold Creek 6th Field Watershed
Gold Creek
Gold Creek is a tributary to the Clark Fork River that drains for approximately 15 miles before reaching
the upper portion of the Clark Fork basin at RM 291.6. Land ownership along Gold Creek is comprised
largely of private lands with some NFS lands in the upper portion of the watershed. The primary land uses
in the Gold Creek drainage are hay production, cattle grazing, and timber harvest. There is also evidence
of extensive historic mining activity in the watershed.
Fish surveys were completed in Gold Creek in September of 2007. The sites were located at river mile
(RM) 11.1, and 13.8. At RM 11.1, the fish community was comprised entirely of westslope cutthroat
trout. Like at RM 11.1, westslope cutthroat trout were the only species present at RM 13.8. However,
these fish tended to be notably smaller (Lindstrom et al. 2008).
A riparian assessment was completed at each site electrofished on Gold Creek in 2007. At RM 11.1 Gold
Creek was classified as a Rosgen B channel type. The riparian area was dominated by a conifer overstory,
with spruce and Douglas fir being most common. Alder and willows were also present, but the willows
appeared to be made up of older, decadent plants with little recruitment observed. It was noted that
browse pressure was evident on many of the willows that were present in the reach. Fish habitat was good
in this part of Gold Creek, but lack of deep pool habitat was thought to be a somewhat limiting factor.
Flow in this segment of the stream was noted as being relatively low (Lindstrom et al. 2008).

292

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

At the most upstream site sampled in Gold Creek in 2007 (RM 13.8), the channel type at the survey site
was typical of a Rosgen B stream type. Riparian vegetation was dominated by a spruce and Douglas fir
overstory, and a dense sedge and grass understory. Willows were in the area but very limited in
abundance, and those present showed considerable browse. Additional notes from the assessment indicate
the presence of nearby berms and old ditches likely associated with historic mining activity. Fish habitat
was rated as fair and was not felt to be at its potential. This was primarily due to low flow and a complete
lack of large pools and deeper pocket water.
North Fork Gold Creek is a tributary to Gold Creek that drains for approximately 4 miles before
entering upper Gold Creek at RM 10.1. Land ownership along North Fork Gold Creek is comprised
almost exclusively of lands administered by the Forest Service. However, approximately 0.2 mile of
channel at the mouth of the stream is located within a mining claim and is under private ownership. The
primary land uses in the North Fork Gold Creek drainage are cattle grazing and timber harvest.
Fish surveys were completed at two sites on North Fork Gold Creek in October 2007 (Lindstrom et al.
2008) at RM 1.6 and 3.7. At RM 1.6, the fish community was comprised entirely of westslope cutthroat
trout. No fish were found at RM 3.7. The upstream distribution of fish in North Fork Gold Creek was not
determined.
Riparian assessments were completed at both sites electrofished on North Fork Gold Creek in 2007
(Lindstrom et al. 2008). At RM 1.6, North Fork Gold Creek exhibited characteristics of both Rosgen B
and C channel types. While the riparian health within the reach was generally good, factors affecting the
overall score were site-specific grazing impacts, as well as the presence of an old road crossing that left a
segment of channel wide and shallow allowing mid-channel sediment delivery. Riparian vegetation was
dominated by a conifer overstory with lodgepole pine and spruce most abundant. Alder was also present,
but younger age-classes were lacking. Fish habitat was rated as good, but was lacking in large woody
debris and deeper pools. A diversion was noted approximately 1 mile upstream of the survey reach.
At RM 3.7, North Fork Gold Creek was confined in a narrow valley, and the gradient of the stream was
beginning to increase. For these reasons, the channel was classified as a Rosgen B stream type. No fish
were captured or observed at this site. Riparian vegetation was dominated by a conifer overstory with
lodgepole pine and spruce most abundant.
South Fork Gold Creek is a tributary to Gold Creek that drains for approximately 3 miles before
entering upper Gold Creek at RM 12.0. Land ownership along South Fork Gold Creek is a mixture of
NFS administered lands and a number of private mining claims. Several lakes exist within the drainage
including Gold Creek Lakes, which occur at approximately RM 1.9 on South Fork Gold Creek, and
Rainbow Lake, which is located off of South Fork Gold Creek. All have historically been stocked with
fish (both rainbow trout and westslope cutthroat trout); however, the most recent plant was in Rainbow
Lake in 2001 (westslope cutthroat trout). The primary land uses in the South Fork Gold Creek drainage
are historic mining and timber harvest, and recreation.
A fish survey was completed at one site on South Fork Gold Creek in October 2007 (Lindstrom et al.
2008). This site was located on NFS lands at RM 0.8. The fish community at this site was comprised
entirely of westslope cutthroat trout. The stream at the survey site was classified as a Rosgen B channel
type. Riparian vegetation was dominated by a conifer overstory, with spruce and Douglas fir the dominant
species present. Alder and snowberry were also common in the understory. Fish habitat was rated as
good, and was thought to be near its potential. Large woody debris, root wads and overhanging vegetation
were all abundant throughout the reach. Pools however, tended to be smaller and lacked depth. Fine
sediment accumulation was notable. A culvert located upstream of the section did not appear to be a fish
passage concern.

Blum Creek is a small (average wetted width 4 feet), first order tributary to Gold Creek with the
confluence located downstream of the Forest boundary. The stream flows perennially for approximately
2.3 miles on the Forest. The average gradient for the stream is 4-6 percent. Instream habitat throughout
Blum Creek is poor. Although this stream does support low numbers of cutthroat trout, no estimate of the
population size was possible due to the very low numbers of adult fish. Preliminary results indicate this
population of westslope cutthroat trout may be slightly hybridized with Yellowstone cutthroat trout.
Crevice Creek is a tributary to Gold Creek that drains for approximately 4.5 miles before entering middle
Gold Creek at RM 6.6. Land ownership along Crevice Creek is comprised mostly of lands administered
by the BDNF, with the lower mile of the channel flowing through private lands at the site of a lowdensity subdivision. Goldberg Reservoir is a small 8-acre impoundment at the head of the drainage.
However, the primary direction of flow out of this reservoir is into the Dunkleberg Creek watershed. Only
a marginal connection to Crevice Creek appears to be present, and is related to high water level
elevations. The primary land uses in the Crevice Creek drainage are cattle grazing and timber harvest.
Fish surveys were completed at two sites on Crevice Creek in September of 2007 (Lindstrom et al. 2008)
at RM 1.8 and 4.4. The fish community at both sites was comprised entirely of westslope cutthroat trout.
Fish were also observed to be present in Goldberg Reservoir.
Riparian assessments were completed for both sites electrofished on Crevice Creek in 2007 (Lindstrom et
al. 2008). At RM 1.8, Crevice Creek was classified as a Rosgen B channel type. Woody vegetation at RM
1.8 was dominated by alder and spruce, with dogwood and Douglas fir also present. However, it was
noted that dogwood and woody shrubs showed notable browse pressure. Cattle hoof shear was evident
along the streambanks and throughout the riparian area, and noxious weeds were also fairly abundant.
Fish habitat at RM 1.8 was rated as good, but was not at its potential. This was primarily because of a
lack of large woody debris in the channel, as well as the absence of deep pools. Fine sediment
accumulation was notable throughout the reach.
At RM 4.4, Crevice Creek continued to display characteristics of a Rosgen B channel type. Conifers, with
spruce and lodgepole pine most abundant, dominated the riparian overstory. Snowberry and alder plants
were also present. Grazing impacts were observed throughout the reach with hoof shear along the
streambanks and low stubble height on available grasses being most notable. Fish habitat at RM 4.4 was
rated as only fair and was not at its full potential. This was primarily due to the lack of deep pools, large
woody debris, and grazed grasses on the stream bank that offered little overhead cover. Fine sediment
accumulation was also notable at this site (Lindstrom et al. 2008).
Pikes Peak Creek 6th Field Watershed
Pikes Peak Creek is a tributary to Gold Creek that drains for over 12 miles before entering lower Gold
Creek at RM 2.9. Land ownership along the lower 6 miles of Pikes Peak Creek is comprised largely of
private lands with some limited State of Montana ownership where it flows through lands administered by
the Montana State Prison. The upper 6 miles of the stream flows exclusively though NFS administered
lands. The primary land uses in the Pikes Peak Creek drainage are cattle grazing and timber harvest.
There is also evidence of historic mining activity in the watershed.
A fish survey was completed at one site on Pikes Peak Creek in October 2007 (Lindstrom et al. 2008).
The site was located on NFS land at RM 6.7. The fish community at this site was comprised entirely of
westslope cutthroat trout.
A riparian assessment was also completed at the site electrofished on Pikes Peak Creek in 2007
(Lindstrom et al. 2008). Riparian vegetation was dominated by a conifer overstory of spruce and Douglas
fir, with alder, willow and cottonwood also present. It was noted that younger age-classes of willow, alder
and cottonwood were largely absent, and what was present showed evidence of heavy browse pressure.

294

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Although the channel was a relatively stable Rosgen B stream type, cattle impacts to the streambanks
were also noted. Fish habitat in the reach was rated only fair due to lack of quality cover components such
as deep pools and overhanging vegetation, as well as very low flow in the channel. The stream was
observed to be dewatered and dry for most of its length downstream of the sample site. Larger cobbles
and boulders dominated the substrate at RM 6.7, and appeared to be a possible result of historic placer
mining activity in the stream channel.
Flint Creek is a fourth HUC stream. It flows from Georgetown Lake nearly 50 miles to its confluence
with the Clark Fork River. The stream has a gentle gradient throughout its length. Grazing and water
diversion are found through a major portion of the drainage. Flows from the East Fork Rock Creek are
added to the drainage as part of irrigation and keep the stream fairly high in the summer months. The high
amounts of agriculture and grazing impact both water quality and temperature. Native fish known from
the drainage include bull trout, westslope cutthroat trout, mountain whitefish, large scale suckers, and
sculpin. Non-native fish include rainbow trout, brown trout and brook trout. Native trout with the
exception of whitefish and suckers have nearly been removed from the stream. High water temperatures
and poor water quality have made conditions where brown trout have nearly taken over all habitats.
Lower Flint Creek - Gird Creek 6th Field Watershed
Gird Creek and its tributaries support an isolated population of genetically pure westslope cutthroat
trout. They are the only fish species present in this drainage, as the stream dewaters near the lower end of
the stream on private land, these barriers effectively block invasion of nonnative species. A recent
assessment of the reach adjacent to where temporary road T21 would be constructed in the RCA indicates
the width/depth ratio (10.6) and large woody debris (17 pieces/mile are narrowly outside objectives in the
Forest Plan (page 19).
A similar assessment in the RCA of an unnamed tributary to Flint Creek adjacent to where temporary
roads T2 and T3 indicated there is no defined stream channel.
Boulder Creek is a large tributary to Flint Creek. Bull trout still occupy most of their historic habitat in
the Boulder Creek watershed, but at reduced densities. The total size of the population is estimated to
contain more than 2000 residents, with some small amount of migratory component (Liermann 2007).
In general, resident bull trout are widely distributed in Boulder Creek and the South Fork of Boulder
Creek. Migratory adult bull trout, however, are rare and spawning is at extremely low rates from these
fish. There are two possible migratory strategies: 1) Migratory bull trout from the Clark Fork River use
Flint Creek as a migratory corridor into Boulder Creek, and 2) the most probable migration is downstream
from resident fish into the Clark Fork River that never return.
The trend of the Boulder Creek population seems to be stable in the upper sections but declining in the
lower sections (Liermann 2007, Redd Surveys Figure 3). The main limiting factors to the populations
are: (1) displacement by non-native brown trout and brook trout and (2) shrinking suitable habitat due to
water temperature from actions on private lands. The population is considered highly vulnerable due to
the possibility of non-native brown trout and brook trout replacement.
The distribution of brook trout and brown trout overlaps bull trout in the lower reaches of the Boulder
Creek watershed. he possibility of bull X brook hybrids is possible in all areas of overlap.
Brown trout and brook trout are most numerous in the lower reaches of Boulder Creek. They are
incidentally found in the middle reaches and not found in the upper reaches of the drainage.
Two sites were electrofished on South Boulder Creek on July 24, 2007. At river mile 2.1, 38 westslope
cutthroat trout and 2 bull trout were captured.

Sensitive Aquatic Species
Westslope Cutthroat Trout
Subspecies Range
Westslope cutthroat trout (WCT) inhabit streams on both sides of the continental divide. Its eastside
distribution is largely in Montana in the Missouri River drainage. Historically, within the Missouri basin,
the downstream distribution extended to Great Falls and included headwaters of the Judith, Milk, and
Marias rivers. On the west side, the subspecies occurs in the upper Kootenai, Clark Fork, Clearwater, and
Salmon rivers. It also inhabits the Spokane River above Spokane Falls and the Coeur d’Alene and St. Joe
drainages.
Westslope cutthroat distribution and abundance has declined substantially. Describing current WCT
distribution is complicated by an abundance of populations with varied levels of genetic purity. Shepard
(2004) used specific criteria to designate conservation populations. Basically they are genetically
unaltered; or those which are hybridized or the genetic status is unknown, but have ecological, genetic
and behavioral attributes of significance. Populations that occupy habitat likely to become part of a WCT
conservation focus were also included.
Total stream-miles occupied by conservation populations are nearly even east and west of the Continental
Divide, 646 on the west side and 635 on the east side. However, there are 29 conservation populations
west of the divide, while there are 144 populations east of the divide. Data points to notable differences
between populations separated by this geographic boundary. The average stream length occupied on the
west side is 22.3 miles, while it is only 4.4 miles on the east side.
Influences from nonnative trout and other factors have resulted in severely disjointed WCT distribution
patterns east of the divide. While WCT conservation populations are present in a reasonable number of
sub-watersheds/6th HUCs, they have been eliminated from most mid-sized and larger streams and rivers.
This leaves harsh, less productive headwater streams as their most common refuge. Even in headwaters,
they are often restricted to relatively short, stream segments where fish passage barriers protect them
against upstream invasion by nonnative trout.
Individual WCT are exposed to invasion by nonnative trout and unnatural competition and hybridization
risks when they move below barriers, and are essentially lost to the population. Consequently, selective
pressures result in the strong tendency for east-side populations to be isolated, non-migratory residents
lacking the characteristics and benefits of a metapopulation. While nonnative trout have influenced WCT
populations west of the continental divide in the same manner described above, the extent and magnitude
of effects are greater on the east side. The percentage of sub-watersheds containing conservation
populations in the Upper Clark Fork River are notably higher than those east of the divide. Further,
conservation populations persist in 36 percent of the historically occupied stream-miles west of the divide
and in only 8 percent of historic habitats east of the divide.
Westslope cutthroat was petitioned for listing throughout its historic range in 1997. In 2000, the USFWS
found WCT “Not Warranted for Listing”. A recent lawsuit resulted in the determination being remanded
to the USFWS for reevaluation. Following a new status assessment, the August 2003 finding issued in
response to the amended petition, again found WCT “Not Warranted for Listing.”
Forestwide Distribution
Based on the most thorough evaluation to date, WCT historically occupied about 33,000 miles of stream
in Montana. This represented about 59 percent of the range-wide distribution (Shepard 2004). About
9,300 of those miles (28 percent of the statewide distribution) are in the BDNF area. WCT were broadly
296

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

distributed across the Beaverhead, Big Hole, Red Rock, Madison, Ruby, Boulder, Jefferson, and Upper
Clark Fork rivers and Rock Creek drainages. Our best information suggests only 10 of 433 subwatersheds (6th field HUCs) did not historically host westslope cutthroat trout. Eastern brook trout is the
most influential nonnative competitor for WCT forestwide. While the nature of the competitive advantage
is not fully understood, the magnitude of the effects on WCT distribution is well known. Fish biologists
are documenting that brook trout continue to invade new areas and displace cutthroat many decades after
the original introduction.
Project Area Distribution
Westslope cutthroat trout occupy most of the named streams in the project area. They are the only trout
species present in the Dunkleberg, Middle Fork, South Fork and North Fork of Douglas Creeks, North
and South forks of Gold Creek, Blum Creek, Crevice Creek, Pikes Peak Creek and Gird Creeks. They are
incidentally found in Flint Creek and the Clark Fork River. In Boulder Creek, they have fairly high
densities along with other trout species. See table 88 followed by Figure 33 in this section for WCT
distribution in the project area.

Western Toad
The western toad is largely terrestrial and found in a variety of habitats from valley bottoms to high
elevations. They breed in lakes, ponds and occasionally in slow-flowing streams. They prefer shallow
areas with muddy bottoms. Breeding typically occurs from May to July, and tadpoles will metamorphose
when 2 to 3 months old (Reichel and Flath 1995). Juveniles can be found in dense aggregations adjacent
to breeding grounds. They are susceptible to high mortality rates if measurable disturbance occurs shortly
after metamorphosis.
Adult and juvenile toads are freeze intolerant and over-winter and shelter in underground caverns, or
rodent burrows (Maxell 2000). Adults feed on a variety of ground dwelling invertebrates and are known
to eat smaller individuals of their own species.
Within the last 25 years, western toads have undergone population crashes in Colorado, Utah, southeast
Wyoming and New Mexico (Ross et al. 1995; Corn 1998). In the northern Rocky Mountains they have
also undergone declines. Surveys in the late 1990s revealed they were absent from a number of areas
historically occupied. While they remain widespread across the landscape, they appear to be occupying
only 5 –10 percent, or less, of the suitable habitat (Maxell 2000).
Forestwide Distribution
A systematic inventory of standing water bodies in 50 randomly chosen sub-watersheds, on and off Forest
demonstrated similar findings (Maxell 2004). Data indicates western toads are widespread across the
Forest but relatively rare in occurrence (Maxell 2004). Toads were detected and breeding in only 7
percent of the suitable habitats within watersheds. What this represents with regard to historic distribution
and abundance in this area is not known, since there is no baseline data to compare against. However,
based on declines in other western states, it seems reasonable they are depressed and a primary cause is
believed to be disease. The Montana Natural Heritage Tracker Database is the primary source for this
information (MNHP 2010b).
Project Area Distribution
Surveys conducted by Maxell in 2004 included the Flint Creek watershed in the project area, did not
locate any western toads although suitable habitat may be present. For this reason, it is assumed they may
occur in or along any of the perennial streams (or their tributaries) within the project area.
Western Pearlshell Mussels
Margaritifera falcata may be one of the longest living freshwater invertebrates and animals. Specimens
have been aged at greater than 90 years (Vannote and Minshall 1982). The western pearlshell mussel has
an elongate shell typically 2.5-4 inches long with a concave ventral edge. The interior shell has a purple to
pink hue as the outside shell is dark brown to black. These mussels are found in cool, stable running,
generally low to moderate gradient streams and rivers. Swift stream velocities can limit where mussels
occur in streams. They are most commonly found in stable gravel and pebble benthic substrate, but can
occur in sand or gravel among cobble and boulders in moderate to higher gradient larger rivers. They
usually occupy reaches of stream where the riparian zone is dominated by willows or alders.
The life history of this mussel consists of four basic life stages, reproductive, larval or parasitic, juvenile
and adult. The larval stage (glochidia) briefly parasitizes a host fish, most commonly westslope cutthroat
trout by attaching to the gills. They fall off the host as a juvenile mussel. The larval parasitism on fish
enables upstream transport to habitats otherwise difficult to reach by relatively immobile adult mussels.

299

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Western pearlshell glochidia are considered highly host specific (Bauer 1987) as they are typically
restricted to salmonid fishes.
The western pearlshell mussel has experienced significant reductions in distribution over the last 100
years. A primary cause is believed to be stream habitat deterioration from high levels of fine sediment.
Excess fine sediment degrades mussel habitats by decreasing substrate permeability. This has a
smothering effect on juvenile mussels and limits successful recruitment (Stagliano 2010).
Because they have not been observed during past stream surveys, the Montana Natural Heritage database
contains no record of occurrence for this species in the project area and because the streams tend not to
provide the types of habitats they prefer it appears western Pearlshell mussels are not present, and so will
not be addressed further in this analysis.
Drunella Doddsi - Management Indicator Species
Background
The mayfly, Drunella doddsi (DD), is an aquatic management indicator species (MIS) for the Beaverhead
Deerlodge NF. It was selected because it commonly occurs in streams across the Forest; and because it is
influenced by changes in water quality, including sedimentation. The analysis for the Forest Plan
recognized sedimentation as an impact common to aquatic systems from land management actions,
including various types of vegetation management, road construction, vehicular use of roads and trails,
livestock grazing, and various types of restoration actions. High levels of fine sediment in aquatic systems
are commonly synonymous with degraded habitat conditions and poor stream function. The reverse is so
when fine sediment levels are low.
There are specific habitats with greater potential for hosting DD than others. Its preference is commonly
for higher stream gradients with larger substrate size. It is often present in lower gradient reaches, where
we commonly survey to evaluate aquatic impacts from management; but commonly in lower densities.
We expect to see abundances of DD decline in moderate to low gradient reaches if fine sediment is
deposition is increasing, leaving the population centralized in higher gradient areas where sediment is
transported through to downstream reaches. Thus, DD is probably more quickly influenced (and changes
in abundance more observable) in lower gradient reaches than in its steeper more preferred habitats.
Based on its ecology, abundances of DD should decline or increase depending on the influence land
management is having on sediment introduction. As such, its abundances should indicate whether
management activities are effectively maintaining and/or improving conditions for desired aquatic
species.
Abundances of DD naturally vary in four ways:
o

Between stream segments within the same stream depending on the quality and
abundance of preferred habitats

o

Between streams, depending on differences in thermal regimes and the abundance of
preferred habitats

o

Between different periods within the year, depending on when adult emergence occurs
and when newly deposited eggs hatch and become large enough to be captured during
sampling

300

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

o

Between years, depending on favorability of weather and stream flow conditions for
reproduction and recruitment

Thus, sampling times, locations and equipment can influence comparability of data between years.
Because DD was only identified as an aquatic MIS upon completion of the Forest Plan (2009),
adjustments to sampling procedures remain a possibility as we learn more about distribution and
emergence patterns in streams we monitor. Any adjustments will be done with the intention to produce
the most comparable data possible.
Because DD was relatively recently identified as an aquatic MIS, reliable trend information is not
currently available. We have sampled and counted DD in 111 samples from 75 streams across the Forest.
Densities ranged from 1 to 714 (per square meter); however it is common for them to occur in relatively
low densities. In 30 percent of the samples they occurred in densities of 10 or less. Fifty-two percent of
the samples had densities of 25 or less and 79 percent of the samples had densities of 100 or less.
Data on abundance is available for the North Fork Gold and the South Fork Douglas Creeks within the
analysis area. We have 1 year of information for each stream. For this reason comparison of the data to
determine trends in abundance is not practical at this time. Results are provided in table 89 that follows.

Drunella doddsi occurs in relatively low abundances in the two streams sampled in the project area.
However, inferring management effects from single samples is less than desirable and can be misleading.
Interpretation of this MIS data will be more reliable when results from additional samples are available.
There will be an opportunity to correlate MIS data with management actions and habitat condition trends
in the future.
Our monitoring is designed to measure changes in abundance of DD over time as an indication of
changing sediment levels. Effects of proposed management on this species will be assessed based on
expected change in stream function. As conditions improve in streams that are not in properly functioning
condition, sediment levels will decline and DD densities should increase.

Species Not Carried Forward For Detailed Analysis
Arctic grayling and western pearlshell mussel (sensitive) are not carried forward for further analysis
because of lack of suitable habitat within the analysis area, distance from known locations, or lack of
potential impact to the species or its habitats. Activities from the Flint Foothills Project would not have an
impact on these species.

Desired Condition
Regulatory Framework
Three government agencies share responsibility for managing aquatic resources. The U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service is a regulatory agency for federally listed species that seeks to recover these species in
conjunction with other agencies. Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks (MFWP) has primary responsibility
for managing fish populations. Management of fish and amphibian habitat on National Forest System
301

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

lands is largely a Forest Service responsibility. All three agencies cooperate in research and monitoring
efforts.
The Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest must comply with several regulations regarding management
of aquatic species. Both action alternatives fully comply with all regulations. The mayfly, Drunella
doddsi, is a management indicator species for the Beaverhead Deerlodge National Forest. It was selected
because it commonly occurs in streams across the Forest and because it is influenced by changes in water
quality, including sedimentation.
The sensitive species analysis in this document meets the requirements for a biological evaluation as
outlined in FSM 2672.42. Sensitive species are administratively designated by the Regional Forester and
managed under the authority of the National Forest Management Act.
The Regional Forester has determined that westslope cutthroat trout, arctic grayling, western toad and
western pearlshell mussel are sensitive species on the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest. The Forest
Service is directed to protect their habitat and prevent population declines that would lead to listing under
the Endangered Species Act (FSM 2670).
In 1999, the Regional Forester signed the "Conservation Agreement and Management Plan for Westslope
Cutthroat Trout in Montana.” This conservation agreement has five objectives, of which the first three are
relevant to National Forest System lands. The memorandum of understanding was updated in 2007 and
the Forest is still committed to the objectives described. The first objective is to protect all genetically
pure populations. The second objective is to protect all populations that are only slightly introgressed (90
percent pure). The third objective is to recover cutthroat trout in several large watersheds (at least 50
miles of habitat) across the state.
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service listed bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) as a threatened species, under
the Endangered Species Act (ESA) in 1998. Bull trout are present in upper Clark Fork River drainage as
well as in the Flint Creek drainage; including Boulder Creek. Water quality conditions have largely
eliminated upper Clark Fork River as suitable habitat or as a migratory corridor and bull trout are
currently rare to incidental in the river upstream of river mile 9.4, (MFWP 2009). This is the case with
Flint Creek as well. The species is incidentally found within the drainage. Boulder Creek still has a fairly
strong population of bull trout within the Flint Creek drainage. Critical habitat was designated in 2010
and includes the Clark Fork River, Flint Creek and Boulder Creek; all of which are outside the project
area.
The National Forest Management Act of 1976 - Prevents watershed conditions from being irreversibly
damaged and protects streams and wetlands from detrimental impacts. Land productivity must be
preserved. Fish habitat must support a minimum number of reproductive individuals and be well
distributed to allow interaction between populations.
Executive Order 11990, as amended - Requires federal agencies exercising statutory authority and
leadership over federal lands to avoid to the extent possible, the long- and short-term adverse impacts
associated with the destruction or modification of wetlands. Where practicable, direct or indirect impacts
of new construction in wetlands must be avoided. Federal agencies are required to preserve and enhance
the natural and beneficial values of wetlands. Other laws pertinent to watershed management of NFS
lands can be found in Forest Service Manual (FSM) 2501.1.
Executive Order 13112 - Directs federal agencies whose actions may affect the status of invasive species
to (1) prevent the introduction of invasive species, (2) detect and respond rapidly to and control

302

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

populations of such species in a cost effective and environmentally sound manner, as appropriations
allow.
Beaverhead-Deerlodge Forest Plan – This project follows direction from the BDNF Land and Resource
Management Plan (FP) including goals, standards and guides, and desired condition.
The 2009 Forest Plan includes the following desired conditions that are applicable to the project area
fisheries, water quality, and riparian and aquatic ecosystems.
•

Ecological processes, which affect the chemical, physical, and biological components of the
aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems and fully support designated beneficial uses, are present and
functioning to provide the diversity of forest, shrub land, grassland, riparian, and aquatic
communities

•

Conditions for self-sustaining or viable populations of native and desired nonnative plant and
animal species are supported within the natural capability of the ecosystem

•

Resources adversely affected by past management activities have been rehabilitated or the
related public health and safety issues corrected

The 2009 Forest Plan also contains goals specific to managing aquatic resources that are applicable to the
project
Stream Channels: Stream channel attributes and processes are maintained and restored to sustain natural
desired riparian, wetland, and aquatic habitats and keep sediment regimes as close as possible to those
with which riparian and aquatic ecosystems developed (IN 2) (FP, pg. 13).
Floodplains: The condition of floodplains, channels and water tables are maintained and restored to
dissipate floods and sustain the natural timing and variability of water levels in riparian, wetland, meadow
and aquatic habitats (IN 4) (FP, pg. 14).
Riparian Areas: Riparian habitat, species composition, and structural diversity of native and desired
nonnative riparian plant communities are maintained or restored to (IN 5-6) (FP, pg. 14):
•

Provide an amount and distribution of woody debris characteristic of functioning aquatic and
riparian ecosystems

•

Provide adequate summer and winter thermal regulation for streams to support beneficial uses

•

Provide bank stability to maintain rates of surface erosion, bank erosion, and channel
migration which are characteristic of functioning aquatic and riparian ecosystems;

•

Effectively trap and store sediment, build stream banks and floodplains, and promote recovery
after watershed disturbance

Riparian Habitat: Habitat to support viable, well distributed populations of native and desired nonnative
plant, invertebrate, and vertebrate aquatic- and riparian-dependent species are maintained or restored.
Movement corridors within and between watersheds, where desired, are maintained or restored to provide
aquatic-dependent species’ habitat needs and maintenance of metapopulations (IN 8) (FP, pg. 14).
Channel Integrity: Stream channel function and water quality are maintained or restored to support
designated beneficial uses on all reaches through management decisions, restoration projects or Best
Management Practices as outlined in the Soil & Water Conservation Practices Handbook.

303

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Roads: Roads are designed, constructed, and maintained to meet desired stream function and avoid
adverse effects to native fish and sensitive aquatic species (RF 2) (FP, pg. 15).
Stream Crossings: Culverts, bridges, and other stream crossings can accommodate a 100-year flood,
including associated bedload and debris (RF 4) (FP, pg. 16).

Aquatic Resource Standards
Standard 2: Evaluate the risks of aquatic nuisance /exotic species introduction as part of project analysis
(Scale – Project area) (FP pg. 18).
Standard 5: New activities within known sensitive amphibian breeding sites and natal areas during
breeding and juvenile rearing periods will not cause a threat to viability or a trend toward federal listing
(Scale - Breeding sites and natal areas identified at the project level) (FP pg. 18).
Standard 21: Provide and maintain fish passage at new, replacement, and reconstructed road crossings of
existing and potential fish-bearing streams, unless barriers are determined beneficial for native fish and
sensitive aquatic species conservation (RF 5) (FP pg. 20).
Standard 27: Vegetation and/or fuel management prescriptions in RCAs will be for the purpose of
restoring, enhancing, or protecting the physical and biological characteristics of the RCA including
Riparian Management Objectives. Vegetation and/or fuel treatments, for the purpose of protecting urban
interface, private property and other investment, and public safety in RCA’s shall be designed so as not to
prevent the attainment of desired stream function (TM 1) (FP pg. 21).

Environmental Consequences
Methodology
This analysis addresses effects on populations that result from:
•

Effects on aquatic habitat

•

Effects on individual aquatic species

Effects on species present in the Flint Foothills Project area, but not specifically addressed in this
analysis, should not vary substantially from those presented below. The extent of impacts to individuals
within populations should also be within the range described. This is because their behavioral tendencies
and sensitivity to influence from the causative factors are not substantially different from those species
analyzed.
Sediment Delivery
Roads
Estimated sediment delivered to streams from proposed road closures and culvert replacement/removals
were evaluated using the Forest Service WEPP Road Erosion Predictor model. The Hydrology section
provides a discussion, of WEPP Roads model used in the modeling process.
For the purpose of this analysis, only roads within 300 feet of perennial streams are considered to
possibly be hydrologically connected (i.e., have the potential to deliver sediment). Beyond 300 feet, any
sediment produced tends to be immobilized by vegetation and other ground barriers, before it reaches

water. That said, nearly all roads delivering sediment to a stream are much closer. Our analysis of road
derived sediment delivery points to streams across the BDNF, suggests nearly 95% occur when roads are
within 100 feet; and almost 100% occur when the road is within 150 feet.
The extent of sedimentation that occurs from roads is dependent on many factors. The potential for
sediment delivery from any route is first dependent on its proximity to a stream course. As the length of
road near a stream increases or as the distance between them decreases, impacts to the stream generally
increase. Increased sedimentation also occurs as the number of stream crossings increase. Failure of
culverts is another factor, and can occur if they have not been designed to handle high-water events.
These events are not necessarily typical, but are predictable as 10- to 100-year events. A more common
occurrence is “incomplete” failure, where water pools against the road prism or flows over the top of the
road for an abbreviated period, causing substantial erosion and the need for repair. This is typically caused
by partial or complete debris blockages at the upstream end of the culvert; or water passage limitations
during common high water events.
Beyond stream proximity and the number of crossing structures, the physical characteristics of each route
define the intensity, extent and location of sediment related impacts. The physical characteristics include:
width, slope, drainage features, geology, soils, adjacent topography, and the capacity of crossing
structures. All of these characteristics vary substantially between routes and are primary determinants of
the extent of sedimentation that occurs. The aquatics report in the project record provides more detail on
the factors that affect sediment delivery.This analysis expects that all newly constructed temporary roads
would be obliterated and would be hydrologically disconnected within a reasonable timeframe.
Temporary Roads

Haul Routes and Road-Stream Crossings

The erosion and sediment delivery potential associated with RCA road segments and road-stream
crossings on the proposed log haul routes was modeled with the Forest Service WEPP Road Erosion
Predictor model (Elliot et al. 2002). The estimated sediment contributions from roads and road-stream
crossings are reported in pounds per year.

Ground-based Timber Harvest

The Disturbed WEPP model was run for all timber harvest units within the Flint Foothills project area that
have a moderate, high-moderate, or high risk of erosion, and included those units that have sensitive soil
types and boundaries close to the RCA buffers. No sediment delivery is expected from proposed timber
units (See Hydrology section).
LWD Addition
LWD would create and improve pool habitat, promote sediment capture and retention, and (where
desired) improve stream width to depth ratios. Wood would be placed at a frequency that promotes a
minimum of 20 pieces per mile.
Large wood placement would occur in adjacent to where temporary road construction and reconstruction
occurs in RCAs with defined stream channels, using trees cut for temporary road construction. Minor
amounts of sediment would be introduced from these restoration actions.
Prescribed Fire in RCAs
No direct ignition of prescribed burning is allowed within riparian areas; but fire will be allowed to back
into RCAs to provide desired long-term benefits. Burning would occur when soil moisture contents are

305

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

relatively high to insure desired outcomes. It is likely that a few overstory trees would be killed, but not at
any substantive level. There is also some risk of sedimentation, but measurable effects are unlikely and
not expected. This is discussed in greater detail under environmental consequences.
There will be longer-term restoration benefits related to prescribed fires in RCAs. They are associated
with soil and vegetative rejuvenation from nutrient recycling; and displayed through increased growth and
production of understory vegetation. This will provide benefits in sediment filtering capabilities. The
likelihood of some mortality to over-story trees, would promote a small level of large wood recruitment,
without measurable adverse effects to shading. In the relatively near future, these few trees would fall and
become a source of large wood for riparian areas and streams, bridging the infrequent periods when
natural events cause pulses of over-story and riparian shrub mortality at higher levels. Benefits to riparian
areas and stream channels from large wood recruitment would be the same as those listed above through
hand placement of large wood.
Spatial and Temporal Context for Effects Analysis
The spatial boundary for direct, indirect, and cumulative effects includes the following 6th level HUCs:
Barnes Creek, Clark Fork River Dunkleberg Creek, Clark Fork River Perkins Creek, Pikes Peak Gulch,
Gold Creek, Douglas Creek, Lower Flint Creek, Gird Creek, Boulder Creek and the mainstem of Flint
Creek from Boulder Creek to its mouth, andultimately the Clark Fork River from Gold Creek to the
mouth of Flint Crek.
The spatial context for effects vary by issue, and range from individual streams, multiple streams
occupied by the same populations, and sub-watersheds (6th -field HUCs).
The time period that direct and indirect effects from sedimentation are projected to last, is through the
first major flushing flow following the cessation of the action. Across the project area, this is expected to
be no more than 5 years from the time the harvest commences, and often one year from the initiation of
specific treatments.
New sedimentation sources and their impacts can last a relatively short period of time if they are
moderate to low in intensity and soon to be removed. Excessive sediment deposited over longer periods
may take longer to pass through the system. Sediment impacts expected to be measurable in the stream
beyond 3 years are considered to be long term. Those expected to be measurable less than 3 years are
considered short term.
Past, Present and Reasonably Foreseeable Future Actions
Cumulative effects represent the incremental impact of a proposed action, summed with other past,
present and reasonably foreseeable actions and events within the same watershed.
Past, present and reasonably foreseeable activities and events within the analysis area that may affect
aquatic resources are displayed in Table 26 and Appendix D and include but are not limited to: timber
harvest, prescribed burning, livestock grazing, range improvements, mining, mine reclamation, water
diversion, noxious weed control, fish passage improvements, dispersed camping, the presence and use of
roads and trails, road and trail maintenance and improvements, beetle related tree mortality.
Cumulative effects are also considered under each alternative. Any activities and events not discussed,
lack the tendency for notable aquatic effects within the analysis area.

306

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Alternative 1– No Action
Direct, Indirect and Cumulative Effects
There would be no direct, indirect or cumulative effects to aquatic resources because no project activities
are proposed. A description of the ongoing processes is provided below for each aquatic issue, by
addressing their indicators.
Analysis Question 1: How would stream habitat conditions change for Drunella doddsi (MIS) and
other stream dependent species?
Because there would be no project activities, there would be no change in sediment delivery to streams,
changes in stream temperatures or changes in channel morphology; and no potential to affect stream
function. As such, alternative 1 would not negatively affect stream conditions. However, it would also fail
to promote improved habitat conditions that are not at desired conditions, and DD and other stream
dependent populations would remain at lower densities than those in streams with appropriate levels of
habitat quality and quantities.
Analysis Question 2: How would pond and wetland habitat conditions change for aquatic species?
Because there would be no project activities, there would be no change in sediment delivery or physical
impacts to ponds and wetland habitat conditions for aquatic species.
Analysis Question 3: How would persistence of sensitive westslope cutthroat trout (WCT)
populations be affected within the analysis area?
Because there would be no project activities, there would be no change in sediment delivery to WCT
streams, changes in stream temperatures or changes in channel morphology; and no potential to affect
stream function. As such, alternative 1 would not negatively affect stream conditions. In WCT occupied
streams. However, it would also fail to promote improved habitat conditions that are not at desired
conditions, and WCT populations would remain at lower densities than those in streams with appropriate
levels of habitat quality and quantities.
Analysis Question 4: How would bull trout be affected?
Because there would be no project activities, there would be no change in sediment delivery to streams,
changes in stream temperatures or changes in channel morphology; and no potential to affect stream
function. As such, alternative 1 would not negatively affect stream conditions, in bull trout occupied
streams below the project area.
Analysis Question 5: How would the persistence of sensitive western toad populations be affected
within the analysis area?
Because there would be no project activities, there would not be any change in western toad habitat
conditions, or changes in mortality to individuals from motorized vehicles. As such, alternative 1 would
not result in any change in the in the likelihood of western toad population persistence within the project
area.

307

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Analysis Question 6: Would there be a change in distribution of aquatic nuisance species (ANS)
within the analysis area?
Because there would be no project activities, there would be no potential to change opportunities for ANS
transport or introduction within the analysis area. As such, alternative 1 would not result in a change in
distribution of aquatic nuisance species in the analysis area.

Alternative 2 – Proposed Action

Direct and Indirect Effects
A description of the direct and indirect effects of alternative 2 is provided for each aquatic issue by
addressing indicators.
Analysis Question 1: How would stream habitat conditions change for (MIS) Drunella doddsi (DD)
and other stream dependent species?
Indicator - Change in stream function
•

Measure: Change in sediment delivery to streams from harvest units, roads, large wood
placement and prescribed fire: The Hydrology section of this document provides a detailed
analysis of sediment effects on water resources. The information that follows draws from
those findings.
There would be no sediment delivery to streams from timber harvest units.
Based on review of BMP effectiveness in the project area, we believe approximately 20% of
the delivery sites would have small increases in sediment delivery during log-haul,
approximately 50% of sediment delivery sites BMP’s would be effective in ensuring no
additional sediment delivery during haul with likely beneficial effects especially post haul,
and at 30% of sites, best management practices would fully compensate for haul- related
sediment delivery with benefits during and following timber hauling activities. Overall, the
analysis indicated total sediment delivery would be fully be accounted for with the
implementation of BMP’s with some reduction possible. After project implementation, BMP
improvements would result in an estimated 40 percent reduction in total sediment delivery
from current conditions.
Stream restoration using placement of large wood would occur in approximately 0.2 miles of
Gird Creek adjacent to where temporary road construction would occur. Wood used for
restoration would come from trees cut during road work. Placement of large wood would be
done in a manner that creates and improves pool habitat, promotes sediment capture and
retention, and/or improves stream width to depth ratios. Wood would be placed at a frequency
that promotes a minimum of 20 pieces per mile.
Minor amounts of sediment would be introduced from these restoration actions. It would be
temporary and only measurable a short distance (within a couple hundred feet) downstream
of each treatment. The benefits of sediment capture and retention should fully compensate for
the minor and temporary effects of sediment delivered from temporary road reconstruction,
and provide additional long-term benefits related to stream function well into the future.
Prescribed fire treatments could back into RCAs and burn within 100 feet of 10 different
streams and 7 stream systems (named stream plus its unnamed tributaries). The highest
potential for measurable sedimentation would be on Blum Creek. There is some risk exposed
soils could result in sediment erosion, however, we expect delivery would either not occur, or
would only occur intermittently and not in substantive enough amounts to cause measurable
effects. To validate this, we will monitor Blum Creek (the stream with the highest estimated
length of RCA that would be burned within 100 feet of the stream; to identify if treatments
result in any new sediment delivery sites and/or the level of sediment delivery that occurred.

311

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

•

Measure: Changes in Miles of motorized routes in RCAs: Alternative 2 would construct
0.5 miles of new temporary road in RCAs. Road T21 would have a segment about 0.17 miles
long in the RCA of Gird Creek that would access Unit 68c. With application of BMPs during
road construction the amount of sediment introduction from the road is expected to be
measurable, but relatively minor and temporary.
Temporary roads T2 and T3 would be constructed to access Unit 55C and would result in
about 0.33 miles of road within 150 feet of an un-named tributary to Flint Creek. It would be
near the headwaters, without a defined stream channel in an ephemeral draw. While some
sediment delivery to the RCA is expected, application of BMPs should result in effects being
nominal and primarily limited to the reach near where the roads would be constructed;
because of the ephemeral characteristics. The stream is fully diverted for irrigation purposes
2.2 miles downstream, with no observable connection with Flint Creek.
There would be about 0.17 miles of reconstruction on an existing road (T17) within the RCA
of an unnamed tributary to Dunkleberg Creek. With application of BMPs during
reconstruction, the amount of sediment introduction from the road is expected to be minor
and temporary in nature. Because work in the RCA is 0.5 to 0.7 miles above the confluence
and there is no defined stream channel, effects would likely be unmeasurable in Dunkleberg
Creek and downstream receiving waters.

•

Measure: Length of stream restoration through large wood placement: Alternative 2
would result in approximately 0.2 miles of stream restoration through placement of large
wood. Restoration would occur adjacent to where temporary road construction occurs in RCA
of Gird Creek. Wood used for restoration would come from trees cut during construction.
Minor amounts of sediment would be introduced from these restoration actions. It would be
temporary and measurable where it settles out a short distance (within a couple hundred feet)
downstream of each treatment. The benefits of sediment capture and retention should fully
compensate for the minor and temporary effects of sediment delivered from temporary road
construction and reconstruction; and provide additional long-term benefits related to stream
function well into the future.

•

Measure: Changes in stream water temperatures: Riparian canopies that extend at least
120 feet from a stream’s edge provide shade at a level comparable to un-harvested conditions
(Cristea and Janisch 2007). The Hydrology section of this document provides a detailed
analysis of vegetative canopy removal within 120 feet of streams, and the estimated effects
on stream temperatures within the analysis area.
There would be no Forest canopy removal in RCAs from timber harvest. There may be some
mortality to individual trees from prescribed burning. Effects would not result in a
substantive enough change in riparian canopy within 120 feet of streams to cause an increase
in stream temperatures.
There are only 2 locations within the analysis area where riparian overstory shade will be
influenced: (1) along Gird Creek, where temporary road T21 would be constructed; and (2) in
the RCA of an unnamed tributary to Flint Creek where temporary roads T2 and T3 would be
constructed. The estimated increase in maximum stream temperatures on Gird Creek would
be less than 0.5 °F. The alteration would likely persist for less than 500 feet downstream;
where unaltered canopy and shading would allow natural temperatures to be restored.

312

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Because of the ephemeral characteristics of the un-named tributary to Flint Creek,
temperature effects from the construction of roads T2 and T3 would not occur or be
transmitted downstream . There is no potential for temperature related effects to be
transmitted to Flint Creek.
•

Measure: Changes in stream channel morphology: Where extensive forest canopy
removal occurs in a watershed, there can be changes in runoff and water yield (Troendle and
King 1985; Winkler et al. 2010). If water yield changes are substantial enough they can
decrease channel stability and cause changes in stream channel form (morphology).
The Hydrology section of this document provides a detailed analysis of effective forest
canopy removal (ECR) from beetle mortality and that for proposed timber harvest under
Alternative 2. It suggests a low likelihood that changes in water yields associated with actions
from this alternative would have any effect on stream morphology.

Indicator Summary: Localized, but measurable increases in sediment delivery would occur in Gird
Creek, Boulder Creek, Douglas Creek, Gold Creek, an unnamed tributary to Flint Creek and an unnamed
tributary to Dunkleberg Creek. Effects are expected to be minor and temporary, and unmeasurable at Flint
Creek and the Clark Fork River.
Stream restoration using placement of large wood would occur in approximately 0.2 miles of stream. The
benefits of sediment capture and retention should fully compensate for the minor and temporary effects of
sediment delivered from temporary road construction and reconstruction; and provide additional longterm benefits related to stream function well into the future.
During project implementation approximately 20% of sediment delivery sites would have small increases
in sediment delivery during log-haul, approximately 50% of sediment delivery sites BMP’s would be
effective in ensuring no additional sediment delivery during haul with likely beneficial effects especially
post haul, and at 30% of sites, best management practices would fully compensate for haul- related
sediment delivery with benefits during and following timber hauling activities. Overall, the analysis
indicated total sediment delivery would be fully be accounted for with the implementation of BMP’s with
some reduction possible. After project implementation, BMP improvements would result in an estimated
40 percent reduction in total sediment delivery from current conditions.
Limited sediment delivery could occur in 10 streams from prescribed fire, but it should not be substantive
enough to create measurable effects (refer to Hydrology Effects Analysis in this document for a more
detailed assessment of effects).
There would be long-term restoration benefits related to prescribed fires in RCAs associated with soil and
vegetative rejuvenation as displayed through increased growth and production of understory vegetation
from nutrient recycling. This will provide benefits in sediment filtering capabilities. There is also a
likelihood of a low percentage of mortality to over-story trees. Because of the limited scope and mosaic
pattern of fire in RCAs, it would promote a small level of large wood recruitment that would bridge
longer periods of time where natural ecological events cause mortality at larger scales. The long term
benefits to the riparian area and stream channel will outweigh any short term impacts.
Increases in maximum stream temperatures would occur on Gird Creek (less than 0.5 °F). The increases
should persist for less than 500 feet before canopy and shading encourage temperatures to return to
normal.

313

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Effective forest canopy removals of 0-3 percent of total watershed acres would occur under alternative 2 proposed action. This, in conjunction with ECR from beetle mortality should not cause substantive
enough increases in water yield to promote stream channel changes.
The sum of these effects should not create any measurable negative change in function in any stream in
the analysis area. Positive changes could be realized in some streams, from reduced sedimentation,
although they may not be evident until after project implementation.
Question 1 Summary: Due to BMP application on all haul routes, overall sedimentation levels would be
reduced during project implementation. Fifty percent of current sediment delivery sites along log haul
routes would see an immediate reduction in sedimentation that would persist throughout and after project
implementation. Twenty percent of delivery sites would see a slight increase in sediment delivery during
log hauling. Eighty percent of delivery sites would see a post project reduction in sediment delivery.
Localized increases from log haul and should not are not expected to be substantial enough to cause
sustained measurable changes in habitat conditions. Sedimentation from prescribed burns are not
expected tooccur at levels that would be measurable in streams. Overall, there would be an estimated 40%
reduction in sedimentation across the project area post project implementation.
Small levels of sedimentation could occur intermittently in streams after prescribed fire treatments, it
would not result in measurable effects. Burning in RCAs could result in some sedimentation, but it is
unlikely and effects are expected to be unmeasurable.
Minor amounts of sediment would be introduced from stream restoration using large wood. The benefits
of sediment capture and retention are expected tocompensate for the minor and temporary effects of
sediment delivered from the restoration and from temporary road construction and reconstruction.
The benefits of stream restoration and the rejuvenating effects of prescribed fire on the soil and vegetation
in RCAs would compensate for any possible effects of sedimentation and would provide added benefits
into the future.
Slight increases in maximum water temperatures may, but is estimated to be less than1°F and would not
persist for any significant distance downstream.
Changes in forest canopy from harvest and vegetative treatments would not be sufficient to cause changes
in channel morphology.
In total, alternative 2 should result in notable long-term improvements in stream habitat conditions for
DD and other aquatic species in the analysis area due to the overall reductions in road generated sediment.
Changes in water temperatures that could occur on two streams would not be substantial enough to
measurably affect aquatic populations. Changes in forest canopy from harvest and vegetative treatments
would not be sufficient to cause changes in channel morphology.
This should equate to improvements in stream habitat conditions in many streams within the project area;
and potential increases in population densities of DD and other aquatic species. There should not be any
streams where the potential for negative impacts are extensive or would persist long enough to
measurably influence aquatic populations.
Analysis Question 2: How would pond and wetland habitat conditions change for amphibian
species?
Indicator - Change in pond and wetland function

314

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

•

Measure: Change in miles of motorized routes in RCAs: New temporary road
construction would take place on 0.17 miles within the RCA along Gird Creek, and 0.33
miles within RCA of an unnamed ephemeral/intermittent tributary to Flint Creek. About
0.17 miles of road would also be reconstructed in the RCA of an unnamed tributary to
Dunkleberg Creek. All newly constructed temporary roads would be decommissioned
following project activities. This would create some physical wetland disturbance if they
are present in these RCAs

•

Measure: Change in sediment delivery to ponds and wetlands: We assume there is a
direct correlation between sedimentation in streams and sedimentation in ponds and
wetlands, since most ponds and wetlands occur within stream corridors. Considering
sediment delivery occurs at points along roads and is not continuous, the occurrence of
sedimentation to ponds and wetlands is probably limited to fewer occurrences in the project
area.
If wetlands are present in the RCAs where temporary roads would be constructed, there
would be localized, sediment delivery with minor effects.
Prescribed fire treatments could back into RCAs and burn within 100 feet of 10 different
streams and 7 stream systems (named stream plus its un-named tributaries). The highest
potential for measurable sedimentation would be on Blum Creek. There is some risk
exposed soils could result in sediment erosion, however, we expect delivery would occur
only occasionally and not in substantive enough amounts to cause measurable effects.
Due to BMP application on all haul routes, overall sedimentation levels would be reduced
during project implementation. Fifty percent of current sediment delivery sites along log
haul routes would see an immediate reduction in sedimentation that would persist
throughout and after project implementation. Twenty percent of delivery sites would see a
slight increase in sediment delivery during log hauling. Eighty percent of delivery sites
would see a post project reduction in sediment delivery.
Localized increases from log haul and should not be substantial enough to cause sustained
measurable changes in habitat conditions. Overall, there would be an estimated 40%
reduction in sedimentation to streams across the project area post project implementation.
This estimate is probably also appropriate for ponds and wetlands. Sedimentation from
prescribed burns should not occur at levels that would be measurable in ponds and
wetlands.

Indicator Summary: For ponds or wetlands to lose their ability to function properly, they have to be
severely, altered to an extent that they lose their water table (substantial portion dries up); or have so
much sediment delivered to them that they largely fill in. Across the Forest, there are many situations
where they are being altered by livestock or motorized vehicles and/or sediment delivery is occurring.
However, management direction provides sufficient protections to prevent impacts from becoming severe
enough to cause a loss of function.
There is some risk of localized, minor and temporary increases in alteration and sedimentation in the
RCAs of Gird Creek, and unnamed tributaries to Flint and Dunkleberg Creeks, from temporary road
construction and reconstruction. There could also be minor amounts of added sedimentation from
prescribed fire backing into RCAs. However, the sum of effects from implementing alternative 3 should
not cause a decline in function for any pond or wetland across the analysis area. On the flip side,
beneficial effects could be realized in various places, from road BMP applications reducing sedimentation
and slowing the rate at which ponds and wetlands are becoming shallower and smaller.
315

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Question 2 Summary: Within the analysis area, there are no known ponds or wetlands that are at risk of
losing their suitability as amphibian habitat. Localized, minor impacts to ponds and wetlands could occur
in a few locations, but would not cause a loss of suitable amphibian habitat. On the other hand, benefits to
amphibian habitats would occur through measurable reductions in road related sedimentation across 45
percent of existing delivery sites
Analysis Question 3: How would the persistence of sensitive westslope cutthroat trout populations
be affected within the analysis area?
Westslope cutthroat trout occupied streams include:
Dunkleberg Creek

Indicator – Changes in Habitat Conditions in WCT occupied Streams:
•

Measure: Change in sediment delivery to WCT occupied streams from harvest units,
roads and prescribed fire: No sediment delivery to streams would occur from timber
harvest units.
Due to BMP application on haul routes, sedimentation levels would be reduced during
project implementation. Fifty percent of current sediment delivery sites along log haul
routes would see an immediate reduction in sedimentation that would persist throughout
and after project implementation. Twenty percent of delivery sites would see a slight
increase in sediment delivery during log hauling. Eighty percent of delivery sites would see
a post project reduction in sediment delivery.
Localized increases from log haul should not be substantial enough to cause sustained
measurable changes in habitat conditions. Sedimentation from prescribed burns should not
occur at levels that would be measurable in streams. Overall, there would be an estimated
40% reduction in sedimentation across the project area post project implementation.
Prescribed fire treatments may back into RCAs and burn within 100 feet of Douglas, NF
Douglas, MF Douglas, Blum (plus 3 unnamed tributaries) and Gird Creeks. There is some
risk exposed soils could result in erosion, however, we expect delivery would occur only
occasionally and not in substantive enough amounts to result in measurable effects (see
Hydrology Effects Analysis for alternative 3, for a more detailed explanation).
To validate this, we will monitor Blum Creek (the stream with the highest estimated length
of RCA that would be burned within 100 feet of the stream; to identify if treatments result
in any new sediment delivery sites and if so, the level of sedimentation that occurred.

316

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

There will be longer-term restoration benefits related to prescribed fires in RCAs. They are
associated with soil and vegetative rejuvenation from nutrient recycling; and displayed
through increased growth and production of understory vegetation. This will provide
benefits in sediment filtering capabilities. There is also the likelihood of a low percentage
of mortality to over-story trees. Because of the limited scope and mosaic pattern of fire in
RCAs, this would promote a small level of large wood recruitment, without measurable
adverse effects to shading.
In the relatively near future, these few trees would fall and become a source of large wood
for riparian areas and streams, bridging the infrequent periods when natural events cause
pulses of mortality at higher levels. Benefits to riparian areas and stream channels from
large wood recruitment would be the same as those listed above through hand placement of
large wood.
•

Measure: Change in miles of motorized routes in WCT occupied RCAs: Alternative 2
would construct temporary road, T21 which would have a segment that is 0.17 miles long
in the RCA of Gird Creek. With application of BMPs during road construction and
decommissioning, the amount of sediment introduction from the road is expected to be
minor and temporary.
There would also be about 0.2 miles of reconstruction on an existing road (T17) within the
RCA of an unnamed tributary to Dunkleberg Creek. With application of BMPs during
reconstruction, the amount of sediment introduction to the RCA from the road is expected
to be minor, temporary in nature and sediment related effects would not occur in
Dunkleberg Creek.

•

Measure: Restoration: large wood placement.
Alternative 2 would result in approximately 0.2 miles of LWD placement in Gird Creek.
Placement would occur adjacent to where temporary road work occurs in the RCA. LWD
would occur at a frequency that consistent with a minimum of 20 pieces per mile, and be
done in a manner that creates and improves pool habitat, promotes sediment capture and
retention, and/or improves stream width to depth ratios.
Minor amounts of sediment would be introduced from these restoration actions. It would
be temporary and measurable where it settles out a short distance (within a couple hundred
feet) downstream of each treatment. The benefits of sediment capture and retention should
fully compensate for the minor and temporary effects of sediment delivered from temporary
road construction and reconstruction; and provide additional long-term benefits related to
stream function well into the future.

•

Measure: Changes in stream water temperatures: Riparian canopies that extend at least
120 feet from a stream’s edge provide shade at a level comparable to un-harvested
conditions (Cristea and Janisch 2007). The Hydrology section of this document provides a
detailed analysis of vegetative canopy removal within 120 feet of streams, and the
estimated effects on stream temperatures within the analysis area.
There would be no Forest canopy removal in RCAs from timber harvest. There may be
mortality to a low number of individual trees from prescribed burning, in the prescribed fire
units. There would not be a substantive enough loss of riparian canopy within 120 feet of
streams, to result in an increase in water temperatures.

317

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

There is one location on a WCT occupied stream within the analysis area where shading is
likely to be influenced. This is along Gird Creek, where temporary road T21 would be
constructed, the estimated increase in maximum stream temperatures on Gird Creek would
be less than 0.5ᵒ F and would persist for less than 500 feet downstream of the area that
would be cleared for the road.
•

Measure: Changes in stream channel morphology: Forest canopy removals of 0-3
percent of watershed acres, would occur under the proposed action. The Hydrology section
of this document indicates this harvest should not cause substantive enough increases in
water yield to promote channel degradation in WCT occupied streams.

Indicator Summary: Localized, but measurable increases in sediment delivery would occur in Gird
Creek and an unnamed tributary to Dunkleberg Creek from construction and reconstruction of temporary
roads. Effects are expected to be minor and temporary. Measurable increases are not likely in Dunkleberg
Creek.
Stream restoration using placement of large wood would occur in approximately 0.2 miles of Gird Creek.
The benefits of sediment capture and retention should fully compensate for any minor and temporary
effects of sediment delivered from temporary road construction and reconstruction, and provide additional
long-term benefits related to stream function well into the future.
BMP application on haul routes, would result in estimated reductions in sediment delivery at 50% of
current sediment delivery sites. Twenty percent of delivery sites would see a slight increase in sediment
delivery during log hauling. Eighty percent of delivery sites would see a post project reduction in
sediment delivery.
There will be long-term restoration benefits related to prescribed fires in RCAs, associated with soil and
vegetative rejuvenation and the promotion of a small level of large wood recruitment that would bridge
the longer periods of time where natural events cause higher levels of tree mortality.
Overall, there would be an estimated 40% reduction in sedimentation to streams across the project area
post project implementation. Limited sediment delivery could occur in Douglas, NF Douglas, MF
Douglas, Blum (plus 3 unnamed tributaries) and Gird Creeks, from prescribed fire treatments, however
we expect the amounts delivered would not be substantive and should not result in measurable effects.
Because there is some uncertainty associated with our assessment of the prescribed fire effects, we will
monitor whether and how much sedimentation occurs in Blum Creek.
An increase in maximum stream temperatures on Gird Creek would be less than 0.5ᵒ F and would persist
for less than a few hundred feet, before undisturbed canopy and shading would allow temperatures to
return to normal. Changes in maximum temperatures of this magnitude are unmeasurable without years
of intensely collected data, because of substantial, naturally occurring daily, seasonal and annual
fluctuations. The effects on WCT populations would not be measurable.
Effective forest canopy removals of 0-3 percent of watershed acres would occur under alternative 2proposed action. This would not promote channel degradation in WCT occupied streams.
The sum of these effects would not create any measurable negative change in function in any WCT
stream in the analysis area. Positive changes could be realized in some streams, from reduced
sedimentation, although they may not be evident for a few years after project implementation.
Question 3 Summary: An overall reduction in sediment delivered to WCT-occupied streams would
occur across the analysis area during implementation of the proposed action. After project completion,

318

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

improvements from BMP applications are expected to reduce sedimentation from existing delivery rates
by about 40 percent.
The benefits of stream restoration and the rejuvenating effects of prescribed fire on the soil and vegetation
in RCAs would compensate for any possible effects of sedimentation and would provide additional
benefits into the future.
There would be no notable negative influence on habitat conditions from changes in water temperatures
or from changes in water yield or peak flows. In total, alternative 2 would result in long-term
improvements in stream habitat conditions for WCT in the analysis area due to reductions in road
generated sediment. This should help promote long-term persistence of WCT populations within the
analysis area.
Analysis Question 4: How would bull trout be affected?
Indicator – Change in bull trout Critical Habitat:
The most likely avenues for effects to bull trout from the activities proposed are from changes in
sedimentation or water temperature. There are no bull trout within the project area, so there is no
immediate potential for effects. Bull trout occur downstream of the project area in Boulder Creek, Flint
Creek and the Clark Fork River; all of which are designated Critical Habitat. These waters are connected
to the project area via tributary streams.
•

Measure - Changes in sediment delivery to designated Critical Habitat streams from
harvest units, roads, stream restoration and prescribed fire units
There’s little potential for measurable effects to be transmitted from the project area, to
Critical Habitat. The distances are substantial enough that any short term increases in
sediment would settle out or be deposited on flood plains before they reach Boulder Creek,
Flint Creek or the Clark Fork River.
With regard to longer-term reductions in sedimentation, within the project area, from
Alterantive 2; there would be little potential for benefits to be realized in any measurable level
in Critical Habitat. The scale of improvements/sediment reductions would not be substantial
enough to overcome the dilution of effects that would occur over those distances.
There is, some potential for log hauling below the project area to cause sedimentation to
Critical Habitat. Effects of sedimentation related to hauling on the Douglas Creek road, the
Gold Creek road and NFS roads 840 (Gird Creek), 1500 (Princeton Gulch) and 676 (Boulder
Creek) are discussed below.
During field assessments, we identified two possible sources of sediment delivery to Princeton
Gulch from road 1500. It is questionable whether sediment delivered to Princeton Gulch
would find its way to Boulder Creek in measurable levels. The delivery points are
approximately 0.50 mile above Boulder Creek; and Princeton Gulch subs (goes dry) about
0.25 mile above its confluence with Boulder Creek. There is a defined stream channel in the
segment that goes dry, indicating the channel carries water intermittently. None-the-less, we
assume some, limited potential for sediment delivery to Boulder Creek exists via transport
from Princeton Gulch.
There are three locations where sediment delivery from road 676 to Boulder Creek, appears to
be occurring. Sedimentation at these locations is not egregious and does not appear to be

319

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

substantively affecting habitat conditions. Log hauling has the potential to cause increases in
the amount of sediment deposited at these locations. However, best management practices
proposed for this road and for FS road 1500 would provide reductions in sedimentation that
fully compensate for any increases associated with log haul over the long term. Thus, there
should be no measurable increase in sedimentation during project implementation; and future
sedimentation would be reduced below current levels. Longer-term reductions in sediment
may not be substantial enough to cause measurable changes in effects to Critical Habitat in
Boulder Creek.
Regarding log hauling below the project boundary on the Gold Creek Road; the most proximal
crossings are 3.8, and 5.8 stream miles above the river. The nearer crossing (3.8 miles from
the river) is paved, and thus has no real potential for measurable effects from changes in
sediment delivery related to logging trucks.
The crossing 5.8 miles from the river is not paved but the road is designed and constructed for
higher traffic levels. The crossing is located where approaches are relatively flat. These
factors provide low potential for substantive changes in sedimentation with increased traffic.
As such, log hauling over these crossings will do little to increase sedimentation to Gold
Creek. Any increases in sedimentation would be unmeasurable a short distance below the
crossing, with no real potential for measurable effects to Critical Habitat.
Log hauling below the project area along Douglas Creek would also occur. There are 2
crossings on Douglas Creek; approximately 1.8 and 4.0 stream miles above Flint Creek. The
road also crosses Flint Creek near the Douglas Creek confluence. All crossings are well
designed and occur at locations where the approaches are relatively flat. The road is well
designed and constructed for higher traffic levels. There is some potential for minor increases
in sedimentation on the Douglas Creek crossings. However, the distances from the crossings
and the confluence of Flint Creek, leaves little potential for measurable effects to be
transmitted to Flint Creek.
Road 8402 follows Gird Creek and connects to MT highway 1. It lies within the RCA of Gird
Creek in several locations, and crosses the stream approximately one mile above Flint Creek.
The crossing is well designed and the approaches are flat, presenting little potential for
increased sedimentation from increased traffic levels. Gird Creek is heavily diverted and
dewatered immediately downstream of the crossing, leaving no potential for measurable
sediment delivery to Flint Creek from log hauling on this road.
Temporary roads T2 and T3 used to access Unit 55C would result in about 0.33 mile of road
within 150 feet of an un-named tributary to Flint Creek. The new road would occur in the
RCA near the headwaters, where the channel is largely ephemeral. Water from this tributary is
fully diverted 2.2 miles downstream and does not reach Flint Creek. While some sediment
delivery is expected to the RCA, we expect the effects to be nominal and the affected area
would be primarily limited to the reach where the roads are constructed, because of the lack of
a stream channel.
LWD placement would occur within the project area, adjacent to where temporary road
construction occurs in the RCAs of Gird Creek. The work would be done in a manner that
creates and improves pool habitat, promotes sediment capture and retention, and/or improves
stream width to depth ratios. It will result in minor, short term increases in sedimentation in
the immediate vicinity of where the work occurs. It will provide long-term benefits through
increased sediment capture and retention, increased pool quantity and quality and other aspects
320

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

of stream function. There is no real potential for sediment related to this work to reach Critical
Habitat in Boulder Creek, Flint Creek or the Clark Fork River.
Therefore, no measurable change in habitat conditions would occur in Boulder Creek, Flint
Creek or the Clark Fork River, from sedimentation, due to implementation of Alternative 2. As
such, project related effects would become insignificant before they reached Critical Habitat.
•

Measure - Changes in water temperatures in designated critical habitat streams:
Alternative 2 does not have timber harvest units in RCAs. Prescribed burning, may result in
the mortality of a few trees in RCAs. It would not, however, measurably influence shading on
any stream. As such, there would not be in any temperature related effects to streams from
timber harvest units or prescribed fire in the project area.
Removal of a few individual trees is expected within the RCA of an unnamed tributary of
Dunkleberg Creek from reconstruction of existing temporary road T17. This would not result
in any measurable change in water temperatures.
There would be canopy removal in the RCA of an unnamed tributary to Flint Creek during
construction of roads T2 and T3. However, because of the ephemeral characteristics of this
area, there would be no temperature related effects. Thus, there is no potential for temperaturerelated effects to be transmitted to Flint Creek.
There would be no measurable changes in water temperatures in designated Critical Habitat
from implementation of Alternative 2.

•

Measure – Changes in stream channel morphology in designated critical habitat streams:
Through our observations, we’ve not seen any changes in channel stability attributable high
peak flows; nor have we noted any changes in timing of run-off events. This suggests streams
in the analysis area are sufficiently resilient and are maintaining conditions.
With regard to effective forest canopy, removals of 0-3 percent of total watershed acres would
occur under the proposed action. This would not cause substantive enough reductions in forest
canopy to result in measurable changes in water yield or peak flows in any watershed. From
this, we expect no negative effect on stream morphologies within the analysis area. Nor would
there be measurable negative effects extended to critical habitat in Boulder Creek, Flint Creek
or the Clark Fork River.

Indicator Summary – Changes in bull trout Critical Habiat: No measurable changes in habitat
conditions, related to sedimentation, would occur in bull trout Critical Habitat. This is true for short term
increases related to aspects of project implementation (like placement of large wood in streams), and
probably also true for longer term sediment reductions. The scale of change within the Project Area
would not be substantial enough to overcome the dilution of effects that would occur in the distances to
Critical Habitat Streams. In the instances where log hauling below the Project Area would occur in more
immediate proximity to Critical Habitat, the change in sedimentation is expected to be unmeasureable and
not cause change in habitat conditions.
Similarly, there would be no measurable changes to water temperatures in Critical Habitat.
Reconstruction of existing temporary road T17 in the RCA of the unnamed tributary to Dunkleberg Creek
and construction of roads T2 and T3 in the unnamed tributary to Flint Creek would not be transmitted to
Critical Habitat because of 1) the substantial stream distance between their locations and Critical Habitat
2) the ephemeral/intermittent characteristics of the tributary streams;.

321

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Question 4 Summary: Implementation of alternative 2 would not result in any measurable effects to bull
trout or their Critical Habitat from changes in sedimentation, water temperatures or stream channel
morphology. While there would be a reduction in sedimentation from roads within the Project area, the
changes would probably not be of sufficient magnitude to result in measurable effects in Boulder Creek,
Flint Creek or the Clark Fork River.
Analysis Question 5: How would the persistence of sensitive western toad populations be affected
within the analysis area?
Indicator – Changes in Western Toad habitats
•

Measure: Change in sediment delivery to ponds and wetlands: We assume there is a
direct correlation between sedimentation in streams and sedimentation in ponds and
wetlands, since most ponds and wetlands occur within stream corridors. Considering
sediment delivery occurs at points along roads and is not continuous, the occurrence of
sedimentation to ponds and wetlands is probably limited to fewer occurrences in the
project area.
If wetlands are present in the RCAs where temporary roads would be constructed, there
would be localized, sediment delivery with minor effects.
Due to BMP application on all haul routes, overall sedimentation levels would be reduced
during project implementation. Fifty percent of current sediment delivery sites along log
haul routes would see an immediate reduction in sedimentation that would persist
throughout and after project implementation. Twenty percent of delivery sites would see
a slight increase in sediment delivery during log hauling. Eighty percent of delivery sites
would see a post project reduction in sediment delivery.
Localized increases from log haul and should not be substantial enough to cause
sustained measurable changes in pond and wetland conditions. Overall, there would be an
estimated 40% reduction in sedimentation to streams across the project area post project
implementation. This estimate is probably also appropriate for ponds, wetlands and
stream habitats suitable for western toads. Sedimentation from prescribed burns should
not occur at levels that would be measurable in western toad habitats.
New temporary road construction would take place on 0.17 miles within the RCA along
Gird Creek, and 0.3 miles within RCA of an unnamed ephemeral/intermittent tributary to
Flint Creek. About 0.17 miles of stream would also be reconstructed in the RCA of an
unnamed tributary to Dunkleberg Creek. All newly constructed temporary roads would be
decommissioned following project activities. This would create some physical wetland
disturbance if they are present in these RCAs.
Prescribed fire treatments could back into RCAs and burn within 100 feet of 10 different
streams and 7 stream systems (named stream plus its un-named tributaries). The highest
potential for measurable sedimentation would be on Blum Creek. There is some risk
exposed soils could result in sediment erosion, however, we expect delivery would occur
only occasionally and not in substantive enough amounts to cause measurable effects.
After project implementation sediment delivery is expected to drop from existing
delivery by 40 percent.

322

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Indicator Summary: If ponds and wetlands are present, there could be localized, minor and temporary
disturbance and sedimentation in the RCAs of Gird Creek and unnamed tributaries to Flint and
Dunkleberg Creeks from temporary road construction and reconstruction. However, the sum of effects
from implementing alternative 2 should not cause a loss of function or a measurable change in the
suitability of toad habitats in these or any other locations across the analysis area. Beneficial effects could
be realized in various places from road BMP applications reducing sedimentation, therefore, slowing the
rate at which ponds and wetlands are becoming shallower and smaller.
Indicator – Change in direct mortality to toads from motorized vehicles
Notable changes in direct mortality from motorized vehicles would be related to changes in the intensity
and speed of traffic near concentration areas.
•

Measure: Change in miles of motorized routes in RCAs: New temporary road
construction would take place on 0.17 miles of within RCA of Gird Creek and 0.33 miles
within the RCA of an unnamed tributary to Flint Creek. Both are in the Lower Flint
Creek-Gird Creek watershed. All newly constructed temporary roads would be
decommissioned by obliteration immediately following project activities.

•

Measure: Miles of Haul routes in RCAs: There would be 10.6 miles of road in RCAs
used for log hauling. It is possible there could be increases in the speed of vehicles
traveling routes within the analysis area, due to road improvements that would occur.
However, it is unlikely the increases would be more than a few miles-per-hour. With the
relatively low vehicle speeds common to Forest roads, we expect little to no effect on the
risk of vehicle related mortality. Situations causing notable mortality are often associated
with pavement and/or vehicles traveling at much higher speeds than we would see as a
result of this project.
There would be increases in vehicle traffic with workers traveling to the project area and
with log hauling. The time of travel would be concentrated during daylight hours, a
period when vehicle mortalities to toads are much less common. Based on this, there is
little increase in the possibility of mortalities due to higher traffic levels.
In the last 5 years there have been few documented occurrences of vehicle related toad
mortality on Forest roads; and none where a high number of - or even multiple mortalities
- occurred. The risk of multiple mortalities can increase where roads are adjacent to areas
where toads congregate. However, we are not aware of any breeding sites that are
adjacent to haul roads. Even so, aquatic standard 5 in the Forest Plan (Forest Plan p. 18)
directs us to modify management actions around a newly identified breeding and/or natal
area if they are causing mortalities to, or pose a threat to, populations. Given this
direction, along with the fact that there would be little to no change in risk from project
related activities we expect there would be no measurable change in the incidence of
vehicle related mortality to toads. Thus, for alternative 2, vehicle related mortality to
amphibians should remain at low levels and would not occur at levels that should create
negative trends in populations or place populations at risk.

Indicator Summary: The increase in motorized routes in RCAs (0.5 miles) proposed in alternative 2, is
nominal and temporary. There would be 10.6 miles of roads in RCAs used for log hauling under
alternative 2. The increased vehicle use in RCAs may cause a small increase in the possibility of toad
mortality. However, because we know of no breeding sites adjacent to haul routes in the analysis area and
because we have never documented a situation on the Forest where mortalities were beyond incidental,
we expect no notable change in direct mortality from implementing alternative 2.

323

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Question 5 Summary: Measurable reductions in sediment delivery to streams would result in habitat
improvements in the streams within a couple of years after implementation of alternative 2. Reducing
sediment delivery would lead to improved substrate and habitat conditions, so western toad population
density may improve.
We expect little to no change in vehicle-related mortality to western toads from implementing alternative
2. In addition, the Forest Plan directs us to modify management actions that would cause a threat to
population viability or a trend toward federal listing, Should vehicle related toad mortality be observed,
we would consider the need to modify the timing of log hauling to mitigate the impacts. As such there
should be no negative effect on western toad persistence within the analysis area.
Analysis Question 6: Would there be a change in the distribution of aquatic nuisance species
(ANS)?
Indicator - Expected change in vectors of transport and introduction of ANS:
The risk of introducing ANS into the analysis area depends on changing the likelihood of transporting
them from infected waters into the analysis area. The nearest locations for 3 ANS of concern are Canyon
Ferry (western milfoil), the Beaverhead River (New Zealand mudsnail) and the Clark-Fork River
(whirling disease). There is nothing proposed as part of implementing alternative 2 that would increase
the risk of transporting these species from their current locations to the project area.
Further, project effects would not cause subsequent changes in recreational uses in a way that increases
the risk of introducing these species into the project area.
Question 6 Summary: Because there are currently no known ANS near or within the analysis area and
this project is not expected to cause a change in vectors of transport. For this reason, there should be no
change in the risk of introducing ANS into the analysis area by implementing Alternative 2.

Alternative 3
Table 92 provides measures that are used in the subsequent analysis. It displays haul routes and temporary
road lengths, stream crossings and proposed temporary or NFS roads in RCAs for alternative 3 for
drainages with streams occupied by westslope cutthroat trout.
Direct and Indirect Effects
A description of the direct and indirect effects of alternative 3 is provided below for each aquatic issue, by
addressing their indicators.
Analysis Question # 1: How would stream habitat conditions change for Drunella doddsi (MIS) and
other stream-dependent species?
Changes in the quality and quantity of stream habitat conditions, is directly related to how well a stream
functions. Stream function in the analysis area is primarily affected by sediment delivery and physical
alterations to stream banks and floodplains.
Indicator - Change in stream function:
•

Measure: Change in sediment delivery to streams from harvest units, roads and
prescribed fire: The Hydrology section of this document provides a detailed analysis of
sediment and canopy removal effects on water resources. The information that follows in
this analysis draws from that analysis.

324

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

There would be no sediment delivery to streams from timber harvest units.
Based of review of BMP’s effectiveness in the project area, we believe approximately
20% of the delivery sites would have small increases in sediment delivery during loghaul, approximately 50% of sediment delivery sites BMP’s would be effective in
ensuring no additional sediment delivery during haul with likely beneficial effects
especially post haul, and at 30% of sites, best management practices would fully
compensate for haul- related sediment delivery with benefits during and following timber
hauling activities. Overall, the analysis indicated total sediment delivery would be fully
be accounted for with the implementation of BMP’s with some reduction possible. After
project implementation, BMP improvements would result in an estimated 40 percent
reduction in total sediment delivery from current conditions.

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Stream restoration using placement of large wood would occur in approximately 0.2
miles of stream adjacent to where temporary road reconstruction would occur. Wood used
for restoration would come from trees cut during road work. Placement of large wood
would be done in a manner that creates and improves pool habitat, promotes sediment
capture and retention, and/or improves stream width to depth ratios. Wood would be
placed at a frequency that ensures a minimum of 20 pieces per mile.
Minor amounts of sediment would be introduced from these restoration actions that
would be temporary and measurable a short distance (within a couple hundred feet)
downstream of each treatment. The benefits of sediment capture and retention should
fully compensate for the minor and temporary effects of sediment delivered from
temporary road reconstruction and provide additional long-term benefits related to stream
function well into the future.
Prescribed fire treatments could back into RCAs and burn within 100 feet of 10 different
streams and 7 stream systems (named stream plus its un-named tributaries. The highest
potential for measurable sedimentation would be on Blum Creek. There is some risk
exposed soils could result in sediment erosion, however, we expect delivery would either
not occur, or would only intermittently and not in substantive enough amounts to cause
measurable effects. To validate this, we will monitor Blum Creek (the stream with the
highest estimated length of RCA that would be burned within 100 feet of the stream; to
identify if treatments result in any new sediment delivery sites and/or the level of
sediment delivery that occurred.
•

Measure - Changes in Miles of motorized routes in RCAs: The primary difference
between alternative 3 and the proposed action, is no temporary road construction in
RCAs in alternative 3. Thus, temporary roads T2, T3 and T21 would not be built.
Reconstruction of temporary road T17 (currently a closed user route) in the RCA of
an unnamed tributary to Dunkleberg Creek would occur; as it would under alternative
2.

•

Measure - Length of LWD Placement: Alternative 3 would have no LWD
placement, since there is no defined stream channel in the unnamed tributary to
Dunkleberg Creek adjacent to where temporary road T17 would be reconstructed..

•

Measure - Changes in stream water temperatures: Riparian canopies that extend
at least 120 feet from a stream’s edge provide shade at a level comparable to unharvested conditions (Cristea and Janisch 2007). The Hydrology section of this
document provides a detailed analysis of vegetative canopy removal in RCAs, and
the estimated effects on stream temperatures within the analysis area.
Similar to alternative 2, there would be no forest canopy removal in RCAs from
timber harvest. There may be some mortality to individual trees from prescribed
burning. Effects would not result in a substantive enough change in riparian canopy
within 120 feet of streams to cause an increase in stream temperatures.
Under alternative 3, there would be no potential for water temperature changes
associated with construction of temporary roads. This differs from alternative 2,
where forest canopy removal in RCAs would occur during construction of road T21
along Gird Creek and roads T2 and T3 along an unnamed tributary to Flint Creek.

327

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Under alternative 2, the estimated effect on Gird Creek was an increase in maximum
stream temperatures of less than 0.5ᵒ F. These effects would not occur under
alternative 3 because road construction activities would not occur.
•

Measure - Changes in stream channel morphology: Forest canopy removal of 2025 percent of a watershed’s area is required to cause measurable change in peak
flows and/or water yield (Stednick 1996).
The Hydrology section of this document provides a detailed analysis of effective
forest canopy removal (ECR) from beetle mortality and proposed timber harvest
under alternative 3. It suggests a little likelihood this alternative would have any
effect on stream morphology.
As such, implementation of Alternative 3 should not influence water yield enough to
cause detrimental effects to stream conditions.

Indicator Summary: Implementation of BMPs on all haul routes within RCAs would result in a
substantial reduction in sedimentation across the analysis area during and after project activities.
There would be no sediment or temperature related effects to any stream from construction of new
temporary roads.
Based on our estimates, prescribed fire treatments have the potential to back into RCAs and burn within
100 feet of 10 different streams and 7 stream systems (named stream plus its un-named tributaries).
However, we expect delivery would occur only occasionally and not in substantive enough amounts to
create measurable effects (refer to Hydrology effects analysis in this document for a more detailed
assessment of effects).
There will be long-term restorative benefits related to prescribed fires in RCAs. They are associated with
soil and vegetative rejuvenation and displayed through increased growth and production of understory
vegetation from nutrient recycling. This will provide benefits in sediment filtering capabilities. There is
also the likelihood of a low percentage of mortality to over-story trees. Because of the limited scope and
mosaic pattern of fire in RCAs, it would promote a small level of large wood recruitment; that would
bridge longer periods of time where natural ecological events cause mortality at larger scales. The long
term benefits to the riparian area and stream channel will outweigh any short term impacts.
Forest canopy removals of 0-3 percent of watershed acres, would occur under alternative 3.
Implementation of Alternative 3 should not influence water yield enough to cause detrimental effects to
stream conditions.
Question 1 Summary: There would be a localized area where a measurable increase in sedimentation
would occur to the RCA of an un-named tributary to Dunkleberg Creek; from reconstruction on
temporary road T17. However, the effects would be minor and temporary; and would not be transmitted
to Dunkleberg Creek.
Approximately 50% of sediment delivery sites BMP’s would see no additional sediment delivery during
log haul with likely beneficial effects especially post haul, and at 30% of sites, best management practices
would fully compensate for haul- related sediment delivery with benefits during and following timber
hauling activities. Overall, the analysis indicated total sediment delivery would be fully be accounted for
with the implementation of BMP’s with some reduction possible. After project implementation, BMP
improvements would result in an estimated 40 percent reduction in total sediment delivery from current
conditions.

328

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Small levels of sedimentation could occur intermittently in streams after prescribed fire treatments, but
we doubt this will occur and it would not result in measurable effects.
The benefits of the rejuvenating effects of prescribed fire on the soil and vegetation in RCAs would
compensate for any possible effects of sedimentation and would provide added benefits into the future.
There would be no influence on habitat conditions from changes in water temperatures or from changes in
water yield or peak flows. In total, alternative 3 should result in notable long-term improvements in
stream habitat conditions for DD and other aquatic species in the analysis area due to the overall
reductions in road generated sediment. Increases in population densities of DD and other aquatic
populations would be expected as instream sediment levels decrease.
Question 2: How would pond and wetland habitat conditions change for amphibian species?
Indicator - Change in pond and wetland function
•

Measure: Change in miles of motorized routes in RCAs: In this alternative, because
no new roads are proposed, there would be no increases in the miles of motorized routes
in the RCAs.

•

Change in sediment delivery to ponds and wetlands: We assume there is a direct
correlation between sedimentation in streams and sedimentation in ponds and wetlands,
since most ponds and wetlands occur within stream corridors. Considering sediment
delivery occurs at points along roads and is not continuous, the occurrence of
sedimentation to ponds and wetlands is probably limited to fewer occurrences in the
project area.
About 0.2 miles of road would also be reconstructed in the RCA of an unnamed tributary
to Dunkleberg Creek. All newly constructed temporary roads would be decommissioned
following project activities. This could cause some sedimentation if ponds or wetlands
are present.
Prescribed fire treatments could back into RCAs and burn within 100 feet of 10 different
streams and 7 stream systems (named stream plus its un-named tributaries. The highest
potential for measurable sedimentation would be on Blum Creek. There is some risk
exposed soils could result in sediment erosion, however, we expect delivery would occur
only occasionally and not in substantive enough amounts to cause measurable effects.
Due to BMP application on all haul routes, overall sedimentation levels would be reduced
during project implementatation. Fifty percent of current sediment delivery sites along
log haul routes would see an immediate reduction in sedimentation that would persist
throughout and after project implementation. Twenty percent of delivery sites would see
a slight increase in sediment delivery during log hauling. Eighty percent of delivery sites
would see a post project reduction in sediment delivery.
Localized increases from log haul and should not be substantial enough to cause
sustained measurable changes in habitat conditions. Overall, there would be an estimated
40% reduction in sedimentation to streams across the project area post project
implementation. This estimate is probably also appropriate for ponds and wetlands.
Sedimentation from prescribed burns should not occur at levels that would be measurable
in ponds and wetlands.

329

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Indicator Summary: There is some risk of a localized, minor disturbance and sedimentation in the RCA
of an unnamed tributary to Dunkleberg Creek, from temporary road reconstruction. There could also be
minor amounts of added sedimentation from prescribed fire backing into RCAs. However, the sum of
effects from implementing alternative 3 should not cause a decline in function for any pond or wetland
across the analysis area. Beneficial effects could be realized in various places, from road BMP
applications reducing sedimentation, thereby, slowing the rate at which ponds and wetlands are becoming
shallower and smaller.
Question 2 Summary: Within the analysis area, there are no known ponds or wetlands that are at risk of
losing their suitability as amphibian habitat. Localized, minor impacts to ponds and wetlands could occur
in a few locations, but would not cause a loss of suitable amphibian habitat. On the other hand, benefits to
amphibian habitats would occur through measurable reductions in road related sedimentation across 45
percent of existing delivery sites.
Analysis Question 3: How would the persistence of sensitive westslope cutthroat trout (WCT)
populations be affected within the analysis area?
Westslope cutthroat trout occupied streams include:
o

Dunkleberg Creek

o

NF Gold Creek

o

Douglas Creek

o

SF Gold Creek

o

SF Douglas Creek

o

Blum Creek

o

MF Douglas Creek

o

Crevice Creek

o

NF Douglas Creek

o

Pikes Peak Creek

o

Gold Creek

o

Gird Creek

Indicator – Changes in Habitat Conditions in WCT occupied Streams:
•

Measure: Change in sediment delivery to WCT occupied streams from harvest
units, roads stream restoration and prescribed fire.
No sediment delivery to streams should occur from timber harvest units.
Due to BMP application on haul routes, sedimentation levels would be reduced during
project implementatation. Fifty percent of current sediment delivery sites along log haul
routes would see an immediate reduction in sedimentation that would persist throughout
and after project implementation. Twenty percent of delivery sites would see a slight
increase in sediment delivery during log hauling. Eighty percent of delivery sites would
see a post project reduction in sediment delivery.
Localized increases from log haul and should not be substantial enough to cause
sustained measurable changes in habitat conditions. Sedimentation from prescribed
burns should not occur at levels that would be measurable in streams. Overall, there
would be an estimated 40% reduction in sedimentation across the project area post
project implementation.
Reconstruction of temporary road T17 has the potential to deliver sediment to the RCA
of an unnamed tributary to Dunkleberg Creek. Effects would not be transmitted to
Dunkleberg Creek.

330

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Prescribed fire treatments may back into RCAs and burn within 100 feet of Douglas, NF
Douglas, MF Douglas, Blum (plus 3 unnamed tributaries) and Gird Creeks. There is
some risk exposed soils could result in erosion, however, we expect delivery would
occur only occasionally and not in substantive enough amounts to result in measurable
effects (see Hydrology effects analysis for alternative 3, for a more detailed
explanation).
To validate this, we will monitor Blum Creek (the stream with the highest estimated
length of RCA that would be burned within 100 feet of the stream; to identify if
treatments result in any new sediment delivery sites and if so, the level of sedimentation
that occurred.
•

Measure - Change in miles of motorized routes in WCT occupied RCAs: Since there
would be no new road construction in RCAs under alternative 3, the miles of motorized
routes along WCT occupied streams would remain the same.
The primary difference between alternative 3 and the proposed action is temporary road
T21 would not be constructed in the RCA of Gird Creek from road construction were
expected to be measurable, but relatively minor, limited in scope, and temporary. These
effects would not occur under alternative 3 because road construction activities would
not occur.

•

Measure - Changes in stream water temperatures: Similar to alternative 2, there
would be no forest canopy removal in RCAs from timber harvest. Through prescribed
burning there may be mortality to a few over-story trees and or shrubs in RCAs, but it
would not occur at a level that would result in water temperature changes. Thus, there
would be no loss of riparian canopy within 120 feet of streams related to these actions.
Under alternative 3, there would be no potential for water temperature changes
associated with construction of temporary roads. This differs from alternative 2, where
forest canopy removal would occur during construction of road T21 along Gird Creek.
Under alternative 2, the estimated effect on Gird Creek was an increase in maximum
stream temperatures of less than 0.5ᵒ F in the immediate vicinity of the vegetative
clearing needed for the road. These effects would not occur under alternative 3 because
road construction activities would not occur.

•

Measure - Changes in stream channel morphology: Forest canopy removals of 0-3
percent of total watershed acres, would occur under alternative 3. The Hydrology
section of this document indicates this harvest in conjunction with ECR from beetle
mortality should not cause substantive increases in water yield to promote channel
degradation in WCT occupied streams.

Indicator Summary: No sediment delivery to streams should occur from timber harvest units. For all
WCT streams across the analysis area where log haul routes occur within RCAs, our analysis indicates
sediment delivery during implementation would be reduced enough to prevent increases in
sedimentation at about 80% of current road sedimentation sites. . At approximately half of the sites,
sedimentation would persist below current levels during log haul and after project implementation. There
would be about a 40% percent reduction from current levels of sedimentation across the project area
following the project.

331

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Some sedimentation could occur to Douglas, NF Douglas, MF Douglas, Blum (plus 3 unnamed
tributaries) and Gird Creeks, from prescribed fire treatments, however we expect the amounts delivered
would not be substantive and would not result in measurable effects. Because there is some uncertainty
associated with our assessment of the prescribed fire effects, we will monitor whether and how much
sedimentation occurs in Blum Creek.
There would be no effects to stream temperatures from implementation of alternative 3 because there
would be no substantive reduction in forest canopy within RCAs.
Effective forest canopy removals of 0-3 percent of watershed acres, would occur under this alternative .
This would not result in a measurable change in water yield or peak flows in WCT occupied streams.
Question 3 Summary: An overall reduction in total sediment delivered to WCT occupied streams would
occur across the analysis area, during implementation of this alternative. After project completion,
improvements from BMP applications are expected to reduce sedimentation from existing delivery rates
by about 40 percent.
There would be no notable negative influence on habitat conditions from changes in water temperatures
or from changes in water yield or peak flows. In total, alternative 3 should result in notable long-term
improvements in stream habitat conditions for WCT in the analysis area due to the overall reductions in
road generated sediment. This should help promote long-term persistence of WCT populations within the
analysis area.
Analysis Question 4 – How would bull trout be affected?
Indicator – Change in bull trout Critical Habitat:
The most likely avenues for effects to bull trout Critical Habitat, from the activities proposed, are from
changes in sedimentation or water temperature. There are no bull trout within the project area, so there
is no immediate potential for effects. Bull trout occur downstream of the project area in Boulder Creek,
Flint Creek and the Clark Fork River; all of which are designated Critical Habitat. These waters are
connected to the project area via tributary streams.
•

Measure - Changes in sediment delivery to designated Critical Habitat streams
from harvest units, roads, stream restoration and prescribed fire units: As we
described for Alternative 2, There’s little potential for measurable effects, from
Alternative 3 to be transmitted from harvest units, roads, stream restoration, or
prescribed fire in the project area, to Critical Habitat. The distances are substantial
enough that any short term increases in sediment would settle out or be deposited on
flood plains before they reach Boulder Creek, Flint Creek or the Clark Fork River. The
scale of improvements/sediment reductions would not be substantial enough to
overcome the dilution of effects that would occur over those distances.
There is, no difference between Alternatives 2 and 3 regarding the potential for log
hauling below the project area to cause sedimentation to Critical Habitat. Therefore, as
described above for Alternative 2, no measurable change in habitat conditions would
occur in Boulder Creek, Flint Creek or the Clark Fork River, from log hauling on the
Douglas Creek road, the Gold Creek road and NFS roads 840 (Gird Creek), 1500
(Princeton Gulch) and 676 (Boulder Creek).

•

Measure - Changes in water temperatures in designated Critical Habitat streams:
Implementation of alternative 3 would not result in timber harvest or prescribed burning

332

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

in the Lower Boulder Creek watershed. As such, there would be vegetative canopy
removal within 120 feet of Boulder Creek or any of its tributaries.
Temporary roads T2 and T3 (proposed for alternative 2) would not be constructed, so
there would be no vegetative canopy removal within 120 feet of the unnamed tributary
of Flint Creek. A few individual trees are expected to be removed with the
reconstruction of existing road T17 in the RCA of an unnamed tributary to Dunkleberg
Creek. This would not be extensive enough to have any influence on stream
temperatures.
There is no potential for changes in water temperatures in designated Critical Habitat,
from implementation of Alternative 3.
•

Measure – Changes in stream channel morphology in designated Critical Habitat
streams: Similar to Alternative 2, Alternative 3 would result in canopy removals of 0-3
percent of total watershed acres. This would not cause substantive enough reductions to
result in measurable changes in water yield or peak flows in any watershed. From this,
we expect no negative effect on stream morphologies within the analysis area. Nor
would there be measurable negative effects extended to critical habitat in Boulder
Creek, Flint Creek or the Clark Fork River.

Indicator Summary – Changes in bull trout Critical Habiat: No measurable changes in habitat
conditions, related to sedimentation, would occur in bull trout Critical Habitat. This is true for short term
increases related to aspects of project implementation (like placement of large wood in streams), and
probably also true for longer term sediment reductions. The scale of change within the Project Area
would not be substantial enough to overcome the dilution of effects that would occur in the downstream
distances to Critical Habitat. In the instances where log hauling below the Project Area would occur in
more immediate proximity to Critical Habitat, the change in sedimentation is expected not to cause a
measurable changes in habitat conditions.
Similarly, there would be no measurable changes to water temperatures in Critical Habitat. The removal
of a few trees during reconstruction of existing temporary road T17 would not change the shading
characteristics of the RCA enough to cause a change in water temperatures in the unnamed tributary to
Dunkleberg Creek.
Question 4 Summary: Implementation of Alternative 3 would not result in any measurable effects to
bull trout or their Critical Habitat from changes in sedimentation, water temperatures, or stream channel
morphology. While there would be a reduction in sedimentation from roads within the Project area, the
changes would probably not be of sufficient magnitude to result in measurable effects in Boulder Creek,
Flint Creek or the Clark Fork River.
Analysis Question 5: How would the persistence of sensitive western toad populations be affected
within the analysis area?
Indicator – Changes in Western Toad habitats
•

Measure: Change in sediment delivery to streams, ponds and wetlands: We assume there
is a direct correlation between sedimentation in streams and sedimentation in ponds and
wetlands, since most ponds and wetlands occur within stream corridors. Considering
sediment delivery occurs at points along roads and is not continuous, the occurrence of
sedimentation to ponds and wetlands is probably limited to fewer occurrences in the project
area.

333

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

If wetlands are present in the RCAs where temporary roads would be constructed, there
would be localized, sediment delivery with minor effects.
About 0.17 miles of stream would also be reconstructed in the RCA of an unnamed tributary
to Dunkleberg Creek. All newly constructed temporary roads would be decommissioned
following project activities. This would create some physical wetland disturbance if ponds or
wetlands are present in this RCA.
Prescribed fire treatments could back into RCAs and burn within 100 feet of 10 different
streams and 7 stream systems (named stream plus its unnamed tributaries). There is some risk
exposed soils could result in sediment erosion, however, we expect delivery would occur only
occasionally and not in substantive enough amounts to cause measurable effects.
With BMP implementation on haul routes within RCAs, sediment delivery during log hauling
would be reduced enough to result in no measurable change from current delivery rates in 55
percent of sediment delivery sites across the analysis area; and approximately 45 percent of
the sites would see measurable improvements (reductions) from current levels of
sedimentation.
A reduction in total sediment delivered to surface waters is expected during project
implementation. After project implementation sediment delivery is expected to drop from
existing delivery by 40 percent.
Indicator Summary: There could be localized, minor and temporary disturbance to ponds and wetlands
along an unnamed tributary to Dunkleberg Creek from temporary road reconstruction. Prescribed fire
treatments could also cause some sediment delivery to ponds or wetlands in seven different stream
systems, but would not occur in substantive enough amounts to cause measurable effects. However, the
sum of effects from implementing alternative 3 should not cause a loss of function or a measurable
change in habitat suitability for toads in these or any other locations across the analysis area. Beneficial
effects could be realized in various places from road BMP applications reducing sedimentation; thereby,
slowing the rate at which ponds and wetlands are becoming shallower and smaller.
Indicator – Change in direct mortality to toads from motorized vehicles
Notable changes in direct mortality from motorized vehicles would be related to changes in the intensity
and speed of traffic near concentration areas.
•

Measusre - Change in miles of motorized routes in RCAs: No new temporary road
construction would take place under alternative 3, thus there would be no change in
miles of motorized routes in RCAs.

•

Measure - Miles of Haul routes in RCAs: Alternative 3 would utilize 9.6 miles of road
in RCAs for log hauling. This is about 1 mile less that would occur under alternative 2.
It is possible there could be increases in the speed of vehicles traveling these routes
within the analysis area, due to road improvements. However, it is unlikely the increases
would be more than a few miles-per-hour with the relatively low vehicle speeds
common to forest roads. Situations causing notable mortality are often associated with
pavement or vehicles traveling at much higher speeds than we would see as a result of
this project.
There would be increases in vehicle traffic with workers traveling to the project area and
with log hauling. The time of travel would be concentrated during daylight hours, a
period when vehicle mortalities to toads are much less common. Based on this, there is a
334

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

small increase in the possibility of mortalities due to higher traffic levels, but the change
in risk is small.
Documentation of locations and the number of individual toads killed on Forest roads
for more than 5 years have noted relatively few occurrences; none of which resulted in a
high number of, or even multiple mortalities. Also, we are not aware of any breeding
sites that are adjacent to roads; a situation where densities of toads would be
concentrated, increasing the risk of high mortalities when small toadlets are migrating
away from the area.
Aquatic standard5 in the Forest Plan (Forest Plan p. 18) requires that new management
activities within known sensitive amphibian breeding sites and natal areas during
breeding and juvenile rearing periods will not cause a threat to population viability or a
trend toward federal listing. This standard directs us to modify management actions
around a newly identified breeding and/or natal area if they are causing mortalities to, or
pose a threat to, high numbers of individuals. Given this direction, along with the fact
that there would be little to no change in risk, and we know of no areas where
mortalities are beyond incidental, we expect there would be no measurable change in the
incidence of vehicle related mortality to toads. Thus, for alternative 3, vehicle related
mortality to amphibians should remain at low levels and would not occur at levels that
should create negative trends in populations or place populations at risk.
Indicator Summary: There is no increase in motorized routes in RCAs over what currently exists.
There would be 9.6 miles of roads in RCAs used for log hauling. This is 1 mile less than would occur
under alternative 2. The increased vehicle use in RCAs may cause a small increase in the possibility of
toad mortality. However, because we know of no breeding sites adjacent to haul routes in the analysis
area, and because we have never documented a situation on the Forest where mortalities were beyond
incidental, we expect no notable change in direct mortality from implementing alternative 3.
Question 5 Summary: Measurable reductions in sediment delivery to streams would result in habitat
improvements in the streams within a couple of years after implementation of alternative 3. Reducing
sediment delivery would lead to improved substrate and habitat conditions, so western toad populations
should benefit from this.
We expect there should be little to no change in vehicle related mortalities to western toads from
implementing alternative 3. In addition, the Forest Plan directs us to modify management actions that
would cause a threat to population viability or a trend toward federal listing, Should an uncommon level
of mortality to toads be observed, we would modify the timing of log hauling to mitigate the impacts.
Thus, proposed actions in alternative 3 would not threaten the persistence of western toad within the
analysis area.
Analysis Question 6: Would there be a change in distribution of aquatic nuisance species (ANS)?
Indicator - Expected change in vectors of transport and introduction of ANS:
The risk of introducing ANS into the analysis area depends on changing the likelihood of transporting
them from infected waters into the analysis area. The nearest locations for 3 ANS of concern are Canyon
Ferry (western milfoil), the Beaverhead River (New Zealand mudsnail) and the Clark-Fork River
(whirling disease).
There is nothing proposed as part of implementing alternative 3 that would increase the risk of
transporting these species from their current locations to the project area. Further, project effects would
335

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

not cause subsequent changes in recreational uses in a way that increases the risk of introducing these
species into the project area.
Question 6 Summary: Because there are currently no known ANS near to or within the analysis area,
and this project is not expected to cause a change in vectors of transport, there should be no change in
the risk of introducing ANS into the analysis area by implementing alternative 3.

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Timber Harvest: There has been a substantial amount of timber harvest within the analysis area on
National Forest System lands over the last 50-60 years. There has also been a fair amount on lands of
other ownerships that are adjacent to our project area. We have not seen legacy sediment effects
specifically from timber harvest units on National Forest System lands; but we have not surveyed
lands of other ownerships to document whether this is also the case there. However, because there
would be no measurable negative effects related to sediment from the proposed alternatives in any
stream at the Forest Boundary, there would be no cumulative negative effects associated with past
timber harvest sedimentation.
There could be a beneficial effects in some streams because of a 40 percent reduction in total
sediment production across the project area after project implementation. There would be a decrease
in sedimentation at approximately 50% of the current road sediment delivery sites. .
There would be no expected change in stream morphology due to project implementation from
changes in water yield.
Livestock grazing: This affects DD and other aquatic populations because it alters stream
morphology and vegetative conditions in the uplands and riparian areas. This causes increases in
sedimentation and ultimately increased levels of fine sediment in the stream substrates where DD
lives. Livestock grazing effects within and downstream of the project area are not expected to change
substantially from current levels or shift substantially in distribution of use.
Mining: Historic mining has had minor to substantial effects on water quality and stream function in
some streams in the project area. Localized measurable sedimentation in Gird Creek, from road T21;
and unnamed tributaries to Flint Creek and Dunkleberg creek from roads T2, T3 under alternative 2;
and T17 under alternatives 2 and 3 would be minor and temporary in nature. Effects would not act
cumulatively with past mining effects in these locations to degrade habitat conditions for DD and
other aquatic species.
Because the proposed project would not measurably negatively affect channel morphology or
sedimentation in any stream at the Forest Boundary, there would be no cumulative negative effects
from this project relative to mining below the Forest Boundary.
Irrigation diversion: Irrigation diversion effects on DD and other aquatic populations occur through
the loss of instream flows and possibly temperature increases. The effects are low to moderate
because the most extensive and dramatic diversions occurs downstream of NFS lands. Irrigation
effects effects within and downstream of the project area are not expected to change substantially
from current levels or shift substantially in distribution of use.
Invasive plant species treatment: Slight beneficial effects could occur from reversing noxious weed
infestations, primarily through reducing soil erosion and the risk of sediment delivery to streams.
There are potential negative effects if herbicides contaminate surface waters. The risk is low for this;
the BDNF Noxious Weed EIS provides mitigations to reduce risks of introduction of herbicide into
streams and other water bodies. We expect the balance of effects related to this management to be
beneficial. There are no project-related effects that would act cumulatively with invasive plant
treatments, to degrade habitat conditions for DD and other aquatic species.
Prescribed Burning: There has been about 6,700 acres of prescribed burning within the analysis area
on National Forest System lands over the last 50-60 years. Twelve percent has been broadcast
burning, the rest has been burning of piles. As such, there has been little potential for substantial
sedimentation effects from past treatments; and we have not observed any lingering effects associated
with prescribed fire. Based on our analysis relative to sediment delivery to streams, the project would
not act cumulatively with prescribed fire effects to negatively impact habitats for DD and other
aquatic species.
337

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

There will be long-term restoration benefits related to prescribed fires in RCAs associated with soil
and vegetative rejuvenation and displayed through benefits in sediment filtering capabilities. It would
also promote a small level of large wood recruitment. The effects would be limited in scale and scope
and not measurable beyond the areas proximal to the treatments. Thus, there would be little
opportunity for cumulative effects to be measurable downstream.
Beetle Related Tree Mortality: The Hydrology section of this document provides a detailed
cumulative analysis of effective forest canopy removal (ECR) from beetle mortality and that for
proposed timber harvest under alternatives 2 and 3. It shows a low likelihood that project
implementation would work cumulatively with other factors to cause changes in channel morphology
from altered water yields., Thus, we believe there would be no cumulative negative effects on aquatic
habitats. As such, there would be no cumulative negative effect on habitats for DD and other aquatic
species.
Fish Passage Improvements: Fish passage has been restored at five locations on the NF, at Douglas
Creek and at one location on the Middle Fork of Douglas Creek. These all represent beneficial effects
to aquatic species. There are no project-related effects that would act cumulatively with regard to
providing fish passage beyond large wood placement and reductions of sedimentation, which would
improve habitat conditions as fish and possibly other aquatic species move to stream segments that
were previously less accessible.
Dispersed Recreation: Dispersed recreation is common across the analysis area and will continue—
and probably increase—in the future. Effects to DD and other aquatic populations are likely minor.
Even though most dispersed camping and other activities occur in close proximity to water, the length
of streams disturbed is relatively small. Sediment delivery from dispersed recreation does occur but it
is limited enough in most cases to keep it from being a notable concern relative to DD populations
and other aquatic species.
Localized measurable sedimentation in Gird Creek, from road T21; and unnamed tributaries to Flint
Creek and Dunkleberg creek from roads T2, T3 and T17 would be minor and temporary in nature.
Sedimentation would not occur at great enough levels to act cumulatively with dispersed camping to
cause a notable decline in habitat conditions DD and other aquatic species.
Because the proposed project would not measurably negatively affect channel morphology or
sedimentation in any stream at the Forest Boundary, there would be no cumulative negative effects
from this project relative to dispersed recreation below the Forest Boundary.
Roads and Trails: Localized measurable sedimentation created in Gird Creek, from road T21; and
RCAs to unnamed tributaries to Flint Creek and Dunkleberg creek from roads T2, T3 and T17 would
be minor and temporary in nature. Sedimentation would not occur at great enough levels to act
cumulatively and cause a notable decline in habitat conditions for DD and other aquatic species.
Existing roads and trails are having a substantial effect on DD and other aquatic species habitat, in
some streams, through sedimentation. Localized measurable sedimentation created in Gird Creek,
from road T21 (alternative 2); and in RCAs to unnamed tributaries to Flint Creek and Dunkleberg
creek from roads T2, T3 (alternative 2) and T17 (alternatives 2 and 3) would be minor and temporary
in nature. Sedimentation would not occur at great enough levels to act cumulatively and cause a
notable decline in habitat conditions for DD and other aquatic species.
Based of review of BMP’s effectiveness in the project area, we believe approximately 20% of the
delivery sites would have small increases in sediment delivery during log-haul, approximately 50%
of sediment delivery sites BMP’s would be effective in ensuring no additional sediment delivery
during haul with likely beneficial effects especially post haul, and at 30% of sites, best management
practices would fully compensate for haul- related sediment delivery with benefits during and
338

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

following timber hauling activities. Overall, the analysis indicated total sediment delivery would be
fully be accounted for with the implementation of BMP’s with some reduction possible. After project
implementation, BMP improvements would result in an estimated 40 percent reduction in total
sediment delivery from current conditions.
Road maintenance: While road maintenance can cause short-term, negative effects from
sedimentation, there tends to be longer-term beneficial effects. A primary component of effects related
to the proposed project is associated with applying BMPs in RCAs. These benefits will work in
concert with past maintenance actions to reduce sedimentation and improve habitat conditions for DD
and other aquatic species.
Fire Suppression: There is some likelihood of wild fire suppression occurring over the next 10 years.
The primary negative effect would be sedimentation to streams and stream dewatering during water
draws to douse fires. The sum of effects from the proposed project would be to mitigate and even
overcome sedimentation that could occur from fire suppression. There would be no project activities
that would act cumulatively with water withdrawal to negatively affect habitat conditions for DD or
other aquatic species.
Alternative 1 (no action) would not promote change in existing conditions within the analysis area.
Alternative 1, when considered with other current, past and reasonably foreseeable actions would result
in DD and other aquatic populations persisting at depressed levels, in some streams within the analysis
area.
Implementation of alternatives 2 and 3 would not cause measurable decreases in abundance or
distribution of DD or other aquatic populations in any stream within the analysis area. Rather, they
would promote reductions in road-derived sedimentation and therefore positive trends in habitat
conditions for DD and other aquatic populations across the analysis area; although not necessarily in
every stream.
Table 94 provides an overview of past, present and reasonably foreseeable actions that have the greatest
potential for measurable cumulative effects to WCT, within the analysis area. The effects of past actions
are reflected in the existing conditions described above.
Timber Harvest: There has been a substantial amount of timber harvest within the analysis area on
Forest lands over the last 50 - 60 years. There has also been a fair amount on non-Forest lands, adjacent
to our project area. We’ve not seen legacy sediment effects specifically from timber harvest units on
National Forest lands, but we have not surveyed non-forested lands to document whether this is also the
case there. However, because there would be no measurable negative effects related to sediment from the
proposed alternatives in any stream, there would be no cumulative negative effects associated with past
timber harvest sedimentation on WCT abundance, distribution and/or persistence.
On the other hand, there could be a beneficial effect in some WCT streams (because of a 45 percent
reduction in total sediment production at 45 percent of the existing sediment delivery sites).
Because cumulative effective canopy removals for all watersheds from this proposed project and past
timber harvest are substantially below the threshold (20 percent forest canopy removal) that would cause
measurable changes in water yield or peak flows, there would not be measurable cumulative effects
related to stream flows in any watershed in the analysis area.

Livestock grazing: Livestock grazing affects WCT habitat and populations because it alters stream
morphology and vegetative conditions in the uplands and riparian areas. This increases sedimentation
and ultimately increases levels of fine sediment in the stream substrates. Localized measurable
sedimentation in Gird Creek, from road T21 (alternative 2); and in the RCA of an unnamed tributary
to Dunkleberg creek from reconstruction of road T17 (alternatives 2 and 3) would be minor and
temporary in nature. There would not be substantive changes in habitat conditions for WCT in Gird
Creek, and the effects from road T17 would not be transmitted to Dunkleberg Creek. As such, the
effects from this project should not act cumulatively with effects from livestock grazing to negatively
affect WCT abundance, distribution and/or persistence.
Because the proposed project would not measurably negatively affect channel morphology or
sedimentation in any stream, there would be no cumulative negative effects from this project relative
to livestock grazing.

340

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Mining: Historic mining has had minor to substantial effects on water quality and stream function in
some streams in the project area. Localized measurable sedimentation in Gird Creek, from road
T21would not act cumulatively with past mining effects to degrade habitat conditions for WCT. As
such, there would be no cumulative negative effect on WCT abundance, distribution and/or
persistence.
Because the proposed project would not measurably negatively affect channel morphology or
sedimentation in any stream, there would be no cumulative negative effects from this project relative
to mining.
Irrigation diversion: Irrigation diversion effects on WCT occur through the loss of instream flows
and possibly temperature increases. There are no project related effects that would act cumulatively
with irrigation diversion to degrade habitat conditions for WCT.
Invasive plant species treatment: Slight beneficial effects could occur from reversing noxious weed
infestations, primarily through reducing soil erosion and the risk of sediment delivery to streams.
There are potential negative effects if herbicides contaminate surface waters. The risk is low for this;
the BDNF Noxious Weed EIS provides mitigations to reduce risks of introduction of herbicide into
streams and other water bodies. We expect the balance of effects related to this management to be
beneficial. There are no project-related effects that would act cumulatively with invasive plant
treatments, to degrade habitat conditions for WCT. As such, there would be no cumulative negative
effect on WCT abundance, distribution and/or persistence.
Prescribed Burning: There has been about 6,643 acres of prescribed burning within the analysis area
on Forest lands over the last 50-60 years. Only 12 percent has been broadcast burning, the rest has
been burning of piles. As such, there has been little potential for substantial sedimentation effects
from past treatments; and we have not observed any lingering effects associated with prescribed fire.
Based on our analysis relative to sediment delivery to streams, the project would not act cumulatively
with prescribed fire effects to negatively impact WCT habitats. As such, there would be no
cumulative negative effect on WCT abundance, distribution and/or persistence.
There will be long-term restoration benefits related to prescribed fires in RCAs associated with soil
and vegetative rejuvenation and displayed through benefits in sediment filtering capabilities. It would
also promote a small level of large wood recruitment. The effects would be limited in scale and scope
and not measurable beyond the areas proximal to the treatments. Thus, there would be little
opportunity for effects to be extended– and be cumulatively measurable beyond the immediate
vacinities of the prescribed burn units.
Beetle Related Tree Mortality: Recent beetle infestations have resulted in widespread mortality to
trees that are greater than 5 inches dbh. This does not translate into complete canopy loss in affected
stands, because smaller trees still occupy sites. These smaller trees will function to maintain
evapotranspiration and moderate increases in water yield. Further, the distribution of dead and dying
trees resulting from insect mortality is often not continuous and varies with difference in soil moisture
and other factors.
Considering effects of vegetative treatments cumulatively with the effects of beetle related mortality
is difficult to estimate. While the literature indicates large scale mortality related to pine beetle
epidemics can result in altered stream flows, we have not observed any indications of increased peak
flow influences on stream channels within the project area. Because effective canopy removals
proposed for this project (0 – 4.0 percent across all watersheds in the analysis area) are substantially
below any threshold (greater than 20 percent that would cause measurable changes in water yield and
peak flows (see hydrology environmental consequences section for more information) we believe
there is adequate room to compensate for potential changes in associated with beetle related mortality,

341

without having cumulative negative effects on WCT habitats. As such, there would be no cumulative
negative effect on WCT abundance, distribution and/or persistence.
Fish Passage Improvements: Fish passage has been restored at five locations on the NF at Douglas
Creek and at one location on the Middle Fork of Douglas Creek. These all represent beneficial effects
to WCT. There are no project-related effects that would act cumulatively with regard to providing fish
passage, beyond large wood placement and reductions of sedimentation, which would improve
habitat conditions as WCT move to stream segments that were previously inaccessible.
Dispersed recreation: This is common across the analysis area and will continue – and probably
increase – in the future. Effects on WCT are likely minor. Even though most dispersed camping and
other activities occur in close proximity to water, the length of streams disturbed is relatively small.
Sediment delivery from dispersed recreation does occur but it is limited enough in scope to prevent it
from being a notable concern relative to WCT populations.
Localized measurable sedimentation in Gird Creek, from road T21, but would be minor and
temporary in nature. Sedimentation would not occur at great enough levels to act cumulatively with
dispersed camping and cause a notable decline in WCT habitat conditions. As such, there would be no
cumulative negative effect on WCT abundance, distribution and/or persistence.
Because the proposed project would not measurably negatively affect channel morphology or
sedimentation in any stream within the project area, there would be no cumulative negative effects
from this project relative to dispersed recreation.
Roads and Trails: Existing roads and trails across the analysis area are having a substantial effect on
WCT habitats through sedimentation. Localized measurable sedimentation created in Gird Creek,
from road T21; and an unnamed tributary to Dunkleberg Creek from reconstruction of road T17
would be minor and temporary in nature. Sedimentation would not occur at great enough levels to act
cumulatively and cause a notable decline in habitat conditions for WCT.
With BMP implementation on haul routes within RCAs, sediment delivery during log hauling would
be reduced enough to result in no measurable change from current delivery rates in 55 percent of
sediment delivery sites across the analysis area; and approximately 45 percent of the sites would see
measurable improvements (reductions) from current levels of sedimentation (refer to the
environmental consequences section of this document for a more detailed description of these
effects).
A twenty-two percent reduction in total sediment delivered to surface waters is expected during
project implementation. After project implementation, sediment delivery is expected to drop from
existing delivery by 45 percent. As such, the sum of effects from the proposed project would be to
mitigate and even overcome some of the current effects of sedimentation in WCT streams from
existing roads and trails.
Road maintenance: While road maintenance can cause short-term negative effects from
sedimentation, there tends to be longer-term beneficial effects because a primary component of
effects related to the proposed project is associated with applying BMPs in RCAs. The benefits will
work in concert with past maintenance actions to reduce sedimentation and improve habitat
conditions for WCT.
Fire Suppression: There is some likelihood of wild fire suppression occurring over the next 10 years.
The primary negative effect would be sedimentation to streams and stream dewatering during water
draws to douse fires. The sum of effects from the proposed project would be to mitigate and even
overcome sedimentation that could occur from fire suppression. There would be no project activities
that would act cumulatively with water withdrawal to negatively affect habitat conditions for WCT.

Alternative 1 (no action) would not promote change in existing conditions within the analysis area.
While this alternative meets the Forest Plan direction of “no measurable effect”, it does nothing to help
ensure movement toward desired conditions. Because many streams are currently nonfunctioning or
functioning at risk, alternative 1, when considered with other current, past and reasonably foreseeable
actions could work cumulatively with the management activities/natural events discussed above to limit
the potential to achieve healthy population densities in certain populations.
Alternatives 2 and 3 would promote improvement in stream conditions through long-term reductions in
sediment delivery and physical impacts to stream channels. They would promote positive shifts in stream
function across the analysis area and promote increases in distribution of WCT. In this light, the effects
of the Flint Foothills proposed actions when considered cumulatively with other past, present and
reasonably foreseeable actions should promote the attainment better habitat conditions, and more
abundant and resilient WCT populations.
Table 95 summarizes those actions with the greatest potential for measurable effects on western toads
and other amphibians. The effects of past actions are reflected in the existing conditions described above.

Timber Harvest: There has been a substantial amount of timber harvest within the analysis area on
Forest lands over the last 50-60 years. There has also been a fair amount on non-Forest lands,
adjacent to our project area. We have not seen legacy sediment effects specifically from timber
harvest units on National Forest System lands, but we have not surveyed on non-forested lands to
document whether this is also the case there. However, because there would be no measurable
negative effects related to sediment from the proposed alternatives in any stream at the Forest
Boundary, there would be no cumulative negative effects associated with past timber harvest
sedimentation on western toads or other amphibians.
On the other hand, there could be a beneficial effect in some ponds and wetlands (because of a 45
percent reduction in total sediment production at 45 percent of the existing sediment delivery sites).
Because cumulative effective canopy removals for all watersheds from this proposed project and past
timber harvest are substantially below the threshold (20 percent forest canopy removal) that would
cause measurable changes in water yield, there would not be measurable cumulative effects related to
stream flows in any watershed in the analysis area.
Livestock grazing: Grazing affects toads and other amphibians, because it alters stream, pond and
wetland morphology and vegetative conditions in the uplands and riparian areas. Changes related to
grazing tend to be inherently negative. Maxell (2000), however, indicated that toads tend to prefer
areas with some level of disturbance; and livestock alteration, if not excessive, may function as a
benefit for this species.
Localized measurable sedimentation in the RCAs of Gird Creek, from road T21; and unnamed
tributaries to Flint Creek and Dunkleberg creek from roads T2, T3 and T17 would be minor in nature.
They would not create substantive changes in habitat conditions for toads or other amphibians in or
adjacent to Gird Creek, and the effects from reconstruction of road T17 are not expected to be
measurable in the RCA of Dunkleberg Creek. As such, the effects from this project should not act
cumulatively with effects from livestock grazing to negatively affect toads or other amphibians.
The proposed project could affect pond or wetland morphology where these temporary roads are
constructed and or reconstructed. It is not expected they would affect conditions to the extent they are
no longer suitable.
There would be no cumulative negative effects from this project relative to livestock grazing.
Mining: Historic mining has had minor to substantial effects on water quality in some areas and has
physically influenced some wetlands. Localized measurable sedimentation in the RCA of Gird Creek
or unnamed tributaries to Flint and Dunkleberg Creeks from roads T2, T3, T17 and T21would not act
cumulatively with past mining effects to degrade habitat conditions for western toads or other
amphibians. As such, there would be no cumulative negative effects.
There would be no cumulative negative effects from this project relative to mining.
Irrigation diversion: Irrigation diversion effects on wetlands would occur primarily through
dewatering. There are no project related effects that would act cumulatively with irrigation diversion
to degrade habitat conditions for toads or other amphibians.
Invasive plant species treatment: Slight beneficial effects could occur from reversing noxious weed
infestations, primarily through reducing surface erosion and the risk of sediment delivery to ponds
and wetlands. There are potential negative effects if herbicides contact individuals directly. The risk is
low for this; the BDNF Noxious Weed EIS provides mitigations to reduce risks of introduction of
herbicide into streams and other water bodies. We expect the balance of effects related to this
management to be beneficial. There are no project-related effects that would act cumulatively with
invasive plant treatments, to degrade habitat conditions for western toads and other amphibians.

Prescribed Burning: There has been about 6,643 acres of prescribed burning within the analysis area
on Forest lands over the last 50-60 years. Only 12 percent has been broadcast burning, the rest has
been burning of piles. As such, there has been little potential for substantial sedimentation effects
from past treatments; and we have not observed any lingering effects associated with prescribed fire.
Based on our analysis relative to sediment delivery to streams, the project would not act cumulatively
with prescribed fire effects to negatively impact western toad or amphibian habitats.
There will be long-term restoration benefits related to prescribed fires in RCAs associated with soil
and vegetative rejuvenation and displayed through benefits in sediment filtering capabilities. It would
also promote a small level of large wood recruitment. Once trees fall, there may be limited benefits in
microhabitats for toads and other amphibians. The effects would be limited in scale and scope and
not measurable beyond the areas proximal to the treatments. Thus, there would be little opportunity
for cumulative effects to be measurable downstream. There is little opportunity for effects to be
extended– and be cumulatively measurable beyond the immediate vacinities of the prescribed burn
units.
Beetle Related Tree Mortality: Recent beetle infestations have resulted in widespread mortality to
trees that are greater than 5 inches dbh. This does not translate into complete canopy loss in affected
stands, because smaller trees still occupy sites. These smaller trees will function to maintain
evapotranspiration and moderate increases in water yield. Further, the distribution of dead and dying
trees resulting from insect mortality is often not continuous and varies with difference in soil moisture
and other factors.
Considering effects of vegetative treatments cumulatively with the effects of beetle related mortality
is difficult to estimate. While the literature indicates large scale mortality related to pine beetle
epidemics can result in altered stream flows, we have not observed any indications of increased peak
flow influences on stream channels within the project area. Because effective canopy removals
proposed for this project (0 – 4.0 percent across all watersheds in the analysis area) are substantially
below any threshold (greater than 20 percent) that would cause measurable changes in water yield
(see hydrology environmental consequences section for more information) we believe there is little
potential for cumulative effects on western toad or other amphibian habitats to occur.
Dispersed recreation: This is common across the analysis area and will continue – and probably
increase – in the future. Effects on western toad and other amphibian habitats are likely minor. Even
though most dispersed camping and other activities often occur in RCAs, wet areas are typically
avoided. Sediment delivery from dispersed recreation does occur but it is limited enough in scope in
most cases to keep it from being a notable concern relative to toad and other amphibian habitats. As
such, there should be no notable cumulative effects on western toad and other amphibian habitats.
Roads and Trails: Existing roads and trails across the analysis area are currently depositing
substantial amounts of sediment into the RCAs of a number of streams. Localized measurable
sedimentation would occur in the RCAs of Gird Creek, from road T21; and unnamed tributaries to
Flint Creek and Dunkleberg creek from roads T2, T3 and T17. The amounts would be minor and
effects would be temporary in nature. Sedimentation would not occur at great enough levels to act
cumulatively and cause a notable decline in habitat conditions for western toads and other
amphibians.
With BMP implementation on haul routes within RCAs, sediment delivery during log hauling would
be reduced enough to result in no measurable change from current delivery rates in 55 percent of
sediment delivery sites across the analysis area; and approximately 45 percent of the sites would see
measurable improvements (reductions) from current levels of sedimentation (refer to the
environmental consequences section of this document for a more detailed description of these
effects).
345

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

A twenty-two percent reduction in total sediment delivered to surface waters is expected during
project implementation. After project implementation sediment delivery is expected to drop from
existing delivery by 45 percent. As such, the sum of effects from the proposed project would be to
mitigate and even overcome some of the current effects of sedimentation in some ponds and wetlands
from existing roads and trails.
Road maintenance: While there can be short-term negative effects from road maintenance from
reductions in sedimentation, there tends to be longer-term beneficial effects because a primary
component of effects related to the proposed project is associated with applying BMPs in RCAs. The
benefits will work in concert with past maintenance actions to slightly improve habitat conditions for
western toads and other amphibians.
Fire Suppression: There is some likelihood of wild fire suppression occurring over the next 10 years.
The primary negative effect would be physical disturbance of wetlands during fire line construction
and some sedimentation. The sum of effects from the proposed project would be to mitigate and even
overcome sedimentation that could occur from fire suppression. There would be no project activities
that should act cumulatively with water withdrawal to substantially affect habitat conditions for
western toads and other amphibians.
Our data indicate that western toads are limited in their distribution within the analysis area. Their
occurrence is not substantially different than other places on the Forest and the belief is that disease, not
habitat, is limiting them. Constraints unrelated to habitat quality and availability and their spotty
occurrence helps limit their exposure to the management actions proposed. On the other hand, sediment
reductions through the application of BMPs on roads in RCAs should promote slight improvements in
some pond and wetland areas.
Bull Trout
There are no bull trout within the project area. Bull trout occur downstream of the project area in
Boulder Creek, Flint Creek and the Clark Fork River; all of which are designated Critical Habitat. These
waters are connected to the project area via tributary streams.
There’s little potential for measurable effects to be transmitted from harvest units, roads, stream
restoration, or prescribed fire in the project area, to Critical Habitat. The distances are substantial enough
that any short term increases in sediment would settle out or be deposited on flood plains before they
reach Boulder Creek, Flint Creek or the Clark Fork River. This would also be the case for longer term
reductions in sedimentation from application of BMPs or large wood placement within the project area.
The scale of improvements/sediment reductions would not be substantial enough to overcome the
dilution of effects that would occur over those distances.
No measurable change in habitat conditions would occur in Boulder Creek, Flint Creek or the Clark Fork
River, from log hauling on the Douglas Creek road, the Gold Creek road and NFS roads 840 (Gird
Creek), 1500 (Princeton Gulch) and 676 (Boulder Creek).
As such, there would no potential for cumulative effects to bull trout or their Critical Habitat from
changes in sedimentation, water temperatures or stream channel morphology.

Cumulative Effects on Aquatic Nuisance Species
There would be no change in the distribution or abundance of ANS within the analysis area, so there
would be no cumulative effects associated with alternatives 2 or 3.

Compliance with Forest Plan and Other Relevant Laws, Regulations, Policies and
Plans
Alternatives 2 and 3 meet the aquatic requirements of the Forest Plan and promote attainment of desired
aquatic conditions the Plan encourages. The aquatics report in the project file describes how the action
alternatives meet the relevant aquatic standards. These alternatives are consistent with viability
requirements in the 1982 Forest Planning regulations, and with other relevant laws, regulations, policies
and plans.
Memorandum of Understanding and Conservation Agreement for Westslope Cutthroat Trout
and Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout
In 2007, the Memorandum of Understanding and Conservation Agreement for Westslope Cutthroat Trout
and Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout was co-signed by numerous partners, including the Regional Forester
(MCTSC 2007). The agreement includes the following goals.
•

Ensure the long-term, self-sustaining persistence of each subspecies distributed across their
historical ranges as identified in recent status reviews;

•

Maintain the genetic integrity and diversity of non-introgressed populations, as well as the
diversity of life histories, represented by remaining cutthroat trout populations; and

•

Protect the ecological, recreational, and economic values associated with each subspecies.

A primary objective of the Montana cutthroat trout conservation agreement is to maintain, secure, and/or
enhance all cutthroat trout populations designated as conservation populations, especially the genetically
pure core conservation populations. The proposed project alternatives 2 and 3 would not alter any
instream channel or population connectivity therefore it is in compliance with the MOU.

Livestock Grazing
This section analyzes the impact of implementing the project on livestock grazing resources within the
project area. The analysis will focus on National Forest System (NFS) lands within the boundaries of the
project area. A specific emphasis will be placed on activity areas where vegetation treatment and road
construction are being proposed.

Overview of Issues Addressed
Treatment activities can damage range allotment infrastructure, such as stock water systems and allotment
boundary or pasture fences. Treatment activities may also remove natural barriers between allotments or
pastures, allowing unrestricted livestock movement.

348

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Measurement Indicators
The measurement indicators used to evaluate impacts of alternatives:
•

Proposed treatment units that could potentially damage existing infrastructure.

•

Proposed treatment units with the potential to remove natural barriers.

Affected Environment
Existing Condition
The history of grazing use throughout the project area is typical of most grazing areas in southwest
Montana. Livestock grazing began in the mid-1800s, prior to the creation of the National Forest Reserves.
Present allotments in the analysis area include Boulder Creek, Gird Creek, Hall, Blum Gold, and Willow
Creek. These five allotments are managed by the Pintler Ranger District. Each allotment contains range
improvements such as fences and water developments (figure 34). A brief description of each allotment
within the project area follows.
Boulder Creek Allotment
The Boulder Creek Allotment consists of approximately 14,166 acres, and 129 cow/calf pairs are
currently permitted on this allotment from June 21 through September 30. An allotment management plan
(AMP) was prepared and approved for this allotment in January 2000. The AMP contains riparian
mitigation measures as well as riparian and upland use parameters (e.g., stubble height, bank disturbance,
browse utilization, grass/forb utilization). A modified four-pasture (Princeton, Cow Camp, Maywood, and
Pickett Gulch) rest-rotation grazing system is used to guide livestock management (described in the
annual operating plan).
Gird Creek Allotment
The Gird Creek Allotment consists of approximately 3,438 acres, and 27 cow/calf pairs are currently
permitted on this allotment from June 21 through September 30. An allotment management plan (AMP)
was prepared and approved for this allotment in October 1999. The AMP contains riparian mitigation
measures as well as riparian and upland use parameters (e.g., stubble height, bank disturbance, browse
utilization, grass/forb utilization). A two-pasture (Morrison’s and Boomer’s) deferred-rotation grazing
system is used to guide livestock management (described in the annual operating plan). However, pasture
containment is sometimes difficult due to the lack of fencing within the allotment. Therefore, riding and
salting is used to improve livestock management.

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Hall Allotment
The Hall Allotment consists of approximately 10,858 acres and 172 cow/calf pairs are currently permitted
on this allotment from June 23 through October 7. An analysis was completed for this allotment in 1996.
The AMP contains riparian mitigation measures as well as riparian and upland use parameters (e.g.,
stubble height, bank disturbance, browse utilization, grass/forb utilization). A three-pasture (Douglas
Mountain, Dunkleberg, and South Fork) deferred-rotation grazing system is used to guide livestock
management (described in the annual operating plan).
Blum Gold Allotment
The Blum Gold Allotment consists of approximately 7,379 acres and 124 cow/calf pairs are currently
permitted on this allotment from July 1 through September 30. An analysis for this allotment was
completed in November 2001. The AMP contains riparian mitigation measures as well as riparian and
upland use parameters (e.g., stubble height, bank disturbance, browse utilization, grass/forb utilization). A
four-pasture (Crevice Creek, North Blum, South Blum, and North Gold) rest-rotation grazing system is
used to guide livestock management and described in the annual operating plan.
Willow Creek Allotment
The Willow Creek Allotment consists of approximately 8,491 acres and 260 cow/calf pairs are currently
permitted on this allotment from June 16 through September 30; however, full nonuse was authorized for
the 2011 grazing season. An analysis for this allotment was completed in November 2001. The AMP
contains riparian mitigation measures as well as riparian and upland use parameters (e.g., stubble height,
bank disturbance, browse utilization, grass/forb utilization). A three-pasture (Doney Lake, Ballard Hill,
and North Willow) deferred-rotation grazing system is used to guide livestock management (described in
the annual operating plan). A mix of sagebrush/grasslands, grasslands, mountain meadows, riparian areas,
and forested rangelands provide the grazing capacity at all elevation zones within these allotments. All of
these allotments are currently active and are grazed annually in accordance with direction found in the
current Allotment Management Plan (AMP) for each allotment.

Desired Condition
According to the 2009 Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan
(LRMP) or Forest Plan, the following applicable Forestwide goals have been identified for livestock
grazing:
•

Sustainable grazing opportunities are provided for domestic livestock from lands suitable for
forage production (Forest Plan, p. 25); and

•

Use of forage by domestic livestock will maintain or enhance the desired structure and
diversity of plant communities on grasslands, shrub lands, and forests. Use will be managed to
maintain or restore riparian function as defined in the allotment management plan (Forest Plan,
p. 25).

The Forest Service provides standards and guidelines for rangeland use by livestock grazing operations in
the Forest Plan (USDA Forest Service 2009). These stipulations apply unless or until specific long-term
objectives, prescriptions, or allowable use levels have been designed through individual resource
management plans or site-specific NEPA decisions (e.g., revised AMPs). All of the allotments associated
with the project area have current management plans.

351

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Environmental Consequences
Methodology
Grazing allotment boundaries and improvements within the analysis area have been mapped and potential
effects within the allotments are based on their association and proximity to treatment units. Effects to
grazing are primarily the potential of proposed activities to damage existing infrastructure within the
allotments. Infrastructure includes existing interior and exterior pasture and allotment boundary fences,
existing stocktanks, and the potential to remove natural barriers to livestock movement. Allotment maps
displaying existing range improvements, such as fences and water developments, were compared to maps
displaying the proposed treatment units. Potential effects to the existing allotment infrastructure were
based on the proximity of the existing improvements to the proposed treatment units. Since several of the
allotments utilize short drift fences and natural barriers to control livestock movement, potential areas
where natural barriers may be removed were also identified.
Spatial and Temporal Context for Effects Analysis
This analysis will discuss both short-term (1 year or less), and long-term (greater than 1 year) project
effects to livestock grazing activities, within the project area.
Present and Reasonably Foreseeable Actions Relevant to Cumulative Effects Analysis
Invasive plant control is an ongoing action in the project area that can affect livestock grazing. Spraying
to control invasive plant species is expected to continue, and additional biological agents will be
introduced.
See Appendix D for a full list of present and reasonably foreseeable actions for the project area.

Alternative 1 – No Action
Direct, Indirect Effects and Cumulative Effects
For alternative 1, there would be no direct, indirect or cumulative effects to existing grazing activities or
allotment infrastructure for the Flint Foothills Project because no project activities are proposed.
The continued treatment of noxious weeds would improve range conditions throughout the allotments
within the project area through continued reduction in infested acres (see the Invasive Plant Species
section).

Alternative 2 – Proposed Action
Direct and Indirect Effects
There would be no increase in livestock numbers or increase in season of use resulting from
implementation of alternative 2. The effects of proposed vegetation management activities on livestock
grazing activities within the analysis area would be mostly beneficial. Specifically, the salvage logging
and thinning operations would indirectly increase short-term forage production through removal of
conifers, and “daylighting” of forested stands so that sunlight is able to reach the forest floor to stimulate
herbaceous plant growth. This short-term flush of herbaceous growth would diminish as conifers
recolonize the harvest units.

352

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

This alternative has the potential to directly affect existing allotment infrastructure. Infrastructure includes
existing interior and exterior pasture and allotment boundary fences, existing stocktanks, and the potential
to remove natural barriers to livestock movement. Damage to existing fences, water developments, or
breaching natural barriers, could affect livestock distribution and movement. This could disrupt scheduled
grazing rotations within allotments, and allow cattle in unauthorized areas.
In regards to grazing management, all range allotments within the analysis area are being managed under
rest-rotation or deferred-grazing systems, and these systems are flexible enough that they can be adjusted
to accommodate proposed vegetation management activities.
Removing timber during harvest activities along existing natural barriers, which are often used as pasture
barriers or barriers between allotments, would open the area for livestock to freely breach the barrier,
resulting in unauthorized drift into adjacent pastures or allotments. Timber Unit Standard 4 within the
Forest Plan (USDA Forest Service 2009) requires “replacement of natural barriers to livestock movement
removed by harvest activities with some other barrier.” Existing fences and water developments would be
protected during project implementation.
Cumulative Effects
The cumulative effects of improved range conditions through short-term forage production and continued
treatment of invasive plant species would be beneficial to forage species.
Summary of Effects
Implementation of the proposed alternative would have short-term benefits to livestock grazing assuming
all allotment infrastructures are protected and any natural barriers removed are replaced with new barriers
in a timely manner. Forage production should increase through the removal of conifers, which would
stimulate herbaceous plant growth. This short-term flush of herbaceous growth would diminish as
conifers recolonize the harvest units. There should be no disruption to cattle grazing from the Flint
Foothills Project. All allotment infrastructures would be protected, and barriers removed would be
replaced in a timely manner.

Alternative 3
Direct, Indirect Effects and Cumulative Effects
The direct, indirect effects are the same for alternative 3 as described in the alternative 2 discussion.

Compliance with Forest Plan and Other Relevant Laws, Regulations, Policies and Plans
Beaverhead-Deerlodge Land and Resource Management Plan (LRMP)
For all alternatives, livestock grazing activities would continue to be managed in compliance with grazing
direction identified in the Forest Plan as well as the allotment management plans.

Recreation
This section analyzes the effects the proposed activities would have on the recreation resources within the
project area.

Overview of Issues Addressed
No issues were identified that relate to recreation. One outfitter guide provided a scoping comment that
stated the proposal may impact some of their hunting in the Gird Creek drainage, but noted that
adjustments could be made due to the large size of the area.

Measurement Indicators
The measurement indicators used to evaluate impacts of alternatives:
•

Effects to developed and dispersed recreation activities, sites, and facilities

•

Analyzes how the proposed actions affect the use, availability, and quality of the recreation
experience within the project area.

•

Consistency with Recreation Opportunity Spectrum - Analyzes the consistency of the
proposed action with established recreation opportunity spectrum (ROS) objectives for the
project area (Forest Plan allocations: summer road-based, and winter motorized, pp. 54-55;
and 112).

Affected Environment
The Flint Foothills MA portion of the project area (85 percent) provides a roaded setting for dispersed
recreation. The Flint Uplands MA (15 percent) provides a mix of semi-primitive motorized and
nonmotorized recreation settings (table 98). There are no specially designated areas within the project
area boundary (i.e., wilderness, wilderness study, or recommended wilderness areas). A small portion of
the Dolus Lake Inventoried Roadless Area (I-439) is within the project area’s south boundary, while a
larger portion is adjacent to the project area, and can be viewed from within the project area (figure 35).

Existing Condition
The Flint Foothills form a scenic backdrop for Interstate 90 between Drummond and Butte. A portion of
Montana Highway 1, outside of the project area, is designated the “Pintler Scenic Loop” (Helena 2011).
Evidence of timber harvest and vegetation management activities are common sights within the Flint
Foothills MA portion of the project area. The history of use and management is reflected in the developed
road systems, mining sites, and scenery (FP p.113). Evidence of beetle-killed trees is a typical sight
(USDA Forest Service 2009).
The area within the Flint Uplands MA in the higher elevations provides a mix of semi-primitive
motorized and nonmotorized recreation opportunities. The setting appears as a mix of managed and
naturally appearing landscape. High mountain scenic vistas and backcountry opportunities are key
attractions to the forest visitor traveling through this area. Roads within the management area are
primarily historic roads built for harvesting and vegetation management, mining, and dam maintenance
(FP p.113).

354

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Figure 35 A and B depicts two popular attractions in the project area—the Douglas Cabin and the Dolus
Lakes Inventoried Roadless Area (IRA). A small portion of the IRA is within project area; the majority is
adjacent to the project area and part of the scenic vista.

Inventoried Roadless Areas (I-439) adjacent to the project area and part of the scenic vista

Recreation Activities
Recreation activities are mostly dispersed and commonly occur on or along roads. Gathering firewood,
weekend camping, fishing and hunting are popular pursuits for local and regional visitors (USDA Forest
Service 2009). Visitors can expect to encounter other users with motor vehicles, those travelling by foot,
stock, and mountain bikes in the summer, or skis and snowmobiles during winter months.
Two outfitter and guide special use permit holders who operate within the project area:

355

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Royal Outfitters – Their area of operation extends into the southwest end of the project area with
Gold Creek Lake and NFS Road1550 as the general limit of extent. Area of operation occurs in both
Flint Foothills and Flint Uplands management areas. This outfitter and guide’s focus is summer use
and fall big game hunting.
Bartlett Creek Outfitter – Their area of operation extends approximately one mile into the
southeastern corner of the project area. Area of operation occurs in both Flint Foothills and Flint
Uplands management areas. This outfitter and guide’s focus is fall big game hunting.
Recreation Sites
The Douglas Cabin is the only developed recreation site in the project area. It is a recreation rental facility
and a favorite of hunters during rifle and bow seasons and is popular among snowmobilers during winter
months. The Recreation Opportunity Spectrum (ROS) map (figure 36) in the Desired Condition section
that follows displays the location of the cabin.
Recreation Roads and Trails
There are approximately 204 miles of roads and 7.5 miles of trails available for public access and use
within the project area boundary. Approximately 30 miles of these roads are considered unauthorized. The
access from the road system for recreational purposes is currently affected by storm repair damage, which
is resulting in road closures and detours. These roads include sections of National Forest System (NFS)
roads 707, and 8402 (see the Transportation section).
Trails are in the southern portion of the project area and include National Forest System trails 8054 (3.9
miles, motorized), 8049 (1.37 miles, nonmotorized) and 8052 (3.39 miles, nonmotorized). The trails are
displayed on the alternative maps, Figure 5 and figure 7, in chapter 2. Motorized users of NFS Trail 8054
currently experience periods of limited availability. National Forest System Road 1550, which accesses
the north end of trail 8054, is closed to motorized use from October 15 – December 1. National Forest
System Road 1500, which accesses the south end of trail 8054, is closed to motorized use from September
1 – June 15.
Recreation Streams and Lakes
Streams and lakes are features that people use for various forms of recreation including fishing and
boating. There are approximately 55 miles of streams within the project area, but none are rated as class
one (i.e., considered larger or major rivers). There are four lakes (used for recreation activities) within the
project area: Goldberg Reservoir, Big Gold Creek Lake, Little Gold Creek Lake, and Rainbow Lake.
Goldberg Reservoir is the only popular recreational lake within the project area that is connected to a
National Forest System road associated with the proposed action. None are listed among the lake and
pond fishing areas on the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest’s webpage. Gold Creek Lake(s) and
Goldberg Reservoir are on the Trout Nation website (Montana 2011). See the ROS map (figure 36)
presented in the Desired Condition section that follows for location and distribution. No designated wild
and scenic rivers or other water bodies of national importance are located in the project area.

Desired Condition
The Forest Plan lists elements of the desired condition on page 11. The one that relates most closely to
recreation and scenery states, “Visitors benefit from a range of primitive to developed recreation settings
and opportunities. Most of the BDNF continues to offer uncrowded motorized and nonmotorized
backcountry opportunities.” The Forest uses the agencies Recreation Opportunity Spectrum concepts and
definitions to establish allocations for recreation use. Table 98 lists the adopted summer-based allocations

356

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

within the project area that are applicable to this proposal, followed by a map that displays the
distribution.

Winter allocations are also assigned to this area in the Forest Plan, but there are no activities proposed for
implementation in the winter, so they are not included in this discussion. The Recreation report in the
project file displays the winter ROS map and descriptions.

Environmental Consequences
Methodology
The proposed vegetation and road treatments are dispersed throughout the project area. Potential effects
to forest visitor’s recreation experience are based on the indicators identified in the Overview section.
Spatial and Temporal Context for Cumulative Effects Analysis
Spatial Boundary: Project Area
Rationale - Consistency with ROS settings outside the project area boundary do not apply.
Temporal boundary: Short-term timeframe: 1-5 years (period of project implementation)
Rationale - The timber sale contract may last up to 5 years, and disruptions would be intermittent over
that timeframe during the normal operating period. This assumes that the prescribed burning would also
occur during this timeframe.
Long-term timeframe: 5 years and beyond (i.e., after project completion)
Past, Present, and Foreseeable Activities Relevant to Cumulative Effects Analysis
Activities that have occurred or may occur in the assessment area that have an effect on recreation
resources are: livestock grazing, mining, noxious weed control, use and maintenance of forest roads and
trails, firewood cutting, timber harvest, wildfire and fire management and suppression activities. Fire
management and suppression has occurred throughout the project area. Hazard tree removal has occurred
and continues to occur along roads and near developed recreation sites (i.e., the area around the Douglas
cabin). Motor vehicle use mapping (MVUM) as part of the travel planning process is a reasonably
foreseeable future activity that may affect the recreation resource. Effects from this action could change
the overall mileage of trails open or closed to motorized vehicles within the project area and across the
forest.
See Appendix D for a full list of present and reasonably foreseeable activities that affect the Flint
Foothills Project area.

Alternative 1 – No Action
Direct, Indirect and Cumulative Effects
Under alternative 1, there would be no direct, indirect, or cumulative effects on recreation resources
because no project activities are proposed.
Use and opportunities available regarding the recreation amenities identified in the Existing Conditions
section would remain, and are consistent with the ROS classification within the project area boundary.

358

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Since there are no activities proposed, this alternative would not contribute to past, present or reasonably
foreseeable effects on developed and dispersed recreation activities, sites and facilities, or cause any
inconsistencies with the ROS settings.

Alternative 2 – Proposed Action
Direct and Indirect Effects
Dispersed Activities
No permanent direct or indirect adverse effects to dispersed recreation opportunities from vegetation
treatments proposed in alternative 2 are anticipated. All of the newly constructed temporary roads would
be obliterated; the majority of the unauthorized routes would be decommissioned; and the newly
constructed NFS road would be put into “storage” following project implementation.
Currently open segments of UR8-246 (0.4 mile), UR8-271 (0.5 mile), and UT8-110 (0.2 mile) would be
decommissioned. The effect of this action is a 1.1-mile reduction in opportunity for various dispersed
road-based activities (i.e., roadside camping, parking for hunting, etc.). Currently closed UR-253 (0.4
mile) would be added to the Forest’s transportation system, and available for the type of road based
activities and uses described above. These actions would result in a net reduction of 0.6 mile of open
road.
Forest visitors (e.g., hunters, outfitter guide /special use permit holders, and others who participate in
dispersed recreation activities) would likely experience occasional, intermittent delays and reduced access
to forest areas while logging and prescribed burn treatments are under way. A timber sale contract
typically has a 5-year term. The prescribed burning activities in units 2b, 3b, 4b, 5b, 6b, 7b, and 8b would
likely take place over several years, and could occur in either the spring or fall. Forest visitors (described
above) in the vicinity of implementation activities may experience indirect effects from sounds and sights
such as timber falling, log hauling, noise, and dust. A project design feature is in place to mitigate
roadway interference and provide for greater safety during weekends and federal holidays (Recreation
project design features and mitigation measures, chapter 2).
In the short term, stumps, slash and logging activities may affect recreation experiences: Tree stumps and
harvest slash would be apparent to users traveling through treatment areas until vegetation becomes
established or until slash is eliminated. In the long term, as openings created by logging are replaced with
healthier stands that offer more diversity in terms of scenery, canopy and ground cover, those seeking
camping and other dispersed forms of recreation would benefit.
Recreation Sites
The only developed recreation site managed by the Forest Service within the project area boundary is
Douglas Cabin. Commercial thinning and seed tree units are proposed approximately 800 feet behind it.
The access road to the cabin is NFS Road 707, which is also a haul route, and has the potential to create
dusty conditions that could disturb users of the cabin. National Forest System Road 707 services 14 units
and would require an estimated 453 haul truck trips to complete the treatment activity. Project design
features would help to control dust during cabin use periods, mitigate roadway interference and provide
for greater safety during weekends and federal holidays (Recreation project design features and mitigation
measures, chapter 2).

359

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Recreation Use of Roads and Trails
Prescribed burn unit 4b is proposed where National Forest System Trail U8049 meets the project area
boundary and unit 29P (a precommercial thinning prescription) is located at the trails terminus. In the
shorter term, opportunity to access portions of this trail is expected to be reduced during periods of
prescribed burning implementation. National Forest System trails 8054 and 8052 would not be affected.
A 450-foot section of NFS Trail 8049 is bisected by burn unit 4b. During periods of implementation,
opportunity to access portions of this trail would be limited as short-term closures could be expected.
Users of NFS Trail 8049 could be exposed to smoke while this unit is treated as well. The public
accessing and using Trails 8054 and 8052 would not notice any effects. No permanent addition or
reduction of trails miles would result from the proposed action.
Approximately 70 miles (30 percent) of NFS roads within the project area boundary would be used as
haul roads. National Forest System roads 1544 and 1557 access many salvage treatment units and are
expected to be the most heavily used. Staging equipment and loading haul vehicles would likely occur
directly from the roadside of units adjacent to these roads. There is the potential for temporary closures
that could affect recreation access and availability (including hunting) but types of closures would vary.
The following photos were taken in the project area and exhibit temporary closures that could be
anticipated.

Figure 37: Images reflecting typical but short-term closures that may limit or restrict access
within the project area during periods of project activity

A project design feature is in place to mitigate roadway interference and provide for greater safety during
weekends and federal holidays.
Recreation Use of Streams and Lakes
Goldberg Reservoir is the only popular recreational lake in the project area that is connected to a NFS
road associated with the proposed action. Delays or limits to access for this reservoir would be expected
during implementations. Access or limits to use because of proposed management activities are not
expected for stream sections within the Flint Uplands Management Area of the project area.
Sections of Dunkleberg Creek may be affected since the stream is in proximity to unit 61S and follows
NFS Road 1544 (a haul route) for approximately 1.5 miles. Effects would be short term, intermittent
delays to accessing the creek at various places while proposed maintenance activities (to bring road to
standard) and eventual hauling occurs. Similar effects can be anticipated (under the same rationale) for

360

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

sections of Douglas Creek that follow NFS roads 1544 for approximately 2.5 miles and 707 (also a haul
route) for approximately 1 mile.
Consistency with ROS
Approximately 1.3 miles of new road constructed under this alternative would be put into storage when
the project is completed and not available for future use. All activity is proposed in summer road based
settings. The Douglas Cabin where units 30ST, 28CS, 33C and 31C are proposed is also allocated as a
winter nonmotorized setting. However, no project activities are proposed during winter. All activities
would remain consistent with the current ROS setting as a result of proposed actions.
Cumulative Effects
The types of projects that could impact recreation are current roadside salvage harvest, ongoing travel
management and trail and road maintenance. Trail maintenance is a recreation-related project expected to
occur in the future; however, no such projects are currently scheduled or planned. Trail maintenance
would be neutral or beneficial to the user.
Short-term effects to the recreation experience are associated with operations during implementation, as
tree stumps and harvest slash would be apparent to users traveling through treatment areas until
vegetation becomes established or slash eliminated. Combined with the ongoing declining recreation
setting because of dead and dying beetle-affected trees, the quality of the recreation experience would be
reduced. In the long term, these projects benefit recreation use by moving the land toward the desired
condition and meeting standards set for recreation in the Forest Plan.
Road maintenance projects (replacing culverts, etc.) benefit most recreation users by ensuring safe access
to the forest continues. Removing hazardous trees, ongoing road maintenance, and maintenance and
reconstruction associated with the haul routes under the proposed action could cumulatively provide
better driving and forest experiences for the forest visitor.
Travel management can affect recreation users who rely on motorized vehicles as a form of recreation or
as access to recreation areas. Future travel management decisions may reduce or increase the available
miles but those decisions are forthcoming so there can be no certain determination of their cumulative
effects in regards to recreation at this time.

Alternative 3
Direct and Indirect Effects
Dispersed Activities
Effects to activities would be similar as described under alternative 2.With alternative 3, UR8-246 (0.4
mile) would be decommissioned; and currently closed UR-253 (0.4 mile) would be added to the Forest’s
transportation system , and available for road based activities and uses. These actions would result in a
negligible increase (about 200 feet) in miles of open road.
No new system or temporary roads would be constructed; fewer treatment units are proposed overall
under alternative 3. Under this alternative, hunters, special use permit holders, and others who participate
in dispersed recreation activities would encounter fewer short-term delays to access the general forested
area than under alternative 2. Other recreation activities within the affected environment would be
expected to have the same effects as described under alternative 2.
361

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Recreation Sites
Effects to recreation sites as described under alternative 2 are the same for alternative 3. Both alternatives
offer the same actions within the vicinity of Douglas Cabin and the same project design features apply, so
effects would be expected to be the same.
Recreation Use of Road and Trails
Effects to road and trail use would be similar as discussed previously under alternative 2 with respect to
temporary closure and delays. Haul roads identified under alternative 3 are the same as under alternative
2. However, alternative 3 anticipates approximately 118 fewer loads hauled along NFS Road 8402. Any
perceived difference to the public in terms of closures or delays as a result is anticipated to be minimal.
Recreation Use of Streams and Lakes
The activities proposed under alternative 3 are the same as alternative 2 with respect to affected steams or
lakes within the project area boundary, and the effects are described under alternative 2 previously.
Effects to ROS
The activities proposed under alternative 3 are the same as for alternative 2 with respect to effects on ROS
classification within the project area boundary.
Cumulative Effects
In terms of the recreation resource, proposed activities for alternatives 2 and 3 are similar enough that the
cumulative effects discussed previously in alternative 2 apply to both alternatives.
Summary of Effects for Alternatives 2 and 3
The majority of effects to recreation resources are short term. Temporary delays and closures create
limited access while treatments occur within the project area boundary. Limited access would affect
various recreation activities, sites, roads, and trails. Upon completion of treatment activities, access and
opportunities would primarily revert as they currently exist – no new or different activities, trails,
facilities, or other opportunities would result from any of the proposed actions. There would be a net
reduction of 0.61 miles of open road in alternative 2; and a negligible increase (200 feet) in alternative 3.
There are no irreversible or irretrievable commitments related to recreation resources from the proposed
action.

Compliance with Forest Plan and Other Relevant Laws, Regulations, Policies and Plans
All alternatives would be consistent with the Forest Plan. Alternatives 2 and 3 would address recreation
goals and objectives outlined in the 2009 Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest Revised Land and
Resource Management Plan.

362

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Roadless
This section describes the inventoried roadless areas (IRAs) and unroaded resources in the project area
and analyzes the impact of the project’s alternatives on those resources. Unroaded resources are National
Forest System (NFS) lands that are outside a designated Wilderness or IRA, but may retain some
wilderness attributes or roadless characteristics as described in the 2001 roadless rule (66 Federal Register
9, January 12, 2001; p. 3245).
The Dolus Lake IRA (I-429) is a 9,365-acre IRA and 3,158 acres overlap into the project area. The Dolus
Lakes IRA is the only IRA that overlaps the Flint Foothills Project area, although three other IRAs are
located outside the project area to the south. They include the Flint Range IRA (1-428), Fred Burr IRA (1435) and the Lost Creek IRA (1-436). These IRAs and contiguous adjacent unroaded areas are referred to
as the Dolus roadless expanse (figure 38).
Collectively, IRAs and unroaded areas can be referred to and analyzed together as a roadless expanse,
which would describe a contiguous land area comprised of unroaded areas adjacent to inventoried
roadless areas.

Forest Plan and Regulatory Framework
The Beaverhead-Deerlodge Forest Plan (2009)
The Beaverhead-Deerlodge Forest Plan established forestwide multiple use goals, objectives, and
management area direction. The analysis of inventoried roadless areas—documented in Appendix C of
the FEIS for the Plan—inventoried and evaluated areas with wilderness potential using a methodology
consistent with Forest Service policy direction. Appendix C of the FEIS for the BDNF Forest Plan (2009)
provides additional detail on the methodology used for this evaluation. As a result of this Forestwide
analysis, some roadless areas were recommended for inclusion in the National Wilderness Preservation
System and others were not. The Dolus Lakes IRA (1-429), Flint Range IRA (1-428), Fred Burr IRA (1435) and Lost Creek IRA (1-436) were not recommended for inclusion in the National Wilderness
Preservation System, nor were the adjacent roadless lands.
No Forestwide or management area standards specific to inventoried roadless areas or areas evaluated for
wilderness potential that were not recommended for designation as wilderness were prescribed in the
2009 Forest Plan. The Forest Plan does, however, prescribe more general management direction which
overlaps with Inventory Roadless Areas (IRAs) and other areas considered for wilderness potential in this
analysis. This management direction takes the form of place-based management area goals, objectives, or
standards; recreation allocations and specific standards for resources across the Forest. Forest Plan
standards exist to ensure that specific management direction is followed.
The Dolus roadless expanse, including the four IRAs is assigned to the Flint Uplands management area
(MA), the Flint Foothills MA, with a small portion within the Georgetown Lake MA and the Warm
Springs Management area. The Flint Uplands MA is managed for a mix of semi-primitive motorized and
non-motorized recreation, as well as secure high-elevation wildlife habitat. The Flint Foothills MA is
managed for timber production, livestock grazing and dispersed recreation. Georgetown Lake
Management area is managed for developed water based recreation, trail opportunities, and winter sports
and Warm Springs MA is managed for recreation, wildlife, and native fish conservation. None of these
IRAs are recommended for Wilderness designation and no other wilderness, inventoried roadless areas,
recommended wilderness areas, or wilderness study areas are in the project area.

Methodology
Wilderness Attributes
The principal attributes of wilderness listed below, as described in Forest Service Handbook (FSH)
1909.12, are generally, but not necessarily listed in order of importance or desirability (USDA Forest
Service 2007). The FS Handbook directs managers to consider these five characteristics when analyzing
the quality of the wilderness resource of potential wilderness areas.
•

Natural: Ecological systems are substantially free from the effects of modern civilization and
generally appear affected primarily by forces of nature. Effects of modern civilization include:
a. The presence of nonnative species that alter the composition of natural plant and animal
communities (such as nonnative plants, animals, fish, livestock, invertebrates, and
pathogens).
b. Developments that degrade the free-flowing condition of rivers and streams (such as
dams or other water diversions and impoundments).
c. The presence of light pollution that degrades night sky quality and night sky quality
related values.
d. The presence of pollutants that degrade water quality.
e. The health of ecosystems, plant communities, and plant species that are rare or at risk.

•

Undeveloped: The degree to which the area is without permanent improvements or human
habitation. A measure of undeveloped is the level of human occupation and modification
including evidence of structures, construction, habitations, or other forms of human presence,
use and occupation.

•

Outstanding Opportunities for Solitude or Primitive and Unconfined Recreation: The
area provides solitude or primitive and unconfined types of recreation including a wide range
of experiential opportunities such as: physical and mental challenge, adventure and selfreliance, feelings of solitude, isolation, self-awareness and inspiration. Solitude is the
opportunity to experience isolation from sights, sounds, and the presence of others from the
developments and evidence of humans. The opportunity to experience isolation from the
evidence of humans, to feel a part of nature, to have a vastness of scale, and a degree of
challenge and risk while using outdoor skills are measures of primitive and unconfined
recreation.

•

Special Features and Values: The area provides other values such as those with ecologic,
geologic, scientific, educational, scenic, historical, or cultural significance. Examples include
unique fish and wildlife species, unique plants or plant communities, connectivity, potential or
existing research natural areas, outstanding landscape features and significant cultural resource
sites.

•

Manageability: In determining capability, consider the ability to manage an area as
wilderness as required by the Wilderness Act. Section 2(c) of the Wilderness Act defines
wilderness as an area that, “…(3) has at least 5,000 acres of land or is of sufficient size to
make practicable its preservation and use in an unimpaired condition.” The Forest Service’s
ability to manage an area as an enduring resource of wilderness, untrammeled by humans,
retaining its primeval character, and to protect and manage its natural character are all factors

365

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

to consider. Consider such factors as size, shape, and juxtaposition to external influences.
Evaluate how boundaries affect manageability of an area. In the most desirable situations:
a. Boundary locations avoid conflict with existing or potential public uses outside the boundary
that might result in demands to allow nonconforming structures and activities in the
wilderness.
b. It is possible to readily and accurately describe, establish, and recognize boundaries on the
ground.
c. Boundaries, where possible, conform with terrain or other features that constitute a barrier to
prohibited use.
d. Boundaries provide adequate opportunity for access and traveler transfer facilities.
Table 99 shows how these wilderness attributes from FSH 1909.12 correspond to the characteristics of
roadless areas listed in the 2001 Roadless Rule.

Identification of Inventoried Roadless Areas and Contiguous Unroaded Lands
(Roadless Expanse):
All unroaded areas (land between roads) were determined by overlaying all existing roads in proximity to
the project area. These roads were then buffered by 16 feet on either side (to account for roadbed and cut
and fill) to create spatial polygons. A total of 53 base, unroaded polygons were identified that were either

366

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

totally within or partially bisected the project area (details available in the project record). The acres were
calculated for each of these polygons. The size of the base polygons ranged from 7,135 acres to less than
1 acre.
A determination was made as to whether these base polygons are contiguous 40 to wilderness, inventoried
roadless areas, recommended wilderness areas, and/or wilderness study areas. Based on this protocol, the
Flint Range IRA, Fred Burr IRA and the Lost Creek IRA were found to be contiguous with the Dolus
Lakes IRA. This Dolus roadless expanse (IRAs and unroaded areas) is 163, 327 acres and located mainly
to the south of the project area with 11,887 acres within the project area (7 percent).
The most recent Forest Plan revision process ending in 2009 did not recommended any of these areas as
wilderness or additions to the existing IRAs and since no activities are proposed in these areas outside of
the project area, existing conditions and environmental consequences would remain relatively unchanged
since the 2009 analysis.
A map of unroaded areas is figure 4 in the Roadless Report (Morrisey and Blake 2014) available in the
project record; figure 38 in this document displays the Dolus roadless expanse.

Spatial and Temporal Boundaries
The spatial boundary for the Flint Foothills Project roadless analysis is the “roadless expanse” with a
focus on the roadless expanse within the project area as described in the previous section. The Flint
Foothills Project area and the Dolus roadless expanse, with project boundaries, roads and trails, and
treatment units, are displayed in figure 38.
The temporal boundaries of the effects analysis are determined by how long the effects of project
activities will last. Direct and indirect effects to unroaded areas can be either short term or long term. For
this analysis, short-term effects are the human-induced impacts to the land surface and vegetation that the
land would recover from within 10 years after initiation of the activity. Long-term effects are humancaused disturbances that would be evident on the landscape for more than 10 years.

Affected Environment
Introduction
In 2003, the BDNF undertook an assessment process whereby the wilderness potential of each IRA was
quantitatively assessed. These worksheets, the Inventoried Roadless Area Capability Assessment (USDA
Forest Service 2003) graded each IRA according to five main elements, in order to help determine the
wilderness potential of inventoried roadless areas. A summary of these worksheet scores is reflected in
Appendix C of the BDNF Forest Plan FEIS (USDA Forest Service 2009). Pages 58-62 of Appendix C
displays the summary of the Wilderness Evaluation data compiled for the Flint Range and Dolus Lakes
IRA which were analyzed together.
The Dolus Lakes IRA and Flint Range IRA combined were determined to have a moderate suitability
rating for wilderness, but almost ranked high. “An area recommended as suitable for wilderness must
meet the tests of capability, availability and need (FSH 1909.12 (72)).” Capability is the degree to which
an area contains the basic Wilderness qualities. These include the integrity of the natural environment,
signs of human occupation and modification, opportunities for solitude and primitive recreation, unique
Contiguous is defined as unroaded land without roads between it and the boundary of the wilderness, inventoried
roadless areas, recommended wilderness areas, and wilderness study areas.

ecological or cultural features and manageability. Manageability includes factors such as size, shape,
relationship to external influences, and boundary location. Availability is the value of and need for the
wilderness resource as compared to the value of and need for other resources. A high rating means there
are few or no obligations such as special use permitted dams, access roads, and others. A moderate rating
has more limiting obligations and a low rating means that the Forest Service has very limited control to
prevent incompatible uses that would affect wilderness potential. Need is the degree to which the area
contributes to the National Wilderness Preservation System. Where need is rated high, areas have both a
broad base of public support and two or more ecological qualities identified in the Region One
Assessment; when need is rated moderate the area has a minimum of one ecological quality or a broad
base of public support for recommendation; or when need is rated low areas have only a single ecological
contribution and no public support specific to that particular roadless area for each area.
The Dolus Lakes IRA and Flint Range IRA combined capability for Wilderness is rated as moderate,
availability is rated as moderate and need is rated as moderate, resulting in a moderate suitability. While
the results of the 2009 Forest Plan Revision- Results of Evaluation of Areas with Wilderness Potential are
specific to boundaries of the Dolus Lakes IRA and Flint Range IRA combined areas, those lands
described as being contiguous to the Dolus Lake IRA within the project area may not have the same
capability and Wilderness potential.
The majority of the Dolus roadless expanse within the project area has a road-based recreation allocation
(70 percent) as shown in Figure 39. This allocation is entirely associated with the areas outside of the
Dolus Lakes IRA. The goal for the roaded-based allocation is to provide roaded natural and rural
recreation settings and offer a wide variety of opportunities for dispersed and developed recreational
activities (2009 Beaverhead Deerlodge National Forest Plan, page 29). The roaded natural areas have
moderate evidences of the sights and sounds of man, evidence of resource modification and utilization,
but harmonize with the natural environment. Motorized use is provided for. Rural areas are characterized
by substantially modified natural environment. Sights and sounds of humans are readily evident and
interaction between users is often moderate to high.

Existing Condition
For the purposes of this analysis, the roadless expanse existing condition and effects will be focused on
the 11,887 acres within the project area that includes the portions of the Dolus Lakes IRA, and the
contiguous unroaded area identified within the project area as described in the Introduction and
Methodology sections.
The Dolus Lake Inventoried Roadless Area (1-429) is located on the northern portion of the Pintler
Ranger District and the northeast side of the Flint Creek Range. It lies north of Rock Creek and NFS Trail
8053, straddles Pikes Peak Ridge and ends along Pikes Peak Creek. The elevation of the Dolus Lake IRA
ranges from approximately 6,200 feet to 9,360 feet. Numerous lakes are within the IRA; however, only a
few are located within the project area.
The Dolus Lakes IRA is 9,366 acres in size, although only 3,158 acres of it are in the project area. The
3,158 acres in the project area are located in the southeastern section of the project area and the northern
portion of the roadless expanse. There are no roads in the Dolus Lakes IRA but there are four National
Forest System Trails. Trail 8052, a non-motorized trail, which meanders in and out of the Dolus Lake IRA
lies mainly within the unroaded portion of the roadless expanse. FS Trail 8054, a motorized trail, borders
the Dolus Lake IRA and the contiguous unroaded area within the project area. No other forest system
trails are within the roadless expanse within the project area. The Dolus Lake Trail, NFS Trail 8115, is a
non-motorized trail which is almost entirely within the Dolus Lake IRA, but completely outside of the

368

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

project area, and a very small portion of the Doney Lake Trail (Trail 8138) enters the IRA but is also
completely outside of the project area.
Approximately 25 miles of roads appear to cross into the IRA creating small areas of roadless expanse
bisected by a road, thus the contiguousness to the IRA. These roads and the 16-foot buffer, technically, are
outside of the roadless expanse however, impacts from these roads are apparent and in some cases leave
small areas without road impacts.
Within the project area the IRA is summer non-motorized (2710 acres and 23 percent) and backcountry
(434 acres and 4 percent) recreation allocations. The goals for summer non-motorized allocations are to
provide semi-primitive non-motorized recreation settings and offer opportunities for mountain biking,
horse and stock travel, hiking, and dispersed camping, while the semi-primitive motorized recreation
setting offers opportunities for varied types of travel and recreational activities (2009 Beaverhead
Deerlodge National Forest Plan page 29). The corresponding standard for summer non-motorized
allocation is Recreation standard 7 which states: Manage summer non-motorized allocations for either a
primitive or semi-primitive non-motorized setting from May 16 thru December 1 (2009 Beaverhead
Deerlodge National Forest Plan page 32). Recreation Standard 9 states: Manage Backcountry allocations
for a semi-primitive motorized setting from May 16 thru December 1, (2009 Beaverhead Deerlodge
National Forest Plan page 32). The backcountry allocations are located along some of the transition zones
between the IRA and the road-based allocations.

The majority of the Dolus roadless expanse within the project area is a winter motorized allocation as
directed by the 2009 Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest Plan and is mainly outside of the IRA. The
goal for winter motorized allocations is to provide roaded and semi-primitive motorized recreation
settings in these areas, and offer opportunities for a variety of motorized and non-motorized travel and
activities. The majority of these allocations provide opportunities for travel by snowmobile (2009
Beaverhead Deerlodge National Forest Plan page 29).
The management areas governing the Flint Foothills project area are the Flint Foothills and Flint Uplands
Management Areas (MA). The Dolus roadless expanse within the project area is split between the Flint
Uplands MA to the south and the Flint Foothills MA to the north. Lands managed by the Flint Foothills
MA are managed for timber production, livestock grazing and dispersed recreation; therefore visitors are
likely to encounter evidence of activities such as vegetation modification from timber harvest or fire,
roads for timber harvest, motor vehicles on roads and trails yearlong, historic mining remnants and
current mining activity and reclamation and livestock. Motor vehicles may also be found on open roads
yearlong on roads that border the roadless expanse.
Lands managed by the Flint Uplands MA are managed for a mix of semi-primitive motorized and nonmotorized recreation along with secure high elevation wildlife habitat. Visitors may encounter vegetation
changes from timber harvest or fire, motor vehicles on some roads and trails, people on foot, stock,
mountain bikes or skis and livestock.
There are no Fisheries Key Watersheds within the project area. Fish Key Watershed means “Watersheds
selected for focusing of federal funds and personnel for the purpose of restoring or maintaining viability
of Threatened, Endangered and Sensitive aquatic species (USDA Forest Service. 2009b, Glossary page
10). In addition, 59 percent of this roadless expanse within the project area is considered wildlife secure
area. Wildlife secure areas are areas that are 1/3 of a mile from a route open to motor vehicles that are
larger than 10 acres.
There are a few stock tanks and a couple miles of fence within the roadless expanse that are associated
with grazing allotments. One outfitter and guide operates within the roadless expanse in the project area
offering mainly day hunting trips.
Existing Wilderness Attributes
To further describe the analysis area’s existing condition, the roadless expanse was evaluated from the
perspective of the five wilderness attributes as defined is FSH 1909.12 and further described in the
methodology section. The evaluation of the Dolus Lakes IRA wilderness attributes can be found in the
Individual Roadless Area Evaluations in Appendix C of the Forest Plan FEIS (USDA Forest Service
2009).
Natural and Undeveloped Attributes
The southern portion of the Dolus roadless expanse, near the Dolus IRA, is mostly natural appearing, with
moderately high scenic integrity (figure 40). Exceptions to this include scattered historic mining, drill
sites, exploration pits, low standard roads, and trails. There are also many roads around the edges and
surrounded by the roadless expanse, which impact the naturalness of the area. Past management activities
are also evident. The natural integrity has also been slightly reduced by livestock grazing and fluctuating
water levels. Grazing allotments in the analysis area support a very limited number of cattle. Streams
maintain their biological values, channel structure, and riparian function, and are used for downstream
irrigation.

371

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Approximately 7022 acres (59 percent) of the Dolus roadless expanse within the project area provide
secure habitat for wildlife, enhancing linkages and connectivity across the landscape in between the
Greater Yellowstone Area (GYA) and forests to the west and north. There is mapped Canada lynx and
wolverine denning habitat in the roadless expanse. In addition, westslope cutthroat and bull trout inhabit
some stream segments.
Some of the Dolus roadless expanse is favorable for mining deposits, including gold-silver veins and
associated base metals. The area is considered a high value known locatable mineral deposit area. Oil and
gas potential for the area is low.

Figure 40: View from the project area looking south into the Dolus Lakes IRA

The unroaded polygons in the northern portions of the roadless expanse, further away from the IRA itself,
are already influenced by human development and are less natural-appearing. There is evidence of past
harvest activity in the northern end of the roadless expanse, as well as a much more roaded landscape.
Solitude and Primitive Recreation Attributes
The Dolus IRA provides many opportunities for solitude, primitive recreation, and challenging hiking or
climbing. Within the IRA there are numerous small lakes that are surrounded by cool moist forests, and
enhance opportunities for solitude. Some of the lakes are popular for family outings, however; most of
these are outside of the project area. Fall hunting season also brings visitors to the backcountry of the
roadless expanse. Snowmobiling is popular in the winter throughout the winter motorized allocations in
the roadless expanse, reducing the solitude and primitive recreation potential of those areas.
The entire roadless expanse does not provide opportunities for solitude or primitive recreation. The
northern half of the roadless expanse, away from the Dolus IRA, is a more roaded landscape, with a
motorized recreation setting. Solitude would be more difficult to find in this portion of the roadless
expanse.
Special Features
A limited amount of survey work has been done in the area, producing some heritage sites. More would
likely be found with additional survey work. There are no other known special features in the Dolus
roadless expanse.

372

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Manageability Attributes
The boundaries of the Dolus IRA itself generally follow topographic features, and are therefore favorable
towards manageability as a wilderness. In the larger roadless expanse, however, there are several different
blocks of private inholdings, which would make manageability more difficult.
In addition, there are already numerous roads, both system and non-system roads that are within the
roadless expanse outside of the IRA that makes management and protection of Wilderness character
extremely difficult

Environmental Consequences
Alternative 1 – No Action
Direct, Indirect and Cumulative Effects
For alternative 1, there would be no direct, indirect or cumulative effects to the roadless expanse because
no project activities are proposed. Therefore, there would be no effect on the existing naturalness of the
area from the project.
The roadless expanse spans a wide range of degree of naturalness, from the more natural, undisturbed
landscape of the IRA in the south, to the more actively-managed landscape in the north. This range of
naturalness would not change in the no-action alternative. As no activities would occur in the roadless
expanse, the ability to find solitude would remain as it currently exists. There is more ability to find
solitude in the less-roaded southern roadless expanse landscape and less solitude potential in the more
roaded north. This would not change with implementation of the no-action alternative.
Current manageability of the roadless expanse also would not change. A summary based on the current
conditions assessment finds the IRA portion of the Dolus roadless expanse to have moderate wilderness
suitability for inclusion into the Wilderness Preservation System. This would not change under the noaction alternative. Natural processes would continue to dominate in the IRA part of the roadless expanse,
and the lands to the north of the IRA would continue to be more managed.

Alternative 2 –Proposed Action
Direct and Indirect Effects
Alternative 2 - proposed action, proposes salvage harvest, seed tree harvest commercial and
precommercial thinning, and prescribed fire on 5,073 acres in order to harvest wood products from
forested stands that are infested or at risk for infestation with bark beetles before the value of the wood
deteriorates, to reduce stand density and restore forest resiliency, to bring lands suitable for timber
production into a managed condition, and to manage those stands to maintain long-term sustained yield.
For a detailed description of the actions proposed in alternative 2, see chapter 2.
In the roadless expanse, 1,127 acres will be treated with 228 of those being timber units and 899 being
restoration units. New and existing temporary roads are also proposed in and near the roadless expanse to
access the vegetative treatment units listed above. Three (3) new temporary roads are proposed to be
constructed and used to support harvest and restoration activities within the roadless expanse and an
existing unauthorized route, UR8-246 (.39 miles) borders the edge of the roadless expanse and therefore
is inside the roadless expanse.

373

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

All the vegetative and roads treatments are proposed in the roadless expanse, outside the Dolus Lakes
IRA boundary. The largest action proposed in the roadless expanse is Unit 5B, a 710-acre prescribed burn
unit. This unit proposes 710 acres of mixed-severity prescribed burning in lodgepole pine stands. It is
located approximately 0.5 miles northeast of the Dolus Lakes IRA boundary, and proposes ignitions on
approximately 40 percent of the unit. Fire spread beyond the initial ignition would be acceptable on up to
100 percent of the unit. This would result in a mosaic of burned and unburned areas, with an objective of
50 percent mortality in unit’s overstory trees. The unburned portions of the units would primarily include
riparian areas. Control lines would primarily be natural features such as rock slopes and natural fuel
breaks of different fuel types.
Units 51S, 52S, 65C, 66C, and 79S propose a total of 186 acres of a variety of salvage cutting and
thinning actions in the northeast section of the roadless expanse, approximately .5 miles away from the
Dolus IRA boundary. In addition, units 73S and 74S straddle the eastern boundary of the roadless
expanse, but are near enough to potentially impact the wilderness attributes of the roadless expanse.
Another cluster of units, 18P, 19P, and 13P propose precommercial thinning in the northeastern section of
the roadless expanse. Just to the southwest of the precommercial units, there is a cluster of salvage
logging units (45, 44, 58, and 69S). Two more precommercial thinning units (36 & 39P) are located in the
southwestern region of the roadless expanse analysis area.
Alternative 2 also proposes 0.59 mile of newly constructed temporary road in the roadless expanse area.
All of the roads in question are on the eastern boundary of the roadless expanse analysis area and would
be decommissioned following project implementation of authorized activities.
The analysis below considers whether, under alternative 2, any of the units described above could have an
impact on the potential wilderness attributes of roadless expanse.
Natural Attributes
Determine whether the area’s ecological systems are substantially free from the effects of modern
civilization and generally appear to have been affected primarily by forces of nature.
There may be a temporary, short-term effect on air resources across the roadless expanse in the short term.
Prescribed burning can affect air quality at the time of the burning. The effects, however, are expected to
be minimal and of short duration. The proposed burn unit is located in the roadless expanse,
approximately 0.50 mile north of NFS Trail 8052, a non-motorized trail. There would be no long-term or
significant effects to air quality in the IRA or unroaded areas because project design features and best
management practices (chapter 2) for prescribed burning would be implemented.
The effects of the vegetation treatments on the naturalness of the unroaded expanse vary by treatment.
Effects of vegetation treatments are discussed in further detail in the Vegetation section of this EIS. For
the prescribed burn units, the killing of overstory and understory conifers would result in a patch mosaic
that may appear similar to a small wildland fire. In the short and long term it would not be evident as to
whether the fire was caused by a natural event (i.e., lightning) or was a human-caused disturbance. There
would be some initial recovery of understory native vegetation that would occur shortly after the
prescribed fire treatments.
Burning would also have some mixed effects on sensitive plants. For example, although the moonwort
species’ above-ground structures could be removed by prescribed burning, reintroduction of fire would
have a beneficial effect on the species in the long term. Burning is also expected to have a positive impact
on the treated areas’ resiliency, resulting in stands more able to withstand insect or fire mortality
(Vegetation Specialist Report), which would in turn, create a more natural landscape.

374

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

The cutting units would have varied effect on the naturalness of the unroaded expanse. The
precommercial thin units would not have a notable short- or long-term impact on the natural appearance
of the unroaded expanse because they are located in a more disturbed part of the roadless expanse. The
395 acres of salvage treatments, however, would have more notable short- and long-term effect on the
naturalness of the unroaded expanse. The treatments in these areas would create openings that would be
obvious to the casual observer in the short and long term; these may mimic natural disturbance patterns,
but the openings themselves would impact the naturalness of the area.
During implementation of alternative 2, wildlife secure areas will be reduced by 449 acres resulting in a
total of 6,573 acres of wildlife secure areas within the roadless expanse. This reduction will have a slight
impact on the naturalness of the area; however, once project work is complete, no long-term impacts
would be expected.
Although there will be effects from the proposed vegetation treatments, there would not be an
irretrievable loss of wilderness attributes.
Undeveloped Attributes
Determine the degree to which the area is without permanent improvements or human habitation. A
measure of undeveloped is the level of human occupation and modification of the area including evidence
of structures, construction, habitations, or other forms of human presence, use, and occupation.
There is evidence of human manipulation already existing in parts of the roadless expanse such as roads,
mining and grazing evidence (fences, stock tanks). These existing human modifications would continue to
exist unchanged with the implementation of the proposed action. No additional permanent management
developments are proposed for the area, so there would be no new evidence of structures, construction,
habitations, or other forms of human presence, use and occupation added as a result of alternative 2. The
actions proposed in alternative 2 would not affect the undeveloped component of the roadless expanse’s
wilderness potential in the long term.
In the short term, new temporary roads built in the roadless expanse would impact the undeveloped
attribute of the expanse. On the eastern edge of the roadless expanse, the 0.59 mile of temporary access
road would alter the area’s undeveloped character while the roads are being built or reconstructed and
used; however, these temporary roads are already adjacent to a fairly roaded section of the project area.
All of the temporary roads would be decommissioned after use; the newly constructed temporary roads
would be obliterated; the existing unauthorized routes would be decommissioned by sign, berms and
other closure methods, as shown in table 6.
In summary, the proposed treatments would only have short-term effects on the undeveloped attributes of
the roadless expanse, and the majority of those effects would occur in an area already influenced by
human development. There would be no long-term impact on the area’s undeveloped character. As such,
the short-term effects to the undeveloped character of the area are not permanent and thus not considered
an irreversible or irretrievable loss of wilderness attributes.
Outstanding Opportunities for Solitude or Primitive and Unconfined Recreation
Determine an area’s capability of providing solitude or primitive and unconfined types of recreation. This
includes providing a wide range of experiential opportunities such as: physical and mental challenge,
adventure and self-reliance, feelings of solitude, isolation, self-awareness, and inspiration.
Outstanding opportunities for solitude or primitive and unconfined recreation are a direct reflection of
distance from and ability to detect disturbances associated with existing and/or proposed human
375

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

development within the area. The actions proposed in alternative 2 would not have long-term effects on
solitude or the primitive and unconfined recreation attributes of the wilderness potential in the roadless
expanse. As described in the Affected Environment section, not all of the analysis area has opportunities
for solitude and primitive recreation. Opportunities for solitude are most likely to be found in the southern
portion of the analysis area, closest to the Dolus IRA. Therefore, treatment units proposed in the northern
section of the analysis will not impact this attribute. The treatment unit activities in alternative 2 would
have no long-term impact on the area’s solitude or primitive recreation value, as most of the vegetation
treatment units occur within close proximity to existing motorized roads and trails with an already low
opportunity for solitude or unconfined and primitive recreation experiences (figure 39).
Alternative 2 may have a minor short-term effect on semi-primitive recreation opportunities in the
roadless expanse area. The Dolus Lakes IRA and adjacent unroaded polygons within the unroaded
expanse provide nonmotorized as well as some motorized recreation opportunities for visitors year-round.
Semi-primitive recreation in the Dolus roadless expanse is primarily limited to foot traffic on trails such
as NFS Road 8052, which borders the IRA, as well as camping or hunting activities (figure 39). Any
hunting or camping recreation is likely to be on or near roads and trails in the roadless expanse. Burn
activities in Unit 5B, which is 0.30 miles from 8052, may produce short-term, localized impacts on these
road and trail-based recreationists, primarily with smoke and haze. Although these activities may impact
recreation in the roadless expanse in the short term, the effects are not anticipated to last beyond project
implementation.
In addition, cutting units 39P and 36P may impact semi-primitive recreation in the short term by creating
possible sights and sounds of treatment activities, such as chainsaw use. These units are each
approximately 0.50 miles away from motorized trail 8054. Therefore, while these units would not be
visible from the trail; sounds of implementation may be heard, and the trail user’s viewscape may be
impacted. Impacts on the recreationist’s viewscape would be short term.
Implementation of this alternative, while it may produce short-term effects during project implementation,
would not cause a long-term impact on the solitude attribute. As such, the proposed vegetation activities
are not considered an irreversible or irretrievable loss of wilderness attributes even though they occur
within the confines of the Dolus roadless expanse.
Special Features and Values
Determine the area’s capability to provide other values such as those with ecologic, geologic, scientific,
educational, scenic, historical, or cultural significance. Examples include unique fish and wildlife
species, unique plants or plant communities, connectivity, potential or existing research natural areas,
outstanding landscape features, and significant cultural resource sites. Identify and describe any such
values and their contribution to Wilderness character.
The actions proposed in alternative 2 would not affect the special features attribute of the roadless
expanse’s wilderness potential, as there are no known special features in the roadless expanse.
Manageability
In determining capability, consider the ability to manage an area as Wilderness as required by the
Wilderness Act. Section 2(c) of the Wilderness Act defines Wilderness as an area that “. (3) has at least
5,000 acres of land or is of sufficient size to make practicable its preservation and use in an unimpaired
condition. . .” Forest Service ability to manage an area as an enduring resource of Wilderness,
untrammeled by humans, retaining its primeval character, and to protect and manage its natural

376

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

character are all factors to consider. Consider such factors as size, shape, and juxtaposition to external
influences.
None of the treatments identified for the proposed action would have long-term effects on the boundary
of, size or shape of, or access to the Dolus roadless expanse. None of the vegetation treatments proposed
in this alternative would change any of the existing conditions regarding these factors, as all existing
motorized routes would remain the same and access routes added (on the eastern edge of the roadless
expanse) are temporary. Therefore, the proposed action would not have long-term effects on the
wilderness manageability attribute of the Dolus roadless expanse.

Alternative 3
Direct, Indirect, and Cumulative Effects
Although the project treatment units proposed in alternative 3 vary from those in the proposed action, the
vegetative units proposed in alternatives 2 and 3 are identical within the roadless expanse.
The road treatments proposed in the roadless expanse in alternative 3 vary from those in the proposed
action. For alternative 3, in the roadless expanse, access to the vegetative treatment units would be by
existing temporary roads.
The effects of alternative 3 on the roadless expanse are therefore the same as described in alternative 2,
with the exception of the short-term impact on the “undeveloped” attribute and slight change in
naturalness in alternative 2. Alternative 3 uses only unauthorized routes in the roadless expanse, so would
therefore have no impact on the “undeveloped” value. In addition, because no temporary roads would be
constructed within the roadless expanse, the wildlife secure acres are slightly higher in the roadless
expanse by 347 acres.
Cumulative Effects of Alternative 2 and Alternative 3
When considering the cumulative effects of the alternatives on the potential wilderness value of the
roadless expanse, incremental impacts from past, present and reasonably foreseeable actions must be
considered. Present and reasonably foreseeable actions are listed in Appendix D. These actions were
considered in combination with direct and indirect effects of proposed alternative actions, to arrive at the
cumulative effects determination on the wilderness/roadless character of the roadless expanse.
Past, present, and future management activities in the project area that could impact the roadless expanse
include roadside and danger tree hazard tree removal, wildland fire suppression activities, invasive plant
species control, and continued livestock grazing. The cumulative effect of these activities, combined with
activities proposed for alternatives 2 and 3, may affect the naturalness, undeveloped value, and feelings of
solitude in the roadless expanse. These activities would take place primarily in the northern parts of the
roadless expanse, away from the IRA, where the existing level of wilderness potential is already lower.
Most of this area with past, present and future management activity is in a road-based recreation
allocation, where these types of activities would be expected.
Management decisions such as the Beaverhead-Deerlodge Forest Plan (USDA Forest Service 2009) and
road and trail designation, Motor Vehicle Use Mapping (MVUM), could change the miles of roads and
trails open to motorized use. This could result in a positive cumulative effect within the roadless expanse
by increasing opportunities for solitude and primitive unconfined recreation.

377

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Another management activity that has occurred in the past and will continue in the future is trail
maintenance work. Trail work continues on both motorized and nonmotorized trails in the roadless
expanse. Maintenance work on NFS Trail 8052, which borders the IRA, will help maintain nonmotorized
trail opportunities in the southern part of the roadless expanse. This maintenance activity will likely have
effects on primitive and unconfined recreation, as well as feelings of solitude. Trail maintenance is also
ongoing on motorized NFS Trail 8054, which is located 0.50 miles from proposed project units for
alternatives 2 and 3. This activity, when combined with project objectives, may have a positive long-term
effect on the Forest’s recreation resource, but as it is a motorized trail, will not add to the solitude value of
the roadless expanse.
In summary, cumulative effects of past, present and reasonably foreseeable activities may affect the
roadless expanse, primarily in the area in and immediately adjacent to the IRA, where there is a higher
starting value for potential wilderness attributes. These effects will likely be positive and negative to the
natural and undeveloped character. There would be minimal cumulative effects on wilderness/roadless
attributes in the contiguous unroaded area part of the roadless expanse, due to a lower existing wilderness
value condition. Cumulative effects associated with future travel management decisions may also have
either positive or negative impacts on the wilderness character of this roadless expanse, as the status of
additional roads or trails may change.

Summary of Effects of Alternative 2 and Alternative 3
In summary, project activities would have some short- and long-term effects on the wilderness attributes
for the roadless expanse from salvage treatments and prescribed burning. The primary effects on the
Dolus roadless expanse from implementing alternatives 2 or 3 would come from impacts to the IRA’s
naturalness value from the cutting and burning activity located near the Dolus IRA. For example,
following salvage harvest, less than 5 percent live canopy coverage would be expected to remain in the
units. However, within 5 years of harvest completion, 94 percent of stands would be expected to be fullystocked (Vegetation Report (Gump 2014)). This creates a short-term impact on naturalness, but minor
long-term impact. Although evidence of burning would look natural in the burn units, it may stand out to
the observer as it would look different from the surrounding vegetation. There would also be some shortterm implementation effects from the alternatives, caused by the sights and sounds of chainsaws, other
logging-related activities; and prescribed burn ignitions by hand crews or use of helitorches. Other project
activities located in the northern part of the roadless expanse would produce little to no impacts on
potential wilderness value, because they are located in an area with more past and ongoing management
activities, where few wilderness attributes currently exist. There would also be some beneficial effects
from implementing alternatives 2 or 3, including increased forest resiliency in the vegetative communities
targeted for treatment. These beneficial effects are particularly applicable to the natural attribute.

Scenic Resources
Introduction
This report analyzes the scenery resource for the Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Project located
on National Forest System lands managed by the Pintler Ranger District of the BDNF (BDNF) in
Montana. The analysis examines the effects of the proposed treatments on the scenery resource within the
affected environment of the project area, which includes portions of the Flint Foothills and Flint Uplands
Management Areas of the Clark Fork Flint Landscape.

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Terminology used in this analysis is defined in Agriculture Handbook #701, Landscape Aesthetics: A
Handbook for Scenery Management (USDA Forest Service 1995). In addition to terminology, see this
handbook for more information regarding scenery management. This project follows direction from the
BDNF Land and Resource Management Plan (Forest Plan, USDA Forest Service 2009) including goals,
standards and guides, and desired condition.

Overview of Issues Addressed
None of the numerous concerns identified by the public during scoping were directed towards the scenery
resource specifically. However, visual effects associated with implementation activities and how areas
might appear after treatments could be considered concerns to some members of the public regardless.

Issue Indicators
Scenic Integrity Objectives associated with the Clark Fork Flint Landscape (Forest Plan p. 33; and
Appendix A, A-1, A-4 through A-7).

Affected Environment
The project area is within the Clark Fork Flint Landscape of the BDNF, and is comprised of the Flint
Foothills and Flint Uplands Management Areas (MA). The Flint Foothills Management Area comprises
85 percent of the project area, and the Flint Uplands Management Area comprises the remaining 15
percent. There are no specially designated areas within the project area boundary such as Wilderness,
Wilderness Study, or Recommended Wilderness areas. A portion of the Dolus Lake Inventoried Roadless
Area (I-439) is within the project boundary.

Existing Condition
Effects from human activity are visible on the landscape from the transportation system network as
viewers travel through the project area. These activities include timber harvest, mineral extraction, fire
suppression, and grazing, road construction, facility construction (including buildings, communication
sites, and transmission lines), developed, and dispersed recreation sites and trails. Of these, timber harvest
activities have had the greatest impact on scenery because of their quantity, scale, proximity to the road
system and time usually required for visual recovery. Figure 41 illustrates the fragmented landscape
patterns that have evolved over time within the project area boundary (red line) due to human activity.

379

project area boundary (15 meter, Lower 48 States eSat Imagery provided by the USDA Forest Service)

The affected environment of the project area can be characterized as a mix of managed and naturally
appearing landscapes. High mountain scenic vistas and backcountry opportunities are key attractions.
Roads within the management area are primarily historic roads built to facilitate timber harvest and
vegetation management activities, mining, and dam maintenance. The Flint Foothills form a scenic
backdrop for Interstate 90 between Drummond and Butte, and a portion of Montana Highway 1
designated the “Pintler Scenic Loop” from Drummond south towards Philipsburg (Helena 2011).

which is in the background distance zone (4 miles or more from viewpoint)

project area, which is in the background distance zone (4 miles or more from viewpoint).

Evidence of timber harvest and vegetation management activities are common sights within the project
area, as the majority of it has been managed for timber production, livestock grazing and dispersed
recreation. Landscape settings with evidence of beetle kill are a typical sight as well (USDA 2009). As
mentioned in the Vegetation Report (Gump 2015) for this project, it is estimated that 100 percent of the
lodgepole pine stands in the project area that trees 5 inches in diameter and larger have been affected by
the mountain pine beetle, causing extensive tree mortality. The following figure depicts how beetle killed
trees typically appear on the high visibility landscape setting in the immediate foreground from a forest
road. Note the discoloration of dead trees in contrast to those that are living. The visual effect is lowered
scenic integrity.

Figure 44: Typical view of beetle killed trees within the project area as seen from a viewpoint along NFS Road
1544 (Concern Level 2 viewing platform). Contrast between affected stands and those that are not results in
lowered scenic integrity.

381

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

The history of use and management is reflected in the developed road systems, mining sites, and scenery.
The following figure depicts a typical view within the project area that ranges from naturally appearing to
modified or managed. Note the power line running through the center of the scene and second growth
clear-cut regeneration to the left. The meadow in the foreground is typical of areas included in grazing
allotments.

Figure 45: A view from within the project area reveals a diverse landscape, representing a mix of natural and
human impacts.

Foreground views in many places are of dense stands of even-aged trees. The effect is reduced visual
penetration into these stands, which contrast with more open stands that can reveal positive landscape
attributes and provide an open park-like condition that is preferable to viewers (Ryan 2005). The
following image depicts such a condition within the Flint Foothills project area.

Landscape Character
Landscape Character is defined as an overall visual and cultural impression of the landscape attributes –
the physical appearance and cultural context of a landscape that gives it an identity and “sense of place”
(USDA Forest Service 1995).
The overall setting provides a scenic backdrop of rugged mountains above what is known as the Southern
Flint Creek Valley, where traditional ranching contributes a pastoral element to the overall character of the
landscape. Lodgepole pine is the most common species on the Forest here, though all local conifers are
represented.

Scenic Attractiveness
Scenic Attractiveness is the “primary indicator of the intrinsic scenic beauty of a landscape and of the
positive responses it evokes in people. It helps determine landscapes that are important for scenic beauty,
based on commonly held perceptions of the beauty of landform, vegetation pattern, composition, surface
water characteristics, and land use patterns and cultural features” (ibid). Scenic Attractiveness is measured
as Class A (Distinctive), B (Typical), or C (Indistinctive). It is important to note that the frame of
reference for scenic attractiveness is the landscape character description (ibid).

383

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Class A includes areas where landform, vegetation patterns, water characteristics, and cultural features
combine to provide unusual, unique, or outstanding scenic quality within the landscape character. Class A
landscapes comprise approximately 5 percent of the project area.
Class B (Typical) contains areas in which the natural and cultural features combine to create ordinary or
common scenic quality. Class B landscapes comprise approximately 61 percent of the project area.
Class C (Indistinctive) contains those areas where natural and cultural features (or the lack thereof)
combine to provide low scenic quality. Class C landscapes comprise approximately 34 percent of the
project area.

Figure 47: Scenic Attractiveness Classes within the project area boundary

Landscape Visibility
Landscape Visibility addresses the relative importance and sensitivity of what is seen and perceived on
the landscape (ibid). Landscape visibility is affected by a number of factors including context of viewers;
duration of view; degree of discernible detail; and number of viewers – all which are subjective and can
vary. In general, the greater the number of people likely to view a landscape and the longer the duration,
384

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

the more sensitive the landscape is to modification. Landscape visibility consists of three elements – how
far the viewer is from the viewing object (distance zone), viewing platforms (such as travelways and use
areas), and the level of concern amongst viewers of the area or object being viewed (as defined by
Concern Level 1 and 2 routes and sites) (ibid).
Distance Zones
The proximity of the viewer to the particular landscape affects the visibility and sensitivity; viewing
distances for this analysis are:
Immediate foreground (0 feet to 300 feet) – Built structures or facilities that serve the public offer
vantage points from which scenery can be experienced from. The scenery management system
regards such elements as “viewing platforms”. Roads and trails are considered viewing platforms, and
are normally (as expected) visible in this immediate foreground.
Foreground (FG) - Views from 300 feet to one-half mile as seen from viewing platform.
Middleground (MG) - Views from one-half mile to 4 miles from viewing platform.
Background (BG) - Views 4 miles and greater from viewing platform (ibid)
Concern Level 1 and 2 Routes and Sites
Of particular concern to landscape visibility are travel ways such as primary highways and trails, as well
as primary use areas such as campgrounds. The Scenery Management System identifies such features as
Concern Level (CL) 1 and 2 viewing platforms. The Forest Plan identifies these CL 1 and 2 viewing
platforms for the BDNF (Appendix A).
•

Concern Level 1 - Generally includes all seen areas from primary travel routes, use areas, and
water bodies where the forest visitors have a high interest in scenic qualities.

Phillipsburg, Drummond, Maxville, Garrison, Grant Kohrs Ranch, and Deerlodge are Concern Level 1
areas that surround the project area boundary; however, there are no CL 1 routes, areas, or sites within the
project area. The Forest Plan identifies Montana Highway 1 (The Pintler Scenic Loop) that runs north to
south along the west aspect (but outside) of the project area boundary, and Interstate Highway 90 that runs
northwest to southeast along the north and west aspect (but outside) of the project area boundary as CL 1
routes. Views into the project area from either of these routes are seen as background distance zone views
(i.e., 4 or more miles from view point). Refer to Figure 42 and Figure 43 for images of views looking
towards the project area from these two routes.
•

Concern Level 2 (CL 2) - Generally includes all seen areas from primary travel routes, use
areas, and water bodies where the forest visitors have a moderate interest in scenic qualities or
low interest in scenic qualities if the area receives moderate to high use.

There are approximately 37 miles of CL 2 routes (identified in the Forest Plan) within the project area
boundary. Segments of these specific routes include National Forest System (NFS) roads 707, 302, 78615,
1557, 636 and 1544. Douglas cabin, located within the project area boundary is considered a CL2 site.
The following Figure 48 depicts the concern routes and sites listed previously that are near the project
area boundary.

Existing Scenic Integrity
Existing Scenic Integrity (ESI) is the measure of the degree to which a landscape is visually perceived to
be complete. The highest scenic integrity ratings are given to those landscapes that have little or no
deviation from the character valued by constituents for its aesthetic appeal. Scenic integrity is used to
describe an existing situation (as with ESI), or can be applied as a standard for management. When used
as a standard for management, it is a Scenic Integrity Objective (SIO), a topic that is explained in detail
under Resource Goals and Objectives (USDA Forest Service 1995). Existing scenic integrity within the
project area ranges from Low to High. The following list and images help describe these ranges.

386

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

High – Human activities are not visually evident. Activities may only repeat attributes of form, line, color,
and texture found in the existing attributes, qualities or traits of a landscape that give it an image and
make it identifiable or unique.
A portion of the Dolus Lakes IRA as seen in the figure below offers the only consistent High ESI setting
within the project area boundary. Scenes of unmanaged landscape settings such as this are not typical
within the project area boundary.

Figure 49: Example of High ESI. View along southeastern portion of the project area boundary looking south
towards a portion of the Dolus Lakes IRA.

Moderate – Human activities are evident but are visually subordinate to the attributes of the existing
landscape character. They may repeat form, line, color or texture common to these characters but changes
in quality, size, number, intensity, etc. must remain visually subordinate to the attributes, qualities or traits
of a landscape that give it an image and make it identifiable or unique. The following figure serves as an
example of Moderate ESI from within the project area boundary.

Figure 50: Example of Moderate ESI. View from within the project area along FS Road 707 (Concern Level 2
route).

387

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Note that the past harvest activity in the upper right aspect of the landscape is evident. However, its
physical qualities closely match those of the natural openings within its surroundings, and the size of the
effect is subordinate to the overall landscape setting. This view is typical of the landscape settings within
the project area boundary.
Low – Human activities of vegetative and landform alterations may dominate the original, natural
landscape character, but should appear as natural occurrences when viewed at background distances.
Note the utility line and its corridor as it cuts through the hillside. Though this human activity his highly
evident and dominates this foreground distance zone view, it would likely be unnoticeable to the casual
observer when viewed as a background distance zone feature (i.e., four or more miles away from
observer). Occurrences of such views are common within the project area boundary.

Figure 51: Example of Low ESI. Photo taken from within the project area along FS Road 1544 (Concern Level
2 route).

Desired Condition
The 2009 BDNF Land and Resource Management Plan (Forest Plan) lists elements of its desired
condition on page 11. The one that relates most closely to recreation and scenery states, “Visitors benefit
from a range of primitive to developed recreation settings and opportunities. Most of the BDNF continues
to offer uncrowded motorized and non-motorized backcountry opportunities.”

Environmental Consequences
Methodology
This analysis was completed using ArcMap and relevant Geographic Information System (GIS) data
layers from the Forest. Global Positioning System (GPS) tools were used to collect point data during a 3day site visit during summer 2011. A photo record to support existing conditions analysis was created as a
result of this site visit as well, and is included as digital files in the project record. GIS data and tools, and
field records were used in combination to determine visibility of proposed treatment activities.

388

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

The potential impacts to scenery resources from the proposed project were determined based on the site
visits to the CL 1 and 2 routes and sites within and outside of the project area, review of photos of the
project area, use of GIS and GPS data, and review of similar projects.

Forest Plan Direction
The Forest manages the scenery of its lands using concepts described under the Scenery Management
System. Standards from the Forest Plan give a strict or specific set of expectations to ensure a properly
managed resource.
Standards for Scenic Resources
Standards for scenic resources are found on page 33 of the Forest Plan. A summary of these standards as
they pertain to the proposed action follows.
Standard 1: Where no minimum SIO’s are identified by landscape or management area – prior to the
completion of a forestwide scenic integrity map – the objectives for scenery shall be determined by
procedures outlined in the Landscape Aesthetics Handbook, Agricultural Handbook No. 701. The
analysis shall use the Scenic Concern Level List in Appendix A, Scenic Attractiveness GIS layer, and
the Scenery Integrity Level Matrix below.
The forestwide SIO map has been completed and this layer is included in the GIS library as well as
presented in Figure 52 below.

Figure 52: Scenic Integrity Objectives within the project area boundary

389

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

For both the Flint Foothills and Flint Uplands MAs, the appropriate SIO is High for areas visible from CL
1 viewing platforms in the foreground and middleground viewing distances, and Moderate in the
background viewing distance. For areas visible from CL 2 viewing platforms within the Flint Foothills
MA, the SIO is Moderate in the foreground and middleground viewing distances. For areas visible from
CL 2 viewing platforms within the Flint Uplands MA, the SIO in all viewing distances is Moderate.
Moderate and High SIO are described in the glossary of the Forest Plan as:
o Moderate – Human activities must remain visually subordinate to the attributes of the
existing landscape character. They may repeat form, line, color, texture common to these
characteristics but changes in quality, size, number intensity, etc. must remain visually
subordinate to the attributes, quality or traits of a landscape that give it an image and
make it identifiable or unique.
o High- Human activities are not evident. Activities may only repeat attributes of form,
line, color and texture found in the existing attributes, qualities or traits of landscape that
give it an image and make it identifiable or unique.

Standard 2: “Projects in non-motorized and summer backcountry allocations would be designed to meet
a minimum SIO of Moderate…” This standard does not apply since no activity is proposed in such
areas.
Standard 3: “Projects in the foreground of scenic byways, national scenic trails, or wild and scenic rivers
would be designated to meet the SIO of at least high. This standard does not apply.
Concern Level 1 and 2 viewing platforms (routes from where effects to scenery resources are analyzed)
are found in Appendix A of the Forest Plan.

Assumptions
•

Analysis assumes all best management practices, project design features, or mitigation
measures identified under each alterative area applied.

•

All geospatial data provided by the Forest and District was accurate and the best available.

Spatial and Temporal Context for Effects Analysis
Effects to the scenery resource occur where evidence of activity can be seen. The spatial context for this
analysis consists of the project area as viewed from the identified CL1 and CL2 routes and sites.
With regard to temporal context for effects to scenic resources, short term refers to the first 5-year period,
beginning when all harvesting, slash treatment activities, temporary road decommissioning/obliteration,
and all other project activities in an area are complete. Long term refers to time that exceeds 5 years.

390

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Figure 53: Example of short-term effects that are within the treatment timeframe. Photos from current activity
within the project area boundary.

After 5 years, “green up” is beginning to occur. That is, vegetative recovery starts to mask the visible
effects associated with activity disturbances such as stumps left from cut trees, track and tire imprints
embedded in the soil, blackened ground caused by burning, and imprint of closed and re-vegetated
temporary roads. Some areas may meet adopted SIOs upon project completion; others may need time for
vegetative recovery before the management objective is reached.

green-up period. This photo is from past activity within the project area boundary.

391

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Alternative 1 – No Action
Direct and Indirect Effects
No direct effects to scenery would result from selection of the no action alternative. Under this
alternative, there would be no salvage harvest of dead and dying trees or other vegetation management
activities.
The existing condition would prevail, and current trends would likely continue. The mountain pine beetle
is affecting the vegetation of the project area and the surrounding area. This activity would continue to
affect the scenery into the future, resulting in additional dead and dying trees, demonstrated by red
needles and bare, dead stems.
The high mortality of lodgepole pine and the resulting presence of trees with an obvious reddish color,
seen in small pockets and large swaths throughout the landscape, would increase and have negative
effects on the scenery resource within the project area. The landscape character ranges from appearing
intact to slightly altered, depending on the number of dead trees visible. In the immediate foreground and
foreground viewing distances, however, the amount of dead trees can often dominate the viewshed and
landscape character, negatively affecting the scenic integrity.
Cumulative Effects
This alternative results in no direct effects to scenic resources. It is expected that current conditions would
persist, resulting in dead and failing trees. As trees fail, they may expose activities and effects of past,
ongoing, and reasonably foreseeable future activities that are now screened from view by vegetation. This
increased visibility of these effects combined with the loss of green trees on a large scale may negatively
affect scenic integrity.
Summary of Effects
The quality of the landscape character and existing scenic integrity is expected to deteriorate over time as
evidence of the large-scale beetle killed stands of trees within the project area becomes more prevalent.

Alternative 2 – Proposed Action
Design Features and Mitigation Measures
When implemented, the following measures would ensure the proposed action meets all scenery related
standards and guidelines, as well as minimize short term impacts.
•

Visible stumps within 100 feet of Concern Level 2 routes should be cut to a maximum stump
height of 6 inches. This applies more specifically to units with edges that are directly adjacent to
the following routes within the project area:
o

•

NFS Road 707, NFS Road 1544, NFS Road 1557 and NFS Road 636.

Clear cut units seen from NFS Road 1544 and NFS Road 1557 would have form and shape that
simulates natural patters (i.e., avoiding straight lines and sharp corners). The edges of such units
would be tied into existing meadows and openings where possible, or provide feathering that
allows gradual transition into the untreated adjacent forest area (as opposed to an abrupt line).

392

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

•

Final layout of units seen from the Concern Level 2 routes listed above shall be reviewed by the
Forest landscape architect.

Direct and Indirect Effects
The direct and indirect effects of the proposed action are measured as appropriate from identified viewing
platforms (i.e. Concern Level 1 and 2 viewing platforms) that exist within and outside of the project area
boundary. As mentioned in the Affected Environment section, viewing platforms within the project area
boundary are comprised of the Concern Level 2 routes identified in the Forest Plan and in the Affected
Environment section. These are routes where the forest visitors have a moderate interest in scenic
qualities or low interest in scenic qualities if the area receives moderate to high use.
Phillipsburg, Drummond, Maxville, Garrison, Grant Kohrs Ranch, Deerlodge are Concern Level 1 areas
that surround the project area boundary but the project area cannot be seen from these locations (refer to
concern level map in Affected Environment section). There are no CL 1 routes, other areas, or sites within
the project area boundary. The portions of the project area where treatment is proposed are not visible
from the CL 1 areas just mentioned due to distance and topography. As mentioned in the Affected
Environment section as well, Montana Highway 1 (The Pintler Scenic Loop) is a CL 1 route that runs
north to south along the west aspect (but outside) of the project area boundary, and Interstate Hwy 90
which runs northwest to southeast along the north and west aspect (but outside) of the project area
boundary. Views into the project area from either of these routes are seen as background distance zone
views (i.e., four or more miles from view point). No effects from these CL1 routes are anticipated because
the distance, topography and sights of landscape patterns associated with the existing visual condition,
would obscure activity from view.
Sections of the following Concern Level 2 routes that were determined to be directly affected by the
proposed actions (since the visible result of actions are expected to be noticed from them) are listed as
follows: NFS Road 707, FR1544, FR636, and NFS Road 1557. No proposed actions (treatments) are
expected to be seen from NFS Road 302 and NFS Road 78615, the remaining CL 2 routes within the
vicinity of the project area. Therefore, no direct, indirect, or cumulative effects are associated with them.
Proposed treatments not identified in the following analysis are not expected to be seen from any Concern
Level 1routes due to factors such as distance and obstruction or screening by terrain features and
vegetation.
The direct and indirect effects of the proposed action are those related to the specific activities proposed.
The following lists the actions proposed (treatment type), the units proposed, the concern level routes
affected, and their anticipated effect on the existing scenic integrity for the landscape setting in which
they are located.
Lodgepole Pine Salvage
This treatment would result in created openings in each of the units, with few, if any, trees remaining.
This would be perceived as a change from the current forested appearance (in spite of nearly all of the
trees in these units being dead). Salvage harvest prescriptions have greater potential to contrast with the
form, texture, line, and color from their natural, unaffected surroundings. These characteristics are
consistent with lower scenic integrity. Project design features were developed to ensure that moderate
scenic integrity is met by salvage harvest treatments seen from Concern Level 2 routes within the affected
environment.
Proposed salvage harvests (including those 40 acres or more in size) are planned for areas in a current
state of lower scenic integrity or quality due to the beetle infestation. The salvage activity would not

393

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

change the existing scenic integrity of these areas in the short term. The overall scenic integrity of treated
areas would improve in the long term as healthy stands replace those that were dead, dying, and removed
under the proposed action.
There are several units proposed for this treatment that would be visible from the identified Concern
Level 2 viewing platforms. Units seen from NFS Road 1544 include: 36, 45S, 69S, and 37S. Units seen
from NFS Road 1557 include 41S, 35S, 16S, 61S, 50S, 26S, 76S, and 49S. Effects of these units are
described below.
Portions of these units would be partially seen from the Concern Level 2 route section they are adjacent
to. Some places along these road sections are likely to have visual screening (where stands of green trees
are) between the road and unit; others would not (where stands of salvage trees are located). Temporary
roads are planned from NFS Road 1557, a Concern Level 2 route that would provide access to units 49S,
61S, 35S, and 41S.
Short-term effects created by activity associated with treatments (such as tractor harvest, and the people
and other equipment needed to accomplish the work) would be visible directly from these associated
Concern Level 2 route sections until treatment is complete. Evidence of the temporary road footprint
would be difficult to see in the long-term, as the road would be obliterated upon project completion. The
created openings as a result of this treatment have the potential to create visual effects that dominate the
setting, but project design features would help to mitigate this. In the long term, after adequate vegetative
regeneration occurs, the resulting visual condition would be consistent with that expected within the
management area and meet the adopted SIO of moderate.
The following provides an estimate for the extent of foreground effects for each unit as seen from the
adjacent Concern Level 2 route as well as other details that may pertain to a specific unit.
Unit 36S - The portion of this unit adjacent to NFS Road 1544 is approximately 0.36 miles in length and
would be partially seen from this road section.
Unit 45S - The portion of this unit adjacent to NFS Road 1544 is approximately 0.36 miles in length and
would be partially seen from this road section.
Unit 40S – The portion of this unit adjacent to NFS Road 1544 is approximately 0.20 miles in length and
flat terrain, combined with vegetation buffer between unit and road, is likely to obscure visibility into the
treatment area; so this unit would be relatively unnoticed. Only haul vehicles are expected to be seen
since treatment is accomplished from other Forest roads that are not identified as having visual concerns.
Scenes of activity from this section of NFS Road 1544 might be noticeable in the background while
treatment occurs.
Unit 69S - The portion of this unit adjacent to NFS Road 1544 is approximately 0.36 miles in length and
would be partially seen from this road section.
Unit 37S - The portion of this unit adjacent to NFS Road 1557 is approximately 500 ft in length and
would be partially seen from this road section.
Unit 41S - The portion of this unit adjacent to NFS Road 1557 is approximately 400 feet in length and
would be partially seen from this road section since it is offset from the roadside by approximately 200 ft.
Units 35S, 16S, 61S, 50S, and 49S – These units are in close proximity to one another and the combined
portion of these units adjacent to NFS Road 1557 is approximately 1.22 miles in length. Portions of all
these units are expected to be visible.

394

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Units 26S and 76S - These units are in close proximity to one another and the combined portion of these
units adjacent to NFS Road1557 is approximately 0.73 miles in length. Most of the direct effects
associated with this treatment method would be unseen, as these units are located on the side of the slope
below NFS Road 1557. An indirect effect is that the quality of the scenic experience is improved along
this road section. Trees in the immediate foreground along this road section currently screen views of the
pastoral landscape setting to the north. Dead and dying trees removed here would reveal these views
more, but Burn unit 7B would be more visible as a result as well. The appearance of Unit 7B would
reflect a landscape setting that has been subjected to fire events of mixed severity.
Commercial Thin
This treatment would result in open stands with increased visual penetration into the stand, and emphasis
on maintaining larger diameter trees. In the long term, larger trees would dominate views in the
foreground, and provide for a coarse-textured tree canopy in middle- and background viewing distances.
By their nature, thinning prescriptions have a lower potential for producing negative scenery effects.
Thinning treatments can be designed to blend in well with their natural, unaffected surroundings as their
forms are obscure, texture and color match the nature surroundings well enough to appear natural, and
lines are difficult to define. These characteristics are consistent with high scenic integrity, and no
mitigations are required.
Units 64C, 60C, 10C and 11C are visible from NFS Road 1557, and unit 22C is seen from NFS Road 707
(both are Concern Level 2 viewing platforms).
Unit 64C spans for approximately 300 feet directly adjacent to NFS Road 1557 where scenery is of
moderate to low concern.
Unit 60C - This unit would be seen along a 0.50-mile (approximate) section of NFS Road 1557 where
scenery is of moderate to low concern. An indirect effect is that the quality of the scenic experience is
improved along this road section. Trees in the immediate foreground along this road section currently
screen views of the pastoral landscape setting to the north. Dead and dying trees removed here would
reveal these views more. Burn unit 8B would be partially visible through the thinned stands as well, but
any resulting evidence of fire treatment would be vague (i.e., darker color contrast than surrounding
landscape).
Units 10C and 11C – These units are located close to one another, and would be seen along a 0.50-mile
(approximate) section of NFS Road 1557 where scenery is of moderate to low concern.
Unit 22C - This unit would be seen along a 0.35-mile (approximate) section of NFS Road 707where
scenery is of moderate to low concern.
This treatment would result in landscape settings with more open, park-like conditions comprised of
larger stands of trees. No temporary roads are planned from this travel route, and activity associated with
treatments (people, and other equipment needed to accomplish the work) would be visible directly from
this section of NFS Road 1557 until treatment is complete. The resulting visual condition would be
consistent with that expected within the management area and meet the adopted SIO of moderate after
project completion and into the long term.
Precommercial Thin
Similar to commercial thinning, the effect of this treatment would be a reduced number of stems per acre,
resulting in increased spacing between trees and increased viewing distance into these stands from the

395

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

adjacent areas. This increase in visual penetration would be slight, due to the form and foliage of the
trees, which still have low-growing branches.
There are several units proposed for this treatment that would be visible from the identified Concern
Level 2 viewing platforms. Units seen from NFS Road 636 include 18P, 19P, 13P and 14P. Units seen
from NFS Road 1557 include 43P and 20P.
These treatments would result in landscape settings with more open, park like conditions comprised of
larger stands of trees. No temporary roads are planned from any of the Concern Level routes for these
treatments, and activity associated with treatments (people, and other equipment needed to accomplish the
work) would be visible directly from these road sections until treatment is complete. The resulting visual
condition would be consistent with that expected within the management area and meet the adopted SIO
of moderate upon project completion and into the long term.
The following provides an estimate for the extent of foreground effects for each unit as seen from the
Concern Level Route they are adjacent to, and other details that may pertain to a specific unit not covered
in the paragraph above.
Units 18P, 19P, 13P and 14P - These units are in the direct vicinity of one another, are located directly
adjacent to NFS Road 636, and affect an approximate one-mile section of this road.
Unit 20P - This unit is located directly adjacent to NFS Road 1557, and totals approximately 0.40 miles of
affected road section.
Seed Tree Harvest
Visual characteristics of this prescription are described in the vegetation resource report for this project as
having widely spaced large-diameter ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir trees (5-15 trees per acre) with
about 400 ponderosa pine seedlings planted per acre. Shrubs and forbs would be common, but low
growing.
Units 65ST and 27ST would be visible from the identified Concern Level 2 viewing platform NFS Road
1557. These units would be seen along a 0.50-mile (approximate) section of NFS Road 1557 where
scenery is of moderate to low concern. The existing condition is already open and park like, with larger
diameter trees dominating the foreground views. The effect of this treatment would not appear much
different from what already exists, with the exception of larger openings or spacing between trees within
the stands. No temporary roads are planned from this travel route, and activity associated with treatments
(such as tractor harvest, the people, and other equipment needed to accomplish the work) would be visible
directly from this section of NFS Road 1557 until treatment is complete. The resulting visual condition
would be consistent with that expected within the management area and meet the adopted SIO of
moderate upon project completion and into the long term.
Prescribed Burn
Prescribed fire is the skillful application of fire to fuels in a definite area under precisely defined
conditions including wind-speed, fuel moisture, soil moisture, and other factors, in order to produce the
intensity of heat and rate of spread required to accomplish specific results (Bacon 1985). Prescribed and
wildfires have the power to change a landscape in ways that cause people to enjoy, dislike, or feel
ambivalent about nature, depending on their personal tastes and cultural background. Aesthetics has the
potential to influence fire management. Public perceptions affect land management plans and influence
national regulations, so it is necessary for managers to consider the visual quality of the landscape
(Fowler 2008).
396

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

There are several units proposed for this treatment that would be visible from one Concern Level 2
viewing platform - NFS Road 707. Effects to these units are described below.
Units 1B, 2B, and 6B – These units are in the same vicinity and have an approximate 200-foot buffer
between NFS Road 707 and the burn unit boundary. The height and density of the vegetative buffer
between the units and road would allow the lower part of these units to be relatively unnoticed by the
public using the road system. However, aspects of treatment along hillsides would be noticeable. Under
this alternative, treated sections within the project area boundary would be restored closer to or within
their natural historic fire regimes—and serve both visually and functionally as a fire adapted ecosystem.
The appearance of the landscape under this alternative would be one that reflects a forest that has been
subjected to fire events of mixed severity. Evidence of crown fires may be apparent but such occurrences
are expected to be infrequent since treatment would occur when weather conditions keep fire severity in
check and closer to the ground. “Green up” or vegetation regeneration that would occur within a natural
timeframe would enhance scenic quality.
No temporary roads are proposed for these units. This activity is consistent with practices for
management or use within the management area, and both short- and long-term effects would result in
meeting the adopted scenic integrity objective of moderate.
Cumulative Effects
This section of the report will consider the cumulative effects of the Flint Foothills Vegetation
Management Project and past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions on scenic resources. A
master list of past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions was created for this project and the
analysis of cumulative effects. For this resource analysis, the master list was further refined (refined list),
narrowing the master list to include those actions that are likely to have an effect on scenic resources. The
refined list can be found in the project record.
The refined list includes only actions that are within the identified Cumulative Effects Analysis Area
(CEAA) for scenic resources. Some actions in the refined list do not include descriptions of the action,
and were not included in the analysis of cumulative effects for scenic resources. The actions include:
BLM – Timber Harvest; Fill-in or Replant Trees; Fireline Construction; Plant Trees; Private – Land
Development; Private – Ranching/Farming; Public Lands Travel Management; Seed Tree Final Cut; Seed
Tree Prepatory Cut; State – State Prison Lands; State DNRC – Jackpot Pile Burn; State DNRC – Salvage
Harvest; and State DNRC – Selection Harvest.
The projects on the refined list were then analyzed, and the effects of these actions on scenic resources
were briefly described. These effects were assigned a Scenic Integrity Level(s) based on the scenic
integrity resulting from the action, or no change. From that effect call, the potential for cumulative effects
was identified.
Ongoing Effects of Past Actions
The ongoing effects of past actions include the introduction of forms, textures, patterns, and colors which
may contrast with the desired landscape character. Past actions in the CEAA include tree removal
activities (including various types of timber harvest and other treatments on different ownerships such as
improvement cuts, fuel breaks, group selection cuts, non-commercial firewood gathering, liberation cuts,
overstory removal cuts, patch clearcuts, permanent land clearing, precommercial thinning, salvage cuts,
seed tree harvests, shelterwood harvests, single tree harvests, commercial thinning, and stand clearcuts),
non-recreation special uses (such as the BPA powerline and electronic sites and facilities), brush and slash
disposal (including burning of piled materials, compacting and crushing of fuels, piling of fuels by hand

397

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

or machine, rearrangement of fuels, slashing – pre-site preparation, yarding – removal of fuels by carrying
or dragging), non-recreation special uses (including BPA power line, private road use, other utility
corridors, electronic/telecommunication sites, snotel sites), prescribed fire (including broadcast burning
covering a majority of the unit, jackpot burning, site preparation for natural regeneration by burning, low
intensity underburn over a majority of the unit), mining, private land activities (land development,
ranching/farming), livestock grazing, recreation (developed, undeveloped, and special uses), travel
management, road and trail construction/reconstruction/maintenance, treatement area site preparation for
regeneration and planting (including by burning, manual, or mechanical manipulation methods), and
wildland fire. The effects of these actions are limited by their scope and visibility beyond the
immediate surrounding area, as well as changes that have occurred over time to reduce effects, such
as regeneration, and recovery of vegetation generally that would have the potential to reduce color,
form, pattern, and texture contrasts. The rural/pastoral development and activities that occur on
private lands is visible but consistent with viewers’ expectations.

Exceptions to this include the BPA power line that traverses the CEAA, which can dominate views in
foreground and middleground viewing distances, but is not evident generally in the background
viewing distance from CL 1 and 2 viewing platforms. Some roads are visible but generally remain
subordinate to the existing landscape character in middleground and background viewing distances
from CL 1 and 2 viewing platforms. In addition, tree removal actions have resulted in effects that range
from dominating the existing landscape character to remaining subordinate to the landscape character in
the foreground and middleground viewing distances, but the effects are not evident as management
actions generally in background viewing distances. Slash disposal activities can dominate the viewshed in
the short term from foreground viewing distances, depending on the size of the piles. However, once the
piles have been disposed of, the effects of disposal are generally short term.
Effects of Present and Future Actions
Present and future actions in the CEAA are and are anticipated to include tree removal on various
ownerships (commercial thinning, improvement cuts, non-commercial firewood gathering, salvage cuts),
brush and slash disposal (piling of fuels by hand or machine and slashing – pre-site preparation), private
land activities (including land development, ranching/farming), roads and trails
construction/reconstruction/maintenance, mining, non-recreation special uses (BPA powerline, private
road use, utility corridors, electronic/telecommunication sites, snotel sites), livestock grazing, recreation
(developed, undeveloped, special uses), and wildland fire.
Similar to the discussion above regarding the effects of present actions, the effects of tree removal
activities, mining, non-recreation special, brush and slash disposal, and wildland fire have the potential
for the greatest impact to scenic resources, as they are more likely to result in a Low Scenic Integrity
Level, depending on viewing distance and other site specific factors. Effects associated with recreation
and rural/pastoral private land uses are generally accepted by visitors and consistent with their
expectations. Effects associated with wildland fire can dominate the landscape character. Mitigation
measures to limit the effects of tree removal, slash disposal, mining actions can be effective, resulting in
reduced impacts and potentially higher SILs depending on viewing conditions. However, actions which
include built structures (such as those included in non-recreation special uses) can be expected to visibly
persist into the long-term as intended. The result is that the effects of these actions may result in Low to
Moderate SILs depending on viewing distance and other factors.
Cumulative Effects of Alternative 2 – Proposed Action
As displayed in the refined list and described above, the effects of many of the past, ongoing, and
reasonably foreseeable future actions meet or are expected to meet SILs ranging from Low to High,
398

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

depending on viewing conditions and position. In those cases where the resulting SIL is Low, it may be
due to the recent nature of the action, proximity to the viewing platform, or size/scope of the action.
These include tree removal, mining, non-recreation uses, and brush and slash disposal actions. To this
end, much of the tree removal, with the exception of the roadside hazard tree removal project, is more
than 10 years old, and the last clearcut (which has the greatest potential to affect scenic resources) was
approximately 10 years ago. Some of the remnants of older mining activities include structures or effects
that can generally have a positive effect on scenic resources, contributing to the sense of place. The utility
corridors for the BPA power line and others remain, but the effects are limited to a degree by the fact that
it is screened from view in many background viewing positions. It is still visible from much of the
surrounding area, depending on viewing conditions.
The greatest amount and extent of the activity in the CEAA occurred between 1960 and 2000, and many
of the effects of these activities have dissipated or have been accepted as a part of the landscape by forest
visitors. As a result there are few areas which meet the SIL of Low outside of the foreground viewing
distance. As such, the combined effect of these past and ongoing actions has been limited and the naturalappearing landscape dominates in most viewing distances and from most viewing platforms and
positions. It is anticipated that the effects of the reasonably foreseeable future actions will have a similar
result, allowing for the natural-appearing landscape to be maintained.
The effects of the proposed action will be visible generally in foreground and middleground viewing
distances from within or in close proximity to the forest boundary. The effects of the project will be
minimal in background views from identified CL 1 viewing platforms due to viewing distance and the
effects of the treatment types involved. However, as stated above regarding the natural-appearing
landscape and the type and extent of the persisting effects of past activity in the area that may result in
lowered scenic integrity, the likelihood for adverse cumulative effects resulting from this proposed action
is minimal. It is anticipated that the existing SILs will be maintained, and that the proposed action will
meet the Forest Plan standards for scenic resources.
Summary of Effects
The visual condition would result in landscape settings that directly, indirectly, and cumulatively, remain
consistent with the Scenic Integrity Objectives and standards prescribed to the project area by the BDNF
Land and Resource Management Plan (2009).

Alternative 3
Direct and Indirect Effects
The direct and indirect effects to scenery as stated under the proposed action are the same for alternative
3. For units seen from CL 2 routes within the affected environment, alternative 3 proposes the same
treatment prescriptions, at the same places, and employs the same harvest methods. There is one
difference in what is proposed in terms of effects to scenery, and that is clear-cut salvage unit 41S. Under
alternative 3, no temporary road is proposed to access the unit; therefore, no short-term effects from
temporary road obliteration are anticipated.
Cumulative Effects
For units seen from CL 2 routes within the affected environment, alternative 3 proposes the same
treatment prescriptions, at the same places, and employs the same harvest methods. The cumulative
effects to scenery as stated under the proposed action are the same as stated for alternative 2.

399

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Summary of Effects
The visual condition would result in landscape settings that directly, indirectly, and cumulatively, remain
consistent with the Scenic Integrity Objectives and standards prescribed to the project area by the BDNF
Land and Resource Management Plan (2009).

Other Relevant Mandatory Disclosures
There are no other relevant mandatory disclosures for alternative 2 or alternative 3 connected to the
Scenery Resources in the Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Project.

Compliance with Forest Plan and Other Relevant Laws, Regulations, Policies and Plans
The proposed action meets the goals, objectives, and standards outlined in the 2009 BDNF Revised Land
and Resource Management Plan.
All proposed activity seen from CL 2 platforms, are in a Moderate SIO management objective. No
activity is seen from CL 1 platforms, or in areas that have a High SIO management objective.
In some cases, Scenic Integrity Objectives would not be met immediately after management activities
have been completed, but would be met at some point in the future. It is important to note that the Forest
Plan (per direction provided by the Scenery Management System) does not attach timeframes to meeting
Scenic Integrity Objectives. Instead, timeframes for meeting Scenic Integrity Objectives are disclosed in
the project scenic resources analysis. Since all Scenic Integrity Objectives would be met, the project is
consistent with the Forest Plan scenic resources standards (Forest Plan p. 33).
Alternatives 2 and 3 meet the goals, objectives, and standards outlined in the 2009 BDNF Revised Land
and Resource Management Plan. Landscapes where actions are proposed, would meet their scenic
integrity objectives, if not upon project completion, in the future as described in the effects analysis.

Heritage Resources
Introduction
This analysis examines the Heritage/Cultural Resources within the project area and discusses how these
resources may be affected by the proposed activities. Cultural Resources are the physical remains of past
human activities (e.g., artifacts, burials, pictographs, Native American ceremonial sites, and the remains
of mining, logging, ranching and other historic activities) having scientific, prehistoric, or social values.

Affected Environment
Existing Condition
As a result of past cultural resources inventory within the Flint Foothills analysis area, 25 cultural
properties were identified and recorded and three site leads were noted. One prehistoric site and 24
historic sites are recorded within the analysis area. The one prehistoric site is a pictograph. The other sites
in the analysis area are historic. Seventeen historic sites are associated with historic mining activity, five
log cabins, one logging activity sites, one historic Forest Service administration site, and one historic
mining district. Most importantly, sixteen historic sites have cabin remains and/ wooden structural
remains present. Twenty-five sites were formally recorded but only two were formally evaluated for
significance in consultation with the Montana State Historic Preservation Office.

401

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Environmental Consequences
Methodology
Heritage personnel use three types of inventory strategies for this project: existing data review, sample
survey, and intensive survey. Existing data review includes a basic literature review to identify previous
archaeological and historic research done in the area and to determine what information previous work
may have revealed. A wide array of standard references were reviewed, including the National Record of
Historic Places, the Montana State Historic Preservation Plan, General Land Office Plats, Homestead
Entry Surveys, Mineral Surveys, land status maps, historic Forest Service maps and professional reports,
and historic monographs directly related to the archaeology and history of the Flint Foothills area.
The following documentary references were consulted for information bearing on the prehistoric and
historic human use of the project area.
•

The National Register of Historic Places

•

The Montana State Historic Preservation Plan

•

The Beaverhead Unit and Deerlodge Unit cultural site atlases, cultural site files and records of
previous archaeological surveys

•

General Land Office (GLO) Plats

•

Homestead Entry Surveys

•

Mineral Surveys

•

Relevant books, articles, professional monographs on the history and prehistory of
southwestern Montana and historic maps.

An examination of the existing Beaverhead-Deerlodge Heritage Program records provided information on
the number and type of previously recorded cultural resource inventories and cultural sites within the
analysis area. All inventories were primarily project compliance related in advance of a number of
proposed federal undertakings including: timber sales, small range improvements (fences, water
developments), and mining exploration and development.
Sample survey is based on the Site Identification Strategy (SIS) found in the Region I Programmatic
Agreement (PA) and within the SIS is the Stratified Survey Standards (SSS). For “analysis level” (Code
of Federal Regulations 800.4.b(1)) undertakings, such as the Flint Foothills project, Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA ), compliance may be completed using a sampling (as defined
from Secretary of Interior Standards and Guidelines) and monitoring strategies in High-Probability areas.
At the Section 106 compliance level Heritage Resource personnel will implement the SSS model for their
survey methodology for specific Areas of Potential Effect (APE). The Intensive survey is a complete
pedestrian examination of an entire project area of potential effect to locate and record all cultural
resources. Heritage personnel would walk a compass or GPS oriented transects spaced every 20 meters
for the intensive survey.
Stratification Standards and Guidelines
Archaeologists may employ a stratified sample survey for all forest undertakings where the project Area
of Potential Effect is in excess of 100 acres. The stratification will include 100 percent survey of all High
Probability areas, 30 percent coverage of all Moderate Probability areas, and 10 percent of all Low

402

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Probability areas. Probability areas are based on qualified intuitive assumptions. Therefore, the
stratification of those probability areas is not firmly fixed and adjustments are easily made in the field.
During the 2011 and 2012 field seasons Heritage personnel completed an existing data review, sample
survey and intensive field inventory to complete the salvage, commercial thinning, seed tree and
prescribed burn units. The precommercial thinning units would not be surveyed by Heritage personnel.
Based on the SIS, Heritage personnel determined the precommercial thinning would have no potential to
cause effects on historic properties (CFR 800.3(a)(1) and CFR 800.16(y). There is no ground disturbing
activity proposed and the felling of small diameter trees would not affect cultural resources.
Sites identified in the project area will be avoided and/or site specific mitigation measures would be
developed in consultation with the Montana State Historic Preservation Office prior to project
implementation.
Incomplete and Unavailable Information
Cultural resource surveys were completed for the timber, commercial thinning, and prescribed burn units.
The precommercial units were not surveyed because based on the SIS Heritage personnel determined the
precommercial thinning would have no potential to cause effects on historic properties (CFR 800.3(a)(1)
and CFR 800.16(y). There is no ground disturbing activity proposed and the felling of small diameter
trees would not affect cultural resources.
Spatial and Temporal Context for Effects Analysis
The spatial context used for direct and indirect effects is limited to the areas of potential effect which are
all salvage, commercial thin, seed tree, and prescribed burn treatment units, landings, new road
construction, temporary road construction, and existing road reconstruction.
Cultural sites will be avoided or site-specific mitigation will be developed in consultation with the MT
State Historic Preservation Office, therefore, the various proposed project activity timeframes will not
affect cultural resources. There are no temporal effects identified.
Past, Present, and Reasonably Foreseeable Activities Relevant to Cumulative Effects Analysis
No past or reasonably foreseeable activities would affect cultural resources. For a full list of, present and
reasonably foreseeable activities in the project area, see Appendix D.

Alternative 1 – No Action
Direct, Indirect and Cumulative Effects
Under alternative 1, there would be no direct or indirect effects to heritage resources from the Flint
Foothills Vegetation Management Project because no project activities are proposed.
There are no known reasonably foreseeable actions that would reduce the heritage resource database.
Other management activities that would occur in this area would need cultural resource field inventory.

403

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Alternative 2 and Alternative 3
Direct and Indirect Effects
Under both alternative 2 and 3 there would be no direct effects to cultural resources because the area of
potential effect which is the proposed activity areas including timber units (salvage, commercial thin, and
seed tree), prescribed burn units, landings, temporary road construction, new road construction, and
existing road reconstruction would be surveyed and sites identified prior to project implementation. Sites
would be avoided and mitigation measures would be developed in consultation with the Montana State
Historic Preservation Office as stipulated by the Region 1 Programmatic Agreement and in accordance
with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. Mitigation measures are provided in chapter
2. These mitigation measures have proven effective in the past on wildfires, managed fires and prescribed
fires on the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest. Over the past 20 years, no heritage resources or
cultural sites have been affected where these measures have been implemented (personal communication,
Joe Sampson 02/28/2012).
There would be no direct effect associated with the spring or fall prescribed burning in the commercial
thin and seed tree units because heritage personnel would field-inventory the entire unit, and the trees
would be whole tree yarded to a landing reducing the fuel component within the units. Fire intensity
would be less and the method of burning would be ground based so sites would be more visible, and sites
would be avoided and/or mitigation measures would be developed in consultation with the MT State
Historic Preservation Office prior to project implementation.
There would be no indirect effects for all the timber harvest units (salvage, commercial thin, and seed
tree), prescribe burn units, and the prescribed burning of the commercial thin and seed tree units for the
action alternatives because sites would be avoided and mitigation measures would be developed in
consultation with the MT State Historic Preservation Office.
Cumulative Effects
Because cultural sites would be avoided and/or mitigation measures would be developed in consultation
with the MT State Historic Preservation Office prior to project implementation there would be no
cumulative effects for either alternative.

Compliance with Forest Plan and Other Relevant Laws, Regulations, Policies and Plans
All of the alternatives are compliant with the 2009 Forest Plan (USDA 2009) and compliant with relevant
federal laws and regulations. Alternative 1 is compliant with the above mentioned regulations because
there are no proposed project activities that would affect cultural resources, Sites with project activities
for the action alternatives have been or would be surveyed, and sites would be avoided or mitigation
measures would be developed in consultation with the Montana State Historic Preservation Office.

Economics and Social Science
Introduction
The management of the natural resources on the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest (BDNF) has the
potential to affect local economies. People and economies are an important part of the ecosystem. Use of
resources and recreational visitation to the national forests generate employment and income in the
surrounding communities and counties. They also generate revenues returned to the Federal treasury or
used to fund additional on-the-ground activities to accomplish resource management objectives.
This section presents concepts used to delineate an affected area and describes the methods and results of
analyzing the economic effects of the project, including project feasibility, financial efficiency, and
economic impacts. Project feasibility and financial efficiency relate to the costs and revenues of doing the
action. Economic impacts relate to how the action affects the local economy in the surrounding area.
The Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Project is located on the Pintler Ranger District of the BDNF
and includes portions of both Granite and Powell Counties, Montana. Since these are the two counties
that would be most affected by the project in terms of social and economic effects, the Affected
Environment section focuses on these two counties.
The combination of small towns and rural settings, along with people from a wide variety of backgrounds,
provides a diverse social environment for the geographical region around the BDNF, including the Pintler
Ranger District. Local residents pursue a wide variety of life-styles but many share a common theme—an
orientation to the outdoors and natural resources. This is reflected in both vocational and recreational
pursuits including employment in logging and milling operations, outfitter and guide businesses, hiking,
hunting, fishing, camping, and many other recreational activities.
Timber, tourism, and agricultural industries are important to the economy of local areas. Despite the
common concern for, and dependence on, natural resources within the local communities, social attitudes
vary widely with respect to their management. Local residents hold a broad spectrum of perspectives and
preferences ranging from complete preservation to maximum development and utilization of natural
resources.
Timber management activities within the project area have the potential to impact the economic
conditions of local communities and counties.

Regulatory Framework
The preparation of NEPA documents is guided by CEQ regulations for implementing NEPA [40 CFR
1500-1508]. NEPA requires that consequences to the human environment be analyzed and disclosed. The
extent to which these environmental factors are analyzed and discussed is related to the nature of public
comments received during scoping. NEPA does not require a monetary benefit-cost analysis. If an agency
prepares an economic efficiency analysis, then one must be prepared and displayed for all alternatives [40
CFR 1502.23].
OMB Circular A-94 promotes efficient resource use through well-informed decision making by the
Federal Government. It suggests agencies prepare an efficiency analysis as part of project decision
making and prescribes “present net value” as the criterion for the efficiency analysis.

405

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

The development of timber sale programs and individual timber sales is guided by agency direction found
in Forest Service Manual (FSM) 2430. Forest Service Handbook (FSH) 2409.18 guides the financial and,
if applicable, economic efficiency analysis for timber sales.
Many of the costs and benefits associated with a project are not quantifiable in financial terms. For
example, the benefit to wildlife from habitat improvement from a project designed to maintain forests in a
mosaic of diverse species and age classes resilient to insects and disease is not quantifiable in financial
terms. These costs and benefits are described qualitatively in the indicated resource sections of this
document. Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations for NEPA (40 CFR 1502.23) indicates:
For the purposes of complying with the Act, the weighing of the merits and drawbacks of the
various alternatives need not be displayed in a monetary cost-benefit analysis and should not be
when there are qualitative considerations.

Analysis Area
The Flint Foothills Vegetation Management project area is on the Pintler Ranger District of the BDNF and
is located approximately 6 miles southeast from Drummond and 28 miles northwest of Deer Lodge,
straddling the Granite and Powell county line. To estimate the potential effect on jobs and income, a zone
of influence (or economic impact area) was delineated. The impact area was chosen using suggested
USDA Forest Service protocols for delineating economic impact areas (Meti Corp 2010), which bases the
selection of the impact area on commuting data and where the timber is likely to be processed (log flows).
This analysis suggested that Granite and Powell Counties, Montana were the appropriate counties to
include in the economic impact analysis area.

Issue Indicators
Three indicators and their analysis methods were selected to compare how well the alternatives are
expected to meet the purpose and need Table 100.

Affected Environment
Methodology
Socioeconomic measures used to describe the affected environment were obtained from the Headwater
Economics’ Economic Profile System – Human Dimensions Toolkit (EPS-HDT 2011), which compiles
and summarizes primary population and economic data from a variety of government sources into county,
multi-county or state reports. Key measures used in this report include land ownership, population,
employment and income. Relevant excerpts from the recent Social Assessment of the Beaverhead
Deerlodge National Forest written by Northern Economics (2002) are also provided to describe social
conditions and preferences. Because one commenter requested consideration of national and state level
polls revealing attitudes towards logging national forests, several pertinent polls are also presented.
Abundant additional information is available in the Eastern Montana National Forest Economic

Assessment written by Stockmann and Stewart (2002). All of these documents are located in the project
record or through the publically available EPS-HDT at http://headwaterseconomics.org/tools/eps-hdt.

Land Ownership
More than half of the land area encompassed by the two-county impact area is managed by various public
agencies, with 55% of the 2.6 million acres being federally owned and an additional 5% is owned by the
state. The Forest Service manages around 1.3 million acres, or 50% of the land area within the impact
area. Granite County has the larger share of Federal public lands (63.2%), and Powell County has the
smaller amount (49.7%). By comparison, only 20.6% of the land area of the United States is publicly
owned (Figure 55).

Payments from federal lands were responsible for 8.0% of Granite County’s government revenues during
2007. This was roughly half the dependence that Powell County had on federal land payments that year,
when about 15.6% of all their revenues came from Secure Rural Schools and Community Self
Determination Funding, PILT and a few other programs.

Population and Demographic Change
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the population of Granite County grew 13.9 % between 1990 and
2009, while the population of Powell County grew by 6.8% over the same time period (Table 101).
Population growth in both the state and the nation outpaced the change observed in these two counties
(USDC 2008).
Sources of population growth in both counties were relatively similar from 2000-2009, where both
counties saw roughly two-thirds of new residents from natural growth (births-deaths) and one third from
migration.

Employment
From 1970 to 2009,when the Standard Industrial Classification System was used to describe the economy,
total employment for full- and part-time jobs increased by 61% in Granite County (from 1,139 to 1,835)
and increased by 42% in Powell County (from 2,576 to 3,666). The State of Montana saw an increase in
total employment of 107.8%, averaging roughly 2.8% annually, over this same period (USDC 2011).
State employment growth was largely due to increases in service and professional sector employment
(including retail trade, health and social services, transportation, utilities, finance, education, etc.).
Employment in the two-county impact area has consistently increased since 1970. The higher increase in
employment was in Granite County, which experienced a 1.6% average annual rise in employment from
1970 to 2009 (Table 103). The lower increase was in Powell County with 1.1% average annual growth.

National and regional trends in industry sectors influence the ability of communities to adapt to changing
circumstances (Northern Economics 2002). Employment in extractive industries such as timber and
mining, as well as in ranching and agriculture, is declining in western Montana. Projections indicate

408

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

continued declines in employment in these areas. Although the differences between today’s national forest
timber sale program and the program that was in place a decade or so ago have changed, the role that
timber production from NFS lands plays in national and regional economies through logging and related
activities has existed for a considerable time period and is integral to local communities and individuals
directly employed by them.
During 2009, both counties had roughly 9% of employment in agriculture, which were twice the Montana
proportion and roughly five times the national proportion. Granite County had more than 28% and Powell
County has just fewer than 23% of their 2009 jobs in sectors associated with travel and tourism. In
addition, service jobs composed a larger portion of private employment in Granite County, with contrasts
with Powell County where government jobs (34.2% many associated with the Montana State Prison)
represented a larger share of employment than in Granite County, where on 14.9% of jobs were attributed
to government. For Montana in general, the earnings from jobs in services at $32,145/year are lower than
those in government, which average $41,221/year. For comparison, Forestry and Logging jobs paid an
average of $31,239/year and wood products manufacturing jobs averaged $31,090/year for the twocounties.
The BDNF is a major employer and landholder in southwestern Montana. Consequently, Forest Service
budget reductions and policies impact employment opportunities throughout the region. Jobs in the
government sector decreased between 1990 and 2000 by 7.8% (from 34.2 to 26.4%) in Powell County but
only by 0.3 % (from 30 to 29.7%) in Granite County. There have been changes in the forest timber sale
program over the past 15 years as objectives have changed and timber harvest levels have declined.
Although the timber output amounts to only 1 % of industry outputs in Powell County, the community of
Deer Lodge (i.e., Sun Mountain Lumber) still relies heavily on timber processing for employment. While
27% of the industry output for Granite County came from the timber industry, the county relies heavily on
private sources of timber products. The Forest Plan EIS (USDA Forest Service 2009b, page 196) contains
information about forest resource related industries and services and the declining trends in extractive
industries such as timber.
Although the portion of all timber-related jobs was down from 22.4% during 1998 to 17.0 % by 2009, the
portion of the economy this represents was still far greater in the Flint Foothills economic impact area
than the Montana state average. Of the 4,123 jobs in the state, representing 1.2% of the total jobs during
2009, 247 of these were located in Granite (45 or 9.5% of all private employment) and Powell (202 or
20.7% of all private employment). For Granite County the majority of these jobs were in harvesting (35)
whereas in Powell County although harvesting accounted for 88 jobs, sawmills contributed more with 112
jobs in 2009. Roughly 4 jobs, 2 in each county, were attributed to other wood products manufacturing.
Despite overall growth in jobs, finding work in Granite County has been harder lately than in the past two
decades. Average annual unemployment declined from 8.2% during 1991 to 6.5% during 1994. It spiked
during 1995 at 7.0% before dropping to 5.7% during 1996. Then it climbed the next three years to 8.9%
during 1999, before dropping every year until the recent low of 4.2% during 2006. From 2007 it climbed
at an accelerating rate until 9.5% by 2009 before slowing its growth rate, but still climbing in 2010,
reaching 10.4%. More recent monthly data for the early months of 2011 indicate it continued climbing.
Although recent average annual and monthly unemployment rates are at or near their highest levels in 20
years in Powell County, there is a different history for those attempting to find work there than in Granite
County. Average annual unemployment increased from 5.9% during 1991 to 8.9% during 1993. After this
short spike it fell until 1999 at 5.1% then rolled along roughly stable until 2002 at 6.2%, dropped to its
low for the period 4.7% during 2006. It climbed rapidly from 5.0% during 2007 to 8.9% in 2010. More
recent monthly data for the early months of 2011 indicate it continued climbing until October when
monthly rates finally were lower than October 2010.
409

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Income
Since 1970, total personal income in Granite County grew at nearly double the rate it did in Powell
County. Granite County total personal income increased roughly 105% from 1970 to $93.742 billion by
2009, whereas in Powell County growth was 59% for the same period, reaching 183.063 billion by 2009.
The 2009 Per capita personal income, or total personal income divided by total population was higher in
Granite County ($32,561) than in Powell County ($25,823) that year. However, the 2009 average earning
per job was higher in Powell County ($32,264) than in Granite County ($22,929). Part of the explanation
for this inconsistency lies in the proportion of total income derived from non-labor income. Non-labor
income consists of dividends, interest and rent (collectively often referred to as money earned from
investments), and transfer payments (payments from governments to individuals, age-related payments,
including Medicare, disability insurance payments, and retirement payments). In Granite County, 53.4%
of all 2009 income was from non-labor sources, which was substantially higher than 46.8% in Powell
County.
Each year the US Census Bureau releases a report on Poverty. The interactive mapping tool located at
http://www.census.gov/did/www/saipe/data/maps/index.html?reload indicates that during 2010, the most
recent year available, the poverty rate in Granite County, was 14.8% , down from 17.4% during 2009.
This is similar to the entire State of Montana, which had an estimated rate of 15.0% during 2009, up
slightly to 15.2% during 2010. In Powell County it higher than the state average, at 20.5% during 2010,
up slightly from 20.3% during 2009. It is worth noting that the prisoner population in Powell County
partially explains the low income. It is also noteworthy that earlier in 2000, the American Indian
population had a very high level of poverty in both Granite County (62.5%) and Powell County (30.5%).

Social Environment
The Forest Plan FEIS (USDA Forest Service 2009b, p. 203) includes information about the social
environment of the analysis area (i.e., the lifestyles and attitudes toward forest resources and the way
these resources are used). Information from the Social Assessment of BDNF (Northern Economics 2002),
which identified contemporary trends affecting lifestyle, attitudes, and values, is incorporated into that
discussion. Maintaining traditional uses like grazing, timber harvest, and recreational activities and
maintaining the condition of forest resources for the health of the community (e.g., clean water, fish,
wildlife, fuel hazards, and roadless management) were identified by the public as concerns related to
lifestyle, attitudes, and values.
Excerpts from the 2002 social assessment describe some local thoughts on BDNF timber management:
Section 3.2.2.1 Timber and Logging Lifestyles
The buckers, riggers, “cat” operators, road builders, and log truck drivers each have their own place in the
logging hierarchy. Collectively they have a fierce pride in their work and describe it as a way of life that
is, in part, made meaningful because of the opportunity to “work in the woods.” Furthermore, the level of
skills required often takes an extended period of time to learn. One of the current concerns in
communities such as Clancy, Dillon, and Deer Lodge is the ongoing loss of “infrastructure” and the skill
loss that accompanies that loss. As one mill operator noted:
You are not just going to replace those people overnight. We are losing that infrastructure and we
will not be able to replace it in a short space of time. We need to do something to keep the skills up
or we will not be able to do anything with the timber if it does become available.

These workers often describe themselves as people who care about forests and their health. As one small
mill operator observed:
410

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

I am not an environmentalist, but I am a conservationist and I care about what happens out there.
The health of the forest is important for my business and for my family’s future. If we don’t take
care of it, then it isn’t going to be there. I know I want my kids to have the same opportunity I have
had to enjoy the woods and to get to know it. You learn from being close to it and it isn’t
something you get from a book.

The mills are now much fewer in number in project count communities than fifteen years ago. The Stoltze
Mill in Dillon closed in 1990. This was among the first of many mill closures in western Montana during
the 1990s. Today, there are only a few mills operating in the seven project counties (AnacondaDeerlodge, Beaverhead, Butte-Silver Bow, Granite, Jefferson, Madison, and Powell Counties, MT). There
are three general types of mills in the project area:
The mill at Deer Lodge, typical of medium to large size mills that use spruce, fir, and pine to produce
fingerjoint products, dimensional lumber and studs or plywood
• Post and pole mills that use primarily lodge pole pine to make fence posts, garden stakes, and similar
products suited to small diameter timber
• Specialty mills that serve niche markets. An example of this type is the mill in Clancy that saws
rough-hewn timber from fir and pine often sold to builders making “western style” homes.
Today, most of the timber processed in these mills is bought from private lands. Timber from public lands
constitutes a relatively small part of the overall log supply.
•

Indeed, the limited amount of federal timber and its economic effects is a topic of ongoing controversy
between the timber industry and those who argue that the decrease in federal timber has had negligible
economic effects for western Montana communities (e.g. Power and Barrett, 2001).
Although timber jobs are concentrated in only a few areas among the project counties, feelings are intense
about the role of federal timber in supporting what has traditionally been an important way of life in
western Montana. Although the number of persons living this lifestyle has declined, sentiments about its
importance remain strong. These sentiments persist for reasons beyond our ability to explain them, but
clearly they are rooted in the connection of lifestyle and place; they are connected to a wider set of
concerns in western Montana about changing lifestyles resulting from in-migration and other sources of
change beyond local influence.” (Northern Economics 2002).
Section 3.2.2.2 Resource Management Issues from the assessment specifically notes, “There is frustration
about not being allowed to salvage dead trees.
If they are not going to let us go in and salvage dead trees they are not going to let us go in and
cut green ones.
People see the wasted wood and they are very frustrated.”

Section 12.3.5 Timber Issues further presents residents feelings during 2002.
Timber cutting emerged primarily in discussion with timber and logging interests as well as some
community members in towns that have or previously had lumber mills. However, timber sentiments are
strongly held and rooted in the history of natural resource use in these communities. What may appear to
be economic issues are also cultural issues related to the preservation of timber-related lifestyles. The
themes below express the link between timber harvesting, community economies, and lifestyle values:
It is a renewable resource.

411

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Loggers and others who visit the woods perceive an abundance of “timber supply” on public lands and
advocate for “sustainable harvests”. Timber is perceived as a renewable resource that can be cut and it
will grow again for future generations to use. There is a sentiment that,
If we (the timber industry) don’t take care of the resource, then it will not be there for the future.

It is a way of life.
The timber industry has been part of the history of southwest Montana since gold was discovered in the
1860s. Mills, large and small, have existed in all project counties and the timber industry has been part of
the mix of the region’s resource-dependent lifestyles. There is sentiment that the BDNF should be:
A good neighbor and support the local communities. That used to be true here. The forest
supported the community. Now they have taken on an elitist attitude and they don’t support us.
Why did that change? There is a sentiment that good forest management creates jobs in the
community.

This sentiment links forest management, lifestyles, and community support.
They need a timber program.
Timber interests perceive a need for a timber program to promote forest health and keep an infrastructure
that is disappearing. Forest health is perceived to benefit by thinning and cutting dead or dying timber that
can create fire danger. Overall, forest health is perceived as declining because beetle infested timber and
burned trees from past fires are not being cut. For example:
A healthy forest is a growing forest, one that is producing fiber and creating oxygen and not
building up this great biomass that is just going to burn. No one is going to get any benefit from it.
Timber is one of our greatest wastes here. I feel that the BDNF is really neglecting its forests. The
past ten years especially, forest health has really gone down. In the 60s and 70s maybe there was
too much cutting, but now people are looking at the forests differently. Montanans are looking at
forests differently. I would like to see a well-managed forest. Take out some of the diseased trees
and open the forest up so there is no multi story timber canopy. Then if a fire comes through it
wouldn’t be catastrophic. You can’t do it everywhere, but in some locations you can do that. With
new logging techniques and machinery it is very low impact. It would improve the forest and they
need to get their heads out and get a timber program going to do something about the overall
health of the forest.

Forest health: periodic disturbance.
The resource user perspective on forest health deserves brief attention, since this topic emerged as a
theme about forest management. This perspective may differ from that of other interest groups, but this is
a thought model held by some interests group about the process for maintaining forest health. This
perspective includes the idea that forest health depends on “periodic disturbance”. This perspective is
succinctly summarized in the following statement:
Forest health is a mixture of timber, brush, and grass. It is a mosaic of landscape and animals. It
is diverse. It is not all green trees or all of any one thing. Some of the trees are burnt, some are
snags, and there is a diversity of age classes. What you need to create this mosaic is periodic
disturbance and some of that comes from timber harvesting. I think timber harvesting promotes
forest health because it creates that mosaic in the landscape.

In this perspective, periodic disturbance through timber harvesting or grazing creates forest health. Forest
health is expressed in a diversity or “mosaic” of species and conditions. This is a different construction of

412

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

forest health than some environmental interests that perceive forest health is created by non-intervention
and non-disturbance, other than “natural” disturbance.
Burned timber needs to be harvested.
Another theme that emerged in several counties is related to the salvage of burned timber. Residents,
members of the forest products industry, and local government officials alike expressed frustration about
the perceived inability of the Forest Service to salvage burned areas.” (Northern Economics 2002).
Relevant Montana Surveys
Comments received during scoping for this project asked that we incorporate national polls and polls
from other states. While the social assessment above is useful in understanding how local people think the
BDNF should be managed, looking at residents living near neighboring forests, line officers across the
country, and results from randomized surveys of US citizens can help readers understand the broader
interests in management of this landscape. Although this is useful information for the responsible official,
it is not the intent to direct their decisions with this information alone. Responsible officials weigh all the
information presented in the environmental assessment to reach their decision.
The Bureau of Business and Economic Research (BBER), at the University of Montana asked residents of
two neighboring forests about this topic prior to the mountain pine beetle epidemic.
Although the cause of mortality differed, during 2001 BBER asked the following question of Bitterroot
Valley residents, the national forest that adjoins the BDNF to the west and southwest of the project area:
“In all the public lands that burned this summer, can you tell me which of the following management
actions you would like the Bitterroot National Forest to take? Please rate the following choices on a scale
from one to five, where one is not at all important and five is very important.”
In that study, 13.2% of residents replied that salvaging timber, in this case killed by the large fires in the
summer of 2000, was somewhat important, and 76.3% of residents replied that salvaging timber was very
important.
During their 2002 study for the Helena NF, BBER asked residents the following: “The year 2000 fire
season and last summer’s fire season brought to attention steps that the Helena National Forest could take
to manage the National Forest. Please tell me to what extent you support or oppose each of the following
possible management actions in the Helena National Forest.”
Results show that 72.3% of respondents indicated they strongly supported salvaging burned, insect
infested or diseased timber, and 11.9% indicated they support it somewhat. On the other hand, 3.4% were
somewhat opposed and 5.1% were strongly opposed. Respondents were sorted into visitors, non-visitors.
In general, visitors identified as urban showed the least support, non-visitors showed more support and
visitors identified as rural showed the highest amount of strong support. Respondents who did not support
salvage were asked if there were conditions where they would or would not support salvage. Of those
who were somewhat opposed or strongly opposed, 52% of them indicated no conditions exist where they
could be supportive, but 38% said there were conditions where they would support salvaging burned or
diseased timber. Roughly half of those respondents who were supportive of salvage listed, noted there
were some conditions when they would be opposed. These included ill effects to ecosystem (52%), when
activities were planned in a roadless area (20%), and if it involved green trees (5%). In addition, far more
respondents to this study supported using prescribed burning than those who opposed it (Sylvester et al
2002).

413

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

In another question from the 2002 Helena NF survey, residents were asked:
“Recreation fees, grazing fees, timber sales and other fees on the Helena National Forest generate income
for local governments and for the Federal Government. To what extent do you support or oppose
generating income by selling timber from Helena National Forest?”
For all respondents, More than 35% somewhat support selling timber, more than 35% strongly supported
selling timber. This contrasts more than 8% that somewhat oppose it and more than 9% that strongly
oppose selling timber to from the Helena National Forest. Respondents were again sorted into visitors,
non-visitors. In general, rural visitors showed the greatest support, while urban visitors and non-visitors
showed similar support, and non-visitors showed the highest level of opposition. (Sylvester et al 2002).
Relevant National Polls
It is important to consider not only the local, and neighboring residents, but also the national picture.
Several national level studies indicate less support for timber management on National Forests than the
more local Helena and Bitterroot BBER studies presented above. For example, in an interesting repeat of
a 1981 study, Brown and Harris (1992) from the University of Idaho, conducted a 1990 randomized poll
of USFS District Rangers and Forest Supervisors, results show averages from numerical responses
suggesting that line officers in the agency in 1990 were generally neutral to slightly unfavorable in
response to the statement: Increased production of wood from National forest System lands. Using a 1-5
scale, where 1 represents favorable and 5 represents unfavorable, the mean score for District Rangers and
Forest Supervisors had increased from 2.35 during 1981 to 3.91 by 1990 and from 2.21 to 3.99,
respectively. While tallies or medians from each category would have also been helpful information (a
histogram of tallies gives the most information about responses and the median is not influenced as much
as the mean by outliers, so comparing it to the mean helps share information about the distribution of
responses), this is an interesting snapshot of the agency 31 and 22 years ago.
Eight years later or roughly 14 years ago, in June of 1998, Market Strategies, Inc. asked 800 randomly
selected registered voters across the country:
“There has been a national debate about whether the U.S. Forest Service should continue to sell timber
from our national forests. Do you favor or oppose continuing to allow timber companies to log in our
national forests?
The following are the 1990 results:
Strongly favor logging in our national forests:
Somewhat favor logging in our national forests:
Neither:
Somewhat oppose logging in our national forests:
Strongly oppose logging in our national forests:
Don't know

7%
17%
2%
19%
50%
5%

This study noted that even voters in the West, by a two-to-one margin (62% - 31%), oppose continuing to
allow timber companies to log in national forests (Market Strategies, Inc. 1990).
Several statewide polls taken from 1996 to 2002 and two more recent national polls in 1999-2000
(American Viewpoint 2000) and 2000 (Shields et al 2002) also show low support for logging, but high
support for protecting ecosystem health.

414

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

American Viewpoint who was called "a leading Republican pollster," according to a news release from
the Heritage Forests Campaign and the National Environmental Trust polled 1,000 western registered
voters in six days in late 1999 and early 2000, asking:
"National forest lands in the United States total 192 million acres. Fifty-one percent of this land has
already been logged, mined or has roads, and remains open to commercial development. Eighteen percent
is permanently protected. The remaining 31 percent are wild but unprotected roadless areas. The Clinton
administration has proposed to protect nearly all of these remaining wild but unprotected areas. This
means it could be used for most types of recreation, but that logging, new roads, mining, oil drilling and
off-road vehicles would be prohibited. Do you favor or oppose this proposal?"
The poll, focused on roadless management revealed that, by a margin of 60 to 31 %, "Americans oppose
allowing logging, mining and other industrial activities on national forest lands," (American Viewpoint
2000).
Shields et al (2002) found wide support for the first goal described in the 2000 Revision of the USDA
Forest Service Strategic Plan, as the public sees the promotion of ecosystem health as an important
objective for public lands and such protection as an important role for the USDA Forest Service. Mixed
results were found for the goal of providing multiple benefits to people. The public supports multiple uses
but does not support all uses equally.. Finally it should be noted that there is only moderate support for the
provision of resources to dependent communities and traditional cultural uses.”

Desired Condition
The BDNF Forest Plan includes the following forest-wide goals and standards affecting the economics of
the area:
•

•

Contribute to the social and economic well-being of local communities by promoting sustainable use
of renewable natural resources. Provide timber for commercial harvest, forage for livestock grazing,
exploration and development opportunities for mineral resources, and recreation settings consistent
with other resource goals (FP, page 21).
Forest products would be used to provide economic benefits where project objectives, forest plan
objectives, and forest plan standards can be met (FP, page 38).

Environmental Consequences
Methodology
The economic measures used for this report are project feasibility, financial efficiency, economic impacts,
and environmental justice. These measures, including methodologies, are described below.
Project Feasibility
Project feasibility is used to determine if a project is feasible, that is, will the timber sell, given current
market conditions. The determination of feasibility relies on a residual value (stumpage = revenues costs) feasibility analysis that uses local delivered log prices and stump to mill costs to determine if a
project is feasible. The appraised stumpage rate from this analysis is compared to the base rate (revenues
considered essential to cover regeneration plus minimum return to the Federal treasury). The project is
considered to be feasible if the appraised stumpage rate exceeds the base rates. If the feasibility analysis
indicates that the project is not feasible, the project may need to be modified. Infeasibility indicates an
increased risk that the project may not attract bids and may not be implemented.
415

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Financial Efficiency
Based on comments received during scoping, all costs and revenues included in the efficiency analysis are
presented in tables in this section of the analysis. The financial efficiency analysis is specific to the timber
harvest and restoration activities associated with the alternatives (as directed in Forest Service Manual
2400-Timber Management and guidance found in the Forest Service Handbook 2409.18). Costs for sale
preparation, sale administration, regeneration, and restoration activities are included. Costs for restoration
activities are based on recent experienced costs and professional estimates. Non-harvest related costs are
not included in appraised timber value, but they are included in the financial efficiency analysis. All costs,
timing, and amounts were developed by the specialists on the project’s interdisciplinary team. The PNV is
the net value when expected future costs and benefits are discounted into a single year and combined. The
expected revenue for each alternative is the corresponding predicted high bid from the sale feasibility
analysis. The predicted high bid is used for the expected revenue (rather than the appraised stumpage rate)
since the predicted high bid is the best estimate of the high bid resulting from the timber sale auction. The
PNV was calculated using a 4 % real discount rate over the ten-year project lifespan (2013-2022). For
more information on the values or costs, see the project file.
Financial efficiency provides information relevant to the future financial position of the Federal
government if the project is implemented. Financial efficiency considers anticipated costs and revenues
that are part of Forest Service monetary transactions. PNV is used as an indicator of financial efficiency
and presents one tool to be used in conjunction with many other factors in the decision-making process.
PNV combines benefits and costs that occur at different times and discounts them into an amount that is
equivalent to all economic activity in a single year. A positive PNV indicates that the alternative is
financially efficient. Because all planning costs are incurred prior to the line officer selecting any
alternative, these are considered sunk costs and are not included in the forward looking financial
efficiency analysis.
This analysis is not intended to be a comprehensive benefit-cost or PNV analysis that incorporates a
monetary expression of all known market and non-market benefits and costs that is generally used when
economic efficiency is the sole or primary criterion upon which a decision is made. Many of the values
associated with natural resource management are best handled apart from, but in conjunction with,
a more limited benefit-cost framework. These values such as improved mosaic of species and age
classes desired for enhanced resilience to future insect and disease are discussed throughout this
document, for each resource area.
Economic Impacts (Jobs and Labor Income)
Economic impacts are used to evaluate potential direct, indirect, and cumulative effects on the economy.
Economic impacts are estimated using input-output analysis. Input-output analysis is a means of
examining relationships within an economy, both between businesses and between businesses and final
consumers. It captures all monetary market transactions for consumption in a given time period. The
resulting mathematical representation allows one to examine the effect of a change in one or several
economic activities on an entire economy, all else constant. This examination is called impact analysis.
The IMPLAN modeling system (MIG 2003) allows the user to build regional economic models of one or
more counties for a particular year. The model for this analysis used the 2010 IMPLAN data from Granite
and Powell Counties, Montana.
IMPLAN translates changes in final demand for goods and services into resulting changes in economic
effects, such as labor income and employment of the affected area’s economy.

416

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

The economic impact effects are measured by estimating the direct jobs and labor income generated by
(1) the harvesting and processing of the timber volume from the project, and (2) Forest Service
expenditures for contracted restoration activities included as part of the proposed treatments. Government
work is not included in impact estimates since the work involved in this project is part of an ongoing
government Agency’s vegetation management program. Data used to estimate the direct effects from the
timber harvest and processing were provided by the University of Montana’s Bureau of Business and
Economic Research (Morgan et al. 2007). This national data is broken into multi-state regions and is
considered more accurate than that which is available from IMPLAN. The Northern Rockies BBER
Region (Montana and Idaho) is used for this analysis. The BBER data represents the results of mill
censuses that correlate production, employment, and labor income.
The direct employment and labor income benefit employees and their families and, therefore, directly
affect the local economy. Additional indirect and induced multiplier effects (ripple effects) are generated
by the direct activities. Indirect effects are felt by the producers of materials used by the directly affected
industries. Induced effects occur when employees of the directly and indirectly affected industries spend
the wages they receive. Together the direct and multiplier effects comprise the total economic impacts to
the local economy.
Potential limitations of these estimates are the time lag in IMPLAN data and the data intensive nature of
the input-output model.
Environmental Justice
As stated in Executive Order 12898, it is required that all federal actions consider the potential of
disproportionate effects on minority and low-income populations in the local region. The principles of
environmental justice require agencies to address the equity and fairness implications associated with
Federal land management actions. The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) (1997) provides the
following definitions in order to provide guidance with the compliance of environmental justice
requirements:
•

“Minority population: Minority populations should be identified where either: (a) the minority
population of the affected area exceeds 50 percent or (b) the minority population percentage of
the affected area is meaningfully greater than the minority population percentage in the
general population or other appropriate unit of geographic analysis...”

•

“Low-income population: Low-income populations in an affected area should be identified
with the annual statistical poverty thresholds from the Bureau of the Census' Current
Population Reports, Series P-60 on Income and Poverty. In identifying low-income
populations, agencies may consider as a community either a group of individuals living in
geographic proximity to one another, or a set of individuals (such as migrant workers or
Native Americans), where either type of group experiences common conditions of
environmental exposure or effect.”

Spatial and Temporal Context for Effects Analysis
The analysis area for the efficiency analysis is the project area. The Flint Foothills Project Area is
approximately 44,522 acres in size and is located northwest of the city of Deer Lodge in southwest
Montana. The project area includes portions of both Granite and Powell Counties. The temporal scope of
the analysis is the duration of the proposed activities. The project is expected to be accomplished over a
ten-year period with the harvest activity occurring primarily in the first five years.

417

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Timber management activities within the project area have the potential to impact the economic
conditions of local communities and counties. To estimate the potential effect on jobs and income, a zone
of influence (or economic impact area) was delineated. The impact area was chosen based on commuting
data suggesting a functioning economy and where the timber is likely to be processed. This analysis
suggested that Granite and Powell Counties were the appropriate counties to include in the economic
impact analysis area.
Past, Present, and Foreseeable Activities Relevant to Cumulative Effects Analysis
The financial efficiency of the project would not be affected by the past, present, or reasonable
foreseeable future actions in the project area. Other projects occurring in the economic impact area have
the potential to contribute cumulatively to jobs and labor income provided by implementing this project.

Alternative 1 – No Action
Under the no action alternative, current management plans would continue to guide management of the
project area. No vegetation management treatments would be implemented to accomplish project goals.
Direct Effects
The No Action Alternative has neither future costs nor revenues associated with it, and thus would have a
PNV of $0. The No Action Alternative contributes/maintains no jobs nor income because there are no
activities associated with this alternative. In other words, no direct effects would be expected if the noaction alternative was implemented.
Indirect Effects
No indirect effects would be expected if the no-action alternative was implemented.
Cumulative Effects
Because there would be no direct or indirect effects, there would be no cumulative effects.
Summary of Effects
No Effects

Action Alternatives 2 and 3
The action alternatives utilize the same vegetation treatments and units to meet the purpose and need for
action. The alternatives differ by the number of units and total acreages of units for salvage by clear-cut
harvest, and commercial thin of ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir stands. There is no difference in
treatment acres between the alternatives for the seed tree harvest, prescribed burn and precommercial thin
treatments.
The estimation of project feasibility was based on the Region 1 residual value appraisal approach, which
took into account logging system, timber species and quality, volume removed per acre, lumber market
trends, costs for slash treatment, and the cost of specified roads, temporary roads and road maintenance.
The estimated stumpage rate, predicted high bids and minimum rates for the action alternative are
displayed in Table 104.
For Alternative 2, the appraised stumpage of $66.61/CCF and the predicted high bid, $72.26/CCF were
compared to $3/CCF minimum rates (revenues considered essential to cover the legal minimum return to
418

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

the federal treasury). The predicted high bid for Alternatives 2 indicates that the 40,104 CCF timber sale
portion of the Flint Foothills Project would be feasible. The predicted high bid from the feasibility
analysis is used in the financial efficiency analysis for each alternative discussed below. Alternative 2
could also produce 8,021 CCF of small-diameter non sawlog material which would likely be sold for
$1/CCF, the minimum rate for that material. Since this would not be a mandatory element of the sale, the
revenue associated with this sale is not included in the financial efficiency analysis; however a non-saw
adjustment was made to develop the saw log stumpage appraisal above.

For Alternative 3, the appraised stumpage value of $66.89/CCF and the predicted high bid, $72.54/CCF
were compared to $3/CCF minimum rates (revenues considered essential to cover the legal minimum
return to the federal treasury). The estimated predicted high bids and minimum rates for the action
alternative are displayed in Table 104 The predicted high bid for Alternatives 3 indicates that the 31,715
CCF timber sale portion of the Flint Foothills Project would be feasible. The predicted high bid from the
feasibility analysis is used in the financial efficiency analysis for each alternative discussed below.
Alternative 3 could also produce 6,343 CCF of small-diameter non sawlog material which would likely
be sold for $1/CCF, the minimum rate for that material. Since this would not be a mandatory element of
the sale, the revenue associated with this sale is not included in the financial efficiency analysis; however
a non-saw adjustment was made to develop the saw log stumpage appraisal above.
Financial Efficiency
Table 104 summarizes the project feasibility and financial efficiency, including the base rates, appraised
stumpage rate, predicted high bid, total revenue, and PNV for each alternative. Because all costs of the
project are not related to the timber sale, two PNVs were calculated. One PNV indicates the financial
efficiency for the timber sale, including all costs and revenues associated with the timber harvest and
required design criteria. The required design criteria, as used here, are the 1) excavator piling and burning
of activity fuel, 2) slashing damaged residuals, 3) erosion control, 4) landing rehabilitation, 5) haul route

419

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

road reconstruction, 6) new temporary road construction / obliteration, 7) road decommissioning, 8) road
storage, 9) weed spraying connected with harvest, and 10) weed monitoring. Several costs associated with
the timber sale are not captured in the appraisals. Appraisals don’t include some direct outlays included in
the project. For example neither 9) sale preparation costs of $13.50/CCF, nor 10) sale administration costs
of $4.50/CCF affect stumpage values. Other examples include: 11) regeneration exams, 12) weed
spraying connected with harvest and 13) weed monitoring. These costs shown as “Mandatory Activity
Expenses Not Included in Appraisal” are captured in the first financial efficiency analysis and would be
funded with regularly appropriated dollars.
The lower portion of Table 105 displays the other activities not tied to commercial harvest and required
design criteria. These activities would occur as funding becomes available from the timber sale revenue
(for conventional timber sales, a minimum of $0.25/CCF must be returned to the treasury) and other
appropriated funds. The costs associated with these activities range from about $1.305 million for
Alternative 2 to $1.238 million for Alternative 3. A second PNV includes all costs for each alternative,
including all activities listed in Table 105, including those listed under “Other Project-Associated
Activities.” Planning costs are not included in financial efficiency analysis since they are sunk costs at the
time of decision.
Table 104 indicates that both action alternatives are financially efficient (positive PNV) when analyzing
timber sale and required design criteria but both become financially inefficient when the analysis includes
all activities. Alternative 2 has the highest PNV for the timber sale, $906,186, and -$181,493 for all
activities. For Alternative 3, the PNV for the timber sale and required design criteria is $558,433 and $466,997 for all activities.
A reduction of financial PNV in any alternative as compared to the most efficient solution is a component
of the economic trade-off, or opportunity cost, of achieving that alternative. The no action alternative
would not harvest or take other restorative actions and, therefore, incur no costs. As indicated earlier,
many of the values associated with natural resource management are non-market benefits. These benefits
should be considered in conjunction with the financial efficiency information presented here. These nonmarket values are discussed in the various resource sections found in this environmental assessment.

Economic Impact Effects
The analysis calculated the jobs and labor income associated with the harvesting and processing of the
timber products harvested as well as all contracting needed to conduct mandatory and optional
stewardship activities. Timber products harvested from the proposed project and the non-timber activities
would have direct, indirect, and induced effects on local jobs and labor income. In order to estimate jobs
and labor income associated with timber harvest, the timber harvest levels were proportionally broken out
by product type (Table 106). In order to estimate jobs and labor income associated with reforestation and
restoration activities, expenditures and timing for these activities were developed by the resource
specialists.

Table 107 displays the direct, indirect and induced, and total estimates for employment (part and full-time
jobs contributed) and labor income that may be attributed to each alternative. Since the expenditures
occur over time, the estimated impacts of jobs and labor income would be spread out over the life of the
project. It is important to note that these may or may not be new jobs or income, in either case they are
jobs and income that are supported by this project. These impacts are shown both in total (over the life of
the project) and on an annual basis.

421

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

“Part and full-time jobs contributed” shown here are defined as the annual average of monthly jobs. Thus,
1 job lasting 12 months = 2 jobs lasting 6 months each = 3 jobs lasting 4 months each. Each of those
examples would appear as 1 job. That 1 job lasting 12 months can be either full-time or part-time; but it
does last for 12 months. When jobs are counted this way, one cannot tell from the data the number of
hours worked or the proportion that are full or part-time or anything about seasonality; only that they are
yearlong. These jobs are different than full time equivalent (FTE) jobs. However, they can be converted to
average FTE jobs by using industry-specific FTE to Employment ratios (number of FTE jobs in an
industry divided by total employment in the industry). These ratios are all less than one because
employment in all sectors contains part-time jobs (so there are more jobs than there are FTEs).
Estimates of average year-long part-time and full-time jobs shown are heavily dependent upon the
implementation period of the project. The estimates shown in Table 107 reflect the average over an
estimated implementation time of 5 years for timber cutting and 10 years for other activities. If the actual
implementation periods are shorter than these, more jobs would be supported over a shorter period of
time. Conversely, if the implementation periods are expanded, fewer jobs would be supported annually
but for a longer period of time. Within the implementation periods of a project, numbers of jobs supported
may or may not be distributed evenly over time. For example, project startup might require more jobs
than are required in later stages of the project; or a certain number of jobs might be required to
accomplish basic site preparation, following which a different number of jobs might be supported to carry
out the full scope of work on the project. The estimates shown in Table 107 give the total number of jobs
supported by a project lasting 10 years, and the annual averages assuming the jobs are distributed evenly
over the two implementation periods. The actual numbers of jobs over time depends on how project
implementation actually occurs.

Alternative 2 would result in 128 direct and 208 total (direct, indirect and induced) part and full-time jobs
and $5.915 million direct and $8.9 million in total labor income over the life of the project.
Of this amount, timber harvest and processing in Alternative 2 would contribute 115 direct and 193 total
jobs during the five years, with $5.316 million direct and $8.249 million in total labor income. Annually
this means a contribution of 23 direct and 39 total jobs and $1.06 direct and $1.65 million in total labor
income. If the implementation takes longer than anticipated, the total impacts would remain the same, but
the annual contributions would be reduced.
The precommercial thin, prescribed burn and other project-related resource activities proposed in
Alternative 2 would contribute approximately 13 direct and 15 total part and full-time jobs during the ten
years. This contribution would entail $598,000 direct and $650,000 in total labor income. Annually, this
would mean a contribution of roughly 1 direct and 2 total jobs and $60,000 direct and $65,000 total labor
income performing restoration activities.
Alternative 3 would result in 104 direct and 167 total (direct, indirect and induced) part and full-time jobs
and $4.798 million direct and $7.169 million in total labor income over the life of the project. Of this
amount, timber harvest and processing in Alternative 3 would contribute 91 direct and 152 total jobs
during the five years, with $4.204 million direct and $6.524 million in total labor income. Annually this
means a contribution of 18 direct and 30 total jobs and $841,000 direct and $1.305 million in total labor
income. If the implementation takes longer than anticipated, the total impacts would remain the same, but
the annual contributions would be reduced.
The precommercial thin, prescribed burn and other project-related resource activities proposed in
Alternative 3 would contribute approximately 13 direct and 15 total part and full-time jobs during the ten

years. This contribution would entail $594,000 direct and $645,000 in total labor income. Annually, this
would mean a contribution of roughly 1 direct and 2 total jobs and $59,000 direct and $64,000 total labor
income performing restoration activities.
Environmental Justice
Environmental Justice is discussed in the Forest Plan EIS (USDA Forest Service 2009b, page 206).
According to the CEQ’s Environmental Justice Guidelines for NEPA (1997), “minority populations
should be identified where either: (a) the minority population of the affected area exceeds 50 percent or
(b) the minority population percentage of the affected area is meaningfully greater than the minority
population percentage in the general population or other appropriate unit of geographic analysis.” Table
102 shows that the total share of all minority populations represented less than 10 percent of the
population in the state and the analysis area in 2000. Thus, the U.S. Census data suggest minority
populations within the analysis area do not meet the CEQ’s Environmental Justice criterion.
CEQ guidance on identifying low-income populations states that “…agencies may consider as a
community either a group of individuals living in geographic proximity to one another, or a set of
individuals (e.g., migrant workers or Native Americans), where either type of group experiences common
conditions of environmental exposure or effect.” Low-income populations are defined, based on the 2000
Census standard, as persons living below the poverty level (based on total income of $13,359 for a family
household of four). Persistent poverty status requires a county to have experienced an individual poverty
rate in excess of 20 percent for several Census years. In 2010, 14.8% of the population in Granite County
and 20.3% of the population in Powell County were living below the poverty level. In the case of Granite
County this was down from 2009, whereas for Powell County it was slightly higher than 2009. Based on
these data, the characteristic of persistent poverty may be present in Powell County, part of the analysis
area. As noted above, the State of Montana prisoner population in Powell County partially explains the
low income.
The Executive Order also directs agencies to consider patterns of subsistence hunting and fishing when an
action proposed by an agency has the potential to affect fish or wildlife. Although the closest Native
American Reservation is located more than one hour from the analysis area, Treaty rights allow special
subsistence hunting and fishing privileges in and near the project area for Salish Kootenai Confederated
tribal members. The impacts of this project on the human environment are designed to enhance the
ecological and socio-economic conditions for all residents. The action alternatives would likely be
preferred by the low-income population and perceived as neutral by the subsistence hunting and fishing
population.
Summary of Effects
When evaluating trade-offs, the use of efficiency measures is one tool used by the decision maker in
making the decision. Many things cannot be easily quantified with dollars, such as effects on the
restoration of watersheds and vegetation. The decision maker takes many factors into account in making
the decision. Table 108 indicates how well each of the alternatives makes progress towards the purpose
and need established for the Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Project.

Cumulative Effects
The financial efficiency of the project would not be affected by the past, present, or reasonable
foreseeable future actions in the project area. Other projects occurring in the economic impact area and
the dynamic economy have the potential to contribute cumulatively to jobs and labor income provided by
implementing this project.
Compliance with Forest Plan and Other Relevant Laws, Regulations, Policies and Plans
All Alternatives comply with applicable Forest Plan, as well as other relevant laws, regulations, policies

Short-term Uses and Long-term Productivity
NEPA requires consideration of “the relationship between short-term uses of man’s environment and the
maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity” (40 CFR 1502.16). The resource sections in
chapter 3 disclose the short-term and long-term environmental impacts. Implementation of the
alternatives would involve tradeoffs between long-term productivity and short-term uses of the
environment including the short-term disturbances of soils that could cause sedimentation to area streams,
or biological resource impacts from habitat disturbance. Conversely, the treatments would have a positive
benefit to the long-term productivity of the treatment stands. Impacts would be mitigated by project
design features and mitigation measures (chapter 2) including BMPs. No significant losses in long-term
productivity have been identified as a result of this project.

The resource sections of chapter 3 disclose the environmental consequences, including unavoidable
adverse effects related to implementation of the alternatives. The analysis in this document used the best
available information to estimate environmental impacts; conservative assumptions were made to
estimate effects where information was unavailable. The severity of the effects would be minimized by
the project design features and mitigation measures (chapter 2).

Irreversible and Irretrievable Commitments of Resources
NEPA requires a discussion of “any irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources which would
be involved in the proposed action should it be implemented” (40 CFR 1502.16).
An irreversible commitment of resources refers to the loss of non-renewable resources that cannot be
regained over time, such as the removal of mined ore or extinction of a species. An irretrievable
commitment applies to the loss of production or use of renewable resources for a period of time, such as
the temporary loss of timber productivity in forested areas that are kept clear for use as a power line rightof-way or a road.
The impacts described in chapter 3 involve irretrievable commitments of resources, including short-term
loss of productivity in areas cleared for road and landings; and detrimental soil disturbance on areas
compacted by logging operations. Growth of forest vegetation would be affected during the time the roads
and landings are used for logging operations, up to 5 years (length of the timber contract); the new
temporary roads would be obliterated after completion of the logging activities. The 1.3 miles of NFS
road construction in the proposed action would affect productivity long term on approximately 6 acres.
The compacted soil areas would be rehabilitated after logging by subsoiling, so there would be a nominal
lag in growth of forest vegetation in these areas. The action alternatives would not jeopardize the
continued existence of any species.

Glossary
Active Crown Fire ∼ A fire that moves into and through the tree crowns, generally due to a
combination of fire intensity and ladder fuels
Activity Fuels ∼ Fuels created by management actions
Allelopathy ∼ The inhibition of growth in one plant species by chemicals produced by another.
For example, other plants will often not grow underneath black walnut trees, since these trees
produce juglone, a chemical inhibiting plant respiration.
Anadromous Fish ∼ Species of fish that are born in freshwater, move to the ocean to mature,
and return to freshwater to reproduce
Aquatic ∼ Living or growing in water
Aquatic Conservation Strategy (ACS) ∼ A strategy “developed to restore and maintain
the ecological health of watersheds and aquatic ecosystems contained within them on public
lands”
(USDA Forest Service and USDI Bureau of Land Management 1994b, B-9)
Aquatic Conservation Strategy Objectives ∼ Objectives that “define the context for the
agency review and implementation of management activities. Complying with the Aquatic
Conservation
Strategy objectives means that an agency must manage the riparian-dependent resources to
maintain the existing condition or implement actions to restore conditions. The baseline from
which to assess maintaining or restoring the condition is developed through a watershed
analysis. Improvement relates to restoring biological and physical processes within their ranges
of natural variability.” (USDA Forest Service and USDI Bureau of Land Management 1994b,
B-10)
Beneficial Uses ∼ “Beneficial uses” of the waters of the state that may be protected against
water quality degradation include, but are not necessarily limited to, domestic, municipal,
agricultural, and industrial supply; power generation; recreation; aesthetic enjoyment;
navigation; and preservation and enhancement of fish, wildlife, and other aquatic resources or
preserves (from Section 13050(f) of California’s Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act)
Best Management Practices (BMPs) ∼ Measures certified by the State Water Quality
Control Board and approved by the Environmental Protection Agency as effective means of

Critical Habitat ∼ Defined in the ESA as (1) the specific areas within the geographical area
occupied by the species, at the time it is federally listed, on which are found those physical or
biological features essential to the conservation of the species, and which may require special
management considerations or protection; and (2) specific areas outside the geographical area
occupied by the species at the time it is listed, when it is determined by the Secretary of the
Interior that such areas are essential for the conservation of the species
Crowning ∼ Situation where fire rises to the tree tops and begins advancing from tree top to
tree top, or where fire intermittently ignites tree crowns as a surface fire advances.
Cumulative Effects ∼ Those effects resulting from incremental effects of actions, when
added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions, regardless of what
agency or person undertakes such other actions
Cumulative Watershed Effects Model ∼ A model for Cumulative Watershed Effects with
three components: Equivalent Roaded Acres (ERA), sediment delivery from surface erosion,
and sediment delivery from mass wasting. The model quantifies disturbances and land
sensitivity at the 7th field watershed scale and can calculate them at larger scales. The estimated
results fall on a continuum. As disturbances increase over time and space, at some point the risk
of initiating or contributing to existing adverse cumulative watershed impacts becomes a cause
for concern. Concern thresholds have been identified for each component based on field
observations in the Forest.
Decommissioning ~ Activities that result in the stabilization and restoration of unneeded roads
or trails to a more natural state.
Designated road, trail, or area ~ A National Forest System road, a National Forest System

Irretrievable ∼ An irretrievable commitment of resources entails a loss of production, harvest,
or use of natural resources. Such decisions are reversible, but the production opportunities
foregone are irretrievable (50 Federal Register 26082)
Irreversible ∼ An irreversible commitment of resources entails a loss of future options. This
applies primarily to the effects of use of non-renewable resources such as minerals or cultural
resources, or to those factors, such as soil productivity, that are renewable only over a long
period of time (50 Federal Register 26082)

downward trends in population numbers or density or, b) Significant current or predicted
downward trends in habitat capability that would reduce a species’ existing distribution. Forest
Service sensitive species are not “listed” under the Endangered Species Act and may not occur
on all the forests within a Forest Service Region. Regional sensitive species lists undergo
periodic review and are subject to change. G rankings denote global (range wide) and state
status from 1 (critically imperiled) to 5 (demonstrably secure).
Silviculture ∼ The art and science of growing and tending forest vegetation. It includes
controlling the establishment, composition, and growth of forests for specific management
goals

463

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Silviculture Prescription ∼ A site-specific operational plan that describes the forest
management objectives for an area. It prescribes the method for harvesting the existing forest
stand, and a series of silviculture treatments that will be carried out to establish a free growing
stand in a manner that accommodates other resource values as identified
Site Potential Tree Height ∼ The average maximum height of the tallest dominant trees
(200 years or older) for a given site class
Skyline Yarding System ∼ Moving logs from the stump to the landing either partially or
fully suspended by a cable
Snag ∼ A standing dead tree
Social Analysis ∼ Analysis that uses social science information to determine how proposed
actions would affect humans
Soil Porosity ∼ State of having pores or holes in the soil that hold air or water; permeability
Soil Productivity ∼ The capability of a soil to produce a specific crop such as fiber, forage,
etc., under defined levels of management.
Species ∼ A unit of classification of plants and animals consisting of the largest and most
inclusive array of sexually reproducing and cross-fertilizing individuals, which share a common
gene pool.
Stand ∼ A community of trees or other vegetation uniform in composition, constitution, age,
spatial arrangement, or condition to be distinguishable from adjacent communities
Stand Density Index (SDI): A relative measure of the amount of stocking on a forest area.
Often described in terms of stems per acre
Standard and Guideline ∼ A principle requiring a specific level of attainment, a rule to
measure against
Stocking ∼ The degree to which trees occupy the land, measured by BA and/or number of
trees by size and spacing, compared with a stocking standard; that is, the BA and/or number of
trees required to fully utilize the land's growth potential. Where tree growth is inhibited due to
competition from too many trees, the site is said to be overstocked
Stocking Control ∼ See thinning
Storage ~ Used to describe an intermittent use road during the time it is closed to vehicular use.
When referring to a National Forest System road, storage is synonymous with a Maintenance
Level 1.
Suppression Forces ∼ Resources used to fight a fire, consisting of firefighters with hand
tools at a minimum; may also include fire engines and bulldozers, helicopters and tanker planes
Suppressed Trees ∼ Smaller trees in the lower canopy layer
Surface Fire ∼ Fire that remains on the forest floor because the combination of fire intensity
and ladder fuels is not sufficient to move it into the tree crowns. Only surface fuels and small
vegetation are burned

464

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

Surface Fuels ∼ Loose combustible material on the soil surface, consisting of fallen leaves,
twigs, bark, and small branches, as well as grasses, small plants, seedlings trees, dead branches,
and logs.
Temporary Road ~ A road necessary for emergency operations or authorized by contract,
permit, lease, or other written authorization that is not a forest road or a forest trail and that is
not included in a forest transportation atlas.
Thinning ∼ Removing trees from a stand to redistribute the growth potential or to benefit the
quality of the residual stand
Threatened Species ∼ A United States Fish and Wildlife Service or NOAA Fisheries
designation of a plant or animal species that is threatened throughout all or a specific portion of
its range.
Torching ∼ Ignition and subsequent flare-up of a fire, usually burning from the bottom to the
top of a tree or small group of trees.
Trail - A route 50 inches or less in width or a route over 50 inches wide that is identified and
managed as a trail.
Tree Crown ∼ Leafy portion
Turbidity ∼ Deposition of substrate material suspended in water
Unauthorized Road or Trail ~ A road or trail that is not a forest road or trail or a temporary
road or trail and that is not included in a forest transportation atlas
Understory ∼ Vegetation (trees or shrubs) growing under the canopy formed by taller trees.
Variable Density Thinning ∼ A thinning treatment that results in an irregularly distributed
and unevenly stocked stand. Conditions range from widely spaced (40’–60’) trees (those being
cultured for large tree attributes) to no-thin areas with dense thickets of trees. Between these
extremes, the remaining stand is thinned with variations according to tree species, crown
position, tree attributes, slope position, aspect and elevation
Vertical Fuels ∼ Standing vegetation, either live or dead.
Viable Population ∼ A population, which has the estimated numbers and distribution of
reproductive individuals to insure continued existence well distributed in the planning area. To
insure that viable populations will be maintained, habitat must be provided to support, at least,
a minimum number of reproductive individuals and that habitat must be well distributed so that
those individuals can interact with others in the planning area.
Water Repellency (for soils) ∼ Loss of soil porosity, preventing water from infiltrating and
causing water to run off
Watershed ~ An area of land with a characteristic drainage network that contributes surface
or ground water to the flow at that point; a drainage basin or a major subdivision of a drainage
basin. A watershed address consists of a name and a number (for example, Lower James
watershed, 02080206). The 8-digit number is a Hydrologic Unit Code or HUC. The Hydrologic
Unit system is a standardized watershed classification system developed by USGS in the mid1970s. Hydrologic units are watershed boundaries organized in a nested hierarchy by size. They
465

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement

range in size from regions to the smaller cataloging units (HUCs), which are roughly equivalent
to your local watershed (example follows).
o

5th field watershed: A watershed that ranges from about 40,000 to 250,000
acres in size

o

6th field watershed: A watershed that ranges from about 10,000 to 40,000
acres in size

o

7th field watershed: A watershed or drainage that ranges from about 2,500
to 10,000 acres in size

Watershed Analysis ∼ Watershed analysis is a systematic procedure for characterizing
watershed and ecological processes to meet specific management and social objectives
Wet Weather Operations Standards ∼ Specific information used to help determine when
activities are at risk of not meeting BMPs. The guidelines are used to determine if conditions
are favorable for wet weather or winter operations, and to provide guidance as to when
conditions warrant suspension of operations, when operations may begin or resume, or when
and what remedies may be appropriate
Wetlands ∼ Those areas that are inundated by surface or ground water with a frequency
sufficient, under normal circumstances, to support a prevalence of vegetative or aquatic life that
requires saturated or seasonally saturated soil conditions for growth and reproduction. Wetlands
include marshes, bogs, sloughs, potholes, river overflows, mud flats, wet meadows, seeps, and
springs.

Appendix D – Cumulative Effects
Cumulative Effects
Past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future activities listed in this appendix are activities known to
have already occurred, are currently occurring, or are likely to occur in the vicinity of the proposed Flint
Foothill Project and may contribute to cumulative effects. These activities and events are primarily
located within and adjacent to the Flint Foothill Project area. An example of proximity is the Boulder
Creek drainage, a large drainage on the west side of the Flint Mountains, and immediately adjacent to the
project on the southwest side of the project area.
Natural processes and past and present management activities have contributed to creating the current
condition, as described in the Existing Condition section of the Final Environmental Impact Statement.
These activities, as well as reasonably foreseeable actions, may produce environmental effects on issues
or resources relevant to the proposal. Therefore, the past, present, and reasonably foreseeable activities
have been considered in the cumulative effects for each resource area.
The catalog of past and present projects to our knowledge is comprehensive based on information
available to the Forest Service. However there may be some unintended omissions due to lack of current
records or knowledge. Information on past activities was gathered from the Forest Service Activity
Tracking System (FACTS), which is an activity tracking system for all levels of the Forest Service;
District files; and collective knowledge of local Forest Service employees.
Because cumulative effects vary in time and space, each resource area has defined a specific cumulative
effects analysis area in their effects discussion that is pertinent to their specific resource and the issues
addressed (Figure D- 1). To strengthen documentation that the appropriate past, present, and reasonably
foreseeable actions are considered, each resource area has addressed the listed activities in the existing
condition and environmental effects discussion in the Flint Foothill analysis.

Natural Events and Processes
Besides past management actions, natural events and processes have also had an effect on existing
conditions within the project area, as discussed in the Existing Condition section within the Flint Foothill
analysis. The following is a description of some of the more important natural processes or events (in
addition to vegetative succession) that have shaped the vegetation component within the project area.

Spruce Budworm
Around the year 2000 spruce budworm expanded in population quickly, especially in the Gird Creek to
Douglas Creek areas of the project area, due to the favorable host base and favorable weather conditions.
Repeated defoliation has led to mortality of some Douglas-fir, as well as an increase in Douglas-fir bark
beetle (see discussion in the Flint Foothill Vegetation analysis).
Mountain Pine Beetle
Mountain pine beetle went from endemic populations to epidemic populations in 2007 in the project area
(Table 27, Volume 1). The 2009 flight (aerial survey) over the project area showed over 19,000 acres
affected, and over 170,000 trees turned visibly red; these trees were actually attacked in 2007 and had
turned red by 2009.
The mountain pine beetle epidemic has killed low-, mid- and high-elevation lodgepole pine, as well as
high-elevation whitebark pine in the project area (current estimates are all of the lodgepole pine stands
have been affected by mountain pine beetle; see Vegetation section of the Flint Foothills analysis). The
stand conditions that supported the epidemic were a high component of mid- to late-seral lodgepole pine,
ponderosa pine and whitebark pine (about 17,500 acres).

Past Vegetation and Prescribed Fire Activities
The following discussion focuses on the past vegetation and prescribed fire activities in the Flint Foothills
Project area that contribute to the current condition. The past activities outside of the project boundary are
not included in the cumulative effects analyses, unless indicated specifically in a resource section.

Timber Harvest
Timber harvest likely began in the project area in the 1870s, and increased primarily in support of mining
activities in local areas such as the Rose Mine in the Dunkleberg drainage, with extensive logging
occurring on National Forest lands from 1906 through 1917; this pattern was likely common on all lands
within 50 miles of Butte and Anaconda (Losensky 1997). No data is available for the logging done during
this time period.
The data record for timber harvest begins in the 1950s. There is no known record prior to that date. Where
possible, the year of the timber sale termination date was used for the date of the activities in the tables
below. However, timber sale activities for a given timber sale can span several years and may overlap into
different decades. As with any record, there may be errors in recording; however, the data displayed
below represents the current data record. A summary of harvest by decade is contained in the Vegetation
section of the analysis.
The catalog of past projects (see project file) is comprehensive based on information available to the
Forest Service. However there may be some unintended omissions due to lack of current records or
knowledge. Information on past activities was gathered from the Forest Service Activity Tracking System
(FACTS), which is an activity tracking system for all levels of the Forest Service, District files, and
collective knowledge of local Forest Service employees.

31

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement – Volume 2 Appendices

Precommercial Thinning
Precommercial thinning of past harvest units began in the 1960s with the objective to reduce stand
densities and improve growing conditions for the retained trees. As with any record, there may be errors
in recording; however, the data displayed below represents the current data record. A summary of
precommercial thinning by decade is contained in the Vegetation section of the FEIS.
Prescribed Fire
The data record for prescribed fire begins in the 1950s. There is no known record prior to that date. Most
of the early records of prescribed fire are associated with timber sale activities—the disposal of activity
fuels left behind after logging. Some prescribed fire use has occurred to improve stand conditions for
certain vegetation species, such as removing conifer succession in grassland areas. As with any record,
there may be errors in recording; however, the data displayed below represents the current data record. A
summary of prescribed fire by decade is contained in the Vegetation section of the FEIS.

Present and Reasonably Foreseeable Actions
A discussion on cumulative effects and identification of the present and reasonably foreseeable actions
relevant to the Flint Foothills analysis are provided in the introduction to chapter 3 (FEIS Volume 1, table
26).

Wildlife Surveys
Surveys were done by Forest Service personnel across the project area, focusing on areas with proposed
treatments and areas of suitable habitat based on species-specific habitat requirements. For example,
flammulated owl surveys focused on areas proposed for treatment that included mature Douglas-fir; great
gray owl surveys focused on units adjacent to open areas (meadows etc.); and goshawk surveys on
historic nest sites. Attempts were made to follow up on reported raptor sightings; however these were
often too late in the season to adequately survey, so special mitigation was included for those units
(Wildlife project design features and mitigation measures, chapter 2).

Forest Plan TES Bird Nest Standard
Available references were reviewed to establish baseline limited operating periods and nest buffers. Sitespecific conditions may warrant some deviation, but this provides a common starting point. When
delineating a nest buffer on the ground, criteria that might be considered includes; homogeneity in the
surrounding vegetation (species, age, size class etc.), the distance of the nest tree to motorized use or
project activities, aspect and terrain of the stand; depending on the specific species being considered.

Flammulated Owl
Wright et al. (Bitterroot) and numerous Linkhart papers (Colorado) were reviewed, but did not find
information to help identify limited operating periods or nest buffers for this area. The following sources
had some information.
McCallum (BNA 1994): early May for nesting from ne OR and BC; end of July for average fledging
dates (5/1 – 7/30). Young stay within 100 m after fledging (328 ft) (area of 337,813 sq. ft. or 8 acres).
Begin to attempt gleaning in 2nd week after fledging, independent after 30 days (end of August)
Hayward and Verner (1994): Appear to be tolerant to disturbance, maybe moderate tolerance to
mechanical disturbance.
Reynolds and Linkhart (1987): CO, breeding adults located starting in early May, males arrive first, all
territories occupied by 3rd week of May. Selected nest sites by late May. Male home ranges from 11-18 ha
(27-44 acres). Young fledged in mid to late-July in CO. Owlets were independent by late August.
Linkhart 2001: flammulated owl fecundity is among the lowest and least variable of North American
owls, few replacement clutches.
Goggans 1985: study in Oregon, Ponderosa pine, ponderosa pine/Douglas-fir, mixed conifer. Initial nest
occupancy 12 June, mean fledging dates 26-28 July. Critical period is June 1 to July 31. 10 ha or 25-acre
male home range.
Based on all of these sources, 35 acres was selected for the nest buffer as it includes the nesting home
range and the area where fledglings are found immediately after fledging while they are flightless and

47

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement – Volume 2 Appendices

vulnerable. There was no information found on a buffer for disturbance, these owls appear to be fairly
tolerant of disturbance. The limited operating period is based on Reynolds and Linkhart – territories
occupied by 3rd week of May; and mid- August date accommodates the period post-fledging when owlets
are still found in the vicinity of the nest (BNA). After that they can fly and forage and are more
independent.

Bald Eagle
BEWG, 2010 – An addendum was prepared for the Montana Bald Eagle Management Guidelines (1994)
to address recent changes in federal bald eagle regulations. This addendum includes recommended
guidelines. The recommended primary seasonal restriction is from approximately February 1 through
August 15th and applies to construction, maintenance and forest management activities. The visual buffer
recommendation is to maintain existing visual buffers within ¼ mile of nest sites or ½ mile in the absence
of a visual buffer.

Peregrine Falcon
Peregrine Fund, 1995. Occupancy in Montana begins April 1 and fledging ends by late July.
Peregrine Falcon Recovery Team, 1977 – Prohibit disturbance and human activity (above those that
occurred historically) within a 0.50 mile of the nest between February 1 and August 1.
Based on the information found, April 1 to July 31 is the limited operating period, based on occupancy
dates in Montana. The buffer of 0.50 mile is consistent with the 1977 Recovery Plan.

Black-backed Woodpecker
Bonnot et al. 2006 – recommends no harvest June 1 to August 31 to prevent nests from being destroyed.
Identify a “nest area” as 12.5 m radius around the nest; this comes out to less than 1 acre.
No further information on a nest buffer, so fall back to the 1 acre nest area. Frequency of use of previous
year’s nests by black-backed woodpeckers was not found. This would likely apply if a nest happened to
be found immediately prior to operations (most likely in a burned area).

Northern Goshawk
R1 Overview 2009 (USDA Forest Service 2009) – This document reviewed the most current literature
and provides the best currently available information for determining limited operating periods and nest
buffers. See that document for more on literature cited.
Pairs usually return by March or early April. Clough (west central Montana, Flint Creek Mountains,
BDNF best available science for this area) noted beginning of incubation on May 5 and found fledged
young capable of sustained flight by Aug 10. Kennedy et al. found that during the fledgling dependency
period, nearly 90% of the juveniles locations were within 656 ft. of the nest tree, the approximate radius
of a 30-acre circular nest area. Fledgling movements outside of nest stand begin in mid-August. End of
breeding season noted as August 15th.
Nest area – mature, closed canopies (50-90%) and open understories. Average size varies, Reynolds et al.
(1992) recommended 30 acres; Clough reported 40 acres in west central Montana.
In the Considerations for Project Analysis section they recommend a minimum 40-acre nest stand, but
actual shape and size may vary based on the size of the stand, topography or other local conditions. They
also recommended timing restrictions from April 15 through August 15 in the PFA.

48

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement – Volume 2 Appendices

Based on the above information, a 40-acre buffer was selected as it includes all of the nest area noted by
Clough, and includes the area around the nest tree where juveniles would be found and agrees with the
Considerations section of the Overview. April 15 was selected because that is close to when goshawks
began incubation in the Flint Creek Mountains and agrees with the Considerations section of the
Overview; and August 15 as young are capable of sustained flight and move out of nest stand by midAugust based on Clough (as noted in the Overview).

Great Gray Owl
Quintana-Coyer et al. 2004 (Pacific Northwest) – begin incubation March 15, fledging July 15
MFWP Montana Field Guide – no information available from Montana, but information from other areas
shows that they begin nesting in March or April
Bull and Duncan 1993 (BNA) – Egg laying in March in OR and Manitoba, late March in CA, early May
in ID and WY. Late-March thru end July displayed on Breeding Cycle graphic.
Bull and Henjum -1990: Oregon egg-laying March 17 – April 17, young left nest by June 19. Males
continued to feed for 3 months after leaving nest (mid-Sept). Defend only immediate nest site. First week
after leaving the nest, the young stay within 200 m of nest (656 ft., area of 31 acres). Can fly within 2
weeks of leaving nest but use stands with high canopy cover.
Based on all of these sources, 30 acres was selected for the nest buffer as it includes the area where
fledglings are found immediately after fledging while they are flightless and vulnerable (no information
found on a buffer for disturbance). The limited operating period beginning in mid-March is consistent
with the majority of these sources; and mid- July date accommodates the period post-fledging when
owlets are still found in the vicinity of the nest. After that they can fly and forage and are more
independent.

ALL MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND ACTIVITIES (ALL)
The following objectives, standards and guidelines apply to management projects in lynx habitat in lynx analysis units (LAU) and in linkage areas, subject to valid
existing rights. They do not apply to wildfire suppression, or to wildland fire use
Standard43 ALL S1
New or expanded permanent developments and vegetation management
projects48 must maintain26 habitat connectivity16 in an LAU21 and/or linkage area22.
33

Guideline15 ALL G1
Methods to avoid or reduce effects on lynx should be used when constructing or
reconstructing highways18 or forest highways12 across federal land. Methods could
include fencing, underpasses or overpasses.
Standard LAU S1

Standard is met. No permanent developments associated with the project.
Dry Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine forests in lower elevations do not
provide suitable horizontal cover for hare and treatments in this forest type
are not expected to affect potential linkage. Proposed treatments in midelevation stands will diversify age classes and improve resiliency;
maintaining or promoting horizontal cover and improving connectivity within
the LAU in the long-term. Downed woody debris will be retained to meet Plan
direction, providing additional horizontal cover.
Not applicable- No highways or forest highways would be constructed or
reconstructed in this project.

Not applicable- No changes in the boundaries of LAUs would occur.

LAU21

Changes in
boundaries shall be based on site-specific habitat information
and after review by the Forest Service Regional Office.
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PROJETS (VEG)
The following objectives, standards and guidelines apply to vegetation management projects in lynx habitat in lynx analysis units (LAU). With the exception of
Objective VEG O3 that specifically concerns wildland fire use, the objectives, standards and guidelines do not apply to wildfire suppression, wildland fire use, or
removal of vegetation for permanent developments like mineral operations, ski runs, roads and the like. None of the objectives, standards, or guidelines apply to
linkage areas.

Northern Rockies Lynx Management Direction

Standard VEG S1 – Stand initiation structural stage limits
Standard VEG S1 applies to all vegetation management48 projects that
regenerate37 timber, except for fuel treatment13 projects within the wildland urban
interface (WUI) 49 as defined by HFRA, subject to the following limitation:
Fuel treatment projects within the WUI that do not meet Standards VEG S1, VEG
S2, VEG S5, and VEG S6 may occur on no more than 6 percent (cumulatively) of
lynx habitat on each administrative unit (a unit is a National Forest).
For fuel treatment projects within the WUI see guideline VEG G10.

Is direction applicable to this project and has it been met
(Yes or No and Met or Not Met)?
Where direction is applicable but has not been met, explain the
reason(s).

Standard Met - Though LAU 36 is close to 30% in stand initiation due
primarily to bark-beetles, no regeneration activities are proposed in
that LAU.
LAU 18= 5%
LAU 28= 2%
LAU 30= 18%
LAU 36= 29%

The Standard: Unless a broad scale assessment has been completed that
substantiates different historic levels of stand initiation structural stages44 limit
disturbance in each LAU as follows:
If more than 30 percent of the lynx habitat in an LAU is currently in a stand
initiation structural stage that does not yet provide winter snowshoe hare habitat,
no additional habitat may be regenerated by vegetation management projects.
Standard VEG S2 – Limits on regeneration from timber mgmt. projects
management48

Standard VEG S2 applies to all vegetation
projects that
regenerate37 timber, except for fuel treatment13 projects within the wildland urban
interface (WUI)49 as defined by HFRA, subject to the following limitation:

Standard is met – Percent of stands in regeneration status on NFS land for
each LAU is between 0 – 7 percent under both action alternatives.
None of the LAUs would exceed 15% regeneration harvest of lynx habitat
within 10 years.

Fuel treatment projects within the WUI49 that do not meet Standards VEG S1, VEG
S2, VEG S5, and VEG S6 may occur on no more than 6 percent (cumulatively) of
lynx habitat on each administrative unit (a unit is a National Forest).
For fuel treatment projects within the WUI49 see guideline VEG G10.
The Standard: Timber management projects shall not regenerate37 more than 15
percent of lynx habitat on NFS lands in an LAU in a ten-year period.
Standard VEG S5 – Precommercial thinning limits
Standard VEG S5 applies to all precommercial thinning35 projects, except for fuel
treatment13 projects that use precommercial thinning as a tool within the wildland
urban interface (WUI)49 as defined by HFRA, subject to the following limitation:

Standard is Met - Field review conducted in 2012 and 2015 shows that four
units (25P, 36P, 39P, 42P and 45P contain suitable snowshoe hare habitat.
The project has been modified to drop these units the more recent harvest

lynx habitat on each administrative unit (a unit is a National Forest).
For fuel treatment projects within the WUI49 see guideline VEG G10.
The Standard: Precommercial thinning projects that reduce snowshoe hare
habitat, may occur from the stand initiation structural stage44 until the stands no
longer provide winter snowshoe hare habitat only:
1. Within 200 feet of administrative sites, dwellings, or outbuildings; or
2. For research studies38 or genetic tree tests evaluating genetically improved
reforestation stock; or
Based on new information that is peer reviewed and accepted by the regional
levels of the Forest Service and FWS, where a written determination states:
that a project is not likely to adversely affect lynx; or
that a project is likely to have short term adverse effects on lynx or its habitat, but
would result in long-term benefits to lynx and its habitat; or
4. For conifer removal in aspen, or daylight thinning5 around individual aspen
trees, where aspen is in decline; or
5. For daylight thinning of planted rust-resistant white pine where 80 % of the
winter snowshoe hare habitat50 is retained; or
6. To restore whitebark pine.
Standard VEG S6 – Multi-storied stands & snowshoe hare horizontal cover
Standard VEG S6 applies to all vegetation management48 projects that
regenerate37 timber, except for fuel treatment13 projects within the wildland urban
interface (WUI)49 as defined by HFRA, subject to the following limitation:
Fuel treatment projects within the WUI49 that do not meet Standards VEG S1, VEG
S2, VEG S5, and VEG S6 may occur on no more than 6 percent (cumulatively) of
lynx habitat on each administrative unit (a unit is a National Forest).

Standard Met - Stands to be salvaged are dominated by lodgepole pine and
are not multi-storied stands. They are characterized by having very poorly
developed understories and lack horizontal cover. Stands where commercial
thinning and seed tree treatment is proposed are in dry Douglas-fir or
ponderosa pine stands that generally lack multi-storied canopy and
horizontal diversity. Therefore, commercial treatments meet this standard
under both action alternatives.
Walk thru stand exams and horizontal cover plot surveys identified several
harvest units and portions of the prescribed burn units with mature multi-

story habitat. These units were either dropped or boundaries were modified
to contain no ignition zones to avoid removing mature multi-story habitat;
thus, this standard is met.

Within 200 feet of administrative sites, dwellings, outbuildings, recreation sites,
and special use permit improvements, including infrastructure within permitted ski
area boundaries; or
2. For research studies38 or genetic tree tests evaluating genetically improved
reforestation stock; or
3. For incidental removal during salvage harvest41 (e.g. removal due to location of
skid trails).
(NOTE: Timber harvest is allowed in areas that have potential to improve winter
snowshoe hare habitat but presently have poorly developed understories that lack
dense horizontal cover [e.g. uneven age management systems could be used to
create openings where there is little understory so that new forage can grow]).
Guideline VEG G1 – Lynx habitat improvement
Vegetation management48 projects should be planned to recruit a high density of
conifers, hardwoods, and shrubs where such habitat is scarce or not available.
Priority should be given to stem-exclusion, closed-canopy structural stage44
stands for lynx or their prey (e.g. mesic, monotypic lodgepole stands).

Not applicable. Improving lynx habitat is not part of the purpose and need of
the project.

Winter snowshoe hare habitat50 should be near denning habitat6.
Guideline VEG G4 – Prescribed Fire

Guideline Met - No permanent travel routes or firebreaks will be constructed.

fire34

Prescribed
activities should not create permanent travel routes that facilitate
snow compaction. Constructing permanent firebreaks on ridges or saddles should
be avoided.
Guideline VEG G5 – Habitat for alternate prey species
Habitat for alternate prey species, primarily red

squirrel36,

should be provided in

Guideline Met. Habitat for red squirrels is being affected by mountain pine
beetle mortality. Mixed conifer stands will be less affected and will continue
to provide habitat.

Fuel treatment projects in the
as defined by
should be designed
considering standards VEG S1, S2, S5, and S6 to promote lynx conservation.
Guideline VEG G11 – Denning habitat
Denning habitat6 should be distributed in each LAU in the form of pockets of large
amounts of large woody debris, either down logs or root wads, or large piles of
small wind thrown trees (“jack-strawed” piles). If denning habitat appears to be
lacking in the LAU, then projects should be designed to retain some coarse woody
debris4, piles, or residual trees to provide denning habitat6 in the future.
LIVESTOCK MANAGEMENT (GRAZ)

Not applicable – Not a fuel treatment project. Reducing wildlife risk is not the
purpose of this project.

Guideline is Met - This project will not disturb large amounts of large woody
debris in the LAUs, and denning habitat (large woody debris) is not thought
to be limiting. Residual trees will be left following forest plan standards for
snags and woody debris.

Not applicable, this is not a grazing project.

The following objectives and guidelines apply to grazing projects in lynx habitat in
lynx analysis units (LAU). They do not apply to linkage areas.
Guideline GRAZ G1 – Livestock grazing and openings

Not applicable, this is not a grazing project.

In fire- and harvest-created openings, livestock grazing should be managed so
impacts do not prevent shrubs and trees from regenerating.
Guideline GRAZ G2 – Livestock grazing and aspen

Not applicable, this is not a grazing project.

In aspen stands, livestock grazing should be managed to contribute to the longterm health and sustainability of aspen.
Guideline GRAZ G3 – Livestock grazing and riparian areas & willow carrs

Northern Rockies Lynx Management Direction

Is direction applicable to this project and has it been met
(Yes or No and Met or Not Met)?
Where direction is applicable but has not been met, explain the
reason(s).

In shrub-steppe habitats42, livestock grazing should be managed in the elevation
ranges of forested lynx habitat in LAUs21, to contribute to maintaining or achieving
a preponderance of mid- or late-seral stages, similar to conditions that would have
occurred under historic disturbance regimes.
HUMAN USE PROJETS (HU)
The following objectives and guidelines apply to human use projects, such as special uses (other than grazing), recreation management, roads, highways,
mineral and energy development, in lynx habitat in lynx analysis units (LAU), subject to valid existing rights. They do not apply to vegetation management projects
or grazing projects directly. They do not apply to linkage areas.

Guideline HU G1 – Ski area expansion & development, inter-trail islands

Not applicable – Ski areas not considered in this proposal.

When developing or expanding ski areas, provisions should be made for
adequately sized inter-trail islands that include coarse woody debris4, so winter
snowshoe hare habitat49 is maintained.
Guideline HU G2 – Ski are expansion & development, foraging habitat

Not applicable - Ski areas not considered in this proposal.

When developing or expanding ski areas, foraging should be provided consistent
with the ski area’s operational needs, especially where lynx habitat occurs as
narrow bands of coniferous forest across mountain slopes.
Guideline HU G3 – Recreation developments

Not applicable- Recreation developments not considered in this proposal.

Recreation developments and operations should be planned in ways that both
provide for lynx movement and maintain the effectiveness of lynx habitat23.
Guideline HU G4 – Mineral & energy development

Not applicable- Mineral development not considered in this proposal.

For mineral and energy development sites and facilities, remote monitoring should
be encouraged to reduce snow compaction.

reclamation plan that restores39 lynx habitat should be developed.
Guideline HU G6 – Roads, upgrading

Not applicable- No roads would be upgraded in this proposal.

Methods to avoid or reduce effects to lynx should be used in lynx habitat when
upgrading unpaved roads to maintenance levels 4 or 5, if the result would be
increased traffic speeds and volumes, or a foreseeable contribution to increases in
human activity or development.
Guideline HU G7 – Roads, locations
New permanent roads should not be built on ridge-tops and saddles, or in areas
identified as important for lynx habitat connectivity16.

Guideline Met – new proposed road segments are not along ridgetops or saddles and are situated away from forested stringers where
feasible.

New permanent roads and trails should be situated away from forested stringers.
Guideline HU G8 – Roads, brushing
low-speed25,

Cutting brush along
low-traffic-volume roads should be done to the
minimum level necessary to provide for public safety.
Guideline HU G9 – Roads, new
On new roads built for projects, public motorized use should be restricted.
Effective closures should be provided in road designs. When the project is over,
these roads should be reclaimed or decommissioned, if not needed for other
management objectives.
Guideline HU G10 – Roads, ski area access

Guideline Met – Brushing associated with road maintenance will be restricted
to the road prism.

Guideline Met - New temporary roads will be closed to public use during
project activities and subsequently decommissioned. New FS system road
totaling 1.26 mi. will be closed to public use but available for infrequent
administrative access.

Not applicable- No ski area expansion under this proposal.

When developing or expanding ski areas and trails, access roads and lift termini to
maintain and provide lynx security10 habitat.
Guideline HU G11 – Snow compaction
Designated over-the-snow routes, or designated play areas, should not expand
outside baseline areas of consistent snow compaction1, unless designation serves
to consolidate use and improve lynx habitat. This is calculated on an LAU basis, or
on a combination of immediately adjacent LAUs.

Not applicable- No new over the snow routes would be developed under this
proposal.

Lynx Table Glossary
Areas of consistent snow compaction – An area of consistent snow compaction is an area of land or water that during winter is generally covered
with snow and gets enough human use that individual tracks are indistinguishable. In such places, compacted snow is evident most of the time,
except immediately after (within 48 hours) snowfall. These can be areas or linear routes, and are generally found in near snowmobile or crosscountry ski routes, in adjacent openings, parks and meadows, near ski huts or plowed roads, or in winter parking areas. Areas of consistent snow
compaction will be determined based on the area or miles used in 1998 to 2000.

57

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement – Volume 2 Appendices

Broad scale assessment – A broad scale assessment is a synthesis of current scientific knowledge, including a description of uncertainties and
assumptions, to provide an understanding of past and present conditions and future trends, and a characterization of the ecological, social and
economic components of an area. (LCAS)
3
Carr – Deciduous woodland or shrub land occurring on permanently wet, organic soil. (LCAS)
4
Course woody debris – Any piece(s) of dead woody material, e.g., dead boles, limbs, and large root masses on the ground or in streams. (LCAS)
5
Daylight thinning – Daylight thinning is a form of precommercial thinning that removes the trees and brush inside a given radius around a tree.
6
Denning habitat (lynx) – Denning habitat is the environment lynx use when giving birth and rearing kittens until they are mobile. The most
common component is large amounts of coarse woody debris to provide escape and thermal cover for kittens. Denning habitat must be within
daily travel distance of winter snowshoe hare habitat – the typical maximum daily distance for females is about three to six miles. Denning habitat
includes mature and old growth24 forests with plenty of coarse woody debris. It can also include young regenerating forests with piles of coarse
woody debris, or areas where down trees are jack-strawed.
7
Designated over-the-snow routes – Designated over-the-snow routes are routes managed under permit or agreement or by the agency, where
use is encouraged, either by on-the-ground marking or by publication in brochures, recreation opportunity guides or maps (other than travel maps)
or in electronic media produced or approved by the agency. The routes identified in outfitter and guide permits are designated by definition;
groomed routes also are designated by definition. The determination of baseline snow compaction will be based on the miles of designated overthe-snow routes authorized, promoted or encouraged in 1998 to 2000.
8
Designated route – A designated route is a road or trail that has been identified as open for specified travel use.
9
Developed recreation – Developed recreation requires facilities that result in concentrated use. For example, skiing requires lifts, parking lots,
buildings and roads; campgrounds require roads, picnic tables and toilet facilities.
10
Security habitat (lynx) – Security habitat amounts to places in lynx habitat that provide secure winter bedding sites for lynx in highly disturbed
landscapes like ski areas. Security habitat gives lynx the ability to retreat from human disturbance. Forest structures that make human access
difficult generally discourage human activity in security habitats. Security habitats are most effective if big enough to provide visual and acoustic
insulation and to let lynx easily move away from any intrusion. They must be close to winter snowshoe hare habitat. (LCAS)
11
Fire use – Fire use is the combination of wildland fire use and using prescribed fire to meet resource objectives. (NIFC) Wildland fire use is the
management of naturally ignited wildland fires to accomplish resource management objectives in areas that have a fire management plan. The
use of the term wildland fire use replaces the term prescribed natural fire. (Wildland and Prescribed Fire Management Policy, August 1998)
12
Forest highway – A forest highway is a forest road under the jurisdiction of, and maintained by, a public authority and open to public travel (USC:
Title 23, Section 101(a)), designated by an agreement with the FS, state transportation agency and Federal Highway Administration.
13
Fuel treatment – A fuel treatment is a management action that reduces the threat of ignition and fire intensity or rate of spread, or is used to
restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
14
Goal – A goal is a broad description of what an agency is trying to achieve, found in a land management plan. (LCAS)
15
Guideline – A guideline is a particular management action that should be used to meet an objective found in a land management plan. The
rationale for deviations may be documented, but amending the plan is not required. (LCAS modified)
16
Habitat connectivity (lynx) – Habitat connectivity consists of an adequate amount of vegetation cover arranged in a way that allows lynx to move
around. Narrow forested mountain ridges or shrub-steppe plateaus may serve as a link between more extensive areas of lynx habitat; wooded
riparian areas may provide travel cover across open valley floors. (LCAS)

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement – Volume 2 Appendices

HFRA (Healthy Forests Restoration Act) - Public Law 108-148, passed in December 2003. The HFRA provides statutory processes for
hazardous fuel reduction projects on certain types of at-risk National Forest System and Bureau of Land Management lands. It also provides other
authorities and direction to help reduce hazardous fuel and restore healthy forest and rangeland conditions on lands of all ownerships. (Modified
from Forest Service HFRA web site.)
18
Highway – The word highway includes all roads that are part of the National Highway System. (23 CFR 470.107(b))
19 Horizontal cover – Horizontal cover is the visual obscurity or cover provided by habitat structures that extend to the ground or snow surface
primarily provided by tree stems and tree boughs, but also includes herbaceous vegetation, snow, and landscape topography. Horizontal cover
was measured by John Squires et al. (pers. com.) in Northwestern Montana according to the following methodology:
“A canvas cover-board (2 m x 0.5 m) was erected 10 m from plot center in 4 directions (forward track, back track, and at 2, 90° angles) was read
to directly measure horizontal cover. The cover board was divided into 4, 0.5 meter blocks and each block was further dividend into quarters. At
each reading, technicians estimated horizontal cover by 10% class at each of the 4 heights; these 4 estimates were then averaged for an overall
estimate of that reading.” (According to Squires via pers. com., cover measured during the summer period averaged approximately 65% while at
den sites it was measured at roughly 85%. During the winter period cover was measured at 45% while at winter kill sites it was slightly greater
than 50%.)
20
Isolated mountain range – Isolated mountain ranges are small mountains cut off from other mountains and surrounded by flatlands. On the east
side of the Rockies, they are used for analysis instead of sub-basins. Examples are the Little Belts in Montana and the Bighorns in Wyoming.
21
LAU (Lynx Analysis Unit) – An LAU is an area of at least the size used by an individual lynx, from about 25 to 50 square miles (LCAS). An LAU is
a unit for which the effects of a project would be analyzed; its boundaries should remain constant.
22
Linkage area – A linkage area provides connectivity between blocks of lynx habitat. Linkage areas occur both within and between geographic
areas, where basins, valleys or agricultural lands separate blocks of lynx habitat, or where lynx habitat naturally narrows between blocks. (LCAS
updated definition approved by the Steering Committee 10/23/01)
23
Lynx habitat – Lynx habitat occurs in mesic coniferous forest that experience cold, snowy winters and provide a prey base of snowshoe hare. In
the northern Rockies, lynx habitat is generally occurs between 3,500 and 8,000 feet of elevation, and primarily consists of lodgepole pine,
subalpine fir and Engelmann spruce. It may consist of cedar-hemlock in extreme northern Idaho, northeastern Washington and northwestern
Montana, or of Douglas fir on moist sites at higher elevations in central Idaho. It may also consist of cool, moist Douglas fir, grand fir, western larch
and aspen when interspersed in subalpine forests. Dry forests do not provide lynx habitat. (LCAS)
24
Lynx habitat in an unsuitable condition –Lynx habitat in an unsuitable condition consists of lynx habitat in the stand initiation structural stage
where the trees are generally less than ten to 30 years old and have not grown tall enough to protrude above the snow during winter. Stand
replacing fire or certain vegetation management projects can create unsuitable conditions. Vegetation management projects that can result in
unsuitable habitat include clearcuts and seed tree harvest, and sometimes shelterwood cuts and commercial thinning depending on the resulting
stand composition and structure. (LCAS)
25
Low-speed, low-traffic-volume road – Low speed is less than 20 miles per hour; low volume is a seasonal average daily traffic load of less than
100 vehicles per day.
26
Maintain – In the context of this amendment, maintain means to provide enough lynx habitat to conserve lynx. It does not mean to keep the
status quo.
27
Maintenance level – Maintenance levels define the level of service provided by and maintenance required for a road. (FSH 7709.58, Sec 12.3)
Maintenance level 4 is assigned to roads that provide a moderate degree of user comfort and convenience at moderate travel speeds. Most level
4 roads have double lanes and aggregate surfaced. Some may be single lane; some may be paved or have dust abated. Maintenance level 5 is
17

59

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement – Volume 2 Appendices

assigned to roads that provide a high degree of user comfort and convenience. Normally, roads are double-lane and paved, but some may be
aggregate surfaced with the dust abated.
28
Mid-seral or later – Mid-seral is the successional stage in a plant community that’s the midpoint as it moves from bare ground to climax. For
riparian areas, it means willows or other shrubs have become established. For shrub-steppe areas, it means shrubs associated with climax are
present and increasing in density.
29
Multi-story mature or late successional forest – This stage is similar to the old multistory structural stage (see below). However, trees are
generally not as old and decaying trees may be somewhat less abundant.
30
Objective – An objective is a statement in a land management plan describing desired resource conditions and intended to promote achieving
programmatic goals. (LCAS)
31
Old multistory structural stage – Many age classes and vegetation layers mark the old forest, multistoried stage. It usually contains large old
trees. Decaying fallen trees may be present that leave a discontinuous overstory canopy. On cold or moist sites without frequent fires or other
disturbance, multi-layer stands with large trees in the uppermost layer develop. (Oliver and Larson, 1996)
32
Old growth – Old growth forests generally contain trees that are large for their species and site, and are sometimes decadent with broken tops.
Old growth often contains a variety of tree sizes, large snags and logs, and a developed and often patchy understory.
33
Permanent development – A permanent development is any development that results in a loss of lynx habitat for at least 15 years. Ski trails,
parking lots, new permanent roads, structures, campgrounds and many special use developments would be considered permanent developments.
34
Prescribed fire – A prescribed fire is any fire ignited as a management action to meet specific objectives. A written, approved prescribed fire plan
must exist, and NEPA requirements met, before ignition. The term replaces management ignited prescribed fire. (NWCG)
35
Precommercial thinning – Precommercial thinning is mechanically removing trees to reduce stocking and concentrate growth on the remaining
trees, and not resulting in immediate financial return. (Dictionary of Forestry)
36
Red squirrel habitat – Red squirrel habitat consists of coniferous forests of seed and cone-producing age that usually contain snags and downed
woody debris, generally associated with mature or older forests.
37
Regeneration harvest – The cutting of trees and creating an entire new age class; an even-age harvest. The major methods are clearcutting,
seed tree, shelterwood, and group selective cuts (Helms 1998).
38
Research – Research consists of studies conducted to increase scientific knowledge or technology. For the purposes of Standards VEG S5 and
VEG S6, research applies to studies financed from the forest research budget (FSM 4040) and administrative studies financed from the NF
budget.
39
Restore, restoration – To restore is to return or re-establish ecosystems or habitats to their original structure and species composition.
(Dictionary of Forestry)
40
Riparian area – An area with distinctive soil and vegetation between a stream or other body of water and the adjacent upland; includes wetlands
and those portions of floodplains and valley bottoms that support riparian vegetation. (LCAS)
41
Salvage harvest – Salvage harvest is a commercial timber sale of dead, damaged or dying trees. It recovers economic value that would
otherwise be lost. Collecting firewood for personal use is not considered salvage harvest.
42
Shrub steppe habitat – Shrub steppe habitat consists of dry sites with shrubs and grasslands intermingled.
43
Standard – A standard is a required action in a land management plan specifying how to achieve an objective or under what circumstances to
refrain from taking action. A plan must be amended to deviate from a standard.

60

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement – Volume 2 Appendices

Stand initiation structural stage – The stand initiation stage generally develops after a stand-replacing disturbance by fire or regeneration timber
harvest. A new single-story layer of shrubs, tree seedlings and saplings establish and develop, reoccupying the site. Trees that need full sun are
likely to dominate these even-aged stands. (Oliver and Larson, 1996)
45
Stem exclusion structural stage – In the stem exclusion stage, trees initially grow fast and quickly occupy all of the growing space, creating a
closed canopy. Because the trees are tall, little light reaches the forest floor so understory plants (including smaller trees) are shaded and grow
more slowly. Species that need full sunlight usually die; shrubs and herbs may become dormant. New trees are precluded by a lack of sunlight or
moisture. (Oliver and Larson, 1996)
46
Timber management – Timber management consists of growing, tending, commercially harvesting and regenerating crops of trees.
47
Understory re-initiation structural stage – In the understory re-initiation stage, a new age class of trees gets established after overstory trees
begin to die, are removed or no longer fully occupy their growing space after tall trees abrade each other in the wind. Understory seedlings then
re-grow and the trees begin to stratify into vertical layers. A low to moderately dense uneven-aged overstory develops, with some small shadetolerant trees in the understory. (Oliver and Larson, 1996)
48
Vegetation management projects – Vegetation management projects change the composition and structure of vegetation to meet specific
objectives, using such means as prescribed fire and timber harvest. For the purposes of this amendment, the term does not include removing
vegetation for permanent developments like mineral operations, ski runs, roads and the like, and does not apply to fire suppression or to wildland
fire use.
49
Wildland urban interface (WUI) - The area adjacent to an at-risk community that is identified in the community wildfire protection plan. If there is
no community wildfire protection plan in place, the WUI is the area 0.5 mile from the boundary of an at-risk community or within 1.5 miles of the
boundary of an at-risk community. The WUI could also include areas if the terrain is steep, or there is a nearby road or ridge top that could be
incorporated into a fuel break, or the land is in condition class 3, or the area contains an emergency exit route needed for safe evacuations.
(Condensed from HFRA. For full text see HFRA § 101.)
50
Winter snowshoe hare habitat – Winter snowshoe hare habitat consists of places where young trees or shrubs grow dense – thousands of
woody stems per acre – and tall enough to protrude above the snow during winter, so hares can browse on the bark and small twigs (Ruediger et
al. 2000). Winter snowshoe hare habitat develops primarily in the stand initiation, understory reinitiation and old forest multistoried structural stage.

Comments on the Flint Foothills DEIS and Forest Service Responses

Concern

Comment: Unlike the References Section Contained in the DEIS, the Opposing Views Attached to these
Comments Describe the Resource Degradation Inflicted to the Forest Ecosystem caused by Logging and Road
Construction.
The attachments to these comments present the “responsible” opposing views of hundreds of independent,
unbiased Ph.D. biological scientists who describe the resource damage caused by the majority of commercial
timber and road construction sale activities taken at any location, on any topography, at any elevation, at any time.
The Responsible Official’s response to each of these opposing views is governed by 40 C.F.R. § 1502.9(a) and
1502.9(b). You will not like these 2 laws but I’d suggest reading them anyway. They will spoil your beliefs that the
pesky public must not interfere when you propose to pillage their forest for corporate gain.
This member of the public has provided the electronic links to the source documents for each opposing view.
Response: The “opposing views” provided by the commenter are a mix of editorials, research, and opinions. Each
piece was reviewed and determined if the topic and/ or content was relevant or not to the Flint Foothills project.
For reference, 40 C.F.R. § 1502.9(a) and 1502.9(b). - Draft, final, and supplemental statements:
“Except for proposals for legislation as provided in 1506.8 environmental impact statements shall be prepared in

Comments on the Flint Foothills DEIS and Forest Service Responses
Comment: It violates the law to give the public a skewed (one sided) description of the environmental effects of a
proposed project as you have done in this DEIS. I suggest you become familiar with the meaning of “hard look.”
You should also read the Administrative Procedures Act.

Concern

Response: Each resource area considered the best available science applicable to the project area and the type
of actions proposed. Both detrimental and beneficial effects are discussed.
Selectively citing USFS employee-authored literature because it supports the project and rejecting other non-USFS
authored literature that explains the massive resource damage caused by logging is worse than unethical. Read
the biased References section of the Flint Foothills DEIS and you will immediately realize the need to include some
of the opposing views source documents contained in Attachments #1 and #4.
Comment: The opposing views quoted in Attachment #1 were authored and/or signed by 237 different unbiased
Ph.D. biological scientists with no connection to the USDA. Does it surprise you that about 77% of the source
documents listed in the References section of this DEIS that drove the project are authored by USDA employees
with financial incentives to portray logging as ecosystem-friendly? Intelligent Americans will immediately detect
bias towards logging in the References.
Comment: The opposing views quoted in Attachment #4 were authored and/or signed by 52 different unbiased
Ph.D. biological scientists with no connection to the USDA. They indicate that road construction inflicts more
resource damage than any logging-related activity.
Comment: The attachments contain statements by over 500 nationally recognized Ph.D. biological scientists who
describe how and why logging and road construction inflict long-term, irreversible damage to countless natural
resources in the forest. Of course Forest Supervisors and District Rangers who manage the public land in a
competent manner they would halt all commercial timber sales their jobs would be in jeopardy. This provides a
financial incentive to harm the natural resources in the forest with unneeded commercial timber sales.
Response: Effects from road construction are addressed in the Sensitive Plant, Invasive Plant, Wildlife, Soils,
Hydrology, Aquatics, Scenic Resources, and the Roadless sections of the DEIS, Each resource specialist
considered the best available science applicable to the project area and the type of actions proposed, based on
their best professional judgment. In addition, alternative 3 was developed to exclude new road construction, based
on scoping comments.
Comment: Does the Responsible Official believe their TMA and silviculturist know more about the ecological
impacts of logging and roading than the 500 scientists quoted in the attachments? Yes or No. Please explain.
Response: No, the TMA nor silviculturist believes they know more than 500 scientists. All of the attachments have
been thoroughly reviewed by the project silviculturist for their pertinence to the project. In the case of the scientist’s
quoted for Silviculture and Ecological concerns, there are a total of 8 scientists quoted, and the project silviculturist
reviewing the quotes for applicability to the project found 2 scientists that had pertinent quotes, and with that
relevance the comment would be considered in the analysis. Many of the quotes provided were not from scientists
or from peer reviewed scientific literature, rather were from individuals expressing opinion, in such places as
newspaper opinion pages. Other scientifically-based quotes provided were from dramatically divergent forest
ecosystems, such as coastal riverine systems, rather than the dry Continental climate that the project area occurs.
Comment: After reading the quotes in the attachments does the Responsible Official feel comfortable basing his

64

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement – Volume 2 Appendices

Letter

Comments on the Flint Foothills DEIS and Forest Service Responses
decision to proceed with the Flint Foothills timber sale based on the advice of the TMA and silviculturist? This
rejects the research conclusions of 500 scientists. Why does this reflect sound decision making? Do you
understand the meaning of “lying by omission”?

Concern

Response: All of the statements have been reviewed and identified whether or not they are relevant to the Flint
Foothills analysis; the Responsible Official feels comfortable basing the decision on this analysis. In some cases,
there was relevance, and the quote provided would be considered in this analysis. In many cases, the quotes
provided were not from scientists or from peer reviewed scientific literature; rather the quotes were from individuals
in such places as opinion pages in newspapers. All views, including opposing views are considered in the analysis,
and in the decision making process; hence the public process that the Forest Service conducts. Sound decisions
are reached after exhaustive analysis of all relevant science and all public comments. Differing conclusions from
due consideration of the entirety of the analysis doesn’t necessarily mean one is lying by omission, rather a
different conclusion has been reached
Comment: Please do not discount the scientist’s observations by claiming:
1) There will be no compelling, major adverse natural resource impacts because the timber sale planning is guided
by BMPs and the Forest Plan unless the Responsible Official identifies the specific guidance, where it is applied
and how the guidance will mitigate the likely impact to the resources.
Response: The project design features and mitigation measures, including BMPs, are provided in the DEIS, pp.
49-59. These features are integral to the actions, and are incorporated into the environmental analysis throughout
the environmental consequences section of the DEIS and FEIS.
3

2) Claiming they are not site-specific to this timber sale. All the damage discussed by the scientists is clearly
intended to apply in all cases where an action occurs. If the Responsible Official still claims the scientists’
predictions do not apply because they are not sit-specific then the Responsible Official must not include literature
in the References section of the final NEPA document that does not mention the name “Flint Foothills.”
Response: Each citation provided in the opposing science attachments was reviewed and a determination was
made as to whether it was or was not applicable to the Flint Foothills analysis and why.
3) Rejecting the opposing views because they are “opinions” won’t work. View and opinion are synonyms.
Response: All opposing science citations were reviewed and considered, including opinion pieces.

3

Comment: The Responsible Official must “base decisions on a consideration of the relevant factors and must
“engage in a substantial inquiry into the facts, one that is searching and careful.” When the Responsible Official
fails to cite literature in the References section of the DEIS describing the likely adverse effects of logging-related
activities he does not consider the relevant factors. What he clearly has put into motion is a well-used USFS
strategy to deceive the public into believing science supports projects like this one.
Response: The References sections of the DEIS, pp. 428-451 and FEIS, pp. x-y lists all of the literature cited in
the analysis, and includes literature that addresses adverse effects due to logging-related activities.
Each resource area considered the best available science applicable to the project area and the type of actions
proposed. Adverse effects, as well as beneficial effects are described. The following citations considered or used

Comment: Figure it out Myers. As you read the statements of hundreds of scientists who describe multiple ways
the forest’s natural resources are trashed by commercial logging at any location… who will a District Court Judge
believe? Will he/she believe a person whose promotion potential depends on offering timber to the resource
extraction corporations, or hundreds of unbiased scientists with nothing to gain when they testify?

Concern

Comment: Harvesting Dead Lodgepole Pine to Eliminate Mountain Pine Beetle Activity in the Project Area is not
Effective and Eliminates the Beneficial Resource Benefits Caused by this Natural Disturbance Event
Insect activity in mature lodgepole pine LPP (80+ years) is part of the natural cycle of this tree species. Given that
LPP has serotinous cones, insect activity and subsequent fire is the natural process that allows LPP regeneration.
It’s supposed to happen Myers!
Stands of LPP contain key habitat for a variety of birds and mammals unavailable in other forest ecosystems.
LPP is a native species in the area of the proposed project. Wiping out the species is irresponsible.

3

Response: Insect activity in mature lodgepole pine is part of the natural cycle of this trees species, and certainly
lodgepole pine has adapted to disturbances such as fire and insects with its serotinous cone. In fact, evidence that
this relationship of pine and beetle has been going in for over thousands of years. Paleoecological reconstructions
from two lakes in the Northern Rockies revealed a presence of what was most likely mountain pine beetle. These
beetle remains date back as far as 8,529 BP (before present), and occur at different time intervals; occurrence of
these macrofossils suggest that when beetle populations reach epidemic levels, beetle remains may be found in
lake sediments (Brunelle et al. 2008).
The importance of dead lodgepole pine as key habitat is also thoroughly recognized and analyzed with this project
(DEIS pages 151-153, 176, 180-184, and 240-241).
Lodgepole pine is a native species in the project area; however, the project is not wiping out the species. There is
a total of 16,949 acres of mid to late seral lodgepole pine (DEIS pg. 79) in the project area that is currently affected
by mountain pine beetle – the majority of these stands have high amounts of beetle-caused lodgepole pine
mortality. The highest acre amount proposed with lodgepole pine salvaged is with Alternative 2, which is 1,163
acres. The proposed removal of dead standing lodgepole pine reflects the removal of snags for wildlife habitat;
however all Forest Plan standards for snag retention would be complied with. Additionally, what would remain is
15,786 acres of lodgepole pine stands within the project area that would continue to function as dead standing
habitat, until it falls to the ground, where it would then continue to provide jack-strawed, downed woody habitat in
the future. As far as the 1,163 acres of lodgepole removal, those acres would see natural regeneration of
lodgepole pine through the serotinous cones on the ground (known success rate of 94 percent on the Forest, DEIS
pg. 100) with desired regeneration levels typically reached within three years of harvest. This shouldn’t be viewed
as wiping out the species.

I strongly suggest that the Responsible Official stop interfering with Mother Nature. Let the LPP go through its
natural life cycle. Please do not allow perceived human benefits to disrupt the natural cycles in the forest. In this
case, death sets the stage for life.
Comment: Harvesting dead and dying LPP will not stop the spread of the Mountain Pine Beetle. The insects have
been there and have moved on.
Comment: Harvesting dead and dying LPP to avoid fires stop the life cycle of LPP.

Comments on the Flint Foothills DEIS and Forest Service Responses
Comment: Harvesting dead and dying LPP increases the fire hazard. Many foresters choose not to believe this
fact. The following article explains this natural process:

Concern

Response: There is no effort by this project to stop the spread of mountain pine beetle. The beetle has not entirely
moved on; most of the pine trees have been killed by the beetle, but beetle mortality continues as the last few live
trees are being affected by the beetle.
There is no effort by this project to avoid fires through harvesting dead and dying lodgepole pine. Harvesting
through salvage actions on 1,163 acres out of the 16,949 acres of mid- to late-seral lodgepole pine would not stop
fires, but would change fire behavior in acres that see no harvest (DEIS pages 90 and 91).
Any type of harvest system that occurs can reduce the risk of crown fire behavior, but without treating the surface
fuels created by harvest, intense surface wildfire may result, negating the positive effects of reducing crown fire
potential (Graham et al. 1999). This project is not designed to change the potential for wildfire, but recognizes that
with changes in fuel profiles, wildfire behavior would change. The project proposals include treatment of surface
fuels created by harvest to ensure that harvest does not contribute to wildfire potential (DEIS pages 95-101).
Beetle Hysteria Again
Some foresters think a tiny tree-killing beetle is heightening the risk of big wildfires. They should think again.
Published in NewWest, 6/30/09
Link to article: http://www.newwest.net/city/article/beetle_hysteria_again/C8/L8/
Comment: Harvesting dead and dying LPP creates unacceptable natural resource damage within the cutting
units.
Any normal, healthy, fully functioning forest has some stands of trees that die from insect and disease activity.

3

All healthy forests pass through periods when some conifer tree species in some areas become “degraded” by
natural disturbance events. Healthy forests are not static. This life/death cycle is natural for healthy forests and
should not be interrupted.
Every (emphasis added) healthy population of living things has dying individuals.
Comment: Action should not be taken to reduce the insect induced mortality to conifer trees. Such natural
disturbance events are necessary to maintain the forest’s biological diversity. Insect activity is an indicator of a
healthy properly functioning forest. Leaving these dead and dying trees in the forest is orders of magnitude more
important than corporate profit.
Trees killed by insect activity are important habitat for scores of wildlife species.
Trees killed by insect activity provide the organic matter to replenish and enrich mineral soils.
Indeed, dead and dying trees have great ecological value in the forest. These conditions cannot be artificially
created after the dead and dying trees are removed.
Response: Harvest activities do result in disturbing effects – resource damage. Project design features and

mitigation measures (DEIS pages 49-60) are an integral part of this proposal to either moderate or alleviate effects
caused by the proposed actions, thereby reducing the effects to levels that are acceptable.

Concern

Insect activity in mature lodgepole pine is part of the natural cycle of this trees species; evidence that this
relationship of pine and beetle has been going in for over thousands of years. Paleoecological reconstructions from
two lakes in the Northern Rockies revealed a presence of what was most likely mountain pine beetle. These beetle
remains date back as far as 8,529 BP (before present), and occur at different time intervals; occurrence of these
macrofossils suggest that when beetle populations reach epidemic levels, beetle remains may be found in lake
sediments (Brunelle et al. 2008). This project has no intentions of curtailing either current or future insect activities,
only the objective to create more resilient forests to natural disturbances such as bark beetles and fire.
The importance of dead lodgepole pine as key habitat is also thoroughly recognized and analyzed with this project
(DEIS pages 151-153, 176, 180-184, and 240-241).
There is a total of 16,949 acres of mid to late seral lodgepole pine (DEIS pg. 79) in the project area that is currently

Comment: In Chapter 3 of the final DEIS please discuss how some natural resources located near the timber sale
area will be adversely affected by eradicating the Mountain Pine Beetle in the LPP stands in the timber sale area.

Please see Attachments #5 and #14.
Response: There are no efforts with the project, either immediately or in the future, to eradicate mountain pine
beetle in the lodgepole pine stands in the timber sale area.
Comment: The Responsible Official does not analyze an alternative in detail that treats the area with the
pheromone Verbenone. The effectiveness of this treatment is discussed at the links below:
http://www.kill-pine-beetles.com/
http://www.mountain-pine-beetle.com/

http://csfs.colostate.edu/pages/mountain-pine-beetle.html
http://www.contech-inc.com/products/pinebeetle/
I will expect such an alternative to be analyzed in detail in the final EIS
Response: Three out of the four links provided are commercial sites that wish to sell their verbenone product. The
Colorado State site is informative, and when you read their document on the use of verbenone, they state that the
produce has proven to work very well in endemic situations, but does not work at all with epidemic situations;

70

Letter

Comments on the Flint Foothills DEIS and Forest Service Responses
additionally, “research has shown mixed results on the use of this anti-aggregant pheromone in a natural forest
setting”.

Concern

The most recent research has shown, over a 3- to 7-year period, that “verbenone reduced mountain pine beetle
infestation of lodgepole pine trees in treated areas when populations built gradually or when outbreaks in
surrounding untreated forests were of moderate severity; verbenone did not protect trees when mountain pine
beetle populations rabidly increase (Progar et al. 2013)”.
The purpose of the harvest of lodgepole pine with this proposal is not to protect existing live lodgepole pine trees
from beetle kill, rather it is to salvage dead and dying lodgepole pine (DEIS pg. 4). In addition, much of the project
area is comprised with dead and dying lodgepole pine, with very little left alive to protect (DEIS pg. 74). Lastly, the
project area is part of a larger epidemic (DEIS pg. 73).
It is not reasonable to create a new alternative with verbenone treatment when the lack of effectiveness of the
pheromone in epidemic situations is acknowledged by the scientific community, and when the purpose of the
project with the lodgepole pine component is to salvage already dead trees, where the pheromone would have
zero effectiveness.
Comment: Scientific Research done Since the USFS Pesticide Safety EIS was Completed shows that Pesticides
like the ones Being Proposed for use on this Sale to Control Noxious Weeds is Driving the Honeybee to Extinction
The DEIS indicates at page 68 says:
“Spraying to control weeds is expected to continue in the project area. Existing invasive plant infestations within
the project area are currently being treated with herbicides annually.”
Chapter 3 of the DEIS fails to mention that spraying the herbicides indicated will continue the honeybee decline.
This is clearly the most significant adverse effect on the human environment that’s occurring on earth today!. And
guess what Myers. You look the other way.

3

Comment: I will expect to see the tragic herbicide impacts to bees disclosed in Chapter 3 of the final EIS, or I will
expect the ROD to specifically state that no chemicals will be used to control non-native vegetation species.
Response: The appropriate integrated pest management actions for noxious weeds are provided in the 2002
Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest Noxious Weed Control Final Environmental Impact Statement and Record
of Decision. The Flint Foothills Project does not address the question of whether or not to spray noxious weeds, or
which treatments are appropriate. The Forest Plan states forestwide goals and objectives to prevent, reduce or
eliminate infestations of non-native or noxious weed species (pp. 43-44).
The effect of spot weed treatments is not analyzed in the FEIS for the following reasons:
1.) Most studies about pesticide poisoning of honey bees are related to agricultural spraying of crops for other
pests (insects). Some of these studies do show that crop spraying may cause pesticide kills to adjacent bees. The
Forest does not spray an area repeatedly, year after year with pesticides targeting other insects (other than our
campgrounds for Mountain pine beetle). On a landscape level, the Forest Service spot sprays invasive plants with
herbicides that target plants, not insects.
2.) EPA has evaluated each active ingredient and formulation and has deemed that these herbicides can be used

71

Letter

Comments on the Flint Foothills DEIS and Forest Service Responses
as labeled without unacceptable risk to non-target organisms. The focus for acceptable and unacceptable risk is
the effect on the population, not individual bees.

Concern

3.) Most honey bees will not travel more than 1.5 miles away from their apiary and the BDNF does not allow honey
bee apiaries.
Comment:20. The importance of hiding cover for bull elk security is likely more stringent that referenced in Hillis et
al. (1991) as his analysis area had much more extensive hiding cover. East of the divide, larger blocks and
percentages of elk security blocks may be required; as they are more limited on the landscape. Why isn't this the
case?
6

2

Response: The Flint Foothills project area is located west of the Continental Divide. As noted in the response to
comment 19 above, there is a growing body of science post Hillis and Christensen that increasingly supports roads
management as the key metric in managing for elk where they are hunted. Hayes (2002) and Proffitt (2013) on
either side of the Continental Divide substantiate in our view the reasonableness of roads management to provide
for elk. Fixating on Hillis et al.(1991) is not consistent with maintaining awareness of more recent science as
exemplified by Unsworth et al.(1993), Hayes et al.(2002) , Cook et al.(2005), Rumble and Gamo (2011), and
Proffitt et al. (2013) ”ProffiProffi
Comment: 1. How effective have BMPs been at stopping (i.e. preventing) new weed infestations from starting
during logging and related road operations?
Response: The Forest has observed good results when best management practices are strictly followed. Forest
plan monitoring reports (2006-2007) demonstrate that BMPs are effective in reducing noxious weed spread.

Comment: 3. Why isn’t the Forest Service considering a Forest Plan amendment in this Project to amend the
Forest Plan to include binding legal standards that address noxious weeds?

2

Response: The Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest Noxious Weed Control Final Environment Impact
Statement and Record of Decision (May 2002), as well as current weed treatments, are consistent with numerous
laws, regulations, agency directives and the 2009 Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest Land and Resource
Management Plan (see pages Rod5-8 of the Noxious Weed EIS.) Therefore, a Forest Plan amendment is not
required.
Comment: 5. How can the Forest Service be complying with NFMA’s requirement to maintain biodiversity if it has
no legal standards that address noxious weeds
Response: The Beaverhead-Deerlodge does have legal standards to address noxious weed issues (see letter 2
comment #3).
Comment: 2. Is it true that new roads are the number one cause of new noxious weed infestations?

2

Response: We are not aware of any literature that states that roads are the number one cause of noxious weed
infestations. However, there is a lot of literature that says roads and/or new roads are a potential vector for new
infestations. There are also dozens of other vectors. We can get massive infestations with or without roads. There

features and mitigation measures as stated in the FEIS in chapter 2 would be implemented for the action
alternatives, and would reduce the risk of new noxious weed infestations.

Concern

Comment: 4. Is it true that noxious weeds are one of the top threats to biodiversity on our National Forests?

2

Response: It is true that invasive species, be it spotted knapweed in Montana or the Burmese python in Florida,
are a top threat to biodiversity and ecosystem health in America. This is due to the fact that some introduced
species can out-compete native species for resources, use resources previously unavailable to native species
and/or physically modify a habitat in ways that are advantageous to them and harmful to the natives. This is a huge
topic that is being discussed at a global level. As far as your specific question, Former Forest Service Chief Dale
Bosworth named the four threats to the health of the nation’s forests and grasslands. They are fire and fuels,
invasive species, loss of open space, and unmanaged recreation.

Noxious Weeds: Threats to
biodiversity

Comment: Noxious Weeds 20. Weeds are a great threat to biodiversity and can often out-compete native plants
and produce a monoculture that has little or no plant species diversity or benefit to wildlife. Noxious weeds tend to
gain a foothold where there is disturbance in the ecosystem, such as road building, logging, livestock grazing or
fire activities. We are pleased that the BDNF has a program to control noxious weeds (BDNF Noxious Weed
Control Program Record of Decision). EPA supports integrated weed management, and we encourage use of
weed control measures at the earliest stage of invasion to reduce impacts to native plant communities. Weed
prevention is the most cost-effective way to manage and control weeds by avoiding new infestations and spread of
weeds, and thus, avoiding the need for subsequent weed treatments. We encourage tracking of weed infestations,
control actions, and effectiveness of control actions in a Forest-level weed database.

7

We are pleased that the proposed Flint Foothills Vegetation Management DEIS project includes measures to
control and manage spread of weeds (page 52), and the DEIS includes a section addressing invasive plants and
noxious weeds (page 135 -148). Although it is also important to recognize that herbicide use for weed control has
the potential to cause adverse effects to water quality and fisheries. Herbicide drift into streams and wetlands could
adversely affect aquatic life and wetland functions such as food chain support and habitat for wetland species.
Montana’s Water Quality Standards include a general narrative standard requiring surface waters to be free from
substances that create concentrations which are toxic or harmful to aquatic life. We recommend that herbicide
weed treatments be coordinated with the Forest botanist to assure protection to sensitive plants, and coordinated
with fisheries biologists and wildlife biologists to assure that sensitive fisheries and wildlife habitat areas are
protected.

Noxious Weeds

Some suggestions to reduce potential water quality and fisheries effects from herbicide spraying that we didn’t see
listed among these weed management measures are: 1) streams and wetlands in any area to be sprayed be
identified and flagged on the ground to assure that herbicide applicators are aware of the location of wetlands, and
thus, can avoid spraying in or near wetlands; 2) use treatment methods that target individual noxious weed plants
in riparian and wetland areas (depending on the targeted weed species, manual control or hand pulling may be
one of the best options for weed control within riparian/wetland areas or close to water). We also recommend that
use of picloram based herbicides (e.g., tordon) be avoided near aquatic areas, and that potentially toxic herbicides
be applied at the lowest rate effective in meeting weed control objectives and according to guidelines for protecting

Concern

Response: Thank you for your comments and links to pesticide and herbicide information. The BeaverheadDeerlodge National Forest Noxious Weed Control Final Environment Impact Statement and Record of Decision
(May 2002) developed specific mitigations for herbicide application. These mitigations were developed to reduce
significant health risk to humans and animals as well as ensure that water and soil quality remains excellent. The
Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest is committed to perform the specific mitigations which are in alignment with
your recommendations.
Comment: 20 (continued). Please also note that there may be additional pesticide use limitations that set forth
geographically specific requirements for the protection of endangered or threatened species and their designated
critical habitat. This information can be found at http://www.epa.gov/espp/bulletins.htm. You may also want to
consider use of a more selective herbicide (clopyralid) in conifer associated communities to reduce impacts on
non-target vegetation. We also note that spotted knapweed, which is a prevalent noxious weed species in western
Montana, is non-rhizomatous and should be relatively easy to control with lower rates of the most selective low
toxicity herbicides.

which operates under a cooperative agreement with EPA and Oregon State University and has a wealth of
information on toxicity, mobility, environmental fate on pesticides that may be helpful (phone number 800-8587378).
Response: The Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Project would take place in both Granite and Powell
counties. There are no pesticide use limitations in place for Granite County. Powell County does have a pesticide
use limitation because of the presence of grizzly bears. The limitation is for two active ingredients that are used to
control Black-tailed Prairie Dogs. This project is not proposing to control Black-tailed Prairie Dogs. As always, while
treating noxious weeds, the use instructions on the herbicide label will be followed as well as the most appropriate
control method.
Comment: 11. Why aren’t you proposing to replace more culverts that are at risk of failure?
2

7

Response: Thank you for your comments. A number of existing culverts are proposed for maintenance,
improvements, or replacement. See Appendix B of the Transportation Resource Report for a more detailed
estimate of work quantities to occur. We believe that the work proposed will improve the overall road conditions in
the project area, as well as bring the roads more in line with established BMPs. The items proposed were based
on road surveys with regards to implementing BMPs and providing for safe access to vegetation treatments and
safe removal of removal of timber products.
Comment: The DEIS identifies several road sediment source problem areas within the project area (e.g., Roads
636, 78472, 1557). It appears, therefore, that all road sediment and erosion control problem areas have not been
properly maintained over time with implementation of appropriate BMPs. We recommend that the FEIS include
additional discussion of the adequacy of funding to implement and maintain needed road BMPs when they are in

need of repair. If existing roads cannot be properly maintained, it adds to concerns regarding maintenance of any
new roads that may be proposed for construction.

Concern

Response: Thank you for your comments. Analyzing and accessing the project area for vegetation treatments
presents an opportunity to assess and improve road conditions. As part of the action alternatives, road
maintenance and reconstruction work is proposed to provide for safe haul vehicle access, and also to implement
BMP work on roads to improve drainage and mitigate adverse resource impacts. The analysis determines that
through the action alternatives, project road conditions would improve. In addition, a long-term reduction in existing
routes is associated with each alternative. We therefore believe that selection of one of the project action
alternatives will result in better road conditions than the existing condition. Additional related discussion is provided
in the transportation resource report.
Comment: Are there any opportunities to decommission additional roads in the Flint Foothills project area,
particularly roads near streams with problem areas that are difficult to maintain? We encourage closure and/or
decommissioning of roads near streams with many stream crossings, since removal of these roads are more likely
to have water quality benefits than closure and decommissioning of roads on upper slopes and ridges.
7

7

Response: Thank you for your comments. To support the purpose and need, a number of road actions are
proposed on routes associated with accessing and treating timber and vegetation. Approximately 4.4 miles of
existing open and closed unauthorized routes would be reconstructed. Following implementation, these routes
would be decommissioned by various methods, as displayed in table 6. While we recognize that there are other
routes within the project area, this effort does not include proposals in areas where timber and vegetation
treatments are not proposed. This does not preclude subsequent transportation planning efforts taking place within
the Flint Foothills analysis area.
Comment: (5. Continued) Land management decisions involve environmental and resource management tradeoffs (i.e., trade-offs in impacts among vegetation treatments, restoration of vegetative conditions, fire risk and fuels,
forest health, wildlife, water quality and fisheries, air quality, weed spread, old growth, and other resource impacts).
We consider it appropriate to further evaluate the many environmental and resource management trade-offs, and
make an effort to optimize the trade-offs while minimizing adverse environmental impacts while addressing project
purpose and need and the significant issues. We acknowledge that some minimal amount of new temporary road
may be needed to carry out particularly important vegetative restoration actions. The BDNF, therefore, may want to
consider development of a modified preferred alternative in an effort to optimize the environmental and resource
management trade-offs. Desirable features we consider worthy of including in a modified preferred alternative are
as follows:
► minimize new road construction and reconstruction, especially long-term or permanent new roads (especially in
the Dolus inventoried roadless area), and locate necessary new roads on uplands away from streams with minimal
new stream crossings, where they have minimal aquatic impacts, and avoid road construction on steep and
erosive soils (particularly in the water quality impaired Barnes Creek drainage);

►maximize fish and watershed improvement (i.e., rehabilitation of mining or grazing impacted streams, reducing
stream encroachments, stabilizing eroding streambanks, improving aquatic habitat, revegetating disturbed areas);
►plan, design and implement vegetative treatments to minimize erosion and sediment transport and excessive
water yield;
►reduce fuel loadings in high fire risk areas, particularly urban interface areas, while improving wildlife habitat,
connectivity and security, retaining large healthy trees of desirable species and/or species in decline (Ponderosa
pine, whitebark pine, aspen), and promoting more natural and sustainable forest structure, and protecting other
resource values (e.g., soil productivity, old growth, control of noxious weeds, options for future wilderness
consideration);
►provide a Forest road and trail system that allows adequate access for management, avoids erosion & transport
of sediment to streams, spread of noxious weeds, degradation of habitat in wetlands and other environmentally
sensitive areas; and provides opportunities for public recreation and adequately balances motorized and nonmotorized recreation opportunities.
Response: The action alternatives include proposed road maintenance and reconstruction specifically to bring the
routes in line with established BMPs. These would address road drainage, and sediment/erosion control, and
promote improvement in water quality and aquatic habitat in streams within the analysis area. We believe that the
road system within the project area will be left in better condition if one of the action alternatives is selected. The
proposed road work also must be balanced with the project purpose and need, which is associated with vegetation
and timber treatments. While widespread watershed rehabilitation work is desirable, an economically feasible set
of transportation actions is also important, and influenced by the value of the forest products included in the
proposed treatments. Alternative 3 has no new temporary road construction and was developed in consideration of
public concerns related to effects from new roads. No roads are proposed for construction in the Dolus IRA.
The analysis specifically addresses sediment delivery to streams from harvest units and roads and the potential for
vegetative treatments to increase water yield (please refer to the environmental consequences section for
Hydrology in the EIS). There would be notable reductions in sedimentation to streams in the analysis area and no
measurable increases in water yield from implementation of either alternative.
To address the bullet statement: reduce fuel loadings in high fire risk areas, particularly urban interface areas,
while improving wildlife habitat, connectivity and security, retaining large healthy trees of desirable species and/or
species in decline (Ponderosa pine, whitebark pine, aspen), and promoting more natural and sustainable forest
structure, and protecting other resource values (e.g., soil productivity, old growth, control of noxious weeds,
options for future wilderness consideration);
The Flint Foothill project area does not contain wildland urban interface areas. The DEIS speaks to the changing
fuel loads over time with the no-action alternative, but ‘high fire risk areas’ were not identified. Road failures related
to recent high water events have been fixed and 6 culvert replacements have occurred in the Douglas Creek
drainage, which should appropriately accommodate future high water events, and reduce the risk of new failures.

Comments on the Flint Foothills DEIS and Forest Service Responses
The Desired Condition section of the FEIS describes the conditions in the project area with the proposed
treatments that are expected to result in 50-100 years if objectives are achieved. At lower elevations, these
conditions include stands of widely spaced larger-diameter trees, with more ponderosa pine, with the understory
being mostly void of multi-layered trees, where young trees occur but in scattered clumps. These low-elevation
forest conditions would favor both ponderosa pine and aspen trees, are resilient to future disturbances, and
function in a more sustainable condition. Where mixed-conifer stands occur with some whitebark pine present, the
DEIS desired condition is to maintain a patch mosaic of forested size classes, whereby created openings would be
suitable for early seral species establishment such as whitebark pine. The design for the action alternatives is to
create forested stands that meet the desired condition.

Concern

Comment: 6. We are pleased that the Road WEPP model (Water Erosion Prediction Project) was used to model
sediment delivery from roads and the Disturbed WEPP model was used to model sediment production for harvest
units. The Road WEPP model appears to include assumptions that appropriate road BMPs are implemented and
maintained. However, funding to maintain roads and correct road drainage and erosion problems is often limited.
We are concerned about the adequacy of funding available to adequately implement road BMPS and maintain
roads over the long term to avoid sediment delivery to surface waters, stream sedimentation and degradation of
stream bottom substrates and other aquatic habitats.

7

DEIS Table 77 (pages 276, 277), Table 80 (pages 288, 289) and Table 82 (pages 298, 299) identify road
conditions and road sediment source problem areas within the project area (roads 636, 78472, 1557). It does not
appear that road sediment and erosion control problem areas have been properly maintained over time with
implementation of appropriate BMPs. Roads should be properly maintained over time (e.g., installing drainage dips
or surface water deflectors, armoring drainage structures, grading and replacement of aggregate to reinforce wet
surface areas, ditch construction and cleaning, removing and replacing undersized culverts, etc.).
Are adequate road maintenance funds available on the BDNF to address the road sediment source problems
identified in the tables listed above as well as any new roads that would be constructed in Alternative 2? The FEIS
should include additional discussion of the adequacy of funding to implement and maintain needed road BMPs
when they are in need of repair. If existing roads cannot be properly maintained, it adds to concerns regarding
maintenance of any new roads that may be proposed for construction.

* locate roads in uplands, away from streams and riparian areas as much as possible;

Concern

* minimize the number of road stream crossings;
* locate roads away from steep slopes or erosive soils and areas of mass failure;
* stabilize cut and fill slopes;
* provide for adequate road drainage and control of surface erosion with measures such as adequate numbers of
waterbars, maintaining crowns on roads, adequate numbers of rolling dips and ditch relief culverts to promote
drainage off roads avoid drainage or along roads and avoid interception and routing sediment to streams;
* consider road effects on stream structure and seasonal and spawning habitats;
* allow for adequate large woody debris recruitment to streams and riparian buffers near streams;
* properly size culverts to handle flood events, pass bedload and woody debris, and reduce potential for washout;
* replace undersized culverts and adjust culverts which are not properly aligned or which present fish passage
problems and/or serve as barriers to fish migration;
* use bridges or open bottom culverts that simulate stream grade and substrate and that provide adequate
capacity for flood flows, bedload and woody debris where needed to minimize adverse fisheries effects of road
stream crossings.
Blading of unpaved roads in a manner that contributes to road erosion and sediment transport to streams and
wetlands should be avoided. It is important that road grading focus on reducing road surface erosion and sediment
delivery from roads to area streams. Practices of expediently sidecasting graded material over the shoulder and
widening shoulders and snow plowing can have adverse effects upon streams, wetlands, and riparian areas that
are adjacent to roads. These practices should be avoided.
Roads are particularly vulnerable to damage during spring breakup as overly-saturated roadbeds from winter
freezing are working to dry out, and this typically occurs between March 30 and June 30, but can vary depending
on the severity of the winter and spring weather conditions. We encourage avoiding road use during spring
breakup conditions, and closing roads to log haul during spring break up to reduce rutting of roads that increase
road erosion and sediment delivery, and graveling of haul roads. Snow plowing of roads later in winter for log haul
should also be avoided to limit runoff created road ruts during late winter thaws that increase road erosion (i.e.,
ruts channel road runoff along roads increasing erosion and sediment transport).
We encourage routine conduct of inspections and evaluations to identify conditions on roads and other
anthropogenic sediment sources that may cause or contribute to sediment to streams, and to include activities in
the project to correct as many of these conditions and sources as possible. Forest Service Region 1 provides
training for operators of road graders regarding conduct of road maintenance in a manner that protects streams
and wetlands, (i.e., Gravel Roads Back to the Basics). If there are road maintenance needs on unpaved roads
adjacent to streams and wetlands we encourage utilization of such training (contact Fred Bower FS R1
Transportation Management Engineer, at 406-329-3354).
We also note that there are training videos available from the Forest Service San Dimas Technology and
Development Center for use by the Forest Service and its contractors (e.g., “Forest Roads and the Environment”-

Concern

Response: Thank you for your comments. We plan to use many of these measures when applicable to road
engineering for vegetation treatment access. Proposed project road work includes improvements in compliance
with Montana State BMPs, which have many similarities to the recommendations mentioned above. Project design
features and contract requirements will also lead to sound road engineering practices used in providing access to
proposed vegetation treatments. Refer to the project design features for transportation and hydrology in chapter 2.
Comment: 7. It is stated (page 24) that approximately 4.4 miles of existing open and closed unauthorized routes
would be reconstructed with the proposed action, and following implementation, these routes would be
decommissioned by various methods. Table 6 (pages 16, 17) shows unauthorized routes that would be
decommissioned. We fully support decommissioning of roads, since as noted above many roads often cannot be
properly maintained resulting in road sediment transport to streams. We note that reductions in road density,
especially road/stream-crossing density, have often been correlated with improved aquatic health.
We also note that lower road densities are often associated with improved wildlife habitat, connectivity and
security. In addition, there is often a relationship between higher road density and increased forest use and
increased human caused fire occurrences. Reduction in road density, therefore, may also reduce risks of human
caused fires, which could be important in an area with high fuels/fire risk and/or wildland/urban interface issues.
7

Are there any opportunities to decommission additional roads in the Flint Foothills project area, particularly roads
near streams with problem areas that are difficult to maintain? We encourage closure and/or decommissioning of
roads near streams with many stream crossings, since removal of these roads are more likely to have water quality
benefits than closure and decommissioning of roads on upper slopes and ridges.

Comment: 8. How will the decreased elk security and thermal cover affect wolverines and have you formally
consulted with the FWS on the effects of this project on wolverines? The wolverine, which was chosen by the
Forest Service as a management indicator species for the project area, was recently determined to be warranted
for listing under the ESA. 75 Fed. Reg.78030 (Dec. 14, 2010). It is currently a candidate species, waiting for work
to be completed on other species before it is officially listed. The USFWS found that “[s]ources of human
disturbance to wolverines include . . . road corridors and extractive industry such as logging .....” .The Forest
Service admits that the wolverine and/or its habitat are present within the project area and would be impacted by
the project. The Forest Service must go through ESA consultation for the wolverine for this project.

2

Response: Federal actions concerning the wolverine date back to 1995 and culminated in a proposal to list the
wolverine DPS as threatened on February 4, 2013 (78 FR 7865). Global climate change in concert with legal and
incidental trapping were identified as primary threats to wolverines. “Wolverines are not thought to be dependent
on specific vegetation or habitat features that might be manipulated by land management activities, nor is there
evidence to suggest that land management activities are a threat to the conservation of the species” Human
activities in wolverine habitat such as snowmobiling, backcountry skiing, and land management activities like
timber harvest and infrastructure development, which do not constitute threats to the species, would not be
prohibited or regulated. After further review of all available scientific and commercial information, the USFWS
subsequently withdrew that proposal, and published their determination on August 13, 2014, that adding the North
American wolverine occurring in the contiguous United States as a distinct population segment to the Lists of
Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants was not warranted (79 FR 47522).

Comment: 4. The DEIS did not address the shortage of snags in the Clark Fork-Flints landscape. The snags here
over 10 inches dbh are only 4.3 acre, while the Forest average is 6.7. In addition, this landscape has “zero” snags
over 20 inches, while the forest average is 0.4 per acre. Since there are not 8 snags per acre over 15 inches dbh in
this landscape, or likely in the Project Area, this means the functional habitat identified as a Forest Plan direction is
not even currently being attained, and certainly will not be attained after logging. How does this affect biological
diversity?
6

Response: The Flint Foothills project area does not have to address snags outside of the effects analysis
boundary. Differences between the Clark Fork Flints landscape and Forest averages does not mean the Clark Fork
Flints landscape is “short”, nor does the snag analysis for the Forest Plan that occurred in 2008 give an indication
of the current number of snags in either the Forest, Clark Fork Flints landscape, nor the Flint Foothill analysis area.

Snags

The Forest Plan Standard 3 (FP pg. 48) was developed to address the short supply of large snags. The Forest
Plan FEIS states “the analysis indicates snags greater than 15 inches in diameter are naturally uncommon, and
snags greater than 20 inches in diameter are naturally quite rare” (FP FEIS pg. 1055). The FP FEIS continues:
“modified Alternative 6 address those snag components that are uncommon and rare (FP FEIS pg. 1055). Finally,
the FP FEIS states that “…snags to be retained are a conservative amount as the highest mean within a seral
stage for a snag group was chosen” (FP FEIS pg. 1055).

surveys (Appendix F-323).
Response: Project design features within the FEIS require that surveys for goshawks and owls in addition to those
described in the DEIS would be conducted prior to unit treatments (DEIS, pg. 227). Design features limiting
operating season are included to minimize impacts to nesting and denning wildlife including TES and migratory

Response: (Wildlife): Management Indicator Species documented as occurring within the project area consist of
Rocky Mountain elk. Elk sign was observed during field visits to the project area. Mapping of mountain goat
distribution obtained from MFWP shows overlap with the southern portion of the project area. Wolverine has not
been documented in the project area, but is known to occur in the Flint Range, which forms the southern boundary
of the project area. Mountain goats may occur at the highest elevations along the southern project boundary based
on distribution polygons obtained from the MFWP website.

(Aquatics): Drunella doddsi, the aquatic MIS is discussed in the Fish and Aquatic Resources section of chapter 3.

Comment: The habitat as proxy approach is premised upon the assumption that, by taking care of old growth
habitat needs of the MIS, the Forest Service can ensure the viability of all species. This theory has a rational basis
and should work where, as here, the habitat model underlying the old growth standards and the method for
measuring habitat are reasonably reliable. Nonetheless, the ultimate test for whether the habitat as proxy approach
is permissible is “whether it ‘reasonably ensures that the proxy results mirror reality.”

See Gifford Pinchot Task Force v. United States Fish & Wildlife Serv., 378 F.3d 1059, 1066 (9th Cir. 2004)
(quoting Idaho Sporting Cong., Inc. v. Rittenhouse, 305 F.3d at 972-73). Here, the most compelling evidence
suggests that the theory, applied in this Project Area, does not match reality. The lack of species sightings,
otherwise ignored and unexplained by the Forest Service, undermines the assumption that by taking care of
habitat, the HNF can ensure species viability.

Concern

The Forest Plan requires that the Forest Service ensures the existence of viable populations of species, not the
theoretical possibility that the species should be present.
Moreover, without any indication that there are viable populations of MIS in the Project Area before the Project, it is
unclear how the Forest Service could conclude that viable populations of MIS will be maintained after the Project.
Put another way, there is evidence in the record that effectively rebuts the presumption that the habitat-as proxyapproach is taking care of the species viability in the Project Area. The Forest Service has failed to adequately
address or explain this evidence or describe more adequately the potential reasons why the MIS have not been
located in the Project Area. Hence, the Forest Service has failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,
offered an explanation that runs counter to the evidence, and relied upon a theory that, as applied, is so
implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.
Accordingly, the decision to rely exclusively upon the old growth standards to meet the Forest Plan requirements
for MIS monitoring and ensuring species viability in the Project Area was in error and the decision authorizing the
Project must be set aside, because the Project’s effect on species viability has not been addressed.
This analysis is consistent with the Ninth Circuit’s recent decision in Native Ecosystems Council v. Tidwell, 599
F.3d 926, 935 (9th Cir. 2010) (holding nonexistent MIS cannot serve as proxy). In Tidwell, a Ninth Circuit panel
reversed a Montana district court decision upholding the Forest Service’s use of a proxy-on-proxy approach to
species viability requirements. The Ninth Circuit held that the proxy-on-proxy approach was not reliable, because
the MIS used to determine appropriate habitat, the sage grouse, did not exist in the area being analyzed and there
was evidence in the record suggesting that the sage grouse population in the larger geographic area was trending
downward. On that record, the Ninth Circuit said “[i]t is unfathomable how the Forest Service could meet its
responsibility to maintain existing species by selecting as a proxy a species that is virtually non-existent in the
targeted area.”.
Response: When the Forest Plan was appealed, the decision found that the Forest Plan and its associated
management direction adequately provides for wildlife species viability and provides necessary management
direction to achieve conservation of individual species at the project level.
Comment: 17. Which wildlife species and ecosystem processes, if any, does this proposed logging and fireproofing benefit?

Response: One important point of clarification; this project does not propose to conduct ‘fire-proofing’.
This project does not propose to ‘benefit’ wildlife species or ecosystem processes. The Purpose and Need

variety of forest dwelling wildlife. One example of an effect associated with logging would be improving habitat for
olive-sided flycatchers with openings created by lodgepole pine salvage and stand density reductions in Douglasfir/ponderosa pine thinning units, and seed tree harvest. One example of an effect associated with prescribed
burning could be stimulating re-growth of senesced grass, herb and shrub understory communities, and increase
vigor for the remaining conifers; improving flammulated owl foraging and nesting habitat, respectively. There are
effects to ecosystem process as well with the proposed treatments and activities. These effects are discussed
thoroughly in the DEIS with each of the resource area discussions. An example where the DEIS discloses effects
that would be considered ‘ecosystem processes’ is where the “indirect effect of low-elevation prescribed burning
would be a regrowth of senesced grass, herb and shrub understory communities, increased vigor for remaining
conifers, and natural regeneration of ponderosa pine” (DEIS, pg. 102).

Concern

Comment: 18. Which species and processes does proposed logging and fire-proofing harm?

2

2

Response: One important point of clarification; this project does not propose to conduct ‘fire-proofing’. There
would be some reduction in habitat for species that are benefitting from habitat conditions that are outside of the
historic vegetative range. Wildlife effects, both positive and negative are disclosed in the wildlife section. Though
some species habitat conditions will be altered and tempera disturbance is expected to occur; improving forest
resiliency is expected to benefit many species using the project area in the long-term. When the Forest Plan was
appealed, the decision found that the Forest Plan and its associated management direction adequately provides
for wildlife species viability and provides necessary management direction to achieve conservation of individual
species at the project level.
Comment: Last year, USFWS found “substantial scientific or commercial information indicating that listing a
[Distinct Population Segment] of fisher in the [Northern Rocky Mountains] of the United States [under the ESA]
may be warranted.” 75 Fed. Reg. 19925 – 19935 (April 16, 2010). In particular, USFWS found that listing the
Northern Rockies fisher under the ESA may be warranted in primary part “due to the present and potential future
modification and destruction of habitat from commercial timber harvest and commercial wood production by
methods that may prevent succession to the mature forest stages preferred by fishers.” The Forest Service admits
that the fisher and/or its habitat are present within the project area and would be impacted by the project. The
Forest Service did no ESA consultation for the fisher for this project.

Response: In their subsequent 12-month finding, the USFWS found that listing the fisher in the U.S. Northern

This finding is available on the Internet at http:// www.regulations.gov at Docket Number FWS –R6–ES–2010–

sensitive old growth species such as flammulated owls and goshawks?

Concern

Response: It is not clear what Region 1 requirements the commenter is referring to. This project would retain
snags to meet Forest Plan standards, as described on pages162-163 DEIS.
While the flammulated owl is indeed classified as Forest Service sensitive, the goshawk is not. The ERG (2010)
Beaverhead-Deerlodge Rapid Assessment included both species in the analysis. Acreage of Potential
Flammulated Owl habitat in the Clark Fork-Flints landscape shows more declines with no vegetation treatment
from 2010 to 2030 than with treatment over the same time frame. Acreages rebound under both scenarios by 2060
with more potential habitat under the treatment scenario (ERG pages 153 and 159 respectively). The ERG (2010)
goshawk habitat projections show virtually no change in potential habitat from 2010 – 2060 under both no
treatment and treatments scenarios (ERG pages 116 and 121 respectively). At this time we anticipate both species
being sustained across the Clark Fork-Flints under all alternatives

prudent measures therein
Comment: 13. Have you checked to see if the project area qualifies as lynx critical habitat as required by the U.S.

Comment: 14. Have you formally consulted with the FWS on the impacts of this project and the revised forest plan
on lynx?
Response: Consultation with USFWS for effects to Canada lynx will be completed prior to the final EIS and
Record of Decision. The project will be in compliance with the Biological Opinion and any Reasonable and Prudent
measures therein.

Wildlife: Lynx

Comment: The U.S. District Court ruled last year that the FWS has to reconsider all of the Beaverhead-Deerlodge
NF as critical habitat for lynx. Therefore, before this project can go forward, the F.S. must consult with the USFWS
on the effect of this project on lynx and if the project will adversely modify lynx habitat. By definition the clearcutting
in this project will adversely modify lynx habitat. To say otherwise is arbitrary.
This is violation of the ESA and an internal Forest Service memo according to Jim Claar from the Regional Office
in Missoula. Mr. Claar told Arlene Montgomery from Friends of the Wild Swan, one of our member groups in a
phone conversation that the Forest Service is directed to follow the Northern Rockies lynx management direction in
historic lynx habitat. The project area is historic lynx habitat which means it is suitable habitat.

Wildlife: Lynx

Consequently he should be aware that the decision specifically states “the current critical habitat designation
shall remain in place until the Service issues a new final rule on lynx critical habitat, at which time the
current, invalidated Final Rule (74 Fed. Reg. 8616) will be superseded.”

Concern

A new critical habitat rule has not been issued. The Fish and Wildlife Service has not included the lynx on its
quarterly species lists for the BDNF. There is no mechanism available to consult on a species which is not
recognized by the US Fish and Wildlife Service as being present on the unit. Characterization of an ESA violation
is disingenuous at best
Response: No critical habitat is designated on the BDNF. Consultation with USFWS for effects to Canada lynx will
be completed prior to completing the final EIS and Record of Decision. The project will be in compliance with the
Biological Opinion and any Reasonable and Prudent measures therein.
The Final EIS for the Northern Rockies Lynx Management Direction (NRLMD), which incorporates and supersedes
LCAS (Ruediger, et al. 2000), was completed in March 2007 with the Record Of Decision signed March 23, 2007
(USFS 2007), pg 29.). The purpose of the NRLMD was to incorporate management direction that conserves and
promotes recovery of Canada lynx, by reducing or eliminating adverse effects from the land management activities
on National Forest System lands, while preserving the overall multiple-use direction in existing plans. This direction
applies to projects and activities in occupied habitat (USFS 2007). An area is considered to be occupied when: (1)
there are at least 2 verified lynx observations or records since 1999 on the national forest, unless they are verified
to be transient individuals; or (2) there is evidence of reproduction on the national forest (USFS, 2007). Lynx
surveys were conducted on the Forest between 1999 and 2001 as part of a National Lynx Survey effort. Through
this effort, the BDNF was determined to be Unoccupied, secondary habitat (USFWS and USFS 2006) and
continues to be considered unoccupied (USFWS 2011).
Comment: 27. After snags are cut down for safety for OSHA requirements will there still be enough snags left for
old growth sensitive species?
2

Response: As stated in the FEIS for the Forest Plan (p. 486), there are no old growth obligate species identified
for the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest. Snags will be retained at Forest Plan standards which were
designed to maintain snag associated species’ viability. It also states that “Snags retained in treatments units
would be clumped to reduce both the potential for wind throw and safety reasons…”

added to the FEIS. As stated in the DEIS (p. 175) project design features restrict public access to proposed
treatment units during the fall period.

Comments on the Flint Foothills DEIS and Forest Service Responses
hunting unit scale for the fall season. Existing open road densities on Forest Service lands between October 15
and December 2 are 1.5 mile per square mile. Because of road use restrictions, the open road density during
project implementation would not change during this fall period, or at the completion of the project..

Concern

Comment: 3. Please discuss summer habitat effectiveness for elk during the summer as per open road densities.
It is important to identify what appear to be significant impacts on elk summer use, the Forest MIS. The larger
grizzly bear analysis area exceeds the maximum open road density recommended for elk, so the open road
density in the Project Area is likely considerably higher.
6

Response: OMRTDs used as indices for elk security are measured at the Hunting Unit scale as described in the
Forest Plan (table 14). Existing and post-treatment road densities in Hunting Unit 212, which includes the project
area, meet the Forest Plan goals.

Elk/Grizzly Bears

The State Elk Plan (2005) population objective of 850 animals has been exceed by a factor of 3.1X in 2011 with
FWP estimating 2693 animals concurrent with the existing footprint of multiple use activities. This appears to
indicate to a reasonable observer that the elk population in Hunting Unit 212 is thriving
Comment: 4. Please provide an analysis of elk security area as per Hillis et al. (1991) and Christensen et al. 1993,
where security consists of 250 acre or larger blocks of contiguous forest cover at least 0.5 miles from an open
road.
Response: The DEIS discloses the effects to secure habitat based on Forest Plan direction (p. 120). Development
of the Forest Plan direction included consideration of Christensen et al. (1993) which considers Hillis et al.

Based on thorough review of Unsworth et al.(1993), Hayes et al.(2002), Cook et al.(2005), Rumble and Gamo
(2011), which constitute a body of best available science postdating Hillis (1991), forested cover for both hiding
and thermal benefits do not appear to be persuasive metrics for elk analysis, particularly for hunted populations.
Furthermore, Proffitt et al.(2013)” used global position system locations collected from 82 females in 2 different
Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) elk herds (East Madison Valley and West Paradise Valley) to evaluate
effects of hunter access, security habitat as defined by the Hillis paradigm, and other landscape attributes on adult
female elk resource selection during the pre-hunting, archery, rifle, and post-hunting periods. They found that
female elk selection for areas restricting public hunting access was stronger than selection for security habitat in
both study areas, and that the densities of roads open to motorized use was the strongest predictor of elk
distribution.”
Comment: 5. Please provide and map big game hiding cover at current and planned conditions for the project
area, with hiding cover being at least 600 feet wide. Please discuss habitat recommendations for elk where
minimum levels of hiding cover are recommended, such as the Black et al. 1976 study.

Elk/Grizzly Bears

Elk/Grizzly Bears

Response: As stated above, Forest Plan direction is tied to wildlife secure areas during the fall, rather than
vegetative conditions (i.e. hiding cover). The DEIS cites two reports which found that vegetation variables were not
significant in relation to elk harvest vulnerability.

Concern

Comment: 6. Please identify the miles of new roads that would have to be opened in order to change the existing
OMRTD for the 417,243-acres Clark Fork-Flint landscape, and which would cause the Project area to violate this
Forest Plan recommendation.

Response: The Clark-fork flints are within 2.5 miles and HU 212 could have 6.4 miles additional fall open routes
before the plan standard is violated. However, the FP OMRTD is measure at completion of the project, by
definition. At completion of the project, Alt 2 has 0.6 less miles of OMRTD, and Alt 3 no change in OMRTD (see
project file).

Comment: 7. The discussion regarding the impact of hiding cover on elk hunting did not address the trend in bull
elk harvest, which is the value of security. Please include this type of analysis, including a peer review by the
Montana, Fish, Wildlife and Parks.

Elk/Grizzly Bears

Response: Elk population and harvest data is maintained by MFWP and is available
at: http://fwp.mt.gov/hunting/planahunt/huntingGuides/deer.htm
Comment: 8. The Forest Plan definition of elk security was develop for grizzly bears, a species that is not hunted.
Why does the agency believe that this definition is suitable for elk, instead of using the current best science cited in
the Plan for elk, or Christiansen et al.1993.
6

6

Response: Security is described in the Elk Monitoring report as the protection inherent in any situation that allows
elk to remain in a defined area despite an increase in stress or disturbance associated with the hunting season or
other human activities. Security is a state of being, a condition or functional concept most important when viewed
in relation to the hunting season. Additionally, forested vegetation does not statistically provide security for hunted
populations of elk; whereas open motorized roads/trails are indeed significant. The FP goal for elk security is to
manage density of open motorized roads and trails (OMRTD) by MTFWP Hunt Units (HU) during the fall rifle big
game season, to achieve levels at or below identified densities. Hunting Unit 212 OMRTD is 1.4 mi/mi2 and is
compliant with the FP for the general hunting season and will remain so post implementation.
Comment: 9. The definition in the Forest Plan for grizzly bear security, and as used in the current project, is not
the same as identified for grizzly bear management. The criteria of “gated roads" was not included for open roads.
Since the Forest Service changed the actual definition of grizzly bear security habitat, what was the scientific basis
for this change, and how, will it affect the delineation of grizzly bear security on the landscape, including the Project
Area for the current project.

Elk/Grizzly Bears

Elk/Grizzly Bears

Response: The Forest Plan does not change the definition for grizzly security, which still remains as described at
Appendix p. G-52. Application of a 500-meter (1,640 ft.) grizzly buffer would generate more secure habitat than a
1/3-mile buffer from the Forest Plan. In essence, this means the plan buffer represents a more conservative
approach to describing wildlife secure habitat. The FS expects the public to adhere to road closures, caged or
otherwise; trespassing these designations is illegal and punishable.

Comments on the Flint Foothills DEIS and Forest Service Responses

Concern

Comment: 10. The DEIS notes that roads will be closed almost in all cases with signing. This will not qualify as a
closed road for grizzly bear security. Please do an analysis of grizzly bear security that uses the appropriate
criteria for a closed road.
Response: The DEIS acknowledges that roads used during implementation would produce short-term increases
in road density as well as disturbance effects to existing secure areas (pgs. 172-174).

6

The commenter does not identify the criteria to be assessed. The Flint Foothills area is outside both the
Yellowstone Grizzly DPS and the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem with no known occupancy of the analysis
area. The Primary Conservation Areas of both systems do not overlap any portion of the project area. However, a
review of Appendix G (Forest Plan Amendment for Grizzly Bear Habitat Conservation for the Greater Yellowstone
Area National Forests) can help inform the Flint Foothills analysis process since the amendment area abuts the
Flint Foothills analysis area. Page Appendix G-12 notes “Outside the Primary Conservation Area in areas identified
in state management plans as biologically suitable and socially acceptable for grizzly bear occupancy,
accommodate grizzly bear populations to the extent that accommodation is compatible with the goals and
objectives of other uses.”

Elk/Grizzly Bears

At Page G-14 (Item 3.1) the Amendment notes “Habitat management efforts on National Forest System lands,
including seasonal and permanent motorized access restrictions (emphasis added), closure of many sheep
allotments, provisions in livestock grazing and special use permits, food storage orders, installation of bear
resistant facilities, information and education materials and programs, and the development of coordinated
direction for management of forest resources have been instrumental in the recovery of this bear population.”
Forest Service management actions are congruent with all of the actions noted at the Item 3.1 reference with the
exception of sheep allotments, which are non-existent on the Deerlodge NF, are being used outside the PCA. The
Forest Service assumes that when a road is signed as closed to public use, that the public is law abiding and such
closures are honored.

6

Comment: 11. The analysis area for grizzly bear security and open roads was increased significantly to include
adjacent unroaded habitat outside the Project Area. The Project Area is about 44,500 acres, while the grizzly bear
analysis area is about 73,900 acres, (66% larger). This would appear to have been done to increase the apparent
level of grizzly bear security and reduce the apparent impacts of the Project. Please explain why the grizzly bear
and elk analysis areas were so different.

Elk/Grizzly Bears

Response: Rationale for establishing the boundaries for grizzly bear analysis are provided in the Wildlife Section.
Grizzly bears, as well as wolverines and wolves, have larger home ranges and the analysis area was increased to
reflect 1 or more home ranges of these species. See Appendix F map.

6

Comment: 12.The current best science for grizzly bears, as per Schwartz et al. (2010) separates grizzly bear
security values into those provided by core habitat areas, and those outside these core areas. The values of both
are important to grizzly bears. However, in your analysis, you did not identify the open road density during summer
for areas outside grizz1y bear security areas. Please show what the current level is for outside security areas for
bears, and how this will change during project implementation. Will road densities outside of secure areas promote
grizzly bear movement through them, and if not, why isn't there an action alternative that promote conservation

Comments on the Flint Foothills DEIS and Forest Service Responses
and recovery of the grizzly bear in this linkage area?

Concern

Response: Schwartz et al. (2010) report that amount of secure habitat as well as road densities outside secure
habitat within a grizzly bear’s home range were important factors in predicting bear survival in their study. They
also cite other studies that report higher bear mortality rates in heavily roaded portions of their range. The DEIS
analysis acknowledges increased disturbance and risk to grizzly bears as a result of roads (pg. 167). In addition,
the DEIS also discloses road densities and available secure habitat, as well as the predicted effects to both factors
as a result of project alternatives within the grizzly bear analysis area during summer (pg. 173). While Schwartz et
al. (2010) describe that the relationship between amount of secure habitat and road densities outside secure
habitat is an important factor in predicting survival, no metrics were provided that could be applied to the DEIS in
measuring effects of alternatives. Therefore, qualitative discussion concerning results reported by Schartz et al. as
well as others in relation to project effects has been added to the FEIS. Effects analysis has been added to the
FEIS.

6

Comment: 14. The definition of security for grizzly bears, which is being applied to elk, does not include roads that
are not closed with structures, such as gates. Since the agency is using the grizzly bear definition for security, you
are also required to use road closure terminology for this definition. This means that any roads that are merely
closed with signs do not count as a closed road. So your analysis of elk security areas in the fall is invalid, since
new and possibly existing roads are not structurally blocked from use.

Elk/Grizzly Bears

Response: The grizzly bear definition for security was used to inform the Forest Plan analysis for a minimum acre
polygon, along with the Wisdom et al. (2004) road buffer, and open motorized route buffering for quiet recreation
values. The resulting buffering produces graphical displays of areas within which a variety of species can find
freedom from motorized disturbance. The Forest Service assumes that when a road is signed as closed to public
use, that the public is law abiding and such closures are honored.

6

Comment: 15. Since the open road density in the summer during this project will dearly exceed the 2 miles per
section threshold for managing elk habitat, the agency needs to dearly disclose this impact as is required by the
NEPA.

Elk/Grizzly Bears

Response: Desired road densities managed for wildlife security during the summer period in the Clark Fork-Flints
landscape are prescribed as at or below 1.9 mile per square mile (Forest Plan, pg. 45). The DEIS shows that
existing, during-project, and post-project road densities are within the desired density (DEIS, Table 45).

6

6

Comment: 16.The agency needs to provide an action alternative that will maintain summer elk habitat at the
minimum level of no more than 2 miles per section.
Response: The Forest Plan states that road densities in relation to wildlife security will be managed at the
Landscape and Hunting Unit levels. Population estimates for Hunting 212, which includes the Flint Foothills project
area, have shown a steady increase since 2005 indicating healthy elk numbers under existing road densities.
Comment: 17. Please provide an alternative that meets the Christensen et al. 1993 minimum 30% level of fall
security for elk, including blocks of contiguous forest habitat at least 0.5 miles from an open motorized route.

Comments on the Flint Foothills DEIS and Forest Service Responses
Response: The Forest Plan defines fall secure habitat as those areas further than 0.33 mile from open motorized
routes, which provides larger blocks of secure habitat than the buffer distance prescribed by Christensen et al. (i.e.
0.5 miles). Based on thorough review of Unsworth et al. (1993), Hayes et al. (2002), Cook et al. (2005), Rumble
and Gamo (2011), which constitute a body of best available science postdating Christensen, forested cover for
both hiding and thermal benefits do not appear to be persuasive metrics for elk analysis, particularly for hunted
populations. Furthermore, Proffitt et al. (2013)” used global position system locations collected from 82 females in
2 different Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) elk herds (East Madison Valley and West Paradise Valley) to
evaluate effects of hunter access, security habitat as defined by the Hillis paradigm, and other landscape attributes
on adult female elk resource selection during the pre-hunting, archery, rifle, and post-hunting periods. They found
that female elk selection for areas restricting public hunting access was stronger than selection for security habitat
in both study areas, and that the densities of roads open to motorized use was the strongest predictor of elk
distribution. Available science has progressed that increasingly substantiates the importance of managing roads
which is supported in Christensen et al. 1993.

Concern

Comment l7.Please discuss why openings, including those larger than 40 acres including: at least 11 in fall elk
security areas, ·will not reduce elk security as per the current best science, or Christensen et al . 1993.
6

6

Response: Under the Forest Plan, elk security is based on buffered distance from open roads and is not habitatbased. Review of current best science pertaining to assessing security based on distance from roads versus
vegetation-based parameters is provided in the Flint Foothills Wildlife Report (Appendix E). See response to
comment 17.
Comment: 18. Please define why openings, including those over 40 acres in size, will not inhibit grizzly bear
movement though this linkage habitat.

Elk/Grizzly Bears

Elk/Grizzly Bears

Response: Additional analysis concerning grizzly bear use of larger openings has been included in the FEIS.
Comment: 19. In discussions on the value of hiding cover for elk during the hunting season the agency at one
point states that Hillis et al. (1991) does not apply to forests east of the divide, then cites a study in Idaho, where
cover is very dense, to base suggestions that hiding cover is not important for elk security. If studies west of the
divide do not apply to the Beaverhead-Deerlodge.National Forest, why do you cite studies in Idaho then?
6

Response: With no specific citation in the comment, we assume that the commenter’s Idaho reference speaks to
Hayes et al. (2002), Unsworth et al. (1993) or perhaps both. Hayes et al. (2002) found that only four of the 36
independent variables in their extensive elk study had significant univariate relationships with harvest mortality.
These four significant independent variables were: total road density, hunting season structure, aspect, and
percent moist shrubfield. They determined hiding cover and interior hiding cover1 were not statistically significant
variables influencing elk behavior in their northern Idaho elk study. Of the four significant variables, road density is
the variable most readily changed by Forest Service management. Furthermore Hayes et al. (2002) citing

Elk/Grizzly Bears

1

Hayes et al. (2002) developed interior hiding cover by constructing an interior polygon on an area mapped as “cover” and considered this inner polygon as
potentially higher in habitat value that the area surrounding it.

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement – Volume 2 Appendices

Letter

Comments on the Flint Foothills DEIS and Forest Service Responses
Unsworth et al. (1993) notes that the latter study “is the only study to establish a quantitative link between habitat
characteristics and elk hunting season mortality rates in a multivariate context...Their model predicts increasing elk
mortality with increases in open road and hunter density, and decreases in elk mortality as topography becomes
more dissected. Vegetation variables such as hiding cover were not significant in the model developed by
Unsworth et al. (1993).”

Concern

The Unsworth study area encompassed approximately 395,400 acres primarily within the Clearwater National
Forest. Fire played a major role in shaping landscape patterns and about 25% of the area consisted of seral
shrubfields with grass/forb understories. Another 25% was mixed open timber/shrubfields, and 50% consisted of
closed-canopy forest (>60% crown closure) – more than the 30% of an area in Hillis et al. (1991). Unsworth et al.
(1993) specifically note: “We are not aware of an elk population that is hunted (except those that are hunted under
a very limited number of controlled permits) where it has been shown that environmental or habitat factors are
limiting the male cohorts of the populations. We believe that elk populations are more likely to be controlled by
harvest than by limits in cover or forage. In most years, hunters, their efficiency modified by road density and
topography, control elk populations.”
Even more recent information found that female elk selection for areas restricting public hunting access was
stronger than selection for security habitat in their study on the East Madison and Western Paradise Valley elk
herds, and that the density of roads open to motorized use was the strongest predictor of elk distributio (Proffitt,
Gude, Shamhart, & King, 2012).
The bottom line, bolstering Christiansen et al. (1993), Unsworth et al. (1993), Hayes et al. (2002), Wisdom et al.
(2004), Rumble and Gamo (2011) is that roads management is a highly effective tool for managing elk. 2
Comment: 20. The importance of hiding cover for bull elk security is likely more stringent that referenced in Hillis
et al. (1991) as his analysis area had much more extensive hiding cover. East of the divide, larger blocks and
percentages of elk security blocks may be required; as they are more limited on the landscape. Why isn't this the
case?
6

6

Response: The Flint Foothills project area is located west of the Continental Divide. As noted in the response to
comment 19 above, there is a growing body of science post Hillis and Christensen that increasingly supports roads
management as the key metric in managing for elk where they are hunted. Hayes (2002) and Profitt (2013) on
either side of the Continental Divide substantiate in our view the reasonableness of roads management to provide
for elk. Fixating on Hillis et al.(1991) is not consistent with maintaining awareness of more recent science as
exemplified by Unsworth et al.(1993), Hayes et al.(2002) , Cook et al.(2005), Rumble and Gamo (2011), and Profitt
et al. (2013) ”

analysis areas that are hundreds of thousands of acres; such as the Clark Fork-Flint landscape which is over
400,000 acres?

Concern

Response: The EIS discloses the effects to secure areas using Forest Plan direction that was based on
management recommendations from Christensen et al. (1993), Wisdom (2004) and the Yellowstone Grizzly Bear
Amendment (USDA Forest Service 2006) for the same reasons disclosed in the Forest Plan FEIS (pp. 488-489,
513-517, 684-685 and 697). Christensen et al. (1993) considered Hillis et al. during development of their
recommendations and considerations. Elk analysis area is based on HU to coincide with MFWP management
scale. MFWP considers population densities and hunter success at this scale and using the same scale provides
the best interpretation for this information.
Comment: 22.The Forest Plan needs to provide consistent definitions of open roads and security for both the
grizzly bear and elk, so that the public can understand the criteria for these guidelines.

6

Response: The grizzly bear definition for security (Forest Plan Appendix G-52, Figure A1) was used to inform the
Forest Plan analysis for a minimum acre polygon, along with the Wisdom et al. (2004) (Forest Plan FEIS, Table
179, P. 513) road buffer, and open motorized route buffering for quiet recreation values. The resulting buffering
produces graphical displays of areas within which a variety of species can find freedom from motorized
disturbance. See response at Comment 9. The FP goal for wildlife security is to manage OMRTD by landscape
year-round, except fall rifle big game season at or below identified densities by landscape.

Elk/Grizzly Bears

The FP goal for elk security is to manage density of open motorized roads and trails (OMRTD) by MTFWP Hunt
Units (HU) during the fall rifle big game season, to achieve levels at or below identified densities.
Comment: 23 It appears that the standard definition of security, or larger cover blocks removed from roads, is
deficient in the hunting unit 212, at only 14%. However, the DEIS failed to provide any discussion on bull elk
vulnerability, and how this low availability of security may be affecting bull elk in this hunting unit. This information
needs to be provided.
Response: The commenter inserts “large cover blocks” as the standard definition of security removed from roads.
This is not described in the Revised Forest Plan which clearly describes on page 45,
6

“Wildlife Security: Secure areas and connectivity for ungulates and large carnivores are provided, while
recognizing the variety of recreational opportunities.” Followed by “Wildlife Secure Areas and Connectivity:
Manage density of open motorized roads and trails by landscape year-round, except fall rifle big game season, to
achieve levels at or below the following (Scale - Landscapes)” (referencing table 13 in the Revised Forest Plan).

Comment: 24. Since these habitat features have been measured forest wide, why can’t this analysis also be
applied to the proposed project?

6

Response: The Forest Plan states that road densities in relation to wildlife security will be managed at the
Landscape and Hunting Unit levels. Elk population estimates for Hunting Units that include portions of the BDNF
are shown in the Flint Foothills Wildlife Section. Population estimates for Hunting 212, which includes the Flint
Foothills project area, have shown a steady increase since 2005 indicating healthy elk numbers under existing
road densities.
Comment: 25. Table 37 at DEIS 112 shows that the total existing open road density for the Project Area is 2. 94
miles per section. Please define what this will be during logging on both alternatives, and what the existing and
projected impacts will be to elk summer use as per habitat effectiveness. We note that the current best science
measures elk summer use by habitat effectiveness, or open road density, not by security, as was done for the
Project.

Elk/Grizzly Bears

Elk/Grizzly Bears

Response: Because temporary roads will be closed to the public during implementation, OMRTD will remain the
same during implementation. Please see previous responses regarding the antiquated use of “Habitat
Effectiveness”, rather than OMRTD, based on current science.
Comment: 26. It is not clear why the existing situation is not considered an adverse impact on the grizzly bear,
since they avoid areas with over 2 miles per section of open roads (DEIS 167). Why isn’t there an alternative that
restores grizzly bear habitat in this potentially important linkage area?

6

Response: Guidance provided in the Endangered Species Consultation Handbook indicates that this is the
appropriate conclusion when effects on listed species are expected to be discountable, or insignificant, or
completely beneficial. Discountable effects are those that are extremely unlikely to occur. Insignificant effects
relate to the size of the impact and should never reach the scale where take occurs. Beneficial effects are positive
effects without adverse effects to the species.

Elk/Grizzly Bears

Determination is based on the following rationale:
Although disturbance is possible, the transient nature of grizzly bears indicate that effects are unlikely
(discountable effect).
Project alternatives would not alter access management in the long-term (insignificant effect).
Food and attractant storage as a risk factor for grizzly bears due to project activities would be reduced or

93

Letter

Comments on the Flint Foothills DEIS and Forest Service Responses
eliminated due to a project design feature that requires attractant storage (beneficial effect).

Concern

Based on the above rational in combination with the environmental baseline, the implementation of either action
alternatives May Affect, but is not Likely to Adversely Affect grizzly bears. Effects determination for grizzly bears
and consultation with USFWS is ongoing and will be completed prior to the Record of Decision for this project. The
project will comply with the biological opinion and all reasonable and prudent measures therein. Also, see
response to letter 5 comment 12.

6

Comment: 28. Even once the Forest Service receives a biological opinion on the management of grizzly bears
outside of designated recovery habitat, the agency will still be required to consult with the USFS on the Flint
Foothills Project.

Elk/Grizzly Bears

Response: See comment response for letter 6 comment 28.
Comment: 1. The Memorandum of Understanding between the Forest Service and the USFWS includes a
recommendation that the agency retain the integrity of known breeding sites of migratory birds. This would include
the goshawk and flammulated owl. However, the Forest Plan direction is only to protect raptor nesting areas from
disturbance, not to protect the integrity of the nest sites. isn’t there a conflict between the MOU and the Forest
Plan?
6

Response: The Forest Service is consistent with direction from the MOU with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
The MOU sates: “Forest Service Shall: …3. Within the NEPA process, evaluate the effects of agency actions on
migratory birds, focusing first on species of management concern along with their priority habitat and key risk
factors. To the extent practicable:…c. Consider approaches to the extent practicable, for identifying and minimizing
take that is incidental to otherwise lawful activities, including approaches such as: …3. Retaining the integrity of
breeding sites…”

Goshawks, Owls and Migratory
Birds

Additional Design Features are included to minimize disturbance during breading season and protect active nests
for goshawks, flammulated owls, great grey owls and migratory birds.

6

Comment: 2. The MOU also recommends that snags be retained where they are underrepresented. How does
this apply to the project?
Response: Snags would be retained according to Forest Plan direction, thereby ensuring consistency with the
USFWS-USFS Migratory Bird MOU, section D.3.c.2.

6

Comment: 3. Many of the migratory songbirds can use snags smaller than 15 inches dbh for nesting. Yet the
Forest Plan has no requirement for snags below 15 inches dbh. If there are no larger snags then no snags at all
are required. How can this Forest Plan direction maintain migratory songbirds in areas where there are few snags
over 15 inches dbh, as in the Project Area?

Goshawks, Owls and Migratory
Birds

Goshawks, Owls and Migratory
Birds

Response: The first part of your comment is based on a concern about Forest Plan direction and that is outside
the scope of this project.
The forest plan snag direction provides for retention and recruitment of the larger snags which are in shorter

94

Letter

Comments on the Flint Foothills DEIS and Forest Service Responses
supply. Literally millions of smaller snags are being created annually by the outbreak of mountain pine beetle and
not all of them are being harvested by this project. Not all smaller diameter trees are incurring 100% mortality,
which will provide for larger snags over time, hence the direction in table 13 (P.49) of the Plan.

Concern

Effects to migratory songbirds are evaluated in the Wildlife Section.
Forest Plan Wildlife standard 4 states: “Do not reduce the number of live trees greater than 10 inches dbh per acre
in regeneration harvest treatment units (to provide future snags) below the levels shown in Table 13…” live trees
less than 10 inches dbh The proposed “seed tree” units will meet this standard.
Comment: 4. The MOU notes that the Forest Service should coordinate with the USFWS if there are any adverse
impacts on birds from project activities. Please cite what coordination has occurred for the Flint Foothills Project,
which will negatively impact every single bird species that occurs on the BDNF, except possibly the cowbird.
6

6

Response: The USFWS-USFS Migratory Bird MOU, section D.3.d. prescribes coordination with USFWS when
planning projects are likely to have a negative effect on migratory bird populations. Summary of effects to
migratory birds as described in the Wildlife Section states that the action alternatives would not negatively impact
migratory landbird populations or their habitats. Design Features are included to minimize impacts to migratory
birds.
Comment: 5. The location of great gray and flammulated owI nests is unknown in the Project Area. So what is the
effectiveness of protecting nest areas from disturbance, if you don’t know where they are? The DEIS should note
that there is a high potential for impacting owl nesting activities as the location of nests are unknown. There
appears to be a significant population of both owl species in the project area.

Goshawks, Owls and Migratory
Birds

Goshawks, Owls and Migratory
Birds

Response: Both owl species have been documented in the project area. Additional surveys for these species will
be conducted prior to unit treatments. If nesting is confirmed, additional restrictions would be applied. See Wildlife
PDFs.

6

Comment: 7. If various owl nests have not been located to date, what are the chances that nests will be
discovered after the project has been implemented?
Response: Additional surveys are required prior to unit treatment, thereby increasing the likelihood that nesting
owls would be detected prior to project implementation.

6

Comment: 8.The DEIS claims that logging will improve flammulated owl habitat. The reference was not cited for
this, so please provide this in the FEIS.
Response: Additional citations concerning the potential for improvement of flammulated owl habitat through
treatment have been added to the FEIS.

6

Comment: 9.The maps do not show any 40 acre nest buffers for the known goshawk area. Why not?
Response: A figure showing the 40-acre disturbance buffer for the Gird Creek goshawk nest site has been added
to the FEIS.

Comments on the Flint Foothills DEIS and Forest Service Responses

Concern

Comment: 10. The DEIS seems to imply that the nest buffers are only for disturbance, and logging can occur after
the nest period. Is this correct? If so, the Forest Plan is misleading the public by suggesting that raptor nests will be
protected, when in fact they are not protected from logging.
6

Response: Yes, that is correct; the nest buffers are for protection of active nests from disturbance for 5 years as
per the Regional NOGO guidance. Additional no-activity buffers (420 acres) until August 15 are included to protect
post-fledgling areas.. Forest Plan standard 9 states, “Mitigate, through avoidance or minimization, management
actions around known active nest sites of threatened, endangered, proposed candidate, and sensitive bird species,
if those actions would disrupt reproductive success during the nesting period.” There is no Forest Plan allocation
for permanent nest site protection.

Goshawks, Owls and Migratory
Birds

Comment: 11. Please cite the science that suggests that logging of raptor nests sites is an appropriate
conservation strategy to ensure continued occupancy of the landscape by these species.
6

Response: For goshawks and several other raptor species, the Wildlife Section discloses direct and indirect
effects, including potential impacts to nest sites. The project reduces potential impacts to nesting raptors by
applying Forest Plan standard #9 which requires the project mitigate management actions around known nest site
of TEPS bird species if those actions would disrupt reproductive success during the nesting period. This standard
also applies to great gray owl and northern goshawk.

Goshawks, Owls and Migratory
Birds

Comment: 12. The DEIS only evaluated goshawk nesting habitat, while foraging habitat was ignored. Please
provide an analysis of current and projected goshawk foraging habitat within the known territory, and within the
Project Area, as per the 6 structural stages the southwest guidelines, as these can be replicated quite closely with
the V -map process in Region 1.

6

Response: Samson (2006) estimated the Northern Region provides critical habitat that far exceeds the threshold
for viability (more than 32 times). Bush and Lundberg’s update (2008) estimated goshawk nest habitat 13.8 times
that needed for Regional viability. ERG (2010) estimates goshawk habitat in the Clark Fork-Flints landscape to
over 6 times that needed for Regional viability in this landscape alone.

Goshawks, Owls and Migratory
Birds

Because habitat is currently widespread and abundant, and predicted to continue to be widespread and abundant
over the next 50 years, despite the current mountain pine beetle outbreak, this evaluation focuses on the FP
standard for protection of known active nest sites and applies mitigation guidelines described in the Regional
Overview.

6

Comment: 13. What is the apparent problem with the loss of almost all of the historic goshawk nesting areas?
Why doesn't this indicate a problem with diversity? Given that the Project Area is over 37,000 of Forest Service
lands, there should be at least 6 active goshawk territories present, not just one.

Goshawks, Owls and Migratory
Birds

Response: Goshawk nest occupancy is known to vary from year to year, depending on such factors as weather
and prey availability. In addition, nest site selection can vary within individual territories. Surveys conducted for

goshawks in 2011 visited 9 historic nest sites that were last verified active over 10 years ago. Additional surveys
will be conducted prior to project implementation, as described in the project design features within the FEIS.
Comment: 14.Why isn’t the postfledging area for the Gird Creek goshawk known nesting area identified, and
management direction provided? The current best science indicates that this is required in order to maintain longterm use of a nesting area.

Concern

Goshawks, Owls and Migratory
Birds

Response: Please refer to the response for 6.15. Protections for PFA are included in the Design Features should
the Gird Creek nest be active during the year of implementation.
6

Comment: 15. It was our understanding that the Northern Region Overview for goshawks required nesting areas
to be protected in their current condition. This seems to be contradicted by this Project. Which is it?

Goshawks, Owls and Migratory
Birds

Response: The FEIS applies the Northern Regional Overview nest and PFA project level guidance.

6

Comment: 16.The current availability of goshawk foraging habitat appears to be extremely limited in this Project
Area, as the V-map information shows only 50 acres of none-lodgepole pine forests over 10 inches dbh with a
canopy cover over 60%. This problem regarding goshawk habitat, and all the species that require similar habitat,
clearly was not addressed in the DEIS.
Response: Goshawks prey species utilize a range of vegetation types and structural stages for foraging . In
Region 1, goshawk foraging habitat is classified as stands with canopy closure greater than 40 percent, one or 2storied structure, regardless of average stand tree diameter (Samson 2006, Bush and Lundberg 2008). Queried
Vmap results show that approximately 8,200 acres consisting of non-lodgepole pine conifer stands (i.e. Douglasfir, ponderosa pine, spruce-fir) occur on FS lands within the project area.

Goshawks, Owls and Migratory
Birds

Comment: l. Please provide the specific criteria by which wildlife diversity should be measured in the Forest Plan
as well as in the Project Area in order for the agency to address the NMF A requirements to maintain diversity.
6

6

Response: NFMA does not include language regarding wildlife populations being well distributed at the project
level. There is direction to provide for a diversity of plant and animal communities based on the suitability and
capability of the specific land area in order to meet overall multiple use objectives, and within the multiple use
objectives of the land management plan (Forest Plan).

Comment: 4. There was no analysis as to what impact the openings over 40 acres will have on wildlife, including
lynx, grizzly bears, wildlife dependent upon well-distributed snag habitat, elk security as per Christensen et al.
1993, and foraging habitat in goshawk home ranges, for example. Please address the problems large openings will
create for these wildlife, and identify why these adverse impacts are either necessary or will be balanced out by
other wildlife benefits in the Project Area.

Comments on the Flint Foothills DEIS and Forest Service Responses
Response: Effects analysis for large openings has been included in the FEIS.
Comment: 5. The DEIS and the Forest Plan do not provide any actual strategy to maintain the diversity of wildlife
associated with old growth. What are the criteria for maintaining old growth-associated species on the Forest and
in this Project?

Concern

Old-growth: associated
species

Response: Please see responses to comments 6.1 and 6.6.
Comment: 6. There is no management indicator species for old growth in the Forest Plan. It is not clear, as well,
what the “habitat proxy” is for old growth-associated species as the goshawk, great gray owl, brown creeper,
pileated woodpecker, winter wren, black-back and three-toe woodpeckers, flammulated owl, Canada lynx, and
pine marten, for example. Please define what the strategy is for these old growth species in the Project, and what
science this is based on so that the public can understand how diversity as per the old growth species will be
maintained in the Project Area.
Response: The analysis for the Forest Plan reviewed old growth types and wildlife present on the Forest and
failed to establish the presence of any old-growth obligate species. There are no MIS species for old growth
identified for the BDNF. The selection of the current Forest Plan terrestrial MIS species was approved by the
Regional Forester’s approval of the plan. All wildlife related aspects of the FEIS for the Plan were sustained by the
Washington Office review of 56+ appeals (Gloria Manning, 2009).
6

There is no specific old growth conservation strategy for this project. Rather, the Forest Plan vegetation direction
(pp. 43-44) provides the strategy for the Forest. The Forest Plan direction is designed to restore, maintain and
retain a range of landscape conditions under which species evolved.

Old-growth: associated
species

Without action, where the stands are densest, individual trees may die from competition or insects. Over time,
canopy gaps would fill in and result in a decline of other species (aspen, shrubs, herbaceous vegetation). Higher
stand densities and development of ladder fuels would increase the risk of wildfire, bark beetle infestations, and in
some areas, successional replacement by shade-tolerant competitors. Existing old growth may be reduced due to
mortality to large trees from bark beetles, with large ponderosa pine trees potentially becoming scarce with some
stands falling out of old-growth status without treatment within 50 years (Vegetation section). It is expected that
under the no-action alternative, mortality in overstocked Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine would continue at an
increasing rate given the current trend in local climatic conditions coupled with the existing dense and multi-layered
stand conditions (Vegetation section). Habitat for several species including the flammulated owl is predicted to
continue to decline in the Clark Fork-Flints landscape in both the short and long-term (ERG 2010).

6

Comment: 7. The Forest Plan states that all old growth will be retained, at least to the minimum standards of large
trees as per Green et. Al. 1991 (e.g. FEIS at 1048, 1052-53, 1060). The Biological Evaluation for the Plan, for
example, as 25, 32 says the Forest Plan “in most cases” prohibits activities that adversely affect old growth, and
that impacts to later successional states is expected to be minimal. If this is the case, how can potential and
existing lodgepole pine old growth be clearcut?

Old-growth: associated
species

Response: The first part of your comment is based on a concern about Forest Plan direction and that is outside

98

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement – Volume 2 Appendices

Letter

Comments on the Flint Foothills DEIS and Forest Service Responses
the scope of this project. However, the lodgepole pine section of the vegetation report on p. 99 of the DEIS states,
“No proposed salvage by clearcut activities in old-growth or potential old-growth stands would occur.” in the Flint
Foothills project area.

Concern

Under the plan, treatments (both mechanical harvest and prescribed fire) could occur in old growth stands as long
as the treatments do not cause the stands to no longer meet the minimum old growth stand characteristics
standards described by Green et al. Such treatments are expected to occur in relatively few of the old growth
stands on the forest More careful reading by the commenter would avoid potential misinterpretation.
Comment: 8. There are a number of migratory birds that are dependent upon older undisturbed forests, including
Montana Species of Concern as the brown creeper, pileated woodpecker, winter wren, pileated woodpecker,
northern goshawk, flammulated owl, great gray owl, and black-back woodpecker. The current best science
recommends that 20% of the landscape provide habitat in larger blocks (blocks over several hundred acres at a
minimum) for these species. Please disclose what the existing level of old growth is in the Project Area, the size of
these blocks, and whether this old growth is at elevations suitable for these species. If the level of old growth is
below 20%, how is the agency meeting the diversity requirement per the NFMA, as this suite of species is not be
occurring at viable levels.
Response: The Forest Plan ensures viability for wildlife through application of Forestwide goals, objectives, and
standards. Forest Plan direction ensures management of a variety of habitats in various successional stages to
ensure the viability of a variety of species dependent upon those different habitats. In addition, retention of specific
habitat components (snags and downed woody debris) is addressed through wildlife standards 3, 4 and 12 in the
Forest Plan.

6

The issue of old-growth dependent species was raised on appeal of the Forest Plan. The Appeal Decision found
that the Forest Plan and its associated management direction adequately provides for wildlife species viability and
provides necessary management direction to achieve conservation of individual species at the project level. This
project meets the wildlife standards in the Forest Plan.

Old-growth: associated
species

There is no requirement in the planning regulations to map old growth. Based on FIA data, the Clark Fork-Flints
landscape has approximately 21 percent old growth across all forest types (Bush et al. 2006). Page 80 in the DEIS
also discusses the existing old growth in the planning area.
The commenter does not cite which best science is referenced. The brown creeper and the pileated woodpecker
are heritage ranked as S3: Potentially at risk because of limited and/or declining numbers, range and/or habitat,
even though it may be abundant in some areas.
Winter wren is heritage ranked as SNA (A conservation status rank is not applicable for one of the following
reasons: 1) The taxa is of Hybrid Origin; is Exotic or Introduced; is Accidental or 2) is Not Confidently Present in
the state).
Samson (2006) indicated the critical habitat threshold for pileated woodpecker viability, for instance, at 95,382
acres for the entire Northern Region. The Bush et al. (2008) update to Samson shows a total of 78,087 acres of
pileated nesting and foraging habitat for the BDNF alone.

Comments on the Flint Foothills DEIS and Forest Service Responses

Concern

Comment: l. It is unclear exactly why wildlife habitat in unroaded areas is planned for burning. Please be more
specific as to why this will benefit wildlife and which species.
Response: In discussing the existing vegetation condition, the Vegetation Section describes that forest structure
and composition have been altered due to lack of fire disturbance . Stands at mid to higher elevations are currently
homogeneous in structure, whereas past fire disturbances suggest a heterogeneous landscape.
6

The desired condition statements described in the Forest Plan (pg. 43) recognize the importance of maintaining
ecological processes and natural disturbance processes in contributing to self-sustaining wildlife populations. In
addition, these processes largely determine the capability of the landscape in supporting healthy populations.
While ecosystem structure and function are dynamic in space and time, management approaches to restore and
maintain a range of landscape conditions within which species evolved are most likely to provide for species
viability (Forest Plan FEIS, pg. 1056).

6

Comment: 2. One of the losses that will occur with burning is removal of hare habitat. Why would this be
considered a necessary as well as beneficial management action?
Response: The Wildlife Section acknowledges that snowshoe hare habitat may occur within the project area, but
further field reconnaissance is needed to verify habitat presence. An additional project design feature (PDF) has
been incorporated to maintain snowshoe hare habitat, if present, within the burn unit.
Comment: 4.The lack of fire will clearly benefit the lynx as per the current best science, as this species is
dependent upon multi-canopied older forest stands as winter habitat.
Response: Lynx primary prey species, snowshoe hare, are known to utilize early successional stages generated
by disturbance, such as fire (ILBT, 2013). . A In remaining areas where prescribed fire is applied, forest
regeneration is likely to benefit snowshoe hares.
Comment: 5. There is no discussion in the DEIS about the adverse impacts on lynx by clearcutting lodgepole pine
stands, which will result in long-term loss of developing old growth forests that are required for winter habitat.
Response: The lynx effects analysis in the FEIS tiers to standards in the Northern Rockies Lynx Management
Direction (2007). Standards Veg S1 and Veg S2 address regeneration activities in lynx habitat. Analysis shows
that these standards are being met by the project.
Comment: 6.The BDNF has not yet completed consultation with the USFWS on lynx, which means this project is
in conflict with the Endangered Species Act.

provide a summary of the lynx surveys that were done to determine whether or not this project area contains lynx.

Concern

Response: Terms and Conditions as provided within the USFWS Biological Opinion on (USDI FWS 2007) are
outlined in the Northern Rockies Lynx Management Direction (pgs. 29-30). Term and Condition (TC) 4 describes
that the Forest Service shall work with the FWS to develop and complete an acceptable protocol to survey
currently unoccupied lynx habitat in secondary areas. No specific requirements are specified for pre-project lynx
surveys in unoccupied habitat in secondary areas, which include the project area. The BDNF has conducted
surveys according to terms and conditions.
Comment: 8. There is occupied lynx habitat (verified) only about 10 miles to the north of the project area; in the
Garnett Mountains. It seems unusual that there would not be any lynx also in the project area.

Response: A review of past lynx survey on the BDNF is provided in the Wildlife Section. None of the surveys
resulted in confirmed lynx presence. The BDNF remains classified as unoccupied by Canada lynx.

Roadless/Prescribed

Comment: 5. There is no management indicator species for snags in the Forest Plan. Why is this, since
management activities, both partial and complete removal of forests, will reduce snags, and over 25% of forest
birds require snags for nesting, and thus will clearly be affected by management activities.
Response: There is no requirement to select a management indicator species (MIS) for every habitat. MIS were
selected during Forest Plan revision and rationale for selection of MIS at the Plan level is found in the Forest Plan
FEIS (pg. 493) and Planning Record. Those MIS potentially found in the project area (elk, wolverine, and mountain
goat) have been analyzed for this project (DEIS, pgs. 21-223).

Snags

Comment: 8. We are concerned about retention of larger acres of natural, undisturbed forests that will provide
foraging habitat for woodpeckers, or woodpecker management areas. Since past logging areas have few to no
snags, and the status of snags in proposed units is unknown to possibly nonexistent, the opportunity to meet
wildlife diversity of woodpeckers, and hence 25% of forest songbirds that depend upon woodpeckers to create
nesting cavities, is threatened in this landscape. Please provide an analysis of the current and proposed availability
of large blocks of woodpecker habitat in the Project Area for meeting diversity requirements. Also, please note that
high elevation areas are generally unsuitable for both woodpeckers and songbirds, due to climatic extremes and
low productivity of these habitats.
Response: The Forest Plan on pp. 43-44 includes vegetation goals, objectives and standards that comprise the
strategy for maintaining biodiversity. The biodiversity goal states, “…a variety of disturbance processes are
managed or allowed to occur that produce resilient vegetation communities able to sustain diversity in the face of
uncertain climate-influenced disturbances.” To meet this goal, the Forest Plan includes objectives by vegetation
type.

Snags

There would not be woodpecker management areas set aside in this project. The Forest Plan ensures viability for
wildlife through application of Forestwide goals, objectives, and standards. Forest Plan direction ensures
management of a variety of habitats in various successional stages to ensure the viability of a variety of species
dependent upon those different habitats. In addition, retention of specific habitat components (snags and downed

woody debris) is addressed through wildlife standards 3, 4 and 12 in the Forest Plan.

Concern

To help meet vegetative and wildlife biodiversity over time, ERG (2010 projected millions of acres of blackedbacked woodpecker habitat and hundreds of thousands of acres of pileated woodpecker habitat through the year
2060. (See executive summary pages ES-14 and ES 19 respectively). Literally millions of smaller snags are being
created annually by the outbreak of mountain pine beetle and not all of them are being harvested by this project.
Additionally, nearly 100% of the lodgepole pine in the project area is effected by mountain pine beetle providing
ample snag habitat.
Comment: 16. There are many bat species that are currently listed as Montana Species of Concern that are
potentially at risk due to population and/or habitat declines. Most of these species as well as dependent upon
snags and lower elevation old-growth forests. What is the rationale for not evaluating project impacts on this suite
of mammals, since they are clearly vulnerable to logging projects?
6

Response: The DEIS analyzed effects of the project on federally-listed species, Forest Service sensitive species,
Management Indicator Species, and Species of Special Interest as identified in the Forest Plan. Forest Service
sensitive species are designated by the Forest Service Regional Office and often include state species concern or
other species for which viability is a concern. Bat species considered for analysis in the DEIS include Townsend’s
big-eared bat and spotted bat, both of which are classified as Species of Concern in the State of Montana. The
Forest Plan considered for analysis of viability all State species of concern having also been identified as Tier 1
species (i.e., species with the greatest conservation need; Forest Plan, pg. 1057-1058).

Snags

Comment: 23. The DEIS suggests that the Forest Plan snag policy will maintain viability of the black-backed
woodpecker. However, it appears that there are no snags required for retention in any of the harvest units, so how
can snag management protect this species?

6

6

Response: Effects to black-backed woodpeckers are provided in the Wildlife Section and show that black-backed
woodpecker habitat is best analyzed at the regional scale, as these birds are adapted to moving with forage
availability. Tree mortality caused by insects, disease, and fire are ecological processes that are important for
black-backed woodpeckers. These processes operate at relatively large scales both in time and space due to
factors such as climate. The species itself is adapted to irruptive movements over large distances to new sources
of habitat. This suggests that a viability strategy for the black-backed woodpecker should be regional in scale; that
distribution of habitat is not a limiting factor; and that lack of habitat in the BDNF at some points in time would not
impair the viability of the species as a whole if such habitat existed elsewhere.Also stated, (Bonn, Dixon, Kennedy,
& Pengeroth, 2007) . Key Findings: (1) populations appear to be increasing in the United States; (2) habitat is
abundant and well-distributed across the Region and by Forest; (3) habitat has recently increased and is expected
to continue to increase as fires and insect outbreaks continue; (4) the level of salvage timber harvest is
insignificant across the Region; and (5) the amount of habitat required for a minimum viable population compared
to that available indicates that it far exceeds that needed, given the natural distribution of the species and their
habitat.
Comment: 18. Please identify the average snag sizes used by the known cavity nesting species on the BDNF, and
explain how limited snag management to snags over 15 inches will affect the distribution and viability of these

various species.

Concern

Response: Distribution and viability of cavity nesting species on the BDNF was addressed and analyzed in the
Forest Plan FEIS. Snag retention levels identified in standard #3 (Forest Plan, pg. 48) were designed to meet
species viability needs. This project adheres to snag retention levels identified in Standard #3.

6

Comment: 15. Is it correct that 5,500 acres of the 7,512 acres on adjacent private lands in the Project area have
been logged as per the DEIS at 183? How is this impact addressed for snag management on Forest Service
lands?

Snags

Response: Additional analyses pertaining to the cumulative effects of habitat conditions on black-backed
woodpecker and flammulated owl have been included in the FEIS.
Comment: 14. The DEIS failed to define what the current impact of no snags in almost 23% of the area’s forest is
having on cavity nesting wildlife and woodpeckers. This means the agency has not taken a “hard look” at creating
yet more acres of non-snag habitat.
6

Response: The DEIS acknowledges that about 23% of FS lands within the project area are expected to be very
low on snags due to timber harvest occurring since the 1960s (DEIS, pg. 152). The DEIS also, however, displays
the substantial amount of acres where tree mortality due to beetle activity has increased snag availability, both at
the landscape level (DEIS, pg. 152), and for cavity nesting species including black-backed woodpecker and
flammulated owl. This amount is considered non-habitat when calculations are presented for percentage of
available habitat treated vs. untreated for both cavity nesting species.

Snags

Comment: 19: The Forest Plan snag strategy appears to be an “all or nothing strategy.” It is not clear exactly what
science this is based on, as it will result in vast areas of the forest having no snags. The current best science
recommends snags every 5-25 acres. Please cite the science which supports the agency’s program of creating
vast areas without snags. The only reference provided in the Forest Plan was Bollenbacher et al. 2008, but this
was not a research study on snag use by birds. That study was simply a measurement of snags on the landscape.
6

Response: The Forest Plan does not promote the creation of vast areas free of snags. Standard 3 clearly
describes snag retention and recruitment requirements to include: “If there are insufficient snags in treatment units,
live trees in the same size class must be retained and counted towards the snag requirement. These would be in
addition to any requirements of standard 4. The Forest Plan snag direction provides for retention and recruitment
of the larger snags, which are in shorter supply. ERG (2010) projects millions of acres of blacked-backed
woodpecker habitat and hundreds of thousands of acres of pileated woodpecker habitat through the year 2060
(see executive summary pages ES-14 and ES 19 respectively).

Snags

Literally millions of smaller snags are being created annually by the outbreak of mountain pine beetle and not all of
them are being harvested by this project. However, not all smaller diameter trees are incurring 100% mortality,
which will provide for larger snags over time, hence the direction in table 13 (P.49) of the Forest Plan.

That said, impacts to snags and snag associated birds have been analyzed in detail in the Wildlife Section. The
vegetation section, pp. 73-77 in the DEIS, also discusses insects and diseases and their effects on trees in the
Flint Foothills project area.

Concern

Comment: 21. There is current science available to define management for the pileated woodpecker, which is
known to occur in the Project Area. Why wasn’t any of this science applied to the Project?
Response: Pileated woodpeckers are not on the Region 1 Sensitive Species list, nor are they identified as MIS in
the Forest Plan. Therefore, analysis that would cover pileated woodpeckers habitat is based on Forest Plan
direction. Forest Plan vegetation management direction is designed to restore, maintain and retain a range of
landscape conditions under which species evolved.
Samson (2005) indicated the critical habitat threshold for pileated woodpecker viability, for instance, at 95,382
acres for the entire Northern Region. The Bush et al. (2008) update to Samson shows a total of 78,087 acres of
pileated nesting and foraging habitat for the BDNF alone. As noted in the Samson and Bush references, there are
no viability issues for this species in the Northern Region requiring extraordinary management.

6

That said, impacts to snags and snag-associated birds have been analyzed in detail in the DEIS pp. 151-153,
162,163, 179-184, 240. The vegetation section pp. 73-77 in the DEIS, also discusses insects and diseases and
their effects on trees in the Flint Foothills Project area.

Snags

According to the ERG assessment (2010), currently only 7% of the forested landscape analysis area meets the
criteria (ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, or cottonwood stands equal to or greater than10 inches dbh) for pileated
woodpecker nesting habitat. Modeled pileated woodpecker habitat in the Clark Fork – Flints with no treatment was
estimated to be at its highest level in 2030 at approximately 151,500 acres. After that, habitat decreased again.
Habitat modeled however with treatments similar to those proposed in this project show habitat steadily increasing
through 2060. See the table below for modeled habitat, from the ERG assessment, with and without treatments.

Comment: 22. The three-toed woodpecker uses areas with up to 70 snags per acres for nesting. They also have
territory requirements of several hundred acres. Where will these areas be retained in the Project Area, and how
does the agency know that these areas will be adequate to maintain three-toed populations over time?

Snags

Response: Three-toed woodpeckers are not on the Region1 Sensitive Species list, nor are they identified as MIS
in the Forest Plan. Therefore, most of the analysis that would cover their habitat is based on Forest Plan direction.
Forest Plan vegetation management direction is designed to restore, maintain and retain a range of landscape

conditions under which species evolved.

Concern

That said, impacts to snags and snag-associated birds have been analyzed in detail in the DEIS pp.151-153, 179184, 240. The vegetation section pp. 73-77 in the DEIS also discusses insects and diseases and their effects on
trees in the Flint Foothills Project area.
During the Forest Plan Revision process, snag density was calculated using current forest inventory and analysis
(FIA) data that was collected through 2003. For this estimate, Bush et al. (2006) found an average of 4.3 snags 10
to 19.9 inches dbh per acre in the Clark Fork-Flints Landscape. Areas of past timber harvest are expected to be
very low on large snags; those that were left would most likely have fallen by now (lodgepole fall between 5-15
years). Much of the analysis area is in a size class that is susceptible to mountain pine beetle. According to the
vegetation report on p. 85 in the DEIS “…virtually all (about 100 percent) of the 18,142 acres of lodgepole pine
greater than 5 inches in diameter has been affected by mountain pine beetle.”
Fire, both prescribed and natural, and insect and disease outbreaks tend to create snags, while timber harvest
activities can reduce snag density. From 2000 to 2007, more than 300,000 acres of forested landscape in the
analysis area and surrounding national forests were affected by fire, more than 5 million acres were affected by
insects, and less than 45,000 acres were harvested or thinned. It is expected that there will be increasing snag
densities in all diameter classes over time across the Region due to the ongoing and predicted future increases in
mountain pine beetle epidemics and fire events (Bollenbacher et al. 2008).
Comment: 9. An ongoing study on the Helena Forest has found that the three-toed woodpecker nests in areas
with an average of 70 larger snags per acre. How is this information being applied to this Project?
6

Response: The study mentioned above was completed in predominantly ponderosa pine stands with a small
amount of lodgepole. Of the nests located, 82% of the three-toed woodpecker nests were in ponderosa pine trees.
This study does not seem relevant to the Flint Foothills project as approximately half of the vegetation in the
project area is lodgepole pine, with the other half comprised of Douglas-fir and a minor component of ponderosa
pine.

Comment: 17. The only way woodpeckers, and thus 25% of the forest songbirds, can be preserved on the
landscape, and thus provide for biological diversity, is to provide woodpecker management area, or larger areas of
unfragmented, undisturbed forests where natural processes are allowed to occur. Please include an analysis in
this project as to where there is a potential for woodpecker managements areas in this heavily disturbed
landscape, and how the project will impact them.

Snags

Response: There will not be any woodpecker management areas set aside in this project. See response to letter 6
comment 8.
Natural disturbance processes are present in the project area as discussed in the DEIS pp. 73-79. Insects and
diseases are producing a large supply of dead and dying trees across the project area, as discussed on pages7377 in the DEIS.

Response: The inventoried gate location figure is provided in the Transportation Report (Bielecki 2014) and the
Wildlife section of this FEIS.
Comment: 24. Biodiversity may be an important consideration for new projects or when special habitats (i.e.,
wetlands, threatened and endangered species habitat) will be affected. The state of the art for this issue is
changing rapidly. We recommend that potential project impacts on biodiversity be at least briefly evaluated and
discussed in the NEPA document. CEQ prepared guidance entitled, “Incorporating Biodiversity Considerations Into
Environmental Impact Analysis Under the National Environmental Policy
Act,” http://ceq.hss.doe.gov/publications/incorporating_biodiversity.html.

7

Response: We have reviewed the CEQ guidance as suggested and find it helpful, if only to put into larger context
the interdisciplinary analysis that forms the basis for this EIS and that of the Forest Plan. Biodiversity as a higher
order concept, and in essence summarizes the individual resource analyses and connects their effects in larger
context. Specifically, aspects of biodiversity are analyzed in all the resource sections in the Flint Foothills EIS,
albeit not by the same name. Habitats and ecosystem processes are discussed primarily in the context of
vegetation and aquatics analyses herein; however existing conditions and predicted future effects of alternatives
on those conditions are disclosed for other resource areas as well (e.g. sensitive plants, noxious weeds, and
wildlife). In reviewing the CEQ guidance scale, both temporal and spatial, are important considerations in
addressing effects to biodiversity in NEPA analyses. Designing a methodology small enough to be responsive to
changes proposed in alternatives that disclose a sufficiently site-specific level of effects yet still meet the aim of a
larger spatial-scale discussion and disclosure of effects on that level is challenging. This analysis addresses each
resource effects analysis by delineating, in some cases, multiple spatial and temporal scales for analysis of the
resource under several alternatives, as well as consideration of the action alternatives in addition to other past
present and reasonably foreseeable actions. Ideally, this helps to satisfy disclosure of effects at both the sitespecific scale as well as larger/longer scales that may have implications for biodiversity.

Wildlife/T&E Species

Fortunately, the recent revision of the Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (Forest Plan) also underwent
NEPA analysis at a scale that may provide regional-level insight regarding resource effects over the life of the
Forest Plan on biodiversity. In some cases the effects of the various components of the Forest Plan on biodiversity
are specifically disclosed in those terms, in other cases they are discussed in terms of the effects to that resource
component, similar to the EIS for this project. This analysis tiers to the Corrected FEIS for the Forest Plan.
Furthermore, goals and objectives for habitat components and the species that depend upon them are provided
(see Forest Plan Vegetation Management Goals and Objectives) thereby incorporating a set of biodiversity goals
into the larger planning framework that this project helps to implement.
Comment: 16. Does the project comply with the Regional visual standards?
2

Response: There are no regional standards for scenery management. Both the Proposed Action and Alternative 3
meet the goals, objectives, and standards outlined in the 2009 Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest Revised
Land and Resource Management Plan. The Forest manages the scenery of its lands using concepts described
under the Scenery Management System. Standards from the Forest Plan give a specific set of expectations
referred to as Scenic Integrity Objectives (SIO) to ensure a properly managed resource.

Visual standards

106

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement – Volume 2 Appendices

Letter

Comments on the Flint Foothills DEIS and Forest Service Responses
The distribution of SIO within the project area is 10% High (4369 acres) and 90% Moderate (40,115 acres).
Moderate and High SIO are described in the Glossary of the Forest Plan as:

Concern

• High- Human activities are not evident. Activities may only repeat attributes of form, line, color and texture found
in the existing attributes, qualities or traits of landscape that give it an image and make it identifiable or unique.
• Moderate – Human activities must remain visually subordinate to the attributes of the existing landscape
character. They may repeat form, line, color, texture common to these characteristics but changes in quality, size,
number intensity, etc. must remain visually subordinate to the attributes, quality or traits of a landscape that give it
an image and make it identifiable or unique.
All proposed activity seen from CL 2 platforms are in a Moderate SIO management objective. No activity would be
seen from CL 1 platforms or areas that have a High SIO management objective. In some cases, Scenic Integrity
Objectives would not be met immediately after management activities have been completed, but would be met
over time as vegetation ‘greens up’ the area. It is important to note that the Forest Plan (per direction provided by
the Scenery Management System) does not attach timeframes to meeting Scenic Integrity Objectives. Instead,
timeframes for meeting Scenic Integrity Objectives are disclosed in the project scenic resources analysis. This
analysis assumes all best management practices, project design features, or mitigation measures identified under
each alterative area would be applied. Since all Scenic Integrity Objectives would be met, the project is consistent
with the Forest Plan scenic resources standards (Forest Plan p. 33).
Comment: 26. Why aren’t you doing more to protect and not harm habitat for westslope cutthroat trout?
Response: We believe there is adequate protection for westslope cutthroat trout to meet all legal and regulatory
requirements in the form of design criteria and mitigation measures (FEIS chapter 2) under all action alternatives.
Because westslope cutthroat trout is sensitive species, the Forest Service is required to protect their habitat and
prevent population declines that would lead to listing under the Endangered Species Act (FSM 2670).
2

In 1999, the Regional Forester signed the "Conservation Agreement and Management Plan for Westslope
Cutthroat Trout in Montana.” It was updated in 2007 and the Forest is still committed to its implementation. There
are five objectives; two of which are relevant to this proposed project. The first objective is to protect all genetically
pure populations. The second objective is to protect all populations that are only slightly introgressed (90 percent
pure).

Fisheries

The protections and improvements to westslope cutthroat trout habitats that would occur through implementation
of Alternatives 2 or 3 would have a positive effect on populations and so are consistent with these requirements.
Please refer to Analysis Question #3 for action Alternatives 2 and 3 in the Environmental Consequences section of
the Fish and Aquatics portion of the FEIS ; addressing the persistence of WCT populations within the analysis
area.

Comment: Water Resources/Hydrology/Fisheries 2. Thank you for including project area watershed maps
(Figures 39 and 40), which facilitate understanding and review of the watershed analyses in the DEIS. We also
appreciate the DEIS disclosures regarding streams in the project area listed as water quality impaired by the
Montana Dept. of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) under Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act (i.e., Barnes Creek,
Dunkleberg Creek, North Fork Douglas and Douglas Creeks and Gold Creek). The DEIS indicates that Barnes

Water

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement – Volume 2 Appendices

Letter

Comments on the Flint Foothills DEIS and Forest Service Responses
Creek is the only water quality impaired stream in the project area that is listed with sediment as a pollutant cause
of impairment. We note that MDEQ’s 303(d) listing website (http://cwaic.mt.gov/) indicates that the probable
sources of Barnes Creek water quality impairment are irrigated crop production and grazing. We also note that
water quality impairment in Douglas Creek identifies silvicultural activities among the potential sources of
impairment, with probable causes listed as nitrogen and nitrate and physical substrate habitat alterations (related
to sediment) (waterbody MT76E003_020, 7.1 miles partial aquatic life use impairment from the confluence of its
Middle and South Forks to Flint Creek).

Concern

We recommend that the potential effects on Douglas Creek’s nitrogen and nitrate levels and physical substrate
habitat due to proposed Flint Foothills project silvicutural activities be more fully addressed in the watershed and
water quality impact analyses. The DEIS indicates that past timber harvests in the Douglas Creek drainage
involved the highest percentage of watershed harvested in any project drainage (i.e., 8.2 percent of acreage
harvested, page 278). Table 81 (page 292) indicates that 2.0% of the Douglas Creek watershed would be
harvested in the currently proposed Flint Foothills project so that the total cumulative harvest in this watershed
would be 10.2%, which is the highest cumulative harvest amount in any of the project drainages. Although the
DEIS predicts little total water yield increase from timber harvests due to beetle killed trees (page 279), and states
that previously harvested areas have generally recovered hydrologically from the prior harvests, which were
conducted in the 1980’s and 1990’s (page 293). We are still concerned about potential effects on Douglas Creek
channel stability and substrate habitat. Will the Douglas Creek channel remain stable and stream substrate be
minimally affected by proposed additional harvests despite the cumulative watershed harvest of 10.2% of the
watershed acreage (i.e., past and present harvest)?
Response: There should be no measurable negative change in channel stability or substrate habitat in Douglas
Creek, from actions proposed in alternatives 2 or 3.
We have added to - and refined our analysis to describe effects of past and proposed vegetation treatments on
stream channels within Douglas creek drainage; and those in other drainages. Please refer to Environmental
Consequences within the Hydrology section of the EIS; under analysis question #1 - What are the effects on water
quality; Indicator 1 –changes in sediment delivery to surface waters; and analysis question #2 – what are the
effects on stream channel morphology.
We expect no measurable change in nitrates in Douglas Creek (see response above). However, since the effects
from prescribed fire backing to within 100 feet of streams has not been well documented on the BDNF, we have
included monitoring for water quality changes related to nitrates in Douglas Creek. Please see the monitoring
section in chapter 2 of the FEIS.

Comment: 9. Runoff that flows from logging roads into a system of ditches, culverts, and channels and then into
forest streams and rivers constitutes a point source under the Clean Water Act and requires a National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”) permit. Do you have a permit? Please disclose all such locations in the
Project area and demonstrate that you have complied with the NPDES permitting process for these point sources.
When we went on the field trip to the project area with you, we almost caught stuck because there was so much
mud and the road and sediment was clearly going into the streams

Permits

Response: A recent Supreme Court decision states that runoff from logging roads does not require a NPDES
permit..

Comment: 28. Are there any WQLS streams in the project area and if so are the TMDLs completed and are you
complying with them?
2

Response: Water quality- limited stream segments within the project area are identified in the Hydrology section in
chapter 3. Consistency of each alternative with TMDLs is analyzed in the Environmental Consequences section of
the EIS for Hydrology; under Analysis Question #1; Indicator 3 – consistency of project effects with TMDLs on
Water Quality Limited Streams.

Water quality: WQLS/TMDLS

Comment: 12. Are the watersheds in the project area functioning at risk, functioning at unacceptable risk, or in a
properly functioning condition?
2

Response: Watershed conditions for all watersheds with National Forest Lands have been classified using a
nationally standardized process defined in the Watershed Condition Classification Technical Guide (please refer
Potyondy and Geier 2011, in the project record). We have added the assessed conditions of watersheds within the
project area under “Watershed Conditions and Descriptions” in the Affected Environment Section for Hydrology in
the EIS.

Watershed function

Comment: #. Are the watersheds in the project area functioning at risk, functioning at unacceptable risk, or in a
properly functioning condition? The USFWS guidelines call for road densities in properly functioning condition of, 1
mile/mile squared and no valley bottom roads. Are the watersheds meeting this standard? If not please close or
move roads as part of this project to comply with the Clean Water Act.

2

Response: We have added the information you’ve requested to the Final EIS (see response to comment 12
above).
The USFWS guidelines you are referring to are based on desired conditions for bull trout. This information should
not be interpreted to mean watersheds cannot function properly if road densities are above a certain threshold.
While road density is commonly used in aquatics analysis as one of many indicators used to assess watershed
condition it does not determine or define it.

Watershed functioning

For watershed condition, road density is appropriately used as a “risk indicator”. Depending on road locations and
characteristics and watershed geology, soils, topography and precipitation patterns, it is possible to have higher
road densities, with limited effects on watershed function.

7

Comment: Monitoring 15. We consider monitoring to be an integral part of land management. The EPA endorses
the concept of adaptive management whereby effects of implementation activities are determined through
monitoring (i.e., ecological and environmental effects). It is through the iterative process of setting goals and
objectives, planning and carrying out projects, monitoring impacts of projects, and feeding back monitoring results
to managers so they can make needed adjustments, that adaptive management works. In situations where
impacts are uncertain, monitoring programs allow identification of actual impacts, so that adverse impacts may be
identified and appropriately mitigated. Monitoring also allows verification and documentation of environmental
effects predicted during NEPA evaluation.

Monitoring

EPA particularly believes that water quality/aquatics monitoring is a necessary and crucial element in identifying
and understanding the consequences of one's actions, and for determining effectiveness in BMPs in protecting

109

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement – Volume 2 Appendices

Letter

Comments on the Flint Foothills DEIS and Forest Service Responses
water quality. The achievement of water quality standards for non-point source activities occurs through the
implementation of BMPs. Although BMPs are designed to protect water quality, they need to be monitored to verify
their effectiveness. If found ineffective, BMPs need to be revised, and impacts mitigated. We encourage adequate
monitoring budgets for conduct of aquatic monitoring to document BMP effectiveness and long-term water quality
improvements associated with road BMP work and road decommissioning.

Concern

We did not see much discussion of water quality or aquatics monitoring in the DEIS. It is stated that monitoring
takes place to test whether BMPs are protecting beneficial uses (page 273), and monitoring involving
measurement of changes in abundance of the mayfly Drunella doddsi (DD) over time is used as an indication of
changing sediment levels (page 316). However little detail regarding this aquatic biological monitoring for the
proposed project is provided (e.g., where and when such biological DD monitoring occurs). We did not see much
specific discussion regarding project aquatics monitoring to determine that the BMPs are effective as implemented
to meet State water quality standards, or to validate DEIS predictions of minimal water quality impacts.
We recognize that there are limited resources for monitoring, and that the Flint Foothills Vegetation Management
project is likely to have minimal water quality impacts if the project is carried out as designed and all appropriate
BMPs are applied, particularly if Alternative 3 is selected that does not include construction of new roads.
However, we encourage conduct of some aquatic monitoring to document and measure water quality impacts of
the activities that are implemented. We encourage adequate monitoring budgets for conduct of monitoring to
document BMP effectiveness and effects of road construction and timber harvests.
We generally recommend that some aquatic monitoring be included in projects, using aquatic monitoring
parameters such as channel cross-sections, bank stability, width/depth ratios, riffle stability index, pools, large
woody debris, fine sediment, pebble counts, macroinvertebrates, etc.. Biological monitoring can be particularly
helpful, since monitoring of the aquatic biological community integrates the effects of pollutant stressors over time
and, thus, provides a more holistic measure of impacts than grab samples.
We note that there may be PACFISH/INFISH Biological Opinion (PIBO) monitoring sites in the project area that
could be used to help evaluate actual project effects (http://www.fs.fed.us/biology/fishecology/emp/index.html). If
there are PIBO monitoring sites in the area, perhaps they may be considered for their potential to evaluate project
effects.
Response: Regarding your comment that we provided little detail for the proposed project’s monitoring of Drunella
doddsi (DD): Monitoring is always designed to answer questions at a specific geographic scale. Sampling intensity,
distribution and sample site selection are all determined based on the size of the area where we are trying to
evaluate change. The strength in DD monitoring comes from having many examples where the same management
direction (i.e. Forest Plan) is applied and patterns of effects can be observed.
We will become more certain of management effects on DD when a number of projects across the Forest are
assessed and common trends can be evaluated. For this reason, we’ve provided summarized DD data from
across the Forest, along with data from within the project area. The information essentially provides a baseline for
comparing the current status of DD within the project area relative to the rest of the Forest. Future sampling will
document changes after project implementation that can be compared to some other areas that have had projects
and some that have not.
With regard to the usefulness of PIBO data to help us evaluate effects from this project. PIBO sampling was

designed to evaluate effects across the range of bull trout. Having said that, we recognize that all previously
collected data within the analysis area are potential sources to help with future evaluation, if we see a need. In
those cases we would replicate protocols and return to previous monitoring sites.

Concern

Regarding your comment suggesting we do BMP effectiveness monitoring. We identified we would do that in the
Monitoring section in chapter 2 under Transportation.
Regarding your comment encouraging us to conduct aquatic monitoring to document and measure water quality
impacts from the project: We have included monitoring to evaluate the potential effects of prescribed fire in RCAs
on changes in sedimentation (Blum Creek) and changes in nutrients in Douglas Creek. Prescribed fire is the
management treatment in this project that has the potential for adverse effects to extended lengths of stream
(although the analysis considers the risk to be nominal).Beyond this, we believe our design features (chapter
2)have effectively mitigated the risk of measurable aquatic effects from this project. Limited budgets and the
considerable expense of monitoring, require that we carefully choose and focus efforts where the information we
gain will be most useful. Beyond BMPs we believe our resources are most appropriately spent answering
questions on other projects.
Regarding your comment suggesting we use PIBO monitoring data to help evaluate project level effects: PIBO
monitoring was designed to determine effects of land management across the range of Bull Trout (i.e. the pacific
northwest). As such, this data is not intended to describe effects at the project scale. The design and sample size
limits a reasonable determination of effects for a single project.
Even so, the PIBO data provides some description of conditions prior to project implementation. If needed it may
have some application in a qualitative assessment of change after the project is completed; provided the Forest
sees a need for this.
Comment: 9. We are pleased that the project design features and mitigation measures include many measures to
avoid and minimize impacts to aquatic resources (pages 55-57), and specify the need to obtain necessary permits
for activities that would disturb streams and wetlands (e.g., 404 permits, Montana Streamside Protection Act (SPA)
124 permits). We encourage the BDNF to contact Mr. Todd Tillinger of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
Montana Office in Helena at 406-441-1375 to determine applicability of 404 permit requirements to proposed
construction activities in or near streams or wetlands.
7

We note that if a 404 permit(s) is eventually required to implement aspects of the proposed project that involve
disturbances to streams and wetlands there would also be a need to obtain appropriate water quality standards
certification from the Montana DEQ in accordance with Section 401 of the Clean Water Act. We encourage contact
with Mr. Jeff Ryan of the Montana DEQ at 406-444-4626 in regard to 401 certification. A short term turbidity
exemption is generally also required from the State when operating heavy equipment in waters of the State (e.g.,
318 authorization). To ease the administrative burden the Federal and State agencies have developed a single
permit application for the various potential permits or authorizations that may be needed
(http://dnrc.mt.gov/permits/default.asp,

Comments on the Flint Foothills DEIS and Forest Service Responses
Response: The Forest will acquire all necessary permits for land management actions undertaken in this project.

Concern

Comment: #. We also recommend that the potential project effects on Douglas Creek be better addressed in the
FEIS disclosures regarding watershed and water quality impacts. Silvicultural activities are listed by the State of
Montana to be among the probable sources of water quality impairment in Douglas Creek. The DEIS indicates that
past timber harvests in the Douglas Creek drainage involved the highest percentage of watershed harvested of
any project drainage (i.e., 8.2 percent of acreage harvested), and 2.0% of the Douglas Creek watershed is
proposed for new additional harvests in the proposed Flint Foothills project so that the total cumulative harvest in
this watershed would be 10.2%. This would be the highest cumulative harvest amount in any of the Flint Foothills
project drainages, and since Douglas Creek is water quality impaired, with probable causes of impairment listed as
nitrogen, nitrate and physical substrate habitat alterations, we recommend additional analysis and disclosure
regarding potential water quality and stream channel effects.

7

Response: We have added to and refined our analysis to describe effects of past and proposed vegetation
treatments on stream channels within Douglas creek drainage; and those in other drainages. The original analysis
simply summed the acres of past and proposed harvest units to estimate the potential for changes in water yield
and peak flows. However, different types of vegetative treatments leave varying amounts of trees standing within
units. The revised analysis considers the percentage of forest canopy removed, as well as the vegetative recovery
that has occurred since the treatment; in conjunction with what is proposed under this project. Because of this, the
numbers you reference have changed. Please refer to Environmental Consequences within the Hydrology section
of the FEIS for the changes.

Water quality

We expect no measurable change in nutrients in Water Quality limited streams from this proposed project. No
timber harvest would occur within RCAs preventing the potential for organic inputs from harvest.
Prescribed fire would be allowed to back into RCAs in units adjacent to Douglas Creek. The effects are described
in the Hydrology Environmental Consequences Section of the FEIS under Analysis Question #1 - What are the
effects on water quality; Indicator 3 – Consistency of project effects with TMDLs on Water Quality Limited Streams.
To validate our assessment of no measurable effects, we have included monitoring for water quality changes
related to nitrates in Douglas Creek. Please see the monitoring Design Features, Mitigations and Monitoring for
Alternatives section in chapter 2 of the FEIS.
We believe the potential for effects on stream substrate are adequately considered and described in the
Environmental Consequences section of the FEIS for Hydrology; under Analysis Questions #1 - What are the
effects on water quality; Indicator 1 –changes in sediment delivery to surface waters; and #2 – What are the effects
on stream channel morphology. Both are considered for each alternative.

7

Comment: We also recommend that the BDNF consult with Montana DEQ TMDL program staff to assure that the
MDEQ considers the proposed Flint Foothills Vegetation Management actions to be consistent with development
and implementation of applicable TMDLs and water quality improvement and restoration of support for beneficial
uses in 303(d) listed streams (contact MDEQ staff such as Mr. Dean Yashan at 406-444-5317, and/or Mr. Robert

Response: Thank you for your comment, we communicate regularly with Montana DEQ and are familiar the
TMDLs that have been developed, not only for this project area; but across the Forest.

Concern

Comment: 3. We are pleased that the DEIS states that target values for road and upland sediment sources for
Barnes Creek that are specified in the Draft Flint Creek Planning Area Sediment and Metals Total Maximum Daily
Loads (TMDLs) and Framework Water Quality Improvement Plan would not be exceeded, and no additional
degradation to 303(d) listed streams would be expected with the implementation of soil and water quality BMPs,
implementation of the required RCAs and improvements to road drainage, and any changes to stream water
quality would probably not be measurable relative to natural variation (pages 296, 303).

We recommend that the BDNF consult with Montana DEQ TMDL program staff to assure that the MDEQ considers
the proposed Flint Foothills Vegetation Management actions to be consistent with development and

Resources/Hydrology/Fisheries

Response: Thank you for your comment, we communicate regularly with Montana DEQ and are familiar with the
TMDLs that have been developed and the process used in developing them; not only for this project area; but
across the Forest. We specifically address whether proposed actions under Alternatives 2 and 3 are consistent
with TMDLs for impaired waters within the analysis area. Please refer to analysis in the Environmental
Consequences section of the FEIS for Hydrology; under Analysis Question #1; Indicator 3 – consistency of project
effects with TMDLs on Water Quality Limited Streams.
Comment: 4. We appreciate the DEIS analysis and discussion of water yield and channel stability effects in regard
to the project watersheds (pages 277-279, 291-293). While our earlier comment #2 mentioned a concern regarding
potential water yield/channel effects regarding the past and proposed cumulative timber harvests on Douglas
Creek, we note that the DEIS indicates that the highest proposed timber harvest (4.1 percent) would be in the Gold
Creek watershed, followed by 3.8 percent harvest of the watershed of Lower Flint Creek-Gird Creek.

7

Over 500 acres of salvage by clearcut is proposed in the Gold Creek watershed (page 293), but the DEIS indicates
that the overall percent of trees to be harvested, combined with past harvest is well under a 25 percent threshold
(for channel stability) for the watershed. The DEIS states that as trees grow back in harvested areas,
evapotranspiration would increase, and more incoming precipitation would be taken up by vegetation or
evaporated, and less water would be available to re-supply shallow and deep groundwater and available for runoff.
It also states that most of the proposed harvest in the other project watersheds would be treated by commercial
thinning, with large, dominant trees left after treatment, and thus, measurable increases in water quantity would not
be expected in commercially thinned areas.

Water
Resources/Hydrology/Fisheries

We are pleased that the DEIS estimates that no notable changes in flow volume, or alteration to timing of peak
flows would be expected from proposed vegetative treatments and that stream channel effects are not expected
from proposed harvest and burning activities.

Comments on the Flint Foothills DEIS and Forest Service Responses
Comment: Wetlands and Riparian Areas 10. EPA considers the protection, improvement, and restoration of
wetlands and riparian areas to be a high priority. Wetlands and riparian areas increase landscape and species
diversity, and are critical to the protection of designated water uses. Executive Order 11990 requires that all
Federal Agencies protect wetlands. It is important that wetlands and riparian areas be properly managed to
maintain and restore the health of watersheds and aquatic resources to sustain aquatic and terrestrial species and
provide water of sufficient quality and quantity to support beneficial uses. Adequate riparian vegetation in streamside areas must be maintained to stabilize streambanks and stream channels during floods and other periodic high
flow events.

Concern

Wetlands and Riparian Areas

The DEIS states that no wetlands or springs were observed within proposed project units, although it also states
that springs and seeps were observed throughout the project area (page 280). It appears unlikely that there would
be no wetlands within harvest units. We recommend that all harvest units be reviewed in the field to determine the
presence of wetlands, and that if wetlands are found that they be identified on the Sale Area Map and flagged on
the ground to better assure that timber contractors will be able to avoid them.
Response: Thank you for your comment. Any wetlands that exist within proposed harvest units will be identified
and marked so appropriate protection of RCA s would occur.

7

Comment: 11.We are pleased that Inland Native Fish (INFISH) Riparian Conservation Area (RCA) buffers would
be used in the proposed project (i.e., 300 feet buffers from perennial streams and 50 feet from intermittent
streams), to reduce the risk of sediment delivery to streams, provide a source of large woody debris for channels,
and help maintain cooler stream temperatures. RCAs are an important management element in the Interior
Columbia Basin (ICB) Strategy to maintain and restore the health of watersheds, riparian, and aquatic resources to
sustain aquatic and terrestrial species and provide water of sufficient quality and quantity to support beneficial uses
(see http://www.icbemp.gov/html/icbstrat.pdf; and “A Framework for Incorporating the Aquatic and Riparian Habitat
Component of the Interior Columbia Basin Strategy into BLM and Forest Service Plan
Revisions,” http://www.icbemp.gov/html/aqripfrm7804.pdf. It is important that proposed federal land management
activities in the ICB are consistent with the riparian management objectives described in the ICB Strategy, which
include:

Wetlands and Riparian Areas

* Achieve physical integrity of aquatic ecosystems;
* Provide an amount and distribution of woody debris sufficient to sustain physical and biological complexity;
* Provide adequate summer and winter thermal regulation;
* Provide appropriate amounts and distributions of source habitats for riparian- or wetland-dependent species; and
* Restore or maintain water quality and hydrologic processes.
* Restore or maintain naturally functioning riparian vegetation communities.

Road Maintenance and BMP

114

Comments on the Flint Foothills DEIS and Forest Service Responses
and needs from this Project all be met by this Project?

Concern

Response: BMP’s will be applied to all haul routes within RCAs first; focusing work on the areas most important in
reducing road-related sediment effects on aquatic resources. Remaining funds will be applied to roads outside
RCAs. The Project Design Features and Mitigation section in chapter 2 of the FEIS, has been updated.
Comment: 16 (continued).The Flint Foothills project area is located on the northern edge of Montana Airshed 5
(Upper Clark Fork) and adjacent to the southern edge of Montana Airshed 3B (page 110). Three Class I air quality
areas are identified within approximately 62 miles of the project boundaries (Table 36), including the AnacondaPintler Wilderness (27 miles to the south); Gates of the Mountains Wilderness (35 miles to the northeast); and the
Scapegoat Wilderness (41 miles north). The area surrounding the city of Butte is stated to be the only air quality
non-attainment area for particulates (PM10) within 100 kilometers of the project area (located approximately 28
miles southeast from the southern-most boundary of the Flint Foothills project area, page 108). We generally
recommend that the EIS include a map showing the relative locations of Class I areas and any PM10 and PM2.5
non-attainment areas that may be affected relative to areas of prescribed burns to improve public understanding of
the proximity of sensitive areas to proposed burning activities.
7

We are pleased that the DEIS states that all prescribed burning would comply with the requirements of the State
Implementation Plan and the Smoke Management Plan (page 50), and that burning is reported to the Airshed
Coordinator on a daily basis. The DEIS also states that a prescribed burn plan would be completed prior to any
burning to address mitigation measures to minimize smoke impacts and comply with State and Federal air quality
regulations; and if ventilation problems are forecast by the monitoring unit, prescribed burning will be restricted by
elevation or curtailed until good ventilation exists. In addition it states that Best Available Control Technologies
(BACT) would be implemented during prescribed burning operations to limit emissions to the maximum degree that
MDEQ determines for that source on a case-by-case basis. Techniques and methods include: scheduling burn
periods, applying dispersion forecasts, fuel preparation and configuration, and limiting the amount of burning,
ignition and burning techniques that minimize smoke production. We suggest that the website for the
Montana/Idaho State Airshed Group, http://www.smokemu.org/ be displayed in the EIS, since it may be of interest
to the public.

Air quality

Response: We believe that the EIS adequately displays the information for Class 1 airsheds and non-attainment
areas. A map of the Class I airsheds and non-attainment area and the website for the Montana/Idaho State
Airshed Group has been added to the Air Quality section of chapter 3.

7

Comment: 16 (continued). The DEIS acknowledges that prescribed fire can affect air quality at the time of the
burning, but states that effects are expected to be minimal and of short duration (page 375). It also states that
smoke from prescribed fires is unlikely to impact the Butte PM10 non-attainment area because the Montana/Idaho
Airshed Group would restrict burning during periods when dispersion would transport smoke toward this area, and
all prescribed burning activity would be coordinated and conducted through the Montana/Idaho Airshed Group
smoke management program to ensure that impacts to air quality would be minimized. The DEIS states that all
alternatives would be consistent with clean air regulations, laws, policies, and programs (page 111).

Air Quality

While we appreciate the information provided regarding potential air quality impacts of prescribed burning, we
often recommend additional disclosures. We recommend that a list of the current NAAQS be provided, and that

115

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement – Volume 2 Appendices

Letter

Comments on the Flint Foothills DEIS and Forest Service Responses
pollutant emissions (i.e., particulates) should be quantified as much as possible for any prescribed burning and for
construction, traffic, and wind erosion on new and existing roads for activities associated with this project (e.g., see
pages 25 and 26 of the 2010 Montana/Idaho Airshed guide found
at, http://www.smokemu.org/docs/20100601OpsGuide.pdf ). Air pollutants that are projected to be emitted in
substantial amounts should have further mitigation applied (i.e. fugitive dust control requirements/road surfacing
requirements, use of combustion technology such as air curtain destructors, etc.).

Concern

We also recommend that the FEIS include: (1) discussion of appropriate smoke monitoring techniques and
mitigation to minimize effects to nearby residents downwind of prescribed burns (including meteorological
conditions favorable for mitigated prescribed fire smoke and alternatives to prescribed fire such as mechanical fuel
reduction methods); (2) requirements for the incorporation of the Interagency Prescribed Fire Planning and
Implementation Procedures Guide (July 2008, http://www.nwcg.gov/pms/RxFire/rxfireguide.pdf ) into the sitespecific burn plans designed for each prescribed burn conducted under this project; and (3) commitment to public
notification of pending burns. It is important that residents downwind of burn areas be notified prior to the proposed
prescribed burning, since even though burns will be scheduled during periods of favorable meteorological
conditions for smoke dispersal, the weather can change causing smoke not to disperse as intended. This can be
especially problematic for smoldering pile burns when a period of poor ventilation follows a good ventilation day.
Response: As stated in the EIS all prescribed burning activity would be coordinated and conducted through the
Montana/Idaho Airshed Group smoke management program to ensure that impacts to quality will be minimized.
The project implementation will be consistent will the Forest Plan and all clean air regulations, laws, policies and
programs identified in the EIS. The NAAQS will be added to the air quality section of the EIS. Dispersion of smoke
will be monitored on the day of the burn. A site specific burn plan will be written for all prescribed burning in the
project area that follows the Interagency Prescribed Fire Planning and Implementation Guide which includes
notification of publics that within the vicinity of the burn units. Those plans are site specific in nature and are not
written until fire managers can look at a unit that is ready for treatment and determine fuel loading, need for fireline
and locations, hoselays and pump locations, equipment and personnel needs. It would be pure speculation and
conjecture to attempt to add the burn plan requirements to the FEIS.

Comment: Mr. Wetsch informed District Ranger Charlene Bucha Gentry that he wants to be notified in advance of
implementation of the prescribed burns contained in the proposed action. As an adjacent landowner to NFS lands
in the project area he wants to be made aware prior to ignition. He also stated that he is in support of the proposed
action.

Response: We refer the commenter to the reference section of the DEIS 428-451 that lists approximately 300
publications, the majority of which are peer reviewed papers, including Forest Service authored documents. Some
of the Forest Service citations are monitoring reports or other annual reports, which are not peer reviewed.

NEPA/NFMA Requirements

Comment: 3. Please clarify the purpose of the project. Removing beetle-killed trees is not necessary for forest
management, nor to prevent fires as per the current best science. This landscape is heavily logged (23% of public
forests logged), and it is obvious that watershed/roading problems are extensive. There are almost no goshawks in
this area, and the open road densities are creating hazards for grizzly bears that may attempt to travel through this
linkage area. There was no rationale connection between the existing conditions in this landscape and the
proposed action, which is to exacerbate these problems. The agency needs to explain more clearly to the public
why further degradation is planned, rather than restoration. There was no alternative that would address many
public concerns about existing problems in this landscape. The No Action alternative would not do any restoration.
6

Response: The Background section in Chapter 1 of the FEIS summarizes the vegetation conditions that are
addressed by the purpose and need. The Vegetation section of the FEIS in Chapter 3 describes the conditions in
detail. The purpose (objectives) and need for the project is discussed in Chapter 1.

NEPA/NFMA Requirements

Forest Plan Timber Management Goals:
*Lands Suitable for Timber Production: Manage lands suitable for timber production for the growth and yield of
sawtimber, crop trees, pulpwood, and other forest products, including salvage harvest.
*Product Utilization: Forest products would be used to provide economic benefits where project objectives, forest
plan objectives, and forest plan standards can be met.
Forest Plan Timber Management Objectives on Lands Suitable for Timber Production:
Bring 10 percent of lands suitable for timber production into a managed condition

118

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement – Volume 2 Appendices

Letter

Comments on the Flint Foothills DEIS and Forest Service Responses
Manage those stands already in a managed condition to maintain long term sustained yield.

Concern

Forest Plan Vegetation Management Objectives:
Reduce forest density in the large size classes of dry forest communities and some lodgepole pine communities to
maintain or improve forest conditions.
*Douglas-fir Type: Increase the number of acres in the 0 to 5 inch DBH class on approximately on approximately
20,000 acres.
*Lodgepole Pine Type: Increase the number of acres in the 0 to 5 inch DBH class by approximately 74,000 acres.
Road Conditions, Safety And Water Quality:
There are existing roads in need of maintenance or reconstruction to minimize or eliminate potential sediment
sources to local streams. While addressing these conditions was not part of the purpose and need, road
maintenance and reconstruction associated with timber haul, in addition to the removal of dead and dying trees,
would provide for much needed maintenance and also a safer and more efficient transportation system, allowing
for additional mileage to be maintained with future annual maintenance funds. NFS haul routes would be improved
to comply with BMPs (transportatiaon section, FEIS); .
Modeling indicated implementation of BMPs would result in reductions in sediment at existing delivery sites and
would compensate for the effects of log hauling. Overall reductions in sediment delivery during project
implementation and after are estimated to occur in about 45 percent of current delivery sites. Many of these sites
are expected to see substantive enough changes to result in measurable positive effects Hydrology section,
Goshawks and Grizzly Bears:
The FEIS contains effects analyses pertinent to the northern goshawk and grizzly bear. The analysis describes
that only one northern goshawk active nest site was found during pre-project surveys. However, because surveys
focused on proposed treatment areas, much of the project area is unsurveyed. These unsurveyed areas contain
suitable habitats where goshawk additional nest sites may occur.
The FEIS describes that increased road densities are associated with increased risk to bears as well as decreased
use of available habitats. The implications of open road densities for existing condition (Alternative 1) and action
alternatives (Alternatives 2 and 3) are discussed in the FEIS. Additional reductions in road densities were not
included as an element in an alternative because road density reduction is not a project objective.
Vegetation:
The existing condition discussion in the Vegetation section ties directly to the proposed action and objectives. The
Flint Foothills project is not a fuels reduction project. Alternative 3 was developed to address public concerns over
temporary road construction and potential impacts to water quality and aquatic habitat, and invasive plants.

Comment: Air Quality 16. The Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Project action alternatives include

that fire would be used on 1,259 acres of mid to high elevation lodgepole pine stands and 731 acres of low
elevation ponderosa pine and Douglas fir stands (page S-13), and may occur in spring or fall over multiple years

Comments on the Flint Foothills DEIS and Forest Service Responses
(page 14). The DEIS also states that unmerchantable material brought to landings would be piled for chipping or
burning, and burning would occur when weather and ground conditions are suitable to maintain air quality and the
burning can be controlled (page S-5).

Concern

The EPA supports judicious and well planned use of prescribed fire to reduce hazardous fuels and restore fire to
forest ecosystems, and we recognize and support the national goal reduce the risk of uncontrolled wildfire in
wildland-urban interface areas. Although as is well known, smoke from fire contains air pollutants, including tiny
particulates (PM10 and PM2.5) which can cause health problems, especially for people suffering from respiratory
illnesses such as asthma or emphysema, or heart problems. PM10 and PM2.5 particles are both of concern,
although PM2.5 is greater concern because it can penetrate into the lungs whereas larger particles (included in the
coarse fraction of PM10) deposit in the upper respiratory tract. Particulate concentrations that exceed health
standards have been measured downwind from prescribed burns.
In addition to health-based standards to protect ambient air quality, the Clean Air Act requires special protection of
visibility in the nation’s large National Parks and Wilderness Areas (identified as mandatory Class I Federal areas)
and establishes a national goal for “the prevention of any future, and the remedying of any existing, impairment of
visibility in mandatory Class I federal areas which impairment results from man-made air pollution.” EPA’s Clean
Air Act implementing regulations require states to submit State Implementation Plans that, among other things,
demonstrate attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), as well as reasonable progress
toward the national visibility goal. Actions by Federal Land Managers that lack adequate mitigation of air quality
impacts could impede a state’s ability to meet Clean Air Act requirements. It is important that Project activities,
when combined with air quality impacts from external sources, do not adversely impact the NAAQS or air quality
related values (AQRVs) such as visibility.
Response: Thank you for your comments. For clarification, the Flint Foothills Project is not a hazardous fuels
reduction project. The project area is not within a WUI. The use of prescribed fire is to reintroduce fire into the
landscape, Light underburning after commercial thinning in ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir stands would reduce
understory vegetation not removed during harvest to lower stand densities. Prescribed fire would be used on midelevation lodgepole pine and low-elevation Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine stands to reduce stand densities and
create a mosaic of age classes. Prescribed burning in low-elevation units would return the fire as a disturbance
process to the project area, and are designed to be low intensity with fire ignited over the entire unit, reducing
multi-layering understory trees and overall forest density. Air quality is addressed in the DEIS, p. 1

Comment: 21. Weed seeds are often transported by wind and water, animal fur, feathers and feces, but primarily
by people. The greatest vector for spread of weeds is through motorized vehicles-cars, trucks, ATVs, motorcycles,
and even snowmobiles. Weed seeds are often caught on the vehicle undercarriage in mud and released on the
Forest. A single vehicle driven several feet through a knapweed site can acquire up to 2,000 seeds, 200 of which
may still be attached after 10 miles of driving (Montana Knapweeds: Identification, Biology and Management, MSU
Extension Service).

Noxious Weeds

We believe an effective noxious weed control program should consider restrictions on motorized uses, particularly
off-road uses, where necessary. Off-road vehicles travel off-trail, disturbing soil, creating weed seedbeds, and
dispersing seeds widely. Restrictions on motorized uses may also be needed after burning and harvest activities
until native vegetation is reestablished in the disturbed areas to reduce potential for weed infestation of the
disturbed sites. Weed seed dispersal from non-motorized travel is of lesser concern because of fewer places to

collect/transport seed, and the dispersal rate and distances along trails are less with non-motorized travel.

Concern

We appreciate the DEIS discussion of the potential for motorized travel to carry seeds and spread invasive plants,
and Forest Service efforts to expend money and time educating the public on the importance of not spreading
invasive plant species and proper weed prevention practices (page 147). We are pleased that the DEIS states that
there is low potential for continued use of open, motorized roads by the public to result in measureable invasive
plant species spread into uninfested lands within the project area because of existing levels of invasive plant
species infestation, ongoing treatment efforts, and the effectiveness of past invasive plant species control efforts.
Response: Thank you for your comments.
Comment: EPA COMMENTS ON THE FLINT FOOTHILLS VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PROJECT DRAFT
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT (DEIS)
Brief Project Overview:
The Beaverhead Deerlodge National Forest (BDNF), Pintler Ranger District, prepared the Flint Foothills Vegetation
Management DEIS to address vegetation conditions resulting from insect and disease infestations. The Flint
Foothills project area encompasses 44,522 acres located on the north end of the Flint Range in the Clark Fork Flint
Landscape about 6 miles southeast of Drummond, Montana. Eighty-three percent of the area (37,010 acres) is
managed by the BDNF; the remainder is private in-holdings (7,512 acres). The project purpose and need is to
contribute to achievement of Forest Plan goals and objectives to produce timber for economic benefits, maintain
long term sustained timber yield, and improve forest conditions by reducing forest density in the large size classes
of dry forest communities and some lodgepole pine communities. No action (Alternative 1) and two action
alternatives (Alternatives 2 and 3) were evaluated. The DEIS did not identify a Preferred Alternative.

7

Alternative 2 is the proposed action which involves 1,163 acres of clearcut regeneration salvage of dead and dying
lodgepole pine; 1,149 acres of commercial thinning of ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir (including 121 acres in old
growth); 353 acres of seed tree with reserves harvest; 1,990 acres of prescribed burning; and 1,048 acres of precommercial thinning of saplings. Collectively, commercial vegetation treatments would provide 16,042 MBF
(32,083 CCF) in sawtimber; and 4,010 MBF (8,021 CCF) in non-saw timber. Approximately 1.3 miles of new
permanent road and 7.2 miles of temporary road would be constructed, and 1.1 miles of open and closed
unauthorized routes would be added to the Forest transportation system. Approximately 58.9 miles of road would
be maintained, and 41.7 miles would be reconstructed for log hauling.

Project Overview

Alternative 3 addresses concerns about new road construction, and logging within old-growth stands, no new
temporary roads would be constructed since eight units needing new temporary road construction are eliminated
(36S, 47S, 72S, 48C, 56C, 57C, 68C, and 71C). Six units utilize existing open and closed unauthorized routes to
and within the unit to accommodate logging (52S, 73S, 12C, 20C, 23C, and 80C). Instead, longer skidding
distances (averaging 1,425 feet) would be utilized to log the unit with ground-based systems. Four units are
reduced in size (23C, 25C, 55C, and 6C) by a total of 121 acres to eliminate commercial understory thinning of oldgrowth stands. Alternative 3 involves 1,022 acres of clearcut regeneration salvage of dead and dying lodgepole
pine; and 666 acres of commercial thinning of ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir (no thinning in old growth); and
would include the same treatment acres as Alternative 2 for seed tree harvest, prescribed burning and precommercial thinning treatments. Collectively, the commercial vegetation treatments would provide 12,686 MBF
(25,372 CCF) in sawtimber; and 3,172 MBF (6,343 CCF) in non-saw timber. Approximately 47.1 miles of road

would be maintained, and 38.3 miles would be reconstructed, and 1.1 miles of open and closed unauthorized
routes would be added to the Forest transportation system.

Concern

Response: This overview properly summarizes the purpose and need, and the alternatives as displayed in the
DEIS.

Comment: 1. We appreciate the inclusion of clear narrative discussions describing alternatives in the DEIS,
including the tables and maps summarizing the activities and features included in the two action alternatives;
discussion of project design features and mitigation measures; discussion of alternatives considered but eliminated
from detailed study; Table 20 comparing alternatives; and the many informative appendices included in Volume 2.
The DEIS narrative, tables, maps, and appendices facilitate improved project understanding, help define issues,
and assist in evaluation of alternatives providing a clearer basis of choice among options for the decisionmaker
and the public in accordance with the goals of NEPA.

Comment: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region VIII Montana Office has reviewed the Draft
Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) for the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest’s Flint Foothills Vegetation
Management Project in accordance with EPA’s responsibilities under Section 102(2)(C) of the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. Section 4321 et.seq., and Section 309 of the Clean Air Act, 42
U.S.C., Section 7609. Section 309 of the Clean Air Act directs EPA to review and comment in writing on the
environmental impacts of any major Federal agency action. EPA’s comments include a rating of both the
environmental impact of the proposed action and the adequacy of the NEPA document.

Review Overview

Response: Thank you for your review and comments.

7

Comment: The EPA understands the need to address the tree mortality, forest health, fuels and fire risk, and
timber salvage issues in the Flint Foothills project area of the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest (BDNF). Our
concerns regarding the proposed project are primarily associated with construction of new roads and the adequacy
of funding for the BDNF to maintain existing roads and proposed new roads. The DEIS states that “sediment
delivery to streams from roads poses the greatest risk to water quality.” Sediment from roads, particularly during
road construction, and from poorly maintained roads with inadequate road drainage and many stream crossings, is
of concern in regard to road effects. Roads and motorized uses can also adversely affect wildlife habitat,
connectivity and security, can adversely impact air quality, and promote spread of weeds and cause other adverse
ecological effects.

Review Overview

Response: For clarification, the Flint Foothills project is not fuels reduction project and does not address fuels and
fire risk. The adverse effects from roads are address in the environmental consequences section of the DEIS. We
believe that the road maintenance, reconstruction and decommissioning provide an improvement in long-term road
and watershed conditions. See letter 2, comments 6 and 11.

Comment: Alternative 2 proposes construction of approximately 1.3 miles of new permanent road and 7.2 miles of
temporary road, reconstruction of 41.7 miles of existing road and maintenance of 58.9 miles of road used for log

hauling. An amount of 1.1 miles of open and closed unauthorized routes would be added to the Forest
transportation system. Alternative 3 proposes no new road construction and includes 12 fewer miles of log haul
routes, but also involves 141 fewer acres of clearcut salvage harvest and 483 fewer acres of commercial thinning
(avoiding thinning in 121 acres of old growth).

Concern

Response: This is a correct summary of the two action alternatives.

7

Comment: We tend to support Alternative 3 over Alternative 2 due to its avoidance of new road construction.
Although we also recognize the need to conduct forest management activities to restore vegetative conditions,
improve forest resilience to fire, insects and disease, and salvage some dead and dying trees to provide timber
products for the local economy; and we recognize the need for road access to conduct vegetation management
activities.

Review Overview

Response: Thank you for your perspective.

7

Comment: We consider it appropriate to evaluate the many environmental and resource management trade-offs
(i.e., trade-offs in impacts among vegetation treatments, restoration of vegetative conditions, fire risk and fuels,
forest health, wildlife, water quality and fisheries, air quality, weed spread, old growth, and other resource impacts),
in an effort to optimize the trade-offs while addressing project purpose and need, the significant issues, and
minimizing adverse environmental impacts. We acknowledge that some minimal amount of new temporary road
may be needed to carry out particularly important vegetative restoration actions, although it is important that all
road be properly maintained.

Review Overview

Response: We concur with your comments.

7

Comment: The BDNF, therefore, may want to consider development of a modified preferred alternative in an effort
to optimize the environmental and resource management trade-offs. We have identified desirable features we
consider worthy of including in a modified preferred alternative in our more detailed comments (enclosed). We
recommend avoiding new road construction in the Dolus inventoried roadless area. Additional alternatives
evaluation in the FEIS may also better explain to the public the trade-offs involved in making land management
decisions, and may also lead to improved public acceptance of decisions. We note of course that the Forest
Service would need to evaluate and analyze the impacts of any new modified alternative that is developed, and
display those impacts in the FEIS.

Review Overview

Response: Thank you for your comments. For clarification, no activities are proposed within the Dolus Lakes IRA,
but are proposed within the unroaded areas adjacent to the IRA. As stated in the DEIS, “Collectively, IRAs and
unroaded areas can be referred to and analyzed together as a roadless expanse…” DEIS pp. 365. Temporary
road construction is proposed within the Dolus roadless expanse, which is adjacent to, but outside of the Dolus
Lakes IRA (DEIS pp. 372-379).

analysis, documentation, or potential environmental impacts of the Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Project
DEIS are included in the enclosure with this letter. Based on the procedures EPA uses to evaluate the adequacy of
the information and the potential environmental impacts of the proposed action and alternatives in an EIS, the

DEIS has been rated as Category EC-2 (Environmental Concerns - Insufficient Information) due to potential for
some adverse effects to water quality and road sediment effects from proposed management activities should
Ealternative 2 be selected. A copy of EPA's rating criteria is attached. We recommend additional analysis and
information to fully assess and mitigate all potential impacts of the management actions.

Concern

The EPA appreciates the opportunity to review and comment on the DEIS. If we may provide further explanation of
our comments please contact Mr. Steve Potts of my staff in Helena at 406-457-5022 or in Missoula at 406-3293313 or via e-mail at potts.stephen@epa.gov.
Response: Thank you for your review and comments and availability to answer questions.
Comment: Roadless 25. The DEIS indicates that the 9,365-acre Dolus Lakes inventoried Roadless Area (IRA)
overlaps the Flint Foothills project area, and 3,158 acres of the Dolus Lakes IRA are in the project area (page 365).
Roadless areas often provide population strongholds and key refugia for listed or proposed species and narrow
endemic populations due to their more natural undisturbed character. EPA supports protection of the pristine
character and integrity of remaining minimally disturbed roadless areas to prevent further fragmentation and
degradation of wildlife habitat, and to maintain or restore solitude and primitive recreation characteristics in such
areas.
The DEIS indicates that the Dolus Lakes IRA was not recommended for inclusion in the National Wilderness
Preservation System in the recent BDNF Forest Plan Revision. The vast majority of the IRA was assigned to the
Flint Uplands management area (MA), which is managed for a mix of semi-primitive motorized and non-motorized
recreation, as well as secure high-elevation wildlife habitat. Approximately 80 acres were assigned to the Flint
Foothills MA and managed for timber production, livestock grazing and dispersed recreation.

7

Alternatives 2 and 3 both include 1,513 acres of vegetative treatments in the roadless area (395 acres clearcut
salvage harvest; 42 acres commercial thinning; 366 acres of pre- commercial thinning; and 710 acres of prescribed
burning, Table 95, page 372). Alternative 2 proposes 0.59 mile of new temporary road construction, and
reconstruction of 0.39 mile of existing unauthorized routes in the roadless area to access the treatment units, while
Alternative 3 only includes the reconstruction of 0.39 mile of existing unauthorized routes in the roadless area.

Roadless

The DEIS states that none of the proposed vegetation treatments in the IRA would have long-term effects on the
boundary of, size or shape of, or access to the Dolus roadless area or change any of the existing conditions
regarding roadless area primeval and natural character. Access routes added (on the eastern edge of the roadless
expanse) would be temporary. It concludes that while the project would have some short- and long-term effects on
the wilderness attributes for the roadless area from clearcut salvage treatments and prescribed burning, there
would be no irreversible and irretrievable commitment of potential wilderness attributes. It also states that there
would be some beneficial effects from implementing Alternatives 2 or 3, such as increased forest resiliency in the
vegetative communities treated.
While we are concerned about potential short-term effects to the Dolus IRA from proposed actions that could
temporarily reduce the sense of solitude within some portions of the IRA due to noise associated with timber
cutting and hauling operations, it does not appear that long-term adverse effects would occur. We do not object to
treatments in the roadless area that would benefit the resiliency and long-term health of vegetative communities
and reduce risk of catastrophic wildfire that could impact the roadless area to a greater degree than the proposed
actions. Although we note that if the proposed vegetative treatments can be carried out without the construction of

124

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement – Volume 2 Appendices

Letter

Comments on the Flint Foothills DEIS and Forest Service Responses
0.59 miles of temporary road in the roadless area, as proposed in Alternative 3, we would support that proposal
over the Alternative 2 proposal.

Concern

Response: Thank you for your comments. The Forest Service also recognizes that Inventoried Roadless Areas
have the potential to provide high quality habitat and other resource values associated with a relatively undisturbed
character which many roadless areas possess, however existing roadless character of any given IRA varies
considerably depending upon the existing quality of roadless attributes of the IRA in question. In the Flint Foothills
project, the Dolus Lakes IRA is recognized in the Forest Plan FEIS to possess an overall moderate wilderness
capability (DEIS pp. 370), which effectively summarizes the existing quality of the wilderness attributes. More
importantly, no activities are proposed within the Dolus Lakes IRA, but rather are proposed within the unroaded
areas adjacent to the IRA to the North where the roadless values have already been degraded somewhat by past
management activities (DEIS pp. 371). As stated in the DEIS, “Collectively, IRAs and unroaded areas can be
referred to and analyzed together as a roadless expanse…” DEIS pp. 365. Temporary road construction and some
treatment units are proposed within the Dolus roadless expanse in unroaded areas to the North of the IRA. These
proposed actions would be adjacent to, but outside of the Dolus Lakes IRA (DEIS pp. 372-379).
Comment: Forest Vegetation 18. The DEIS Chapter 3 discussion of forest vegetation provides helpful
information regarding project effects on forest structure and composition, disturbance, insects and pathogens, fire
regimes, fuels and fire risks. EPA supports vegetative treatments to reduce fire risks, susceptibility to insect and
disease agents, improving forest structural diversity and ecological integrity. We also support the need to restore
fire as a natural disturbance process, and to help address competing and unwanted vegetation and fuel loads and
fire risk and forest health.

7

We generally favor understory thinning from below, slashing and prescribed fire to address fuels build-up with
reduced ecological impacts. We also favor retention of the larger more vigorous trees, particularly trees of
desirable tree species whose overall composition may be in decline (e.g., Ponderosa pine, aspen, whitebark pine).
The larger trees are generally long-lived and fire resistant, and provide important wildlife habitat. Harvest of many
live mature trees could potentially increase fire risk, as well as reduce wildlife habitat. If the forest canopy is
opened too much by removal of large fire resistant trees it may promote more vigorous growth of underbrush and
small diameter trees that would increase fuels and fire risk in subsequent years, contrary to the fire risk reduction
purpose and need.

Vegetation

We are pleased that the project design features and mitigation measures indicate that the best trees (free growing
and full crowned) would be retained with priority for retention given to species other than lodgepole pine; and all
trees (live or dead) greater than 20 inches dbh and all whitebark pine (regardless of size) would be retained.
Response: Thank you for supporting these design elements and for your comments.

7

Comment: The DEIS indicates that approximately 4.4 miles of existing open and closed unauthorized routes
would be reconstructed with the proposed action, and following implementation, these routes would be
decommissioned by various methods. We fully support decommissioning of roads, since as noted above sediment
delivery to streams from roads poses the greatest risk to water quality, and reductions in road density, especially
road stream crossing density, has often been correlated with improved aquatic health. We also note that lower
road densities are often associated with improved wildlife habitat, connectivity and security, and there is often a

Water quality (roads)

Letter

Comments on the Flint Foothills DEIS and Forest Service Responses
relationship between higher road density and increased forest use and increased human caused fire occurrences.
Reduction in road density, therefore, may also reduce risks of human caused fires, which could be important in an
area with high fuels/fire risk and/or wildland/urban interface issues.

Concern

Response: We concur with your comments.
Comment: 5. Roads and motorized uses often affect watershed conditions, water quality and fisheries in streams
on National Forests. Sediment from roads, particularly during road construction, and from poorly maintained roads
with inadequate road drainage and many stream crossings, is often of concern in regard to road effects. Roads are
often the major anthropogenic sediment source adversely affecting hydrology, water quality, and fisheries.
We appreciate the DEIS discussion of the effects of roads on watersheds and water quality, and disclosures of
road conditions and estimated road sediment yield in the DEIS (pages 275 to 277). We agree with the statement in
the DEIS that, “sediment delivery to streams from roads poses the greatest risk to water quality” (page 295). We
also note that roads and motorized uses can adversely affect wildlife habitat, connectivity and security; can
adversely impact air quality; and promote spread of weeds and cause other adverse ecological effects. We
generally encourage minimization of new road construction, especially roads near streams and that require new
stream crossings, and roads on steep slopes or erosive soils or other environmentally sensitive areas.
7

Accordingly we tend to support Alternative 3 involving no new road construction over Alternative 2 that would
involve construction of 1.3 miles of new permanent road and 7.2 miles of new temporary roads. Alternative 3 would
also involve 12 fewer miles of log haul routes (page 297). Although it is stated that only one new stream crossing
would be constructed under Alternative 2 (on a temporary haul route (T3) in Lower Flint Creek-Gird Creek, page
291), and both action alternatives are stated as being consistent with Barnes Creek sediment targets in the Draft
Flint Creek Planning Area Sediment and Metals TMDLs and Framework Water Quality Improvement Plan. We also
recognize the need to conduct forest management activities to restore vegetative conditions, improve forest
resilience to fire, insects and disease, and salvage dead and dying trees to provide timber products for the local
economy; and we recognize that road access is often needed for conduct of vegetation management activities.

Water
Resources/Hydrology/Fisheries

Response: Thank you for your comments. While road construction more fully supports accomplishing the purpose
and need, we appreciate your perspective. Project design features and mitigation measures in the DEIS, pp. 55-57
including BMPS, are integrated into the alternatives to minimize adverse effects to resources. See letter 7

Comment: - 22.The DEIS indicates that some threatened and/or endangered (T&E) species may occur in the
project areas such as the grizzly bear and Canada lynx. The DEIS indicates that grizzly bear observations have
not been reported within the project area (page 176), but grizzly bears have been documented in areas in close
proximity to the Flint Foothills Project area (page 166), and recent increases in grizzly bear sightings on and near
the northern portion of the BDNF may indicate a higher potential for grizzly bear occurrence in the future. The
DEIS reports that effects to grizzly bears and their habitats may occur as a result of temporary increase in road
densities, temporary reduction in security summer security area, project-related disturbance, and vegetation
modification. We are pleased that the BDNF will consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS)
concerning the effects of proposed Flint Foothills project activities on grizzly bears (page 176).

Wildlife/T&E Species

The DEIS reports that the BDNF is considered unoccupied habitat for the threatened Canada lynx (page 229), and

126

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement – Volume 2 Appendices

Letter

Comments on the Flint Foothills DEIS and Forest Service Responses
that while it stated that the project may affect lynx habitat, effects on lynx and their habitat are expected to be
minor, with impacts within the thresholds identified in the Northern Rockies Lynx Management Direction (page
237).

Concern

If it is found that the finally selected project alternative may adversely affect any T&E species the final EIS should
include the associated USFWS Biological Opinion or formal concurrence for the following reasons:
(a) NEPA requires public involvement and full disclosure of all issues upon which a decision is to be made;
(b) The CEQ Regulations for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA strongly encourage the integration
of NEPA requirements with other environmental review and consultation requirements so that all such procedures
run concurrently rather than consecutively (40 CFR 1500.2(c) and 1502.25); and
(c) The Endangered Species Act (ESA) consultation process can result in the identification of reasonable and
prudent alternatives to preclude jeopardy, and mandated reasonable and prudent measures to reduce incidental
take. These can affect project implementation.
Since the Biological Assessment and EIS must evaluate the potential impacts on listed species, they can jointly
assist in analyzing the effectiveness of alternatives and mitigation measures. If T&E species are subsequently
identified in the project area, EPA recommends that the final EIS and Record of Decision not be completed prior to
the completion of ESA consultation. If the consultation process is treated as a separate process, the Agencies risk
USFWS identification of additional significant impacts, new mitigation measures, or changes to the preferred
alternative.
Response: Thank you for your comments. Consultation with USFWS will be completed prior to completing the
final EIS and Record of Decision.

Comment: 23. The DEIS includes helpful discussion regarding availability of snags for cavity nesting species such
as black-backed woodpeckers and flammulated owls (pages 162-163). Table 46 (page 162) identifies the minimum
number of snags to be retained per acre in various vegetative habitats, and Table 17 (page 52) discloses Forest
Plan snag retention standards. The DEIS indicates that proposed treatments would remove up to approximately 7
percent of existing foraging habitat for the black-backed woodpecker, but at least 90 percent of the stands would
continue to provide potential foraging and nesting habitat, as long as mountain pine beetles and secondary beetles
are present (page 184).

Wildlife/T&E Species

We are pleased that the DEIS identifies mitigation measures for wildlife including cavity nesting species (pages 5254), and states that both action alternatives would maintain habitat for cavity nesting species across the project
area (page 163). It is stated that while project implementation may impact individual black-backed woodpeckers
and flammulated owls or their habitat it will not likely result in a trend toward federal listing or reduced viability of
the population or species (pages 184, 189).
Response: Thank you for your comments.

for dozens of jobs over a time period of several years.

Concern

In addition, this project is in concert with the Forest Plan that identifies this area as part of the suitable timber base.
The Board supports both the commercial timber units, as well as the precommercial thinning, and providing for
future timber harvest by preserving the seed trees.
The Board supports any salvage harvest of beetle killed or infected timber, to utilize any available commercial
value in a timely manner. Other elements that are of benefit include the prescribed fire treatment, to lessen the
intensity of potential wildfires in this area of the country. The small amount of new road construction is appropriate
in designated suitable timber base.
The Board fully supports the Pintler District Ranger in the scale and scope of this project, and welcomes the
benefits both economically and in terms of forest health offered by this project.

Comment. I have reviewed the DEIS for the Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Project. As a communal owner
of the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest I am saddened that the Responsible Official is proposing to cause
long-term harm to my natural resources using my tax dollars to prepare this corporate-friendly project.

Non-support

Response: Thank you for your views.
Comment: 10. The economic analysis seems to have not included all of the costs. The EA states the NEPA costs
are not included in the revenue estimate. Why not?

2

Response: A financial efficiency analysis is a forward looking analysis which compares costs and revenues that
occur in the future relative to a selection from multiple alternatives. The analysis reduces these future values to
present values using a consistent discount rate, reflecting the time value of money. The net of present costs and
present revenues is called the present net value.

Economics

Costs that occur prior to the decision are considered sunk costs, mainly because the decision has no bearing on
them, they will have already been incurred at the point when a decision is made. NEPA planning costs may or may
not be provided; when they are, they disclose the costs associated with analyzing alternatives. However, there is
no link between the selection and these NEPA costs which are in the past relative to the decision. It would be
technically inappropriate to include NEPA planning costs in a project-level financial efficiency analysis.

Comment: 15. Do unlogged old growth forest store more carbon than the wood products that would be removed
from the same forest in a logging operation?

Carbon storage

128

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement – Volume 2 Appendices

Letter

Comments on the Flint Foothills DEIS and Forest Service Responses
Response: The Vegetation Section of the DEIS (pg. 93) does state that net ecosystem productivity (the balance
between being a net carbon source and net carbon storage) is low in old stands (190 to 360 years), and that most
mature and old stands remain a net sink of carbon (Law et al. 2003). The proposed treatment would reduce on-site
carbon sources by removing the dead and dying lodgepole component, storing the majority or removed carbon in
long-lived forest products such as lumber. In the Flint Foothills Project, alternative 2 would remove products in 121
acres of old growth while retaining all of the old-growth components (the old trees) – changing the structure from
multi-storied to single-story. Small-diameter trees would be removed (young trees) with smaller amounts of carbon
stored. These trees would be milled into lumber and used in construction. The carbon remains in the wood
product, moving from being stored in the woods to the structure constructed. In the immediate aftermath of
removing smaller diameter trees in the old-growth stands as is proposed, less carbon would be stored in the postlogged site as compared to the same site if it were not logged.

Concern

Comment: 22. What beneficial ecological roles do beetles play?

2

Response: As there are many ‘beetles’ that serve many ecological roles in the world, it is assumed that the
question pertains specifically to bark beetles that are native to the Northern Rockies, which includes the project
area.

Ecosystem Process

Because disturbances are important to the function of forest ecosystems, bark beetles are ecologically beneficial
(Negron et al. 2008). Bark beetles play important roles in forest stand structure and net primary production
(Romme et al. 1986), bio-geochemical and hydrologic cycling (Edmonds and Eglitis 1989), and species diversity
(Martin et al. 2006) among other processes.
Comment: 23. Can the forest survive without beetles?

2

Response: As there are many types of beetles that occur in the forest, the assumption for this question is whether
or not the forest can survive without bark beetles. Additionally, there are many types of bark beetles for the
different forest communities, so the answer here will be in general terms speaking to one beetle, the mountain pine
beetle. Paleoecological reconstructions from two lakes in the Northern Rockies revealed a presence of what was
most likely mountain pine beetle. These beetle remains date back as far as 8,529 BP (before present), and occur
at different time intervals. Occurrence of these macrofossils suggest that when beetle populations reach epidemic
levels, beetle remains may be found in lake sediments (Brunelle et al. 2008). The question as to whether or not the
forest can survive without beetles is not known by this analyst. One known fact is both the forest and the bark
beetles have lived together over thousands of years.

Ecosystem Process

Comment: 19. What about the role of mixed severity and high severity fire – what are the benefits of those natural
processes?
2

Response: Fire as a natural disturbance and process is discussed in the DEIS (pg. 77-78). As the DEIS notes, fire
regimes are differentiated by the frequency, extent, severity, and timing for fire events associated with vegetation;
the role of mixed severity and high severity fire and the benefits of those natural processes is the influence on, as
the DEIS notes, the vegetation successional stages and fuel conditions, leading to landscape heterogeneity or
homogeneity.

Comments on the Flint Foothills DEIS and Forest Service Responses

Concern

Comment: 20. How have those processes (mixed and high severity fire) created the ecosystems we have today?

2

Response: As the DEIS notes on page 78, fire disturbances historically influenced the mosaic of stand age
classes and successional stages of lodgepole pine in the middle to upper elevations of the Flint Foothill area. The
processes of mixed- and high-severity fire have created the existing size classes in the project area; however, the
absence of fire the past 100 years has also influenced the size classes as well as the mountain pine beetle
epidemic. The ecosystems today in the Flint Foothills area, where mixed- to high-severity fires occurred (principally
in the lodgepole vegetation type) are skewed towards larger size classes; fire (when an active component) is the
dominate disturbance factor in determining size class (DEIS, page 79). The absence of fire within the past century
due to fire management strategies is the primary reason for the Flint Foothills area being dominated by larger size
classes, where all of the early seral conditions were created by timber harvest practices rather than natural fire
processes (see DEIS page 79). Whereas the process of natural fire disturbance (mixed and high severity) has
been disrupted in the past 100 years, the disturbance processes are still occurring in the Flint Foothills area, best
depicted by Figure 24 in the DEIS (pg. 100). Figure 24 shows the green-tree patches of young stands created by
clearcut harvest in the past 40 years, with the red and gray color of dead pure lodgepole pine stands in the
background. The disturbances depicted in Figure 24 would be very similar to the patch mosaic created by fire in
the past, with the fires in the past conversely influencing the vegetation patterns today.

Ecosystem process

Comment: 21. Over how many millennia have mixed and high severity fire been occurring without human
intervention?
Response: Fire is a primary natural disturbance in most forests of western North America and has shaped plant
and animal communities for millions of years (Noss et al. 2006). There have been three points in time when human
intervention came into forest vegetation communities that had a direct influence on occurrence of mixed- and highseverity fires.
•The first point in time is by Native Americans, who generally set fires in the spring and fall in lower-elevation
valleys and hunting or travel zones; it is difficult to partition out the contribution over time of Native Americans
(Baker 2002).
2

•The second point in time was noted in Heyerdahl et al. (2006), wherein surface fires (low-intensity fires) in the
southern Fleecer Mountain area (south and east of the project area, but on the Forest) were eliminated after 1855,
likely due to intensive livestock grazing that occurred until the early 1870s. It was during this same time that turnof-the-century logging began to influence forested vegetation on the Beaverhead-Deerlodge NF, with intensive
stand clearcut activities in the majority of forests around the main mines of Butte and smaller outlier mines around
the Forest to support area mining in the early 1900s.

Ecosystem process

•The third point in time is an aggressive fire suppression management policy by the Forest Service that was
implemented in the 1930s.
The question of how many millennia mixed- and high-severity fires have been occurring without human
intervention is not known. Likely fires have occurred naturally over 10 millennia, with only the recent 100 to 150
years seeing human intervention that may have had some effect on mixed-and high-severity fires. The two most
significant human interventions to the types of fires in question were logging of lodgepole pine forests for Butte
area mines in the early 1900s and fire suppression as an aggressive management policy of the Forest Service in

the 1930s.

Concern

Comment: 24. Why is logging that removes all/almost all trees considered regeneration (and not loss of existing
forest), when a stand-replacing fire is considered loss of the forest (and not regeneration)?
2

Response: In both cases, the loss of forested lands requires concern for reforestation. The NFMA (National Forest
Management Act) states that it is the policy of Congress that all forested lands in the National Forest System shall
be maintained in appropriate forest cover (emphasis added) with species of trees, degree of stocking, rate of
growth, and conditions of stands designed to secure the maximum benefits of multiple use sustained yield
management in accordance with land management plans. In both cases, logging and stand-replacing fires,
regeneration is evaluate per NFMA requirements.

Forest regeneration and stand
replacing fires

Comment: 25. How will the project improve watershed health?
2

Response: Activities for the action alternatives improve resiliency of forested vegetation to future disturbances
such as insects and fire(Vegetation section of chapter 3). Improving watershed health is not identified as part of the
purpose and need for this project; however, the analysis indicates that reductions in sediment should be
measurable in many places, benefiting watershed health from an aquatics perspective (Hydrology section of
chapter 3).

Watershed health

Comment: 1. It is not clear why an old growth inventory has not been done for the Project. Why isn’t the Vmap
methodology used?
6

Response: An old growth inventory was done for the Flint Foothills Project. A silviculturist identified the most likely
stands for old growth based on previous field reconnaissance, and then those stands were inventoried with an
Intensive stand exam. As noted in the DEIS (pg. 80) stand exams were conducted in 781 acres of Douglasfir/ponderosa pine stands and 529 acres of lodgepole pine stands. Out of the stands inventoried, 281 acres were
old growth. Vmap is satellite imagery, and does not provide the age of trees.

Old Growth: Inventory

Comment: 3. Why isn’t any of the lodgepole pine proposed for clearcutting considered as current or developing
old growth? In Appendix E, the age of these proposed clearcuts is not even provided.

6

6

Response: As mentioned previously, 529 acres of lodgepole pine stands had Intensive stand exams completed.
None of these stands were old growth; in general over half of the basal area within each stand inventoried is dead,
and the percentage of dead trees is higher with diameters over 5 inches. Lodgepole pine stands have too much
mortality to carry the number of live trees at the diameters necessary for old growth. As far as developing old
growth, FVS modeling done in a sample lodgepole pine stand indicated that in 50 years, unmanaged stands would
have smaller mean diameters than the stands that are managed (DEIS, pg. 101). In both instances, old growth can
be attained over time; however, within one old-growth attribute (diameters), managed stands have been shown
through modeling to attain larger diameters at adequate numbers quicker.
Comment: 4. The Forest Plan indicates that 17% of the Forest is old growth lodgepole pine. In the Clark ForkFlints landscape, there is an estimated 20.9% old growth. In the Project Area, there are at least 8.098 acre of midand late-seral lodgepole pine. How is it possible that no old growth lodgepole pine exists in any of the proposed

clearcuts in the Project Area?

Concern

Response: Please see the answer to the previous comment (letter 6 comment 3). Additionally, much of the
mortality occurring to lodgepole pine in the project area took place after the Forest Plan analysis.
Comment: 3. The DEIS needs to address all the science regarding the presumed lack of fire in the Project Area.
This claim is dearly outdated, as well as the supposed detrimental impact, that the forests have grown "too thick."
Yet the DEIS acknowledges that the lack of fire has benefited the goshawk and other old growth-associated
species (DEIS 229).

6

Response: When it comes to the “presumed lack of fire in the Project Area,” project-specific information, such as
District and Forest records and site-specific inventory would better provide the facts about whether fires have
occurred in the project area over what science would tell, because there are no specific scientific studies that have
occurred in the project area regarding fire. There has been a site-specific examination of fire scars to determine
mean fire intervals as well as when the last major fires occurred (DEIS pg. 78). Numerous current science has
been referenced in regard to effects of dense stand conditions (Gruell 1983; Covington and Moore 1994; Arno et
al. 1995; Arno and Keane 2000; Everett et al. 2000; Keane et al. 2002; Friederici 2003; Heyerdahl et al. 2006;
Kashian et al. 2006; Jenkins et al. 2007; Bentz 2008; Kaufmann et al. 2008; North et al. 2009; Mitchell et al. 2009;
Fiedler et al. 2010; Reinhardt and Holsinger 2010).

Roadless/Prescribed
Burning/Lynx

The reference by the commenter to the DEIS comment on page 229, quoting “…the lack of fire has benefited the
goshawk and other old growth-associated species” is not correct. The DEIS states, “Past wildfire suppression has
led to denser Douglas-fir stands that may have increased available goshawk nesting habitat.” This does not state
that there is a benefit; rather that more nesting habitat may be available. This does not take into account the other
habitat need for goshawk, foraging habitat. Additionally, there is no statement regarding “other old growthassociated species” on page 229 of the DEIS.
Additional information, including supporting science citations, has been added to the wildlife analysis portion of the
FEIS further describing the effects of fire suppression.
Comment: 11. The DEIS is misleading on the availability of larger snags. It is noted at 212 that these snags
average 2.9 per acre, which is incorrect. Appendix E shows that most of the lodgepole pine units were never
surveyed (69% of the acres identified for harvest!!!). Only 90 of 1163 acres are known to have at least 8 snags per
acre over 15 inches dbh.
6

Response: This number is representative of snag densities and was derived from the stand exams conducted in
the project area. All of the lodgepole pine units were surveyed (DEIS, pg. 101), although these ‘walk-through’
informal surveys did not measure snags. Formal stand exams were conducted in 529 acres of lodgepole pine
stands and 781 acres of Douglas-fir/ponderosa pine stands (DEIS, pg. 80); these surveys did measure snags. It is
true that most of the lodgepole pine units did not have exams conducted that measured snag diameters, although
40% of the lodgepole pine units did have stand exams that measured snags. It is also true that only 90 acres out of
the 1,163 acres of lodgepole pine units have at least 8 snags per acre over 15 inches dbh

Snags

6

Comment: 3. There appears to be a conflict between the Forest Plan FEIS and the Forest Plan. The Plan FEIS at
1057 states that the Forest Service will retain an average of 3.6-8 snags per acre over 15 inches dbh in warm and

Snags

132

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement – Volume 2 Appendices

Letter

Comments on the Flint Foothills DEIS and Forest Service Responses
cool forests “as an average for the total treatment acreage in the project area.” However, the Forest Plan does not
actually require any snags be left in any treatment units. As such, the FEIS is a misleading analysis of the Forest
Plan implementation.

Concern

Response: The Forest Plan states that the minimum average snags per acre to be retained, calculated for the
total treatment unit acreage in a project area, are as follows (Table 12, FP, pg. 48):
Warm-3.6
Cool-8
Cold-5
PICO (lodgepole)-6.4
This doesn’t appear to conflict with pg. 1,057 of the FEIS for the Forest Plan.
Additionally, the Forest Plan (pg. 48) does say that “if analysis shows the levels of snags will be met for the project
area as a whole” these per acre requirements do not apply. This also doesn’t appear to be in conflict with the FP
FEIS, as the sufficient analysis would have to show suitable levels of larger than 15-inch dbh snags across the
entire project area.
Additionally, the Forest Plan (pg. 48) states that “if, in the project area as a whole, there are insufficient live trees
and/or snags greater than 15 inches dbh, the standard is deemed complied with by retention of the existing live
trees and/or snags greater than 15.0” dbh in the treatment units.” This also doesn’t appear to be in conflict with the
FP FEIS; if you are retaining all of the 15-inch dbh trees you can, even if it falls below the minimum number, you
cannot leave more.
Comment: 20. As per the Forest Plan, is there any limit to the acreage of a given landscape that does not have to
contain snags?
6

6

Response: Snag retention requirements in the Forest Plan are limited to mechanical vegetation treatments
(standard 3 and standard 4, FP pg. 48). Acres outside of mechanical treatments would only have a snag analysis if
the project would be removing all snags below Forest Plan standards, and would thereby rely on the project area
as a whole to provide suitable snag numbers. This responder is not sure what is meant by “limit to the acreage of a
given landscape that does not contain snags.” If trees are not being removed by mechanical treatments, then the
landscape would carry the levels of snags that were naturally occurring there, regardless of the acres.
Comment: 12. If there are no trees over 15 inches dbh in lodgepole pine forests, then no snag management is
required. Why aren’t smaller snags required as well, since the agency clearly knew in developing the Forest Plan
that larger trees in lodgepole pine were very limited. Isn’t this Forest Plan direction a means of avoiding snag
management in lodgepole pine forest?

Snags

Snags

Response: The statement by the commenter that “no snag management is required” if there are no trees over 15
inches dbh is not correct. We cannot manage snags larger than 15 inches in diameter in a lodgepole pine forest, if
they do not already exist. To address this, Forest Plan standard 4 (pg. 48) requires live trees greater than 10
inches dbh to be retained to supply future snags. This is snag management, with the Forest Plan direction to

133

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement – Volume 2 Appendices

Letter

Comments on the Flint Foothills DEIS and Forest Service Responses
provide trees that would increase in diameter, providing future large snags. So no, the Forest Plan direction is not
a means of “avoiding snag management in lodgepole pine forest.”

Concern

Comment: 24. The DEIS claims that commercial thinning will benefit snag-associated species by creating larger
snags through future growth of remaining trees, and by killing large trees for snags. However, no science was cited
as the source of these claims. In addition to identifying how these conclusions were derived, we would like to know
what the time frame the expected increase in large snags will be.
Response: The DEIS states, “Commercial thinning treatments would decrease stand densities, thereby
accelerating future tree growth. This would also reduce the potential for tree mortality due to insects and disease,
wildfire, and growth suppression. While total snag numbers generated in a stand that has been thinned may be
less than in a stand that has not been thinned, snags in the thinned stand are more likely to be larger and therefore
more functional to a wider range of species (DEIS pg. 163).”

6

Hessburg et al. (2005) discuss stands in what they term “healthy” conditions (single-layered, fire-tolerant open
stands with elevated tree crown bases and variably spaced trees) that would have ongoing bark beetle mortality,
especially in tree clumps with higher stocking levels, and occasionally root disease mortality that contributed highquality large snags and down wood.

Snags

The DEIS does not speak to ‘killing large trees for snags’ with harvest activities. The DEIS does speak to burning
activities: “Prescribed burning treatments on 1,259 acres of mid-elevation conifers have the potential to increase
snag presence. Crown mortality in patches up to 20 acres in size would be the objective on about 40 percent of
treatment units. This equates to approximately 504 acres where suitable habitat for black-backed woodpecker
could be created or already exists due to advanced levels of tree mortality (DEIS pg. 184).” Saab et al. (2007)
observed increases in snag densities, including the large-diameter size class with the use of prescribed fire and
notes, “…maintenance and recruitment of larger-diameter snags is particularly important because large snags
have greater longevity and provide wildlife habitat for a longer period than smaller snags.”
The DEIS speaks to the time-frame for creating larger-diameter snags, “…a few overstory trees (less than 5
percent) may also be killed from the understory burning (DEIS pg. 102); and “…the direct effect of burning midelevation mixed-conifer (lodgepole dominated) stands would be killing overstory and understory conifers in a patch
mosaic across the proposed unit (DEIS pg. 103).” The timing for creation of snags would be immediately after the
prescribed burning activities have been completed.

6

Comment: 2. We agree with the Forest Plan that forest habitats that contain at least 8 snags per acre over15
inches dbh in lodgepole pine, and 3.6 per acre of 15 inches dbh in Douglas-fir, provide high quality habitat for the
large percentage of wildlife associated with snags (over 25% of forest song birds, plus other species). However.
Neither the Plan for the DEIS for this project defines how these snag sizes and densities will be maintained in
managed forest stands, in both clearcuts and commercial things, seeds cuts, etc. Please clarify how these snag
numbers will be maintained in the managed units with this project.

Snags

Response: The DEIS addresses the snags that will be retained calculated for the total treatment units (DEIS pp.
162-163). The snag numbers described in the DEIS will be maintained in the managed units with this projection
through retention of the snags through the mechanical treatments.

Concern

Comment: 10. As is noted in the DEIS, snags will fall over in1-15 years. In clearcuts, where will replacement
snags come from provided 8 per acre are retained?

6

6

6

Response: The fall rate for snags disclosed in the DEIS was specific to lodgepole pine killed by mountain pine
beetle (DEIS p. 99); fall rates for snags of other species is different. Replacement snags will come from the live
trees and dead trees retained in the total treatment unit acreage within the project area as a whole. ‘Replacement
snags’ as defined in the Forest Plan (FP pg. 49) are at different rates (on a per acre basis) then described by the
commenter. Forest Plan standard 4 supplies future snags in the project area with live trees greater than 10.0
inches dbh for the Cool Vegetation Category at 0.9 trees per acre, and for Warm Vegetation Category at 1.3 trees
per acre. Forest Plan standard 3 requires existing snags to be retained that are over 15 inches dbh for the same
vegetation categories as standard 4 for the total treatment unit acreage in the project area (3.6 per acre, Warm; 8.0
per acre, Cool). Analysis has shown that existing large-diameter (greater than 15 inches dbh) snags are not
available at the required standard 4 levels; standard 4 allows that existing live trees over 15 inches dbh can be
retained to meet the number requirement, which would then comply with the standard.

Snags

Comment: 6. The DEIS need to provide a clear description of how the Forest Plan snag standard will be applied to
this Project. Our interpretation of the Plan is that since no snag survey has been done for the project area that no
green trees or snags over 15 inches dbh can be cut in the Project. Is this correct?
Response: That is not correct. Snags were inventoried for a portion of the harvest units (DEIS p. 80). The Forest
Plan standard 3 will be met with the retention of existing snags over 15 inches dbh and live trees over 15 inches at
the numbers prescribed in the Forest Plan, as well as retaining all snags over 20 inches dbh. Retention of snags
and live trees over 15 inches dbh does not require a survey.
Comment: 1.The snag management program for the project is vague and contradictory in the DEIS. Please
provide the number and dbh of snags for each harvest units planned for both alternatives, so that the public can
understand what the snag management plan is.

Snags

Snags

Response: As has been discussed in the above answers to comments, the snag program is specific, and is not
contradictory, rather it is consistent. To address your comment, snag data was collected in 2013 and added to the
FEIS, and is discussed in the Vegetation section and the Wildlife section in Chapter 3.
Comment: 7. Please define what areas in the Project Area will meet the desired conditions in the Forest Plan.
Table 27 at 79 shows that there are only 116 acres known with tree over 15 inches dbh, in the 44,522 acres project
area.
6

Response: It is difficult to define what areas in the project area meet the desired conditions in the Forest Plan, as
there are many Goals in the Forest Plan (which is assumed to be similar to ‘desired conditions’), and the
commenter is not specific as to which ones should be addressed.

Snags

As far as snags meeting Forest Plan standards after harvest, both action alternatives for all acres treated would
meet standards, thereby meeting the direction within the Forest Plan and subsequently the goals of the Forest
Plan.

Comment: 17 Climate Change- We appreciate the DEIS discussion regarding climate change, forest carbon
cycling and storage, and climate change effects on vegetation and wildlife (pages 73, 104, 157). We encourage
such discussion in NEPA documents since it contributes to improved public understanding of the effects of climate
change on forest ecosystems and forest management, particularly the effects of hotter and drier conditions in
stressing trees, increasing the frequency of bark beetle outbreaks, and allowing bark beetles to move northward or
higher in elevation and into other ranges of their hosts or the ranges of new potential hosts. Climate change
research indicates that earth’s climate is changing, and that the changes will accelerate, and that human
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, primarily carbon dioxide emissions (CO2), are the main source of accelerated
climate change (United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) , http://www.ipcc.ch/ ).
Forest Service guidance on how to consider climate change in project-level NEPA documents can be found
at, http://www.fs.fed.us/emc/nepa/climate_change/includes/cc_nepa_guidance.pdf, and suggests EIS analysis and
disclosure of the following:

7

• The effect of a proposed project on climate change. (GHG emissions and carbon cycling). Examples include:
short-term GHG emissions and alteration to the carbon cycle caused by hazardous fuels reduction projects, and
avoiding large GHG emissions pulses and effects to the carbon cycle by thinning overstocked stands to increase
forest resilience and decrease the potential for large scale wildfire.
• The effect of climate change on a proposed project. Examples include: effects of expected shifts in rainfall
and temperature patterns on the seed stock selection for reforestation after timber harvest and effects of changed
stream hydrographs due to earlier snowmelts.

Climate Change

Climate change appears to be a factor influencing some bark beetle outbreaks. Temperature influences everything
in a bark beetle’s life, from the number of eggs laid by a single female beetle, to the beetles’ ability to disperse to
new host trees, to individuals’ over-winter survival and developmental timing. Elevated temperatures associated
with climate change, particularly when there are consecutive warm years, can speed up reproductive cycles and
reduce cold-induced mortality. Shifts in precipitation patterns and associated drought can also influence bark
beetle outbreak dynamics by weakening trees and making them more susceptible to bark beetle attacks,
(http://www.fs.fed.us/ccrc/topics/bark-beetles.shtml ). Climate change may increase stress to ponderosa pine
seedlings, and affect the ability of ponderosa pine and other species to prosper through time, and may have added
to stress factors leading or affecting the current bark beetle attacks.
We agree with the DEIS statement that despite the uncertainty of future climate conditions at local scales, the
majority of published science suggests that climate changes may strongly influence the frequency, intensity, and
size of disturbances (such as fire and extensive insect outbreaks) in coming decades on areas of the BDNF (page
73). Wildland fire frequency has increased in the west and altered fire regimes over the last twenty years due to
climate change. More frequent fires are currently burning for extended periods of time (average of 5 weeks)

Comments on the Flint Foothills DEIS and Forest Service Responses
compared to the infrequent fires lasting less than one week that were common prior to the mid-1980s. Large
wildfire activity increased in the 1980s, with higher large fire frequency, longer wildfire durations, and longer wildfire
seasons; with the greatest increases occurring in mid-elevation.

Concern

EPA Region 8 suggests a general four step approach to address climate change in NEPA documents that appears
consistent with the Forest Service guidance.
•Briefly discuss the link between greenhouse gases (GHGs) and climate change, and the potential impacts of
climate change, (see http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/ , http://www.fs.fed.us/ccrc/ , http://www.ipcc.ch/
•Describe the capacity of the proposed action to adapt to projected climate change effects, including consideration
of future needs.
•Characterize, quantify and disclose the expected annual cumulative emissions of GHGs attributable to the project,
using annual CO2-equivalent as a metric for comparing the different types of GHGs emitted. It is suggested that
the project's emissions be described in the context of total GHG emissions at regional, national and global scales
(over the lifetime of the project).
•Discuss potential means to mitigate project-related emissions as appropriate pursuant to CEQ regulations (40
CFR Sections 1502.14(f), 1502.16(h), 1508.14).
Response: The DEIS briefly describes the link between greenhouse gases and climate change, and the potential
impacts of climate change at page 104. The top three anthropogenic contributors to greenhouse gasses are fossilfuel combustion, deforestation, and agriculture (IPPC 2007, p. 36). This project falls into one of those categories,
because motorized equipment used during implementation of the proposed activities emit greenhouse gasses. The
amount of greenhouse gasses emitted by the project would be limited to the duration of the harvest activities,
which is typically 5 years. It is beyond the scope of this analysis to quantify how much annual cumulative
emissions of greenhouse gasses are attributable to the project during the 5-year period of project activities, let
alone regional, national and global scales for the lifetime of the project (Hapner v. Tidwell, No. 09-35896 (9th Cir.
2010)).
The ability for the project area to sequester carbon and that relation to climate change is the primary link for
activities associated with the proposal regarding impacts to climate change.
The long-term ability of forests to sequester carbon depends in part on their resilience to multiple stresses;
including increasing probability of drought stress, high severity fires, and large-scale insect outbreaks associated
with projected potential climate change (DEIS pg. 105). Management actions such as those proposed with this
project that maintains vigor and long-term productivity of forests, with resiliency to future disturbances of varying
scales, are the best option to maintain the capacity of the forest to sequester carbon in the long term (DEIS pg.
105).
Project design, such as the Flint Foothills Project, accounts for the most efficient approach to affect long-term
change to forested vegetation and account for future uncertainty with climate change. In addition, project design
accounts for the most efficient approach to minimize the amount of project-related emissions, through the use to
the maximum extent of existing road systems (minimizing new road construction and the associated heavy
equipment emissions) and larger unit size (maximizing efficiency for logging operations)

Comments on the Flint Foothills DEIS and Forest Service Responses

Concern

Comment: 19. EPA also supports protection of old growth habitats and maintenance or restoration of native, lateseral overstory trees and forest composition and structure within ranges of historic natural variability. Old growth
stands are ecologically diverse and provide good breeding and feeding habitat for many bird and animal species,
which have a preference or dependence on old growth (e.g., barred owl, great gray owl, pileated woodpecker).
Much old growth habitat has already been lost, and it is important to prevent continued loss of old growth habitat
and promote long-term sustainability of old growth stands, and restore where possible the geographic extent and
connectivity of old growth (e.g., using passive and active management-such as avoiding harvest of old growth
trees, leaving healthy larger and older seral species trees, thinning and underburning to reduce fuel loads and
ladder fuels in old growth while enhancing old growth characteristics). Often lands outside the forest boundary
have not been managed for the late-seral or old growth component, so National Forest lands may need to
contribute more to the late-seral component to compensate for the loss of this component on other land
ownerships within an ecoregion.
Table 28 (page 80) indicates that there are 281 acres of inventoried old growth in the project area (not reflecting
total old growth in the project area), with old growth present in units 6C, 23C, 25C, and 55C. No proposed salvage
by clearcut activities in old-growth or potential old-growth stands would occur (page 101), but commercial thinning
is proposed in 121 acres of old growth in Alternative 2. Commercial thinning in old growth is dropped in Alternative
3. Although the DEIS states that both action alternatives would retain all of the existing old-growth acres within the
project area (page S-11), but it would be multi-storied old growth with Alternative 3 and single-storied old growth
with Alternative 2.
7

Generally EPA does not object to treatments in old growth that are intended to protect old growth characteristics,
such as thinning of understory or under burning to reduce fuel loads and ladder fuels in old growth. Such
treatments may lessen the threat of stand removal by a wildfire and reduce competition with other vegetation to
promote more resilient, larger diameter trees. Careful prescribed burning in old growth stands can reduce fuel
loads and fire risk in such stands, and thus, may promote long-term protection and sustainability of old growth
stands. Although we have some concern that commercial thinning in old growth may result in removal of large old
trees likely to become future old growth. We encourage non-commercial thinning to minimize such effects.

Vegetation

Response: The objective of the treatment in old growth under alternative 2 in the Flint Foothills Project is to
reduce stand density by removing many of the understory trees, thereby promoting resiliency to the largerdiameter trees. Old growth characteristics would be retained, with the change in structure from multi-story to single
story noted by the commenter. Care in both mechanical removal and prescribed fire activities would be prudent to
retain not only individual old trees, but the stand characteristics that define old growth. This is also Forest Plan
direction (Standard 1, FP pg. 44). Younger large diameter trees as well as mid-sized (10 to 15 inch dbh) trees
would be retained not only as future old-growth trees, but to maintain the overall stand densities required to keep
the stand as old growth. These stands would not be comprised of only old trees in a post-harvest condition.
The DEIS discusses long-term (50-year) trends for old-growth and mature stands. Under the no-action alternative
(Alternative 1) in old growth, it is estimated (through FVS modeling) that existing old growth would fall out of old
growth status due to beetle-caused mortality to the large trees within the 50-year period (DEIS pg. 89). It is also
estimated that existing mature stands with 15-inch dominant trees would not attain old-growth characteristics in a
50-year period due to mortality from bark beetles (DEIS pg. 89). With the actions prescribed for alternative 2, it is
estimated that current old growth stands in 50 years would be retained as old growth, with an increase of the

138

Flint Foothills Vegetation Management Final Environmental Impact Statement – Volume 2 Appendices

Letter

Comments on the Flint Foothills DEIS and Forest Service Responses
ponderosa pine component (DEIS pg. 96). With both alternative 2 and 3, prescribed intermediate treatments in
stands not currently old growth would result in an increase in lower-elevation old growth (DEIS pg. 97).

Concern

The high stand densities combined with the fuel loading that would be created with precommercial removals – and
the risk to the old trees with burning fuel loads in a precommercial endeavor – warrant the more cautious
commercial removal approach as proposed.
Comment: Soils 12. The Table 68 soil risk ratings (pages 246-249) show high erosion risk ratings for a number of
treatment units, although no high risks are shown for rutting, compaction, or mass movements. We generally
recommend avoidance of tractor timber harvest and road construction in areas with high risk of erosion potential.

Table 71 (pages 257-259 ) showing detrimental soil disturbance by harvest unit for Alternative 2 identifies units
32ST, 40S, 41S right at the 15 percent Regional standard for detrimental soil disturbance, and unit 56C is at 14.1
percent detrimental soil disturbance. It is stated (page 259) that subsoiling would occur on units 32ST, 40S, 41S to
ensure compliance with the soil quality standards [32ST (18.6% DSD), 40S (16.7 percent DSD), and 41S (20.7
percent DSD)]. Subsoiling is also proposed on unit 23C in Alternative 3. It is our understanding that subsoiling is
similar to tilling, but we did not see a description of subsoiling in the DEIS. It would be helpful to describe
subsoiling, since it appears that this measure will be needed on units 32ST, 40S, 41S and perhaps 56C to avoid
exceedance of Regional soil quality standards.

Soils

Response: Avoidance of tractor timber harvest and road construction in areas with high risk of erosion potential
will occur. Slope gradient is a driving factor in separating high from moderate class ratings. While high erosion
potential soils are present within the Flint Foothills Project area and some of the harvest units, slopes greater than
35 percent are not included within the tractor harvest units.
A description of subsoiling has been added to the FEIS. Subsoiling is similar to tilling in that both are designed to
fracture the compacted layer of soil. As the subsoiler shanks move through the soil, the compacted layer is lifted
slightly and fractures allowing for root penetration, improved moisture infiltration and retention, and increased air
spaces. Subsoiling differs from tilling in that the fracturing of the compacted layer occurs without turning over the
soil layers minimizing soil mixing and surface layer disturbance.

Comment: 13. We appreciate the many project design features and mitigation measures proposed to protect soils
(e.g., limiting ground-based yarding to slopes below 35 percent and using cable logging on steeper slopes;
harvesting on only dry or frozen soils; 75-100 feet distances between skid trails and placing slash on skid trails;
scarifying compacted soils prior to seeding on landings, etc.). We are particularly pleased that coarse woody debris
would be retained in harvest units to maintain long-term soil productivity and wildlife habitat (i.e., 7-12 tons per acre
of coarse woody debris over 3 inches in diameter). It is important that adequate amounts of woody debris be
retained on-site following vegetative treatments to maintain soil productivity.

Soils

We fully support such practices. We often suggest mitigation measures such as use of existing skid trails wherever
possible; restrictions on skidding with tracked machinery in sensitive areas; using slash mats to protect soils;
constructing water bars; creating brush sediment traps; adding slash to skid trail surfaces after recontouring and
ripping; seeding/planting of forbs, grasses or shrubs to reduce soil erosion and hasten recovery; as well as
recontouring, slashing and seeding of temporary roads and log landing areas following use to reduce erosion and

Response: Thank you for supporting the design features and mitigation measures proposed. Sensitive areas are
covered by the design feature which states, “Timber operations and harvest units would avoid wet areas. The
Forest soil scientist, hydrologist, and fisheries biologist would work with the project implementation team to protect
these areas (SWCP 13.03).” Therefore, use of slash mats and restrictions on skidding with tracked machinery
should not be necessary. There are design features and mitigation measures included which address reducing
erosion and hastening recovery including adequately draining skid trails, placing slash on skid trails, revegetating
with native seed, recontoured or obliterated constructed skid trails and roads, temporary roads, and landings.
The design features and mitigation measures for Hydrology and Aquatic Resources address sedimentation issues
including water bars for temporary roads and the use of sediment traps.

Literature Review
Dead Trees Opposing View #6 - “Dead and down woody materials have long been viewed by foresters as unsalvaged
mortality, the utilization of which is an important objective of good timber management. This material is also viewed as a fire
hazard, and steps are frequently taken to reduce the amount of flashy fuels from timber harvest areas. Woody materials are
also recognized as home for small vertebrate animals that are considered "pests" which impede reforestation.

Assigned

These are all valid considerations, but dead and down woody material in various stages of decay serves many important
functions, one of which is habitat for wildlife. Instead of viewing logs left in a forest as unsalvaged mortality or a fire hazard, this
chapter examines their role as wildlife habitat. Elton (1966, p. 279) put it this way:
When one walks through the rather dull and tidy woodlands--say in the managed portions of the New Forest in Hampshire
[England]-that result from modern forestry practices, it is difficult to believe that dying and dead wood provides one of the two or
three greatest resources for animal species in a natural forest, and that if fallen timber and slightly decayed trees are removed
the whole system is gravely impoverished of perhaps more than a fifth of its fauna.”

used by wildlife for a variety of purposes — nesting and raising young, denning, roosting, resting, feeding, caching food,
escaping predators and hibernating.”
“The majority of wildlife species that use cavities cannot excavate their own holes and rely on those created by primary cavity
users or on holes that form naturally. This group is called secondary cavity users. The kestrel, some owls such as the saw-whet
and barred owls, ducks such as the common goldeneye and wood duck, and songbirds like the eastern bluebird, great-crested
flycatcher and white-breasted nuthatch are all secondary cavity users. Many mammals are in this category too. These include
deer mice, red squirrels, grey squirrels, flying squirrels, weasels, martens, fishers, raccoons, porcupines and black bears.”

Dead Trees Opposing View #9 - “Birds are the most obvious benefactors of dead trees. They use snags, limbs, and logs for
perching, foraging, and nesting. In some forests, 30 to 45 percent of the bird species are cavity nesters. In North America alone,
55 avian species nest in cavities. Cavity-nesting birds are classified as primary excavators (who can excavate hard wood), weak
excavators (who can excavate soft, dead wood), or secondary cavity-users (who can utilize existing cavities). In Ohio, eastern
bluebirds, American kestrels, and wood ducks are examples of species that rely on cavities in dead wood for successful
reproduction. Other birds, such as ruffed grouse, will use logs for drumming and courtship displays.
However, birds are not the only creatures that benefit from dead wood. Mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and invertebrates seek
refuge in natural cavities and dens. For example, salamanders rely on the security and dampness of soil found beneath a rotting
log. Small mammals find cover and relief from the hot midday sun in dead limbs and downed wood, while spiders, beetles,
worms, and microbes move and feed within the decaying matter. Additionally, fungi and mushrooms flourish on and around
logs, breaking down the organic matter to release important nutrients back into the forest ecosystem.

Doug Middlebrook

Logs provide other important ecological functions as well. Decaying logs retain moisture and nutrients that aid in new plant
growth. Young trees may sprout from a single downed limb known as a nurse log. The soft wood tissue of a nurse log offers an
ideal substrate for many young trees during their initial growth and development. Logs also store energy and fix nitrogen.
Furthermore, dead wood serves as a ground cover, lessening soil erosion and preventing animals such as deer from overbrowsing plant seedlings.”

tragic loss of a valuable resource. But on further inspection it becomes clear that a dead tree is simply a part of nature. And as a
part of nature it serves an important purpose that isn't always obvious to us.
Dead trees and dead parts of trees are critically important to birds and mammals for nesting, rearing of young, feeding and as
shelter. With a little forethought and tolerance we can maintain our organized, structured lifestyle and at the same time provide
wildlife the habitat it needs to survive. In the long run, we'll be the better for it.”

reduction of stream habitat diversity. However, the existing literature indicates one of the most insidious effects of logging is the
elevation of sediment loads and increased sedimentation within the drainage basin.

scientific research has consistently shown the adverse effects of roads on hydrologic processes and fish and wildlife
populations.
“One of the key things to recognize is the effects of the roads extend far beyond their immediate footprint,” Noon said. For
example, “in terms of hydrology, the roads are leading to faster runoff of water, often with great increases in sedimentation,
particularly following storm events, and roads in watersheds often lead to increases in the intensity of floods.” “

Jim Brammer

These changes degrade fish habitat because of the increased sedimentation that leads to decreases in water quality, Noon
said. And roads fragment wildlife habitat and create areas that animals avoid, often as result of increased hunting, he said.”

and other diseases. In fact the crisis in the national forests is habitat destruction caused by too much clearcutting.
My long-term studies of forest diseases in Idaho show the loss by disease and insect activity in all age classes of forests to be
less than or slightly more than 1 percent per year over the past thirty-eight years. These findings are consistent with Forest
Service national level data.
Forests are structured systems of many life forms interacting in intricate ways and disturbances are essential to their
functioning. It’s not fire disease fungi bacteria and insects that are threatening the well being of forests. Disease, fire, windthrow,
and other disturbances are a natural part of the forest ecosystem and assist in dynamic processes such as succession that are
essential to long term ecosystem maintenance. The real threat facing forests are excessive logging, clearcutting and
roadbuilding that homogenize and destroy soil, watersheds and biodiversity of native forests.”

Dead Trees Opposing View #5 - “The forest floor is a living, breathing factory of life and death. The out-reaching roots of a
great tree search out from that chemical stew we call soil not only moisture but those elements it needs while its solar panels, or
leaves, exchange carbon dioxide and oxygen.
Years later, when this aged giant completes its cycle and falls, crashing to earth, those very organisms and creatures which
sustained it in life will gradually disassemble its biomass, returning to the soil those molecules which the next generation of
seedlings, already sprouting, require for sustenance.”

Rob Gump

“Forest biologists such as Herbert Kronzucker, Ph.D., point out that dead and dying trees sustain the coming generations, are
not a hazard, and are essential to the health of the forest.” Alaskan fire management official John LeClair has noted that dead
trees left standing, rather than increasing the hazard of fires, burned more slowly, retarding the conflagration in contrast to the

Dead Trees Opposing View #3 - “When many of us think of a healthy forest, we think of tall, green trees. It’s hard to imagine
how a tree killed by mountain pine beetle could be good for a forest. However, to be truly healthy and support all the wildlife that
depends on it, there must be a variety of young, old and dead trees in a forest ecosystem. At “endemic” or normal levels,
mountain pine beetles help maintain this diversity by colonizing and killing old or damaged trees, therefore kick-starting the
invaluable process of decomposition. Decomposing wood returns nutrients to the system while providing shelter and food for
many plants and animals. Standing dead trees host a diversity of organisms that would not be present without them.”

Timber Harvest Opposing View #57 - “Once clear-cutting has occurred, regulation and human silvicultural practices become
responsible for the revegetation that follows. The creation of new forest succession patterns are the result of human control over
the growing environment. Rather than proceeding at a natural pace, humans attempt to speed up the forest succession process
to quickly return to a situation where harvesting is again possible. Reforestation of the disturbed area after clear-cutting also
emphasizes maintaining control over the distribution and quality of forest species.
Simplification is a state that results from the forest being harvested before it reaches maturity. Logging simplifies forest
ecosystems (Dudley et al. 1995) by narrowing the age range of the stand and suppressing diversification through repeated
harvesting, burning to remove slash, and replanting with hybrid seedlings. Simplification affects the health and productivity of
the forest because simplified forests lack the variety found in older stands, including species diversity, vertical structure, and
microhabitat. From an ecological standpoint, a simplified forest of a particular age has less overall bio-mass per acre than a
natural forest of the same age, but a simplified forest produces a higher volume of merchantable timber.
Review: Not Relevant to the Project
This study is a Master’s Thesis studying the effects of harvest from 1905-1996 in a coastal river system in western Washington.
The lack of relevance is due to the difference in the dramatically divergent forest ecosystem that is studied with the reference
from the proposed project. This will not be considered in the analysis.

Timber Harvest Opposing View #32 - “Fear of wildfire is heavily used to sell these forest “restoration” schemes. Logging has
not been proven, in practice, to reduce fire frequency or intensity. Historically, the largest, most destructive blazes, like the
Tillamook conflagration, were caused from logging or fueled by slash. Unlogged forests, cool and shaded, are typically more fire
resistant than cut over, dried-up stands choked with slash and weeds.
Large-scale logging (by any name) has devalued our forests, degraded our waters, damaged soils, and endangered a wide
variety of plants and animals. How will the current round of politically and environmentally propelled ‘restorative’ logging
proposals differ, in practice, from past logging regimes?”

This is an opinion piece in a newspaper by an individual who is a real estate broker and private timberland restoration specialist
in western Oregon. It contains no sources, references, or literature cited and is not scientific, peer-reviewed literature. The
opinion piece centers on Oregon forests, not southwest Montana. Additionally, this project’s purpose and need and proposed
actions do not include ‘restoration’ actions.

Timber Harvest Opposing View #40 - "Logging removes a mass that harbor a myriad of organisms, from bacteria and
actinomycetes to higher fungi. The smaller organisms, not visible to the unaided eye, are still important components of the
system."
Review: Relevant to the Project
This paper presents literature (as of 1984) regarding the importance of coarse woody debris to soil biota along with other
resources. The full text of the abridged citation quoted above is as follows and is found on page 16 of the reference: “Fallen
trees harbor a myriad of organisms, from bacteria and actinomycetes to higher fungi. Of these, only some of the fungi might be
noticed by the casual observer as mushrooms or bracket fungi (fig. 16). These structures, however, are merely the fruiting
bodies produced by mold colonies within the log. Many fungi fruit within the fallen tree, so they are seen only when the tree is
torn apart (fig. 17). Even when a fallen tree is torn apart, only a fraction of the fungi present are noticed because the fruiting
bodies of most appear only for a small portion of the year. The smaller organisms, not visible to the unaided eye, are still
important components of the system.”
Removing fallen trees is not part of the proposed action of this project as found in Chapter 1 of the DEIS. Coarse woody debris
recruitment is provided for by the regional soil quality standards and is a project design feature mitigation measure for both
action alternatives.

Timber Harvest Opposing View #74 - “CONCLUSIONS
In our overview of the impacts of forest management activities on soil erosion and productivity, we show that erosion alone is
seldom the cause of greatly reduced site productivity. However, erosion, in combination with other site factors, works to degrade
productivity on the scale of decades and centuries. Extreme disturbances, such as wildfire or tractor logging, cause the loss of
nutrients, mycorrhizae, and organic matter. These combined losses reduce long-term site productivity and may lead to
sustained periods of extended erosion that could exacerbate degradation.
Managers should be concerned with harvesting impacts, site preparation disturbances, amount of tree that is removed, and the
accumulation of fuel from fire suppression. On erosion-sensitive sites, we need to carefully evaluate such management factors.”

Review: Relevant to the Project
This paper summarizes some of the research (through the ‘90s) on the effects of management practices on forest soil
productivity. The authors recognize that “relationships between disturbance and productivity are not simple but rather are
extraordinarily complex, reflecting interactions among disturbance levels, soil water-holding capacities, nutrient cycling
properties, and climate. Therefore, the effect of a given disturbance is highly dependent on site-specific soil properties and
microclimate and may also be influenced year to year variation in climate.”
Region 1 Soil Quality Standards (SQS) require that new activities do not create detrimental soil conditions on more than 15
percent of an activity area following project implementation and restoration activities (USDA Forest Service, 1999). Restoration

is defined as treatments that restore vital soil functions to their inherent range of variability. Restoration treatments could
include, but are not limited to, tillage, ripping, subsoiling, seeding, mulching, recontouring of temporary roads, and water barring.
Activity areas are defined as the proposed harvest units, including landings, skid trails, and temporary road construction, and
any proposed prescribed burning units. As defined by the Region 1 SQS, detrimental soil disturbance includes the effects of
compaction, displacement, rutting, severe burning, surface erosion, loss of surface organic matter, and soil mass movement.

The Disturbed WEPP model (Elliot and Hall 2010) was run to generate predicted erosion rates for the existing condition and
following implementation of the proposed harvest for both action alternatives. Eighty-five percent ground cover was assumed for
harvest units to reflect no more than 15% DSD in each unit modeled. (Ground cover is likely disturbed or removed if the soil is
detrimentally disturbed.) Probability of erosion and estimated erosion rates as a result of Alternative 2 and 3 implementation
were modeled using Disturbed WEPP. The probability of erosion increases in one unit, 73S, from 0% to 2% in both Alternative 2
and 3 compared to the no action alternative. However, model results for both Alternative 2 and 3 indicate an average annual
erosion rate of 0 tons/ac/yr for each modeled harvest unit.
Based on the WEPP modeling, SQS for surface erosion would continue to be met in all units under the proposed action for
Alternative 2 and Alternative 3. Additionally, the WEPP results do not take into account SWCPs listed above in the Mitigation
measure section; in particular, providing drainage control and slash placement on skid trails. These SWCPs will ameliorate
disturbance associated with harvest, reduce erosion potential, and hasten soil recovery.
