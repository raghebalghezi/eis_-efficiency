UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR – NATIONAL PARK SERVICE
FINAL DYKE MARSH WETLAND RESTORATION AND LONG-TERM MANAGEMENT PLAN /
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT, DYKE MARSH WILDLIFE PRESERVE, VIRGINIA

Lead Agency: National Park Service (NPS), U.S. Department of the Interior
This Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and Long-Term Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement (plan/EIS)
describes three alternatives for the restoration and management of the Dyke Marsh Wildlife Preserve (Dyke Marsh) at George
Washington Memorial Parkway, as well as the environment that would be affected by the alternatives and the environmental
consequences of implementing these alternatives.
The purpose of this plan is to develop and implement actions for restoration and long-term management of the tidal freshwater
marsh and other associated wetland habitats that have been lost or impacted in Dyke Marsh. Dyke Marsh wetland resources,
plant and animal communities, and natural ecosystem functions have been damaged by previous human uses and continued
erosion, are subject to continuing threats, such as alterations to the hydrology in the Potomac River and in nearby tributaries,
and other effects from urbanization in the surrounding region. In addition, the NPS is required to restore Dyke Marsh under
Public Law (P.L.) 93-251 and Water Resources Development Act of 2007. A restoration and management plan is needed at
this time to protect the existing wetlands from erosion, nonnative invasive plants, loss of habitat, and altered hydrologic
regimes; restore wetlands and ecosystem functions and processes lost through sand and gravel mining and shoreline erosion;
avoid increased costs from delayed restoration; and improve ecosystem services that benefit the Potomac River watershed and
the Chesapeake Bay.
Under alternative A: no action, there would be no restoration. Current management of the marsh would continue and the
destabilized marsh would continue to erode at an accelerated rate.
Under alternative B: Hydrologic Restoration and Minimal Wetland Restoration, the focus is on the most essential actions that
would reestablish hydrologic conditions that shield the marsh from erosive currents and protect the Hog Island Gut channel
and channel wall. A breakwater structure would be constructed on the south end of the marsh, in alignment with the
northernmost extent of the historic promontory. Wetlands would be restored to wherever the water is less than 4 feet deep.
This alternative would create approximately 70 acres of various new wetland habitats.
Under alternative C: Hydrologic Restoration and Fullest Possible Extent of Wetland Restoration (Preferred Alternative), up to
180 acres of various wetland habitats would be restored in a phased approach. The initial phase would stabilize the marsh by
installing a breakwater on the southern edge of the historic promontory and restoring marsh in the outline of the historic
promontory and along the edge of existing marsh to wherever the water is less than 4 feet deep (approximately 40 acres).
Future phases would continue marsh restoration within the historic boundaries of the marsh, except for the area immediately
adjacent to the marina.
Alternatives B and C both include fill of deep channels near the breakwater, and reestablishment of hydrologic connections to
the approximately 30 acres on the inland side of the Haul Road to restore bottomland swamp forest areas.
The potential environmental consequences of the alternatives are analyzed for hydrology and sediment transport, soils and
sediments, surface water quality, floodplains, vegetation and wetlands, fish and wildlife, species of special concern,
archeological resources, historic structures and districts and cultural landscapes, visitor use and experience, adjacent property
owners and the marina, and park management and operations.
The draft plan/EIS was available for public and agency review and comment for 60 days after publication of the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency’s (USEPA) Notice of Availability in the Federal Register, from January 15, 2014, to March
18, 2014. Copies of the plan/EIS or links to download it on the NPS Planning, Environment, and Public Comment (PEPC)
website, were sent to individuals, agencies, organizations, libraries, and local businesses. This final plan/EIS provides
responses to substantive stakeholder and public comments, incorporates those comments and suggested revisions where
necessary, and provides copies of relevant agency and organization letters. Once this document is released and a Notice of
Availability is published by the USEPA, a 30-day no-action period will follow. Following the 30-day period, the alternative or
actions constituting the approved plan will be documented in a record of decision that will be signed by the Regional Director
of the National Capital Region. For further information regarding this document, please contact:

Final Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration
and Long-term Management Plan /
Environmental Impact Statement

October 2014

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and Long-term Management Plan / Environmental Impact
Statement (plan/EIS) has been prepared to assist the National Park Service (NPS) in developing and
evaluating alternatives for wetland restoration and management for the Dyke Marsh Wildlife Preserve
(Dyke Marsh). This document has been prepared in accordance with the National Environmental Policy
Act of 1969 (NEPA), the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations implementing NEPA (40
CFR 1500–1508) and the NPS Director’s Order 12: Conservation Planning, Environmental Impact
Analysis, and Decision-Making, and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as
amended.
This final plan/EIS evaluates alternatives for wetland restoration of Dyke Marsh at the George
Washington Memorial Parkway. The plan/EIS assesses the impacts that could result from continuing
current management (the no-action alternative) or implementing one of the two action alternatives.
Upon conclusion of the decision-making process, the preferred alternative, with its various restoration
components, will provide a strategy for long-term monitoring management, and restoration of the Dyke
marsh.

BACKGROUND
Dyke Marsh is one of the largest remaining tidal freshwater wetlands in the Washington, D.C.,
metropolitan area. Based on sediment core samples taken within the marsh by the U.S. Geological Survey
(USGS) in 2012, it is estimated that the southern marsh is approximately 2000 years old and the northern
marsh is 500 years old (Litwin et al. 2013; Litwin et al. 2011). The alluvial deposits beneath the marsh are
approximately 50 feet thick, and are composed of defined layers of silt and clay interspersed in layers of
sand and gravel. According to historic documents, the original extent of the property covered
approximately 650 acres; the main part of the marsh north of the promontory covered approximately 184
acres in 1937, plus 16 acres south of the promontory, and an additional 15 to 20 acres west of the
parkway. The current extent of the marsh is about 60 acres, plus the 15 to 20 acres west of the parkway
(Litwin et al. 2011). Dyke Marsh includes tidal freshwater marsh, floodplain forest, and swamp forest
habitats with a diverse array of plants and animals.
The first manipulations of Dyke Marsh took place in the early 1800s when colonial landowners tried to
convert the marsh area first into a place for ships to tie up and then into pasturelands for grazing (NPS
2009a). In an attempt to create a wet meadow, dikes were constructed around the marsh to keep the tidal
influx of water out of the marsh. However, the dikes were difficult to maintain and the land was later
abandoned. Shortly after, portions of the dikes failed and the inflow of tidal water formed channels
through the meadow, and the tidal freshwater marsh was reestablished (NPS 1977).
The marsh was later indirectly affected when Congress resolved to build a memorial parkway for the
celebration of the 200th anniversary of George Washington’s birthdate. Congress appropriated funds for
the project in 1922 and in 1924 established the United States Commission for the Celebration of the Two
Hundredth Anniversary of the Birth of George Washington. Construction of the Mount Vernon Memorial
Highway, a portion of which would cross a small section of the marsh along the right-of-way of the
former Washington, Alexandria, and Mount Vernon Railway, was authorized in 1928. When the George
Washington Memorial Parkway was authorized in 1930, additional property was soon purchased in Dyke
Marsh (and elsewhere) to establish larger land holdings to ensure the aesthetic value of the Parkway.
Approximately 225 acres of the northern portion of the marsh was acquired during this time period. (NPS
1977, 1996).

In the early 1930s, Smoot Sand and Gravel Corporation (SSGC) acquired 650 acres of land along the
Potomac River from Bucknell University. This parcel included the southern 260 acres of Dyke Marsh
adjacent to the lands belonging to the United States. By 1940, SSGC had dredged a large portion of the
open water areas and destroyed a great deal of marshland (NPS 1977). Between 1940 and 1972,
approximately 270 acres of the original marsh were mined for sand and gravel by SSGC, including the
swamp forest wetlands of the promontory south of Hog Island Gut.
In the late 1950s, the government, local citizens, and various conservation groups in and around
Washington, D.C., including the Audubon Society, the Garden Club of America, and the Wildlife
Federation, began expressing concern that the marsh was degrading due to SSGC mining activities. On
February 8, 1959, Irston Barnes, the president of the Audubon Society of the District of Columbia,
published an article in the Washington Post describing the value of preserving Dyke Marsh. In response
to this article and the mounting public interest, in April 1959, Representative Frank Smith of Mississippi
drafted bill HR 2228, which authorized the Secretary of the Interior to acquire the southern 260 acres of
Dyke Marsh from SSGC for the NPS. The bill, which was intended as a tool for preservation, described
Dyke Marsh as “an area of irreplaceable wetlands near the Nation’s Capital which is valuable for the
production and preservation of wildlife” (Cong. Rec. 86 [first sess.] [1959]). Acreage is stated according
to historic records.
Congress passed Public Law (P.L.) 86-41 granting the U.S. government a legislative mandate for
management of the marsh (UMCES 2004) on June 11, 1959. The passage of this legislation ensured that a
substantial portion of the wetland would remain intact, but allowed SSGC to continue to dredge in some
areas of the marsh. As a result, mining continued in certain portions of the marsh until 1972, when SSGC
relinquished its dredging rights.
In May 1959, the Committee on Public Works submitted a report to accompany bill HR 2228, stating that
it was in the interest of the government to own this strip of land along the Potomac River because it
would help preserve the aesthetic qualities of the memorial parkway (S. Rep. 86-280 [1959]). A deed
completing the exchange and conveying title to the land from SSGC to the United States was executed on
May 31, 1960.
Once the property had passed into NPS ownership, the NPS started activities to fill the deep holes created
by the dredging. NPS continued to fill dredged areas in Dyke Marsh into the early 1970s. However, in
1972, Superintendent David Richie wrote a letter to the Director of National Capital Parks that
emphasized the significant weaknesses in the overall planning for Dyke Marsh rehabilitation. The NPS
realized that there was no effective and scientifically sound management plan, and that placing fill
materials to restore the marsh should be more thoroughly analyzed. The letter also requested the
professional support of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). As a result, the filling of the
dredged areas was halted. In response to the situation, PL 93-251 was enacted on March 7, 1974, at the
93rd session of Congress, authorizing the USACE to assist the NPS in planning, designing, and
implementing the restoration and expansion of Dyke Marsh (NPS 1977).
As stated in PL 86-41, SSGC had dredging rights in Dyke Marsh until 1979; however, by 1972 the sand
and gravel deposits in the marsh had been exhausted, making dredging operations unprofitable. As a
result, in 1975 SSGC relinquished their mining rights and granted the NPS permission to begin restoring
the last areas of Dyke Marsh. At this time, a little more than half of the original marsh was still intact and
the remainder of the acreage under NPS management was dredged open water.
Although impacts on the marsh from dredging activities have caused the most easily recognizable
changes to the marsh, several other changes have resulted from past activities in and near the marsh. The
outfall of Hunting Creek and Cameron Run into the Potomac River has been altered by the development
of the George Washington Memorial Parkway, urbanization within the watershed, the development of a
golf course along the creek and parkway, and upstream channelization. The sediment load from Hunting
Creek, which was once carried toward the marsh and helped maintain a depositional environment, is now

ii

George Washington Memorial Parkway

deposited mostly north of the marsh at the creek’s confluence with the Potomac River, where mudflats
and emergent wetlands are beginning to develop. These changes have greatly reduced the amount of
sediment and nutrients supplied to the marsh by Hunting Creek (NPS 1977; UMCES 2004). More recent
disturbances rebuilding the Woodrow Wilson Bridge and several associated interchanges at Hunting
Creek could further alter the hydrology in the creek and result in additional impacts on the marsh
downstream.

PURPOSE AND NEED FOR ACTION
The purpose of this plan is to develop and implement actions for restoration and long-term management
of the tidal freshwater marsh and other associated wetland habitats that have been lost or impacted in the
Dyke Marsh.
Dyke Marsh wetland resources, plant and animal communities, and natural ecosystem functions have
been damaged by previous human uses and continued erosion, and are subject to continuing threats, such
as alterations to the hydrology in the Potomac River and in nearby tributaries, and other effects from
urbanization in the surrounding region. In addition, the NPS is required to restore Dyke Marsh, under P.L.
93-251, and WRDA 2007. Therefore, a restoration and long-term management plan is needed at this time
to


Protect the existing wetlands from erosion, nonnative invasive plants, loss of habitat, and altered
hydrologic regimes;



Restore wetlands and ecosystem functions and processes lost through sand and gravel mining and
shoreline erosion;



Avoid increased costs (delayed restoration will result in increased restoration costs); and



Improve ecosystem services that benefit the Potomac River Watershed and the Chesapeake Bay.

OBJECTIVES IN TAKING ACTION
Objectives are “what must be achieved to a large degree for the action to be considered a success” (NPS
2001). All action alternatives selected for detailed analysis must meet project objectives to a large degree
and resolve the purpose of and need for action. Objectives are grounded in the enabling legislation,
purpose, and mission goals of the George Washington Memorial Parkway, and should be compatible with
direction and guidance provided by the 2005 George Washington Memorial Parkway Long-range
Interpretive Plan (NPS 2005b). The following are specific objectives for this plan/EIS.
NATURAL RESOURCES



Restore, protect, and maintain tidal freshwater wetlands and associated ecosystems to provide
habitat for fish, wildlife, and other biota.



Ensure that management actions promote native species while minimizing the intrusion of
nonnative invasive plants.



Reduce erosion of the existing marsh and provide for erosion control measures in areas of
restored marsh.



To the extent practicable, restore and maintain hydrologic processes needed to sustain Dyke
Marsh.



Protect populations of state rare species such as swamp sparrow (Melospiza georgiana) and river
bulrush (Bolboschoenus fluviatilis).



Increase the resilience of Dyke Marsh and provide a natural buffer to storms and flood control in
populated residential areas.

CULTURAL RESOURCES



Protect the historic resources and cultural landscape features associated with Dyke Marsh and the
George Washington Memorial Parkway.

VISITOR EXPERIENCE



Enhance appropriate educational, interpretation, and research opportunities at Dyke Marsh and
enhance accessibility for diverse audiences.

ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED
The alternatives under consideration include a required “no-action” alternative and two action alternatives
that were developed by an interdisciplinary planning team and through feedback from the public and
scientific community during the planning process. The two action alternatives would meet, to a large
degree, the objectives for this plan and also the purpose of and need for action. The alternatives are
described below. For both action alternatives, work would be phased so that the initial restoration would
provide the most benefits and protection, and would allow future stages to build upon the initial benefits.
Generally, construction of the breakwater and possibly the deep channel fill would take place first, to
protect the marsh restoration area and Hog Island Gut. This would be followed by protection of the
weakening outer walls of Hog Island Gut, particularly where there is danger of breaching.
Alternative A: No Action—Under this alternative, there would be no restoration. Current management
of the marsh would continue, which includes providing basic maintenance related to the Haul Road,
control of nonnative invasive plant species, ongoing interpretive and environmental education activities,
scientific research projects, boundary marking, and enforcement of existing regulations. There would be
no manipulation of the marsh other than emergency, safety-related, or limited improvements or
maintenance actions. The destabilized marsh would continue to erode at an accelerated rate (Litwin et al.
2011).
Alternative B: Hydrologic Restoration and Minimal Wetland Restoration—Under alternative B, the
focus is on the most essential actions that would reestablish hydrologic conditions that shield the marsh
from erosive currents and protect the Hog Island Gut channel and channel wall. A breakwater structure
would be constructed on the south end of the marsh, in alignment with the northernmost extent of the
historic promontory, close to the historic edge of hog island gut, and wetlands would be restored to
wherever the water is less than 4 feet deep. This alternative also includes fill of some deep channel near
the breakwater. The final element of this alternative is the reestablishment of hydrologic connections to
the inland side of the Haul Road to restore bottomland swamp forest areas that were cut off when the
Haul Road was constructed. Approximately 30 acres west of the Haul Road could be influenced by tidal
flows as a result. These actions would not necessarily happen in any particular order, and may be dictated
by available funds. However, it is assumed that the breakwater would be constructed first. This alternative
would create approximately 70 acres of various new wetland habitats and allow the continued natural
accretion of soils and establishment of wetlands given the new hydrologic conditions.
Alternative C: Hydrologic Restoration and Fullest Possible Extent of Wetland Restoration
(Preferred Alternative)—Under alternative C, the marsh would be restored in a phased approach up to

iv

George Washington Memorial Parkway

the historic boundary of the marsh and other adjacent areas within NPS jurisdictional boundaries, except
for the area immediately adjacent to the marina. The initial phase would install a breakwater, establish
marsh in the outline of the historic promontory, fill the deep channels within the park, and restore marsh
along the edge of existing marsh to wherever the water is less than 4 feet deep (approximately 40 acres) to
stabilize the marsh and protect Hog Island Gut. Future phases would continue marsh restoration until a
sustainable marsh is achieved and meets the overall goals of the project, and breaks would be installed to
reintroduce tidal flows west of the Haul Road. The historic boundaries lie between the historic
promontory and Dyke Island, the triangular island off the end of the Haul Road. The outer edges of the
containment cell structures would be placed at the park boundary in the river. Restoration of 16 acres of
wetlands south of the breakwater is also included as an option. Approximately 180 acres of various
wetland habitats could be created overall, including the option.

ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES
The summary of environmental consequences considers the actions being proposed and the cumulative
impacts on resources from occurrences inside and outside the park. The potential environmental
consequences of the actions are addressed for hydrology and sediment transport, soils and sediments,
surface water quality, floodplains, vegetation and wetlands, fish and wildlife, species of special concern,
archeological resources, historic structures and districts and cultural landscapes, visitor use and
experience, adjacent property owners and the marina, and park management and operations. Impacts are
summarized in chapter 2, table 2-6.
Under the no-action alternative no restoration would occur and erosion would be severe enough that the
marsh would likely disappear. The no-action alternative would result in significant adverse impacts on
hydrology and sediment transport, soils and sediment transfer, vegetation and wetlands, fish and wildlife,
and plant and animal species of concern found in the marsh. The erosion and eventual disappearance of
the marsh would result in adverse but not significant impacts on the remaining resources and values.
Alternative B would result in long-term beneficial impacts on most resources, including significant
beneficial impacts on hydrology and sediment transport, and vegetation and wetlands, as a result of
placement of the breakwater, restoration of marsh that would stabilize erosion, and reintroduction of tidal
flows west of the Haul Road. The breakwater, placed on the northern side of the historic promontory,
would be visible from parts of the parkway and Mount Vernon Trail, and would therefore result in
adverse effects on cultural landscapes and visitor use and experience. There would be short-term adverse
impacts on most resources from construction-related activities. None of the short-term impacts would be
significant.
Alternative C would result in long-term beneficial impacts on most resources, slightly greater in
magnitude than the benefits from alternative B. As with alternative B, the beneficial impacts on
hydrology and sediment transport, as well as vegetation and wetlands, would be significant, because the
marsh would be stabilized and the amount of vegetation and wetlands would be greatly increased. The
magnitude of the increase in marsh would also result in potentially significant benefits for fish and
wildlife and species of concern. There would be short-term adverse impacts on most resources during
construction, although these impacts would not be significant. For visitor use and experience, impacts
from construction may be significant because the impacts would take place over a period of years and
would be highly noticeable, although the impacts would end when construction was complete.

CHAPTER 1: PURPOSE OF AND NEED FOR ACTION
INTRODUCTION
Dyke Marsh is a large wetland area on the Potomac River south of Alexandria, Virginia, that is part of the
George Washington Memorial Parkway. The marsh is one of the few remaining tidal freshwater marshes
on the Potomac River. Such marshes provide habitat for many species of plants and animals, including
rare species and species of state concern. Before the marsh came under the ownership of the National
Park Service (NPS), and continuing during NPS administration, it was dredged extensively for the gravel
deposits that underlay the marsh, and the result has been loss of acreage and acceleration of erosion in the
marsh. Congress has declared in several pieces of legislation that the marsh is a valuable resource to the
region, and should be preserved and restored, particularly in Public Law (P.L.) 93-251 in 1974, and most
recently in the Water Resources Development Act of 2007 (WRDA 2007, Section 5147).
This Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and Long-term Management Plan / Environmental Impact
Statement (plan/EIS) was prepared to assist the NPS in developing and evaluating alternatives for wetland
restoration and management for the Dyke Marsh Wildlife Preserve (hereafter referred to as “Dyke
Marsh.” This document has been prepared in accordance with the 1969 National Environmental Policy
Act (NEPA) and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended.
This “Purpose of and Need for Action” chapter explains what the wetland restoration and long-term
management plan intends to accomplish and why the NPS is taking action at this time. This plan/EIS
presents several alternatives for implementing wetland habitat restoration within Dyke Marsh, and
assesses the impacts that could result from continuing the current practices (the no-action alternative) or
implementing any of the action alternatives. Upon completion of this plan/EIS and decision-making
process, one of the alternatives will become the Dyke Marsh wetland restoration plan and will guide the
long-term, monitoring, management, and restoration of the marsh. Brief summaries of both the purpose
and need are presented here, and more information about the marsh and its history is available in the
“Background” section of this chapter.

PURPOSE OF THE PLAN
The purpose of this plan is to develop and implement actions for restoration and long-term management
of the tidal freshwater marsh and other associated wetland habitats that have been lost or impacted in
Dyke Marsh.

NEED FOR ACTION
Dyke Marsh wetland resources, plant and animal
communities, and natural ecosystem functions have been
damaged by previous human uses and continued erosion,
and are subject to continuing threats, such as alterations to
the hydrology in the Potomac River and in nearby
tributaries, and other effects from urbanization in the
surrounding region. In addition, the NPS is required to
restore Dyke Marsh, under P.L. 93-251, and the Water
Resources Development Act of 2007, Section 1547.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
defines “ecosystem services” as “the many
life-sustaining benefits we receive from
nature—clean air and water, fertile soil for
crop production, pollination, and flood
control. These ecosystem services are
important to our health and well-being, yet
they are limited and often taken for granted
as being free” (USEPA 2009).

Final Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and Long-term Management Plan / EIS

Chapter 1: Purpose of and Need for Action

Therefore, a restoration and management plan is needed at this time to


Protect the existing wetlands from erosion, nonnative invasive plants, loss of habitat, and altered
hydrologic regimes;



Restore wetlands and ecosystem functions and processes lost through sand and gravel mining and
shoreline erosion;



Avoid increased costs (delayed restoration will result in increased restoration costs); and



Improve ecosystem services that benefit the Potomac River Watershed and the Chesapeake Bay.

OBJECTIVES IN TAKING ACTION
Objectives are “what must be achieved to a large degree for the action to be considered a success” (NPS
2001). All action alternatives selected for detailed analysis must meet project objectives to a large degree
and resolve the purpose of and need for action. Objectives are grounded in the enabling legislation,
purpose, and mission goals of the George Washington Memorial Parkway (the park), and should be
compatible with direction and guidance provided by the 2005 George Washington Memorial Parkway
Long-range Interpretive Plan (NPS 2005b). The following are specific objectives for this plan/EIS.

NATURAL RESOURCES


Restore, protect, and maintain tidal freshwater wetlands and associated ecosystems to provide
habitat for fish, wildlife, and other biota.



Ensure that management actions promote native species while minimizing the intrusion of
nonnative invasive plants.



Reduce erosion of the existing marsh and provide for erosion control measures in areas of
restored marsh.



To the extent practicable, restore and maintain hydrologic processes needed to sustain Dyke
Marsh.



Protect populations of species of concern such as swamp sparrow (Melospiza georgiana) and
river bulrush (Bolboschoenus fluviatilis).



Increase the resilience of Dyke Marsh and provide a natural buffer to storms and flood control in
populated residential areas.

CULTURAL RESOURCES


Protect the historic resources and cultural landscape features associated with Dyke Marsh and the
George Washington Memorial Parkway.

VISITOR EXPERIENCE


2

Enhance appropriate educational, interpretation, and research opportunities at Dyke Marsh and
enhance accessibility for diverse audiences.

PROJECT SITE LOCATION
The geographic project area for this plan/EIS is the Dyke Marsh Wildlife
Preserve, located on the Potomac River in Fairfax County, south of the City of
Alexandria, Virginia (figure 1-1), and within the George Washington Memorial
Parkway. The project area falls completely within the park boundaries and
includes forested areas, wetlands, and open water areas within the
Commonwealth of Virginia. Hog Island Gut, the portion of the Dyke Marsh that
extends to the west side of the George Washington Memorial Parkway, is
considered to be within the project area for this plan/EIS.

Tidal guts are streamlike features found in
tidal marshes formed
by advancing and
receding tides

BACKGROUND
GEORGE WASHINGTON MEMORIAL PARKWAY AND DYKE MARSH
The George Washington Memorial Parkway was authorized in 1930 by the Capper-Cramton Act as a park
roadway to run along both shores of the Potomac River from Mount Vernon, Virginia, and Fort
Washington, Maryland, northerly to the Great Falls of the Potomac. Its purpose was for the protection and
preservation of the lands along the Potomac River and it expanded upon the mission of the previously
1928-authorized Mount Vernon Memorial Highway that was to serve as a scenic, commemorative
roadway connecting Washington, D.C., with the George Washington Mount Vernon estate. The George
Washington Memorial Parkway incorporated the under-construction Mount Vernon Memorial Highway
and extended the parkway beyond the originally envisioned connection of the nation’s capital to the first
president’s home to become a grand gateway and greenway system into Washington, D.C. (NPS 1996).
The George Washington Memorial Parkway Long-range Interpretive Plan defines the overall purpose of
Dyke Marsh Wildlife Preserve, which is “to protect irreplaceable wetlands which are valuable for the
reproduction and preservation of wildlife near the Nation’s Capital” (NPS 2005b). The plan states that
Dyke Marsh is significant in that it is “one of the largest naturally occurring tidal freshwater marshes in
the National Park System,” and contains a narrowleaf cattail (Typha angustifolia) community that is a
dominant vegetative feature. The marsh is an oasis in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area, providing
ample and diverse opportunities for inspiration, wildlife observation, interaction with the natural
environment, exercise, and fun through a variety of outdoor experiences. The history of Dyke Marsh
illustrates a lineage of human interaction with this environment, from Native American hunting and
fishing and colonial farming with the creation of dykes to sand and gravel dredging and current use of the
marsh as a preserve and recreation area (NPS 2005b).
Dyke Marsh is also important in that it contributes to the health of the Potomac River and the Chesapeake
Bay Watershed by filtering pollutants contributed from adjacent urban land uses.

Background

HISTORY OF THE DYKE MARSH SYSTEM
Dyke Marsh Description
Dyke Marsh is one of the largest remaining tidal freshwater wetlands in the Washington, D.C.,
metropolitan area. Based on sediment core samples taken within the marsh by the U.S. Geological Survey
(USGS), it is estimated that the southern marsh is approximately 2,200 years old and the northern marsh
is 500 years old (Litwin et al. 2013; Litwin et al. 2011). The alluvial deposits beneath the marsh are
approximately 50 feet thick, and are composed of defined layers of silt and clay interspersed in layers of
sand and gravel. Although the original extent of the property covered approximately 650 acres. In 1937,
the main part of the marsh north of the promontory covered approximately 184 acres, and there were
16.5 acres south of the promontory, and an additional 15 to 20 acres west of the parkway. The current
extent of the marsh is about 60 acres, plus the 15 to 20 acres west of the parkway (Litwin et al. 2011;
Litwin et al. 2013). Dyke Marsh includes tidal freshwater marsh, floodplain forest, and swamp forest
habitats with a diverse array of plants and animals.
The tidal marsh, floodplain forest, and swamp forest found within Dyke Marsh provide habitat for
approximately 300 plant species, 6,000 arthropod species, 38 fish species, 16 reptile species, 14
amphibian species, and over 230 bird species (FODM 2007). In 2011, the breeding bird survey confirmed
40 species of birds breeding in the marsh, including both the least bittern, which is on the state watch list,
and the marsh wren (Cistothorus palustris). Dyke Marsh has the only known nesting population of marsh
wrens in the Upper Potomac River tidal zone. The marsh is dominated by narrowleaf cattail. Other
species within the marsh include arrow arum (Peltandra virginica), arrowhead (Sagittaria latifolia),
pickerelweed (Pontederia cordata), sweetflag (Acorus calamus), spatterdock (Nuphar lutea), and wild
rice (Zizania aquatica) (NPS 2008b). Dyke Marsh is unusual in that it has remained as a climax cattail
marsh, possibly because of periodic inundation and river scouring and large storm events that have stifled
the establishment of upland successional species (R. Hammerschlag, pers. comm. 2007).

Land Use History
The first manipulations of Dyke Marsh took place in the early 1800s when colonial landowners tried to
convert the marsh area first into a place for ships to tie up and then into pasturelands for grazing (NPS
2009a). In an attempt to create a wet meadow, dikes were constructed around the marsh to keep the tidal
influx of water out of the marsh. However, the dikes were difficult to maintain and the land was later
abandoned. Shortly after, portions of the dikes failed and the inflow of tidal water formed channels
through the meadow, and the tidal freshwater marsh was reestablished (NPS 1977).
The marsh was later indirectly affected when Congress resolved to build a memorial parkway for the
celebration of the 200th anniversary of George Washington’s birthdate. In 1924, Congress established the
United States Commission for the Celebration of the Two Hundredth Anniversary of the Birth of George
Washington. Construction of the Mount Vernon Memorial Highway, a portion of which would cross a
small section of the marsh along the right-of-way of the former Washington, Alexandria, and Mount
Vernon Railway, was authorized in 1928. When the George Washington Memorial Parkway was
authorized in 1930, additional property was soon purchased in Dyke Marsh (and elsewhere) to establish
larger land holdings to ensure the aesthetic value of the parkway. Approximately 225 acres of the
northern portion of the marsh was acquired during this period (NPS 1977; 1996).
In the early 1930s, Smoot Sand and Gravel Corporation (SSGC) acquired 650 acres of land along the
Potomac River from Bucknell University. This parcel included the southern 260 acres of Dyke Marsh
adjacent to the lands belonging to the United States. By 1940, SSGC had dredged a large portion of the
open water areas and destroyed a great deal of marshland (NPS 1977). Between 1940 and 1972,

approximately 270 acres of the original marsh were mined for sand and gravel by SSGC, including the
swamp forest wetlands of the promontory south of Hog Island Gut (see figure 1-2).

OF DREDGING AND EROSION

In the late 1950s, the government, local citizens, and various conservation groups in and around
Washington, D.C., including the Audubon Society, the Garden Club of America, and the Wildlife
Federation, began expressing concern that the marsh was degrading due to SSGC mining activities. On
February 8, 1959, Irston Barnes, the president of the Audubon Society of the District of Columbia,
published an article in the Washington Post describing the value of preserving Dyke Marsh. In response
to this article and the mounting public interest, in April 1959, Representative Frank Smith of Mississippi
drafted bill HR 2228, which authorized the Secretary of the Interior to acquire the southern 260 acres of
Dyke Marsh from SSGC for the NPS. The bill, which was intended as a tool for preservation, described
Dyke Marsh as “an area of irreplaceable wetlands near the Nation’s Capital which is valuable for the
production and preservation of wildlife” (Cong. Rec. 86 [first sess.] [1959]). Acreage is stated according
to historic records.

Background

Congress passed P.L. 86-41 granting the U.S. government a legislative mandate for management of the
marsh (UMCES 2004) on June 11, 1959. The passage of this legislation ensured that a substantial portion
of the wetland would remain intact, but allowed SSGC to continue to dredge in some areas of the marsh.
As a result, mining continued in certain portions of the marsh until 1972, when SSGC relinquished its
dredging rights.
In May 1959, the Committee on Public Works submitted a report to accompany bill HR 2228, stating that
it was in the interest of the government to own this strip of land along the Potomac River because it
would help preserve the aesthetic qualities of the memorial parkway (S. Rep. 86-280 [1959]). A deed
completing the exchange and conveying title to the land from SSGC to the United States was executed on
May 31, 1960.

Post-dredging Rehabilitation Actions
Once the property had passed into NPS ownership, the NPS started activities to fill the deep holes created
by the dredging. NPS continued to fill dredged areas in Dyke Marsh into the early 1970s. However, in
1972, Superintendent David Richie wrote a letter to the Director of National Capital Parks that
emphasized the significant weaknesses in the overall planning for Dyke Marsh rehabilitation. The NPS
realized that there was no effective and scientifically sound management plan, and that placing fill
materials to restore the marsh should be more thoroughly analyzed. The letter also requested the
professional support of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). As a result, the filling of the
dredged areas was halted. In response to the situation, PL 93-251 was enacted on March 7, 1974, at the
93rd session of Congress, authorizing the USACE to assist the NPS in planning, designing, and
implementing the restoration and expansion of Dyke Marsh (NPS 1977).
As stated in PL 86-41, SSGC had dredging rights in Dyke Marsh until 1979; however, by 1972 the sand
and gravel deposits in the marsh had been exhausted, making dredging operations unprofitable. As a
result, in 1975 SSGC relinquished its mining rights and granted the NPS permission to begin restoring the
last areas of Dyke Marsh. At this time, a little more than half of the original marsh was still intact and the
remainder of the acreage under NPS management was dredged open water.
With USACE support and dredging operations completed, the NPS began to research marsh restoration.
The Rehabilitation of Dyke Marsh project included area surveys; mapped out plans for dikes and polders
(the reclaimed or low-lying land behind the dikes); and hydrographic surveys showing existing
underwater conditions, topography, existing and projected shoreline after marsh expansion, and fill areas.
As part of this effort, the NPS, with the help of the USACE, conducted an environmental assessment
(EA) of management options for Dyke Marsh (NPS 1977). Three alternatives were analyzed in the EA:


Take no action, allowing natural processes to guide the evolution of the marsh. No physical
manipulation of the marsh would be conducted under this alternative.



Use intensive management techniques within portions of the remnant marsh. The intensive
management alternative involved the deliberate manipulation of existing marshlands through
bulldozing, grading, dredge and fill, explosives, ditching, and weirs.



Investigate the reestablishment of stabilized wetlands in areas that were dredged. The feasibility
of this alternative would be checked first through the establishment of a test/demonstration area.

Final Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and Long-term Management Plan / EIS

Chapter 1: Purpose of and Need for Action

The marsh reestablishment alternative involved constructing a 28-acre test/demonstration area surrounded
by newly constructed dikes (figure 1-3). The demonstration area was proposed on the north end of the
marsh, stretching from the end of Haul Road and the smaller island out into the Potomac River (NPS
1977). If the demonstration area proved successful, it was proposed that the reestablishment would be
expanded to other sections of the marsh. However, based on lack of resources and other considerations,
the EA was not published, the NEPA process was never completed, and no restoration actions were ever
implemented at the marsh (Pavek, pers. comm. 2013).

Changes to the Dyke Marsh Resulting from Past Activities
As noted earlier, several hundred acres of the marsh were dredged, creating deep holes and channels and
removing substantial amounts of marsh vegetation. The alignment of the tidal guts and inlets has also
changed since dredging activities began. Sometime during the 1950s, dredging activities removed the
promontory of land south of Hog Island Gut, which likely impacted the hydrology of the marsh (figure 12).
Although impacts on the marsh from dredging activities have caused the most easily recognizable
changes to the marsh, several other changes have resulted from past activities in and near the marsh. The
outfall of Hunting Creek and Cameron Run into the Potomac River has been altered by the development
of the George Washington Memorial Parkway, urbanization within the watershed, the development of a
golf course along the creek and parkway, and upstream channelization. The sediment load from Hunting
Creek, which was once carried toward the marsh and helped maintain a depositional environment, is now
deposited mostly north of the marsh at the creek’s confluence with the Potomac River, where mudflats
and emergent wetlands are beginning to develop. These changes have greatly reduced the amount of
sediment and nutrients supplied to the marsh by Hunting Creek (NPS 1977; UMCES 2004). More recent
disturbances rebuilding the Woodrow Wilson Bridge and several associated interchanges at Hunting
Creek could further alter the hydrology in the creek and result in additional impacts on the marsh
downstream (Litwin et al. 2013).
After the NPS took ownership of the property, the NPS began the process of refilling dredged areas, and
during the 1960s and early 1970s deposited fill material in the marsh. However, this process was
conducted without a scientifically based management plan and was halted in 1972. It is not clear from
recent studies and photos whether the filling of dredged areas during the 1960s and early 1970s had any
measurable impacts.
Haul Road, the path that serves as the current nature
trail Dyke Marsh, was constructed as a vehicle road
during the 1940s by SSGC. It was used to support
dredging operations and to haul construction debris
and other dredge spoils. When Haul Road was built,
it effectively disconnected the land on the west side
of the road from tidal inundation. As a result,
succession has occurred in this area, and now large
upland trees and exotic invasive species are
prevalent in the area west of Haul Road.

Chapter 1: Purpose of and Need for Action

Erosion in Dyke Marsh is a source of NPS maintenance costs. Erosion, caused primarily by storm waves
driven northward up the Potomac River, is evident along the entire western bank of the Potomac River,
including along Haul Road. Erosion has progressed from the southeast to the northwest. The riverbed has
also eroded, with the downstream two-thirds of the marsh experiencing most of the erosion. The upstream
one-third of the marsh is experiencing some deposition (NPS 2009b; Litwin et al. 2011) (figure 1-4).
The Belle Haven Marina, at the north end of Dyke Marsh, contains several moorings, docks, a sailing
school, and a rental concession for small sailboats, kayaks, and canoes. The moorings are located in some
of the deeper holes created by the dredging, although the area behind the canoe dock is filling in with
sediment.

SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND
Wetlands, the transitional lands between aquatic habitat and upland terrestrial areas, serve several critical
functions. They provide habitat as well as breeding and feeding grounds for fish and wildlife, and they
serve critical water quality and flood control functions by filtering pollutants and acting as a sponge and a
barrier between open water and uplands (Cowardin et al. 1979). Tidal freshwater wetlands occur in the
uppermost portion of the estuarine zone, where the inflow of saltwater from tidal influence is diluted by a
larger volume of freshwater from upstream and salt concentrations are less than 0.5 parts per thousand.
Tidal freshwater wetlands such as Dyke Marsh once occurred extensively along the rivers in the coastal
plain of the Mid-Atlantic, but rivers and coastal wetlands have come under natural and human threats, and
the USGS estimates that at least half of the wetlands present in colonial times may have been lost (USGS
2008). Coastal wetlands are under threat from erosion and subsidence. Riverine and inland wetlands have
been impacted by such activities as dredging, nonpoint source pollution, and other changes that can in
turn affect habitat, hydrology, and wetland function.

PAST RESEARCH ON DYKE MARSH
Since the 1974 congressional mandate to restore Dyke Marsh, the marsh has been the subject of numerous
physical and biological surveys. Researchers from the University of Maryland Center for Environmental
Sciences (UMCES) Appalachian Laboratory held a workshop in 2004 to compile and review the existing
data and collect additional information on Dyke Marsh to assess the feasibility of restoring the dredged
portions of Dyke Marsh, while maintaining the integrity and health of the existing marsh. The data
included all of the studies conducted on the marsh since the 1990s, such as an inventory of plant species
in 1991 (Xu 1991, as discussed in UMCES 2004) as well as a collection of case studies of restoration
projects in the region for the purpose of obtaining lessons learned and relating them to the process of
establishing feasibility.
The UMCES workshop materials listed several studies on the marsh and other wetlands:



Study of terrestrial arthropod and alien plant diversity in the forested areas of Dyke Marsh
(Barrows and Kjar 2003).



Survey of leaf beetles (Cavey et al. 2013).



Inventory of the various fish species found in and around the Dyke Marsh area (Mangold et al.
2004).



Annual surveys of breeding birds in the marsh (Cartwright 2004; FODM various years).



Studies of soils, elevation, and the diversity of vegetation communities and their topographic
positions in the marsh (UMCES 2004).



A seed germination project examining the quantity of seeds and species of seeds floating into the
marsh due to tides, river currents, and storms (UMCES 2004).



Water quality analysis considered samples taken from six different locations around Dyke Marsh,
including from the Potomac River and tidal guts, in summer. The water samples were analyzed
for ammonia, nitrate+nitrite, nitrite, ortho-phosphate, total suspended solids, and total fecal
coliform (UMCES 2004).



A tidal gauge was installed in May 2004 at the Belle Haven Marina.

More recent studies on the marsh include a 2005 study mapping vegetation within the marsh using
ecology field sampling and classification techniques combined with remote sensing technologies
(Engelhardt and Elmore 2007), a second vegetation mapping project sponsored by the NPS National
Capital Region, and a 2009 bathymetric survey conducted to document areas of erosion and deposition
within the marsh (NPS 2009b). The Engelhardt and Elmore (2007) report, titled Should We Restore Dyke
Marsh? A Management Dilemma Facing George Washington Memorial Parkway, found that “elevation
maps, and to a limited degree tidal channel information, could inform the development and interpretation
of vegetation maps because vegetation appeared to respond to the physical gradient that elevation and
channel size and distance confer” and recommended that elevation maps be used as a guide for marsh
restoration designs. The 2009 bathymetry study found that much of the western shoreline of the Potomac
River has experienced erosion since 1992. It also found that riverbed erosion has occurred over a much
larger area of Dyke Marsh than deposition, with most of the erosion occurring in the southern
(downstream) two-thirds of the marsh and most of the deposition occurring in the northern (upstream)
third of the marsh (NPS 2009b) (figure 1-4).
The erosional state of Dyke Marsh and several other issues have been further studied by scientists with
the USGS in partnership with the NPS and researchers familiar with the marsh. Litwin et al. examined the
age of the marsh; the size of the marsh from 1937 to the present; pre- and post- mining configurations of
Dyke Marsh; causes, characteristics, and rates of erosion in the marsh; geologic factors that could
diminish marsh erosion; and whether or not the marsh is in a naturally sustainable state (Litwin et al.
2011; Litwin et al. 2013). The researchers found that the marsh had been relatively stable for at least 73
years prior to the commencement of dredging, and that the dredging and other alterations significantly
altered the tidal creeks that are the marsh’s primary source of sediment (Litwin et al. 2011; Litwin et al.
2013).
These researchers also found that the post-mining marsh remnant is shrinking rapidly as a result of
erosion. Storm waves driven upstream from tropical storms, hurricanes, and nor’easters (large-scale
coastal storms whose winds blow predominantly out of the northeast) have been the primary agents of
marsh erosion, rather than flooding from upriver. Researchers found that linear erosion in the marsh
averages between 6 and 8 feet per year, and that the outer walls of Hog Island Gut are not stable without
the protective promontory removed in the 1950s that had directed flow from the gut upstream; they also

12

Background

found that without intervention through manmade stabilization of geological features such as the
promontory, the marsh would continue to deconstruct (Litwin et al. 2011; Litwin et al. 2013).
The Interagency Workgroup on Wetland Restoration, made up of representatives from the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), USACE,
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), and the Natural Resources Conservation Service, produced An
Introduction and User’s Guide to Wetland Restoration, Creation, and Enhancement in 2003 (IWWR
2003). This guide provides an overall background on wetlands and wetland restoration; discusses project
planning, implementation, and monitoring; and provides a list of resources, contacts, and funding sources.
A 2006 feasibility study entitled “The Use
of Case Studies in Establishing Feasibility
for Wetland Restoration” used Dyke
Marsh as a focal point for assessing the
importance of incorporating lessons
learned from previously completed
restoration projects in the success of
similar future endeavors (Hopfensperger,
Engelhardt, and Seagle 2006). The authors
posited that establishing restoration
feasibility is “a multifaceted process and
aspects of site ecological, social, and
economic conditions should be
considered.” Five completed wetland
restoration projects that reported successes
and failures were examined and
commonalities among them were
identified. Most of the case studies that
were examined in this study identified the need for the following:


gathering preexisting and historical information



developing scenarios through hydrologic modeling



studying the fill and plant materials to be used in restoration



using best professional judgment for unanswered questions



establishing multigroup collaboration



gaining public support from stakeholders



post-restoration monitoring.

Dyke Marsh

These lessons were applied to a study that evaluated the feasibility of restoring Dyke Marsh, and it was
found that the use of case studies substantially increased confidence in the decision-making process. The
additional knowledge focused discussions on the most important ecological, social, and economic aspects
of a potential restoration.
Finally, after it was determined at the first alternatives development meeting in 2009 that more
information was needed on the hydrodynamics of the marsh and the probability of success of the
proposed alternative elements, the USACE engaged hydrologists and engineers to perform more detailed
bathymetry studies; conduct one- and two-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling that considers flow
depth, velocity, and sediment transport and deposition; and develop or refine the alternatives based on the

Final Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and Long-term Management Plan / EIS

13

Chapter 1: Purpose of and Need for Action

study findings. This research provided a baseline understanding of current hydrodynamics in the marsh,
as well as an understanding of how well the alternatives discussed in chapter 2 will work in reestablishing
a sustainable marsh environment. The USACE and its consultants examined existing flows and sediment
transport in the marsh, and the effects of the proposed breakwater on flows and sediment transport. All
action alternatives were modeled as well to evaluate how the restoration would work over the long term.
(USACE 2013)

WETLAND RESTORATION MANAGEMENT ISSUES
Although there are congressional mandates to restore the marsh, marsh restoration is a difficult science,
and several issues need to be considered during the restoration process. Most studies on wetland
restoration focus on saltwater marsh or nontidal freshwater wetlands. There is a demonstrably smaller
body of literature on restoration of tidal freshwater marshes such as Dyke Marsh. Although there are case
studies to examine, care and attention are necessary to ensure that the desired restoration objectives are
met and that appropriate and proper monitoring occurs, no matter which alternative is selected, to ensure
successful adaptive management.
The 2004 workshop held by UMCES defined several priority concerns regarding the long-term
persistence and health of the existing marsh and potentially restored areas. These concerns included
shoreline erosion, engineered marsh soils, sea level rise, nor’easter storms, urbanization, and invasive
species.
Any restoration alternative would require the use of fill material, which the USACE could provide
whenever maintenance dredging is required at other nearby sites, although this is not a regular or
predictable occurrence. However, to accommodate the uncertain availability and volume of suitable fill, a
phased approach would need to be incorporated into the restoration plan. The restoration design must
account for the uncertain amount of fill available at any one time. Long-term monitoring and modeling
would be required to ensure that the expected outcomes are achieved. The introduction of any foreign fill
material could increase the likelihood of introducing nonnative invasive plants because it is difficult to
ensure that fill material is completely free of viable seeds, including those from exotic or invasive plants.
This would particularly be true if elevation changes prove conducive to the introduction of such species.
Therefore, management plans need to account for the possibility of the introduction of invasive species,
and how to prevent and manage their presence.

DYKE MARSH SCIENCE TEAM
It is important to the NPS that the development of a restoration plan for Dyke Marsh be based on
scientifically sound recommendations. Therefore, the NPS convened a science team for the plan/EIS to
provide technical background information and guidance to the NPS as it developed alternatives for the
plan/EIS.
The science team consisted of 19 individuals from federal agencies and universities who have particular
expertise in some aspect of restoration of tidal freshwater wetlands and/or experience with Dyke Marsh.
Federal agencies included the NPS, USACE, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, USGS,
and USFWS. Universities represented included the University of Maryland and the University of Rhode
Island.

George Washington Memorial Parkway

Scoping Process and Public Participation

The science team convened via conference calls, meeting five times over a five-month period. The
purpose of these meetings was not to develop alternatives or seek group consensus, but to seek
information, advice, concerns, and opinions from the individual team members on several key topics,
including


the feasibility of restoring the marsh



the desired condition of Dyke Marsh



the ecology of the marsh



how restoration efforts could impact the marsh over the short and long term



technical aspects of engineering and wetland restoration on both small and large scales



methods for protecting the existing marsh from natural factors as well as ongoing restoration
activities



what monitoring and adaptive management protocols should be considered during the restoration
process.

A science team report was generated, and the interdisciplinary planning team then used the input from the
science team to develop specific alternatives and address questions and concerns raised during the public
scoping process.

SCOPING PROCESS AND PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
INTERNAL SCOPING
To initiate this plan/EIS, the NPS held an internal scoping meeting that included several members of the
Science Team on November 14 and 15, 2007. The purpose of the meeting was to provide the NPS with an
overview of the process required by NEPA and its implementing regulations, as well as to provide an
opportunity for the key agency staff to review and confirm the purpose and need for taking action, define
plan objectives, discuss potential issues and impact topics, and identify data needs.

PUBLIC SCOPING
NEPA regulations require an early and open process for determining the scope of issues to be addressed
and for identifying the significant issues related to a proposed action. To help determine the scope of
issues to be analyzed in depth in this plan/EIS, public participation was solicited through the use of a
newsletter and at a public meeting. The park released a scoping newsletter for the plan/EIS for public
review and comment on April 7, 2008. The public was invited to submit comments on the scope of the
planning process and potential alternatives through May 23, 2008. During the scoping period, a public
scoping meeting was held at Belle View Elementary on April 22, 2008. The meeting presented
information about the development of the plan and planning processes. NPS staff members were on hand
to answer questions, provide additional information to meeting participants, and record participant input.
During the scoping period, nearly 300 pieces of correspondence were received and entered into the NPS
Planning, Environment, and Public Comment (PEPC) website system either from direct entry by the
commenter, or uploading of emails, faxes, and hardcopy letters by NPS staff.
Correspondence from the 45-day scoping period came from over 32 states and three countries (United
States, Canada, and Scotland). Of the approximately 50 letters submitted from outside the region
immediately surrounding Dyke Marsh (defined as the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia),

Final Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and Long-term Management Plan / EIS

15

Chapter 1: Purpose of and Need for Action

concerns regarding hunting access in areas near Dyke Marsh were the most prevalent. Among those who
commented from the immediately surrounding area, the three topics that received the majority of the
comments were expressions of support for the restoration of Dyke Marsh, concerns regarding the impact
of the restoration on the Belle Haven Marina, and concerns regarding continued access to hunting in areas
near Dyke Marsh.
Additional Public Scoping Meeting Regarding Alternatives. Following the determination in 2009 that
additional work was necessary to develop alternatives that were based on up-to-date hydrologic and
hydraulic data, the NPS worked together with the USACE and its contractor to develop conceptual
restoration alternatives. Once alternatives were developed, the NPS held a public meeting to present them.
The meeting was held at the Washington Sailing Marina in Alexandria, Virginia, on May 19, 2012. The
public was invited to submit comments on the potential conceptual alternatives through June 20, 2012.
During the comment period following the meeting, more than 600 pieces of correspondence were
received and entered into the PEPC system. More information about the meeting is available in
“Chapter 5: Consultation, Coordination, and Regulatory Compliance.”

PUBLIC REVIEW OF THE DRAFT PLAN/EIS
On January 15, 2014, the NPS published a Notice of Availability in the Federal Register for the draft
plan/EIS. The 60-day public comment period was open through March 18, 2014. The public comment
period was announced on the project website, posted on the park website, and announced through a press
release. The draft plan/EIS was available on the PEPC website and via hard copy upon request from the
park. During the scoping period, a public meeting was held at the Washington Sailing Marina on February
26, 2014. During the comment period, 313 pieces of correspondence were received. As discussed further
in “Chapter 5: Consultation, Coordination, and Regulatory Compliance,” substantive comments from
these correspondences were considered in the preparation of the final plan/EIS.

ISSUES AND IMPACT TOPICS
Issues associated with implementing a wetland restoration and long-term management plan for Dyke
Marsh were identified by the planning team. The issues identified by the team are discussed below. These
form the basis for the impact topics that were carried forward for analysis and that are discussed in
chapters 3 and 4 of this plan/EIS. These issues represent existing conditions, as well as concerns that
might arise during the implementation of any of the proposed alternatives.

Hydrology and Sediment Transport
The mean tidal range in the area of Dyke Marsh is between 0.5 and 0.9 meter (1.6 and 3.0 feet)
(UMCES 2004). Due to the distance from the main river channel to the marsh, there is minimal effect on
the shoreline by the main channel flow of the river; however, there are other factors, including two deep
channels through the historical marsh area, wave action, and other influences, that affect marsh and
shoreline stability and erosion. Drainage in the marsh is controlled by both tidal flows and general flow in
the Potomac River (UMCES 2004). Restoration activities would likely need to address hydraulic issues in
the marsh. Restoration activities may have some effect on hydrology and flow characteristics in and
around the marsh. Tidal influence may be restored to areas west of Haul Road, which would affect the
ecological community in that area. Marsh restoration may also help attenuate flooding in the immediate
area, with more acres of wetlands to act as a sponge in flooding situations. Tidal guts and meanders are
vital elements of a healthy, functioning marsh, and restoration designs would need to maintain the
hydrology of the existing marsh while also creating tidal guts in the new marsh.

Issues and Impact Topics

The prevailing winds and currents and occasional nor’easter storms can cause erosion, scour, and flooding
that could imperil newly restored areas. Restoration should be designed and planned with care to provide
as much protection from erosion and storm damage as possible, and there should be plans in place should
damage occur as the result of one of these storms.
The hydrology of the marsh has already been impacted by changes in Hunting Creek and Cameron Run,
two interconnected systems that have been subject to hardening, urban development, and increased
stormwater runoff. The recent construction of a bridge to replace the I-495 Woodrow Wilson Bridge has
further changed the upstream environment around Hunting Creek. In addition, National Harbor, a new,
large conference center, hotel, and mixed-use complex in Maryland, is just upstream of Dyke Marsh on
the opposite side of the Potomac River and could impact the marsh. A water taxi service connects
National Harbor to Old Town Alexandria, Mount Vernon, Georgetown, and the Washington Nationals
Ballpark for games during the baseball season. Although most of these water taxis are not high-speed
boats (there is one higher-speed catamaran in the fleet), the service, along with increased numbers of
larger boats docked at the National Harbor marina, could increase wave action, and subsequently affect
erosion, within Dyke Marsh. Concerns about flooding in the Belle Haven community surrounding the
marsh and potential plans to control the flooding could also affect the success of marsh restoration. All of
these issues need to be considered in developing a restoration plan as well as long-term monitoring and
management plans for the marsh.
Sea level rise, a consequence of climate change, may be a long-term concern for the successful
continuation of both the existing marsh and the restored marsh. Sea level rise is expected to impact
coastal wetlands along the eastern seaboard. Tidal gauges around the Chesapeake Bay indicate that sea
level rise in Chesapeake Bay is twice the average global rate of 1.8 millimeters per year (Titus et al.
2009), and there is concern by climate change scientists that post-glacial rebound could exacerbate the
effects of sea level rise in the area as well. The weight of the glaciers caused the earth’s mantle material to
bulge around the edges of the glaciers during the Ice Age, and as the glaciers receded, the bulge settled
and continues to settle, creating a small fall in elevation in the Mid-Atlantic region (Litwin and Pavich,
pers. comm. 2009; NOAA 2000). Climate change modelers have predicted that mean annual discharge in
the Potomac River could increase 20 percent by the 2050s (UMCES 2007). Wetlands could disappear
because of inadequate sediment loads. Some studies on the Chesapeake Bay show that sediment loads
should be adequate to maintain most wetlands, but there is concern whether sediment loads in the
Potomac River are sufficient for Dyke Marsh to keep pace with sea level rise (UMCES 2004). More
recent studies have inconclusive findings. Other concerns about the marsh related to sea level rise are
whether shoreline erosion would be exacerbated and whether increased salinity in the area resulting from
sea level rise could change the marsh ecology (UMCES 2004).

Soils and Sediments
The years of dredging and marsh removal have altered the marsh and riverbed bathymetry. Where
shallow contours once existed, there are now deep holes and channels that contribute to the erosion of the
marsh as shallower sediments slough off into these deeper waters. To restore the marsh, fill material
would likely need to be brought in from outside sources and new soils created through the restoration
process. Containment structures would be necessary to keep this new material in place until the marsh
becomes established. Construction activities and the new fill material would impact existing soils.
Restoration would also encourage sediment deposition in some parts of the marsh.

Surface Water Quality in the Potomac River
The Potomac River, and specifically the Middle Potomac River where Dyke Marsh is located, has been
listed as impaired under the Clean Water Act for bacteria and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Under

Final Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and Long-term Management Plan / EIS

17

Chapter 1: Purpose of and Need for Action

the Clean Water Act, waters are listed as “impaired” when required pollution controls are not sufficient to
attain or maintain applicable water quality standards. Water quality in this stretch of the river is
dominated by urban runoff and effluent from upstream, which includes high nutrient loads, turbidity,
some heavy metals, and toxic chemicals (NPS 1977; Johnston 2000; UMCES 2004). The marsh appears
to have been more affected by dredging activities and changes in hydrology at Hunting Creek than by the
other water quality factors; however, restoration success may be affected by existing water quality issues
in the river. Conversely, successful restoration may have positive effects on water quality, by increasing
the acres of wetlands performing wetland functions such as nutrient capture and filtering in the immediate
area of the marsh. Construction activities, particularly during the placement of sheet piling and
containment structures, may cause temporary turbidity issues.

Floodplains
Upland areas associated with Dyke Marsh are in the floodplain of the Potomac River, and it is likely that
contours, elevation, and area of tidal inundation may change in several areas as a result of restoring the
marsh. The success of the marsh restoration is potentially interlinked with and dependent on other local
projects under consideration to address concerns about flooding in the area.
NPS Director’s Order 77-2 (NPS 2003) governs NPS actions involving floodplains, and directs the NPS
to reduce the risk of flood loss, minimize impacts of floods on human safety, health, and welfare, and to
restore and preserve the natural and beneficial values served by floodplains. However, a floodplains
statement of findings would not be required for the Dyke Marsh restoration project because the project
would restore or protect the natural functions and values of the floodplain.

Vegetation and Wetlands
There are both upland and wetland plant
communities within the marsh. Dyke
Marsh contains tidal freshwater marsh,
swamp forest, and floodplain forest,
with both uplands and wetlands within
the forested areas. Although the goal is
to restore the marsh, restoration
activities may impact existing wetland
areas in addition to creating new
wetlands. Restoration design will be
done with care to avoid unwanted
adverse impacts in existing wetland
areas as well as to minimize the
introduction of invasive plants like the
purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria), if
fill contains seed material for these
plants and the restoration activities
inadvertently create situations (by
creating too high an elevation, for
example) in which the plants could become established.

Dyke Marsh Wetlands

The emergent marsh community is diverse, with seven co-dominant species; the most common species in
the existing marsh is narrowleaf cattail. Engineering restoration of the marsh may impact the vegetation in
the marsh, and care must be taken to ensure that any impacts are positive and in keeping with the goals
and purpose of the restoration activities. Changes in vegetation patterns have been observed in the marsh,

18

George Washington Memorial Parkway

Issues and Impact Topics

with new clumps of spatterdock observed in the waterways over the last several decades, which could be
evidence of changing sedimentation patterns in the marsh (UMCES 2004), and marsh restoration may
continue to contribute to changes in vegetation patterns. In addition, while the presence of submerged
aquatic vegetation (SAV) has been in decline in past decades, it has increased in recent years due to the
rapid spread of nonnative SAV. Placing new fill in the riverbed to restore the marsh would likely impact
these nonnative SAV species by burying them.
Vegetation in the marsh includes a few species of nonnative invasive plants, such as common reed and
purple loosestrife, and this project would affect the park’s ability to manage and eradicate these species in
the marsh as the restoration occurs, and there could be temporary conditions in which these plants could
become established, particularly before other vegetation has been planted. Although it is expected that
some of the exotic and invasive plant species would be eliminated as a result of the reintroduction of tidal
inundation, aggressive measures to control some of the exotic vegetation may be needed, and
management of expected and desired vegetation may be necessary.
Increased tidal exchange in the areas currently cut off by Haul Road would gradually alter numerous tidal
floodplain characteristics, including plant community composition. There would be a gradual transition
from one set of plant community types to another as adjustments are made to environmental parameters
such as tidal inundation, flooding frequency, and soil saturation.

Fish and Wildlife
One of the most important functions of marsh and wetland habitats is to provide habitat and food web for
wildlife. Tidal marsh, floodplain forest, and swamp forest are found within Dyke Marsh, and the marsh
provides habitat for numerous species of fish, reptiles, amphibians, and birds. Previous dredging of the
marsh has greatly reduced the size and changed the hydrologic functions of the marsh, altering the
amount and type of habitat available to support both resident and migratory fish and wildlife species.
The proposed project focuses specifically on restoring marsh habitat and hydrologic functions. These
actions would provide long-term improvements to the overall habitat for fish and wildlife species.
However, they may reduce the habitat quality available for some aquatic species that use the deep holes
created by the dredging, because these deeper holes and channels may be filled as part of the restoration.
Construction activities have the potential to cause temporary adverse impacts to species and their habitat
through physical disturbance, noise disturbance, and burying of sessile aquatic species (those species
attached to the substrate and are immobile). Impacts would be dependent upon the implementation of and
adherence to best management practices (BMPs) designed to avoid or reduce temporary impacts on
resident and migratory species.

Species of Special Concern
Dyke Marsh is considered a cattail climax marsh. It is an important plant community that provides
essential habitat for many wildlife species, including several Virginia state-listed rare or sensitive plant
and animal species. State-listed species present in the marsh include Davis’ sedge (Carex davisii), river
bulrush, rough avens (Geum laciniatum), giant burreed (Sparganium eurycarpum), and two bird species:
the least bittern and the swamp sparrow (Melospiza georgiana). There are no federally threatened or
endangered species located within the project area, although the marsh is within the range of the federally
listed (endangered) shortnose sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum), and the Chesapeake Bay distinct
population segment of Atlantic sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus oxyrinchus). Multiyear surveys by the
USFWS did not find individuals of either species in the marsh (Mangold et al. 2004), indicating that the
restoration would have no effect on these species, and they are therefore not discussed further. The statelisted plant heartleaf plantain (Plantago cordata) is now extirpated in the marsh and possibly extirpated in

19

Chapter 1: Purpose of and Need for Action

the Commonwealth of Virginia, although it is secure globally. Bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), a
delisted species, are also found in the vicinity of the marsh. One nest was recently confirmed in the woods
adjacent to the marsh, and bald eagles may use the marsh as hunting habitat. Although marsh restoration
would likely provide long-term benefits to species of concern by expanding and improving the marsh
habitat available to the species, construction activities may have the potential to negatively impact these
species through physical and noise disturbances.

Archeological Resources
Despite the past dredging activities, a large portion of the preserve property appears to have retained
sufficient landscape integrity that it should be considered to have the potential for archeological
resources. Essentially, the entire upland area could contain Native American sites dating from the past
5,000 years. These would most likely be short-term, seasonal camps used by people hunting, fishing, or
gathering in the marsh and the river (NPS 2009a). The marsh area was dry land until at least 6000 BC,
and probably as late as 3000 BC, so Paleo-Indian and Archaic campsites may be present in the
undisturbed portions of the marsh (NPS 2009a). Historic uses of the marsh included the 19th century
diking to reclaim marsh area to create fast land for better river access and pasturage/agricultural use, as
well as hunting, fishing, boating, and occasional illicit activities including bootlegging, gambling, and
prostitution. These activities have potentially left behind archeological remains in the form of cabins,
cottages, shacks, work sites, watercraft, marine facilities, etc. (Virta 2012a) This plan/EIS primarily
focuses on the previously dredged areas and will include measures designed to protect the existing
portions of the marsh from damage, so restoration is unlikely to have an adverse impact on any potential
sites present in Dyke Marsh. However, restoring tidal influence west of Haul Road has the potential to
impact unknown archeological sites if there are land-disturbing activities outside the footprint of the road
itself. If ground-disturbing activities cannot avoid potential archeologically sensitive areas, archeological
surveys would need to be undertaken to identify and evaluate any resources that may be directly impacted
by the marsh restoration activities.

Historic Structures and Districts, and Cultural Landscapes
The entirety of the George Washington Memorial Parkway and the land that encompasses the larger
parkway landscape has been listed in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) under the
nominations for the Mount Vernon Memorial Highway (NPS 1981), George Washington Memorial
Parkway (NPS 1995), and the Parkways of the National Capital Region (NPS 1991). The marsh is part of
the scenic landscape that the designers of the parkway originally sought to preserve and incorporate into
the viewshed of the roadway. The 19th century dikes have been the only lasting structural improvement
made to the marsh since historic times. Portions of the dike remain on the southern end of the marsh, near
Hog Island Gut, and restoration activities could impact these remnants. No other historic structures
associated with the more ephemeral human activities within Dyke Marsh are known to exist, but
archeological remains are possible.
Dyke Marsh is an important feature of the overall cultural landscape of the Mount Vernon Memorial
Highway along the roadway between Washington, D.C., and Mount Vernon, one of the 19 identified
major cultural landscapes of the park. The planting plan of the Mount Vernon Memorial Highway (NPS
n.d.c) includes directed view areas for users of the Parkway and several of the opportunities for observing
scenic resources included viewing the Potomac River and Dyke Marsh. Views and vistas are significant
characteristics of parkways such as the Mount Vernon Memorial Highway, and the features of Dyke
Marsh were highlighted as scenic views by Mount Vernon Memorial Highway designers.
Dyke Marsh itself has not yet been formally evaluated for cultural landscape status, and is not one of the
19 currently identified major cultural landscapes of the park. The historic dikes are important features of

20

George Washington Memorial Parkway

Issues and Impact Topics

the human manipulated landscape of the marsh, and human use and vestiges of their activities in the
marsh may suggest that Dyke Marsh would qualify as a type of cultural landscape on its own if found to
have enough integrity and character to fit the definition. Regardless, the marsh is an important feature of
the overall landscape of the southern parkway leading to Mount Vernon (Bies and Virta, pers. comm.
2009; Virta, pers. comm. 2012b). Restoring and expanding the tidal freshwater marsh would enhance the
cultural landscape, although altering marsh hydrology with construction of modern breakwaters or other
structures related to the restoration could have some adverse impacts.

Visitor Use and Experience
Construction activities would impact both visitor use and visitor experience by restricting access to areas
of the marsh during construction activities, reducing the amount of open water within the marsh, and by
creating noise and visual disturbances. Visitors would likely not be able to use the marsh for fishing or
other recreational enjoyment during construction. Converting open water areas to marsh and filling the
deeper holes would have long-term impacts on recreational fishing activities within the marsh itself by
increasing nursery areas for fish and other aquatic life. Visitor experience would be impacted visually
during the construction process, and when areas of fill that are settling and have not yet been planted, and
the when there are areas of vegetation that are not yet mature enough to blend in with the remainder of the
marsh. Fill activities and related disturbances would require the use of heavy equipment, which would
cause noise. Restoration activities would also include benefits by providing several opportunities for
expanded education on the marsh ecosystem and restoration activities and goals.
In addition, users of the Belle Haven Marina may be affected both during marsh restoration activities and
after restoration is complete. The configuration of the marsh would change, navigation through and
around the marsh would change, and access to the marina from the river might also change, resulting in
changes to visitor use and experience.

Adjacent Property Owners and the Marina
Adjacent properties would also be temporarily impacted by construction noise and may be impacted if
there is a change in the numbers of waterfowl in the marsh once restoration is complete. More waterfowl
and reestablishment of the marsh closer to the licensed duck blinds could increase hunting in the area and
affect adjacent property owners. Potential effects of marsh restoration on neighboring properties will be
considered during design and construction.

Park Management and Operations
The plan for the incremental restoration of Dyke Marsh, accompanied by a program of environmental
monitoring and adaptive management, must include an operations and management plan that specifies
how structures will be managed throughout the probably lengthy restoration process (which is expected to
last years or decades) and identifies the responsible agencies.
In addition, restoring Dyke Marsh may result in a loss of revenue for the Belle Haven Marina, a
concession located at the northern end of the marsh. Restoration may decrease the amount of open water
within the marsh area and potentially fill in deep holes, so there could also be a decrease in the number of
anglers using the marina boat ramp to access the marsh and the surrounding area for fishing purposes.
This could result in a loss of boat ramp revenue for the marina.

Chapter 1: Purpose of and Need for Action

ISSUES CONSIDERED BUT DISMISSED FROM FURTHER CONSIDERATION
The following impact topics and issues were dismissed from further analysis, as explained below.

Air Quality
The Washington, D.C., region is a nonattainment area for ground-level ozone and fine particulate matter
(PM2.5) according to federal health standards. The George Washington Memorial Parkway and Dyke
Marsh are classified as a Class II area per the Clean Air Act of 1973. Impacts on air quality from
implementing a tidal wetland restoration plan would include fugitive dust and emissions from
construction vehicles and equipment, but would not make noticeable contributions to the air quality.
Therefore, air quality was dismissed from further analysis.

Land Use
Although there should be accretion of marshland and there may be some associated change in the
boundary between wetland and upland areas, there would be no substantial change in land use as a result
of the project. Impacts on neighboring properties are addressed under the topic “Adjacent Property
Owners and the Marina” (under “Issues and Impact Topics” in this chapter). Therefore, land use was
dismissed from further analysis.

Prime Farmlands
There are designated prime farmland soils in the Dyke Marsh study area, but restoration activities would
not be expected to affect these soils. Therefore, the topic of prime farmlands was dismissed from further
analysis.

Estuarine Resources
Estuaries are partly enclosed coastal bodies of water that are influenced by both connections to the open
ocean and to freshwater from one or more rivers flowing into them. The Chesapeake Bay, into which the
Potomac River flows, is an estuary, and the river is tidally influenced as far north as Washington, D.C.,
but is brackish only downstream of the Governor Nice Bridge near Colonial Beach, Virginia. Dyke Marsh
is therefore located in the freshwater tidally influenced portion of the Potomac River, and is not
considered part of the estuarine zone. Although restoration activities could affect estuarine resources, the
estuarine zone begins far enough downstream that impacts would be unlikely. Therefore, the topic of
estuarine resources has been dismissed from further analysis.

Climate Change
The impacts on climate change from restoring Dyke Marsh would be mainly due to emissions of nitrous
oxides and carbon dioxide from the burning of fuel in vehicles and construction equipment, which can
affect global warming. However, these impacts would be short term and negligible. Therefore, impacts of
the project on climate change have been dismissed from further analysis. Climate change may impact the
restoration project due to sea level rise and changes to salinity, and require adaptive responses to ensure
continued project success; these impacts on the project will be addressed in discussions of adaptive
management monitoring plan in appendix A of this plan/EIS, and in the “Environmental Consequences”
chapter.

George Washington Memorial Parkway

Issues and Impact Topics

Transportation
Restoration work will most likely involve the use of boats accessing the site from the water. There may be
a few trucks used to access the marsh restoration sites, especially for work on Haul Road, but their use
would be minimal. Should access by land from the George Washington Memorial Parkway be required,
construction vehicles would be permitted by the park, and time spent on the parkway would be limited.
Therefore, transportation has been dismissed from further analysis.

Minority and Low-income Populations, including Environmental Justice
The actions under this plan would not be expected to have a disproportionate or significant adverse effect
on any low-income or minority populations in the area. Therefore, environmental justice has been
dismissed from further analysis.

Soundscapes
In accordance with NPS Management Policies 2006 and Director’s Order 47: Soundscape Preservation
and Noise Management (NPS 2006, 2000a), an important part of the NPS mission is the preservation of
natural soundscapes associated with parks. The natural ambient soundscape is the aggregate of all the
natural sounds that occur in park units together with the physical capacity for transmitting natural sounds.
The frequencies, magnitudes, and durations of human-caused sound considered acceptable varies, being
generally greater in developed areas and less in undeveloped areas. Some increased recreational use (e.g.,
canoeing/kayaking, fishing, and nature observing) of the Dyke Marsh would be expected as a result of
marsh restoration activities. These activities would result in some level of human-generated noise, but
these levels are generally unobtrusive, with little anticipated effect on wildlife and visitor enjoyment.
Construction activities associated with the restoration of the marsh, such as operating equipment, hauling
material, etc., would result in dissonant, human-caused sounds. However, any noise caused by
construction activities would be temporary and limited in area, with only short-term minor impacts on
soundscapes. Also, the impacts of noise on wildlife and on visitor experience are addressed under the
appropriate impact topics. Therefore, the topic of soundscapes has been dismissed from further analysis.

Health and Safety
During public scoping, concerns were raised about creating additional mosquito habitat and the potential
impact of mosquito-borne viruses on human health and safety. However, any restored marsh area,
including areas west (inland) of Haul Road, would be tidally influenced and flushed regularly, avoiding
the creation of stagnant water where mosquitoes breed. In addition, Dyke Marsh is located within the
flight path of Ronald Reagan National Airport, and concerns were raised about bird strikes by planes
taking off from and landing at the airport as a result of more geese and waterfowl being attracted to Dyke
Marsh. However, the marsh is over 7 miles from the airport, which means that planes will be flying at
several thousand feet above ground level, significantly higher than the typical flight altitude of geese and
other birds frequenting the marsh. Most bird strikes occur within 100 feet of the ground, with 74 percent
of the strikes occurring at 500 feet or less above ground level, where most birds routinely fly unless they
are migrating (Cleary and Dolbeer 2005). Any increase in resident bird populations frequenting the marsh
as a result of restoration would not increase the potential for bird strikes on aircraft. Any impacts on
health and safety would occur during construction activities and would be negligible, because visitors
would be excluded from all construction zones and all construction operations should be following the
appropriate Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations. Therefore, health and safety has
been dismissed from further analysis.

Chapter 1: Purpose of and Need for Action

Socioeconomics
Restoring Dyke Marsh is not expected to have any socioeconomic effects, other than to the Belle Haven
Marina, a concession located at the northern end of the marsh. However, marina related socioeconomic
impacts are discussed in both the visitor use and experience section and the park management and
operations sections in chapter 4. Therefore, socioeconomics has been dismissed from further analysis.

RELATED FEDERAL LAWS, POLICIES, REGULATIONS, AND
PLANS
NPS ORGANIC ACT
By enacting the Organic Act of 1916, Congress directed the U.S. Department of the Interior and the NPS
to manage units of the national park system “to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects
and the wild life therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means
as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations” (16 U.S. Code [USC] 1). The
Redwood National Park Act of 1978 (Redwood Amendment) reiterates this mandate by stating that the
NPS must conduct its actions in a manner that will ensure no “derogation of the values and purposes for
which these various areas have been established, except as may have been or shall be directly and
specifically provided by Congress” (16 USC 1a-1). Congress intended the language of the Redwood
Amendment to reiterate the provisions of the Organic Act, not to create a substantively different
management standard. The House committee report described the Redwood Amendment as a “declaration
by Congress” that the promotion and regulation of the national park system is to be consistent with the
Organic Act. The Senate committee report stated that under the Redwood Amendment, “the Secretary has
an absolute duty, which is not to be compromised, to fulfill the mandate of the 1916 Act to take whatever
actions and seek whatever relief as will safeguard the units of the national park system.” Although the
Organic Act and the Redwood Amendment use different wording (impairment and derogation) to
describe what the NPS must avoid, both acts define a single standard for the management of the national
park system—not two different standards. For simplicity, NPS Management Policies 2006 uses
impairment, not both statutory phrases, to refer to that single standard.
Park managers must also not allow uses that would cause unacceptable impacts. These are impacts that
fall short of impairment, but are still not acceptable within a particular park’s environment. According to
the NPS Management Policies 2006 (NPS 2006, Section 1.4.7, 12), “for the purposes of these policies,
unacceptable impacts are impacts that, individually or cumulatively, would

24



be inconsistent with a park’s purposes or values, or



impede the attainment of a park’s desired future conditions for natural and cultural resources as
identified through the park’s planning process, or



create an unsafe or unhealthful environment for visitors or employees, or



diminish opportunities for current or future generations to enjoy, learn about, or be inspired by
park resources or values, or



unreasonably interfere with
‒

park programs or activities, or

‒

an appropriate use, or

Related Federal Laws, Policies, Regulations, and Plans

‒

the atmosphere of peace and tranquility, or the natural soundscape maintained in wilderness
and natural, historic, or commemorative locations within the park, or

‒

NPS concessioner or contractor operations or services.”

Because park units vary based on their enabling legislation, natural resources, cultural resources, and
missions, management activities appropriate for each unit, and for areas in each unit, vary as well. An
action appropriate in one unit could impair or cause unacceptable impacts to resources in another unit.

NPS MANAGEMENT POLICIES 2006
The introduction to “Chapter 4: Natural Resources Management” of NPS Management Policies 2006
states that parks “will strive to understand, maintain, restore, and protect the inherent integrity of the
natural resources, processes, systems, and values of the parks” and that the NPS “manages the natural
resources of parks to maintain them in an unimpaired condition for present and future generations” (NPS
2006).
The NPS Management Policies 2006 acknowledges that park units are parts of much larger ecosystems
and that parks can contribute to the conservation of regional biodiversity (NPS 2006). Conversely, many
parks cannot meet their natural resource preservation goals without the assistance and collaboration of
neighboring landowners and resources to achieve ecosystem stability and other resource management
objectives. Therefore, Section 4.1.4 of the NPS Management Policies 2006 states that the agency will
pursue cooperative conservation with other agencies, Indian tribes, other traditionally associated people,
and private landowners in accordance with Executive Order 13352, “Facilitation of Cooperative
Conservation.”
Section 4.1.5 (“Restoration of Natural Systems”) of the NPS Management Policies 2006 states that the
NPS will seek to return areas impacted by human disturbances “to the natural conditions and processes
characteristic of the ecological zone in which the damaged resources are situated” and that impacts on
natural systems resulting from human disturbances include, among other things, “changes to hydrologic
patterns and sediment transport…. and the disruption of natural processes” (NPS 2006).
Other sections of the NPS Management Policies 2006 most relevant to this plan/EIS are those that are
directly related to the restoration objectives, particularly those related to managing natural resources,
fostering healthy systems that support native species, and fostering the natural functions of wetlands, such
as providing habitat and providing water quality. These sections include the following:


Section 4.4.1, “General Principles for Managing Biological Resources.” NPS Management
Policies 2006 instructs park units to maintain as parts of the natural ecosystems of parks all native
plants and animals. The NPS achieves this maintenance by “preserving and restoring the natural
abundances, diversities, dynamics, distributions, habitats, and behaviors of native plant and
animal populations and the communities and ecosystems in which they occur.”



Section 4.4.2, “Management of Native Plants and Animals.” NPS Management Policies 2006
states that “whenever possible, natural processes will be relied upon to maintain native plant and
animal species and influence natural fluctuations in populations of these species,” but that the
NPS may intervene to manage individuals or populations of native plants or animals. However,
such management actions shall not cause unacceptable impacts on these populations or on other
components of the ecosystems that support them.



Section 4.4.2.4, “Management of Natural Landscapes.” This section states that landscape and
vegetation conditions altered by human activity, such as Dyke Marsh, may be manipulated where

Final Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and Long-term Management Plan / EIS

25

Chapter 1: Purpose of and Need for Action

the park management plan provides for restoring the lands to a natural condition. There are
several possible actions, including the restoration of “natural processes and conditions to areas
disturbed by human activities”—in this case, the dredging of the marsh.


Section 4.6.5, “Wetlands.” The restoration of wetlands is the principal purpose of this plan/EIS.
The NPS Management Policies 2006 states that the NPS will “preserve and enhance the natural
and beneficial values of wetlands.” The NPS should implement a “no net loss of wetlands policy”
and strive for a “long-term net gain of wetlands across the national park system through
restoration of previously degraded or destroyed wetlands.”

DIRECTOR’S ORDER 12: CONSERVATION PLANNING, ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
ANALYSIS, AND DECISION MAKING AND HANDBOOK
NPS Director’s Order 12 (NPS 2011) and its accompanying handbook (NPS 2001) lay the groundwork
for how the NPS complies with NEPA. Director’s Order 12 and the handbook set forth a planning process
for incorporating scientific and technical information and establishing a solid administrative record for
NPS projects.
NPS Director’s Order 12 requires that impacts on park resources be analyzed in terms of their context,
duration, and intensity. It is crucial for the public and decision makers to understand the implications of
those impacts in the short term and long term, cumulatively, and within context, based on an
understanding and interpretation by resource professionals and specialists. Director’s Order 12 also
requires that an analysis of impairment of park resources and values be made as part of the NEPA
document.

DIRECTOR’S ORDER 77-1: WETLAND PROTECTION
The purpose of Director’s Order 77-1 is to establish NPS policies, requirements, and standards for
implementing Executive Order 11990: “Protection of Wetlands” (42 FR 26961). Executive Order 11990
was issued by President Carter in 1977 in order “…to avoid to the extent possible the long and short term
adverse impacts associated with the destruction or modification of wetlands and to avoid direct or indirect
support of new construction in wetlands wherever there is a practicable alternative…” The USACE
regulates development in wetland areas pursuant to Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (33 CFR, Parts
320–330). NPS Director’s Order 77-1: Wetland Protection and Procedural Manual 77-1 provide NPS
policies and procedures for complying with Executive Order 11990. As stated:
Actions proposed by the NPS that have the potential to have adverse impacts on wetlands
will be addressed in an Environmental Assessment (EA) or an Environmental Impact
Statement (EIS). If the alternative in an EA or EIS will result in adverse impacts on
wetlands, a “Statement of Findings (SOF)” documenting compliance with this Director’s
Order and its implementation procedures will be completed.
NPS Director’s Order 77-1 (NPS 2002) directs that adverse impacts to wetlands be avoided to the extent
practicable, and that unavoidable impacts will be minimized and compensated for with restoration of
degraded wetlands. The restoration of Dyke Marsh is intended to result in mostly beneficial impacts on
wetlands, and the intent of this project is to restore and expand the marsh. However, the placement of the
stone breakwater under the action alternatives is expected to have some long-term adverse impacts on
existing shallow water habitat. BMPs and other conditions specifically identified in the procedural manual
will be followed and less than 0.25 acre of existing marsh will be impacted. Therefore, the project fits
within the exception 4.2.1(h) of the procedural manual and a wetlands statement of findings is not
necessary.

DIRECTOR’S ORDER 77-2: FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT
Director’s Order 77-2: Floodplain Management was issued in response to Executive Order 11988,
Floodplain Management. This order applies to all proposed NPS actions that could adversely affect the
natural resources and functions of floodplains or increase flood risks. This includes those proposed
actions that are functionally dependent upon locations in proximity to the water and for which nonfloodplain sites are not practicable alternatives. Some of the alternatives would raise the base flood
elevation in the area very slightly, but overall the project would protect, restore, and enhance the
functions of the floodplain, and provide additional buffers to the floodplain by restoring wetlands, so a
floodplain statement of findings would not be required.

DIRECTOR’S ORDER 28: CULTURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
This director’s order (NPS 1998a) sets forth the guidelines for the management of cultural resources,
including cultural landscapes, archeological resources, historic and prehistoric structures, museum
objects, and ethnographic resources. This order calls for the NPS to protect and manage cultural resources
in its custody through effective research, planning, and stewardship in accordance with the policies and
principles contained in the NPS Management Policies 2006.

OTHER FEDERAL LEGISLATION, EXECUTIVE ORDERS, COMPLIANCE, AND NATIONAL
PARK SERVICE POLICY
National Environmental Policy Act, 1969, as Amended
NEPA is implemented through regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) (40 CFR
1500–1508). The NPS has in turn adopted procedures to comply with the act and the CEQ regulations, as
found in Director’s Order 12: Conservation Planning, Environmental Impact Analysis, and Decision
Making and its accompanying handbook (NPS 2011, 2001). Section 102(2)(c) of this act requires that an
environmental impact statement (EIS) be prepared for proposed major federal actions that may
significantly affect the quality of the human environment. This act and its amendments are the basis on
which this plan/EIS is being prepared.

National Parks Omnibus Management Act of 1998
The National Parks Omnibus Management Act of 1998 (16 USC 5901 et seq.) underscores NEPA in that
both are fundamental to NPS park management decisions. Both acts provide direction for articulating and
connecting the ultimate resource management decision to the analysis of impacts using appropriate
technical and scientific information. Both also recognize that such data may not be readily available and
provide options for resource impact analysis in this case.
The National Parks Omnibus Management Act directs the NPS to obtain scientific and technical
information for analysis. The NPS handbook for Director’s Order 12 states that if “such information
cannot be obtained due to excessive cost or technical impossibility, the proposed alternative for decision
will be modified to eliminate the action causing the unknown or uncertain impact or other alternatives
will be selected” (NPS 2001).

Chapter 1: Purpose of and Need for Action

Endangered Species Act of 1973, as Amended
This act requires all federal agencies to consult with the Secretary of the Interior on all projects and
proposals with the potential to impact federally endangered or threatened plants and animals. It also
requires federal agencies to use their authorities in furtherance of the purposes of the Endangered Species
Act by carrying out programs for the conservation of endangered and threatened species. Federal agencies
are also responsible for ensuring that any action authorized, funded, or carried out by the agency is not
likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in
the destruction or adverse modification of designated critical habitat.

Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918
The Migratory Bird Treaty Act implements various treaties and conventions between the United States
and Canada, Japan, Mexico, and the former Soviet Union for the protection of migratory birds. Under this
act, it is prohibited, unless permitted by regulations, to “pursue, hunt, take, capture, kill, attempt to take,
capture, or kill, possess, offer for sale, sell, offer to purchase, purchase, deliver for shipment, ship, cause
to be shipped, deliver for transportation, transport, cause to be transported, carry, or cause to be carried by
any means whatever, receive for shipment, transportation or carriage, or export at any time or in any
manner, any migratory bird included in the terms of this Convention…for the protection of migratory
birds…or any part, nest, or egg of any such bird” (16 USC 703).

Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 36 (1992)
Title 36, Chapter 1, of the CFR provides the regulations “for the proper use, management, government,
and protection of persons, property, and natural and cultural resources within areas under the jurisdiction
of the National Park Service” (36 CFR 1.1(a)).

National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as Amended
Section 106 of this act requires federal agencies to consider the effects of their undertakings on properties
listed or potentially eligible for listing on the NRHP. All actions affecting the cultural resources of the
park must comply with this legislation.

Archeological Resources and Protection Act of 1979
The Archeological Resources Protection Act prohibits unauthorized excavation on federal and Indian
lands, establishes standards for permissible excavation, prescribes civil and criminal penalties, requires
agencies to identify archeological sites, and encourages cooperation between federal agencies and private
individuals.

Coastal Zone Management Act 1972, as Amended
The Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) (16 USC 1451 et seq.) seeks to preserve and protect coastal
resources. Through this act, states are encouraged to develop coastal zone management programs
(CZMPs) to allow economic growth that is compatible with the protection of natural resources, the
reduction of coastal hazards, the improvement of water quality, and sensible coastal development. The act
provides financial and technical incentives for coastal states to manage their coastal zones in a manner
consistent with CZMA standards and goals. Section 307 of the act requires that federal agency activities
that affect any land or water use or natural resource of the coastal zone must be consistent to the
maximum extent practicable with the enforceable policies of the state CZMP. Federal agencies and
applicants for federal approvals must consult with state CZMPs and must provide the CZMP with a

28

George Washington Memorial Parkway

Related Federal Laws, Policies, Regulations, and Plans

determination or certification that the activity is consistent with CZMP-enforceable policies, where those
policies will have a possible effect on state coastal resources, as defined by the CZMP and local land use
plans. The proposed restoration of the marsh is within tidal waters and therefore must be consistent to the
extent practicable with the CZMA and the related state and local coastal zone policies and plans.

Clean Water Act of 1972, as Amended
The Clean Water Act is a comprehensive statute aimed at restoring and maintaining the chemical,
physical, and biological integrity of the nation’s waters. Section 404 of this act is administered by the
USACE and regulates the discharge of dredged and fill material to waters of the United States, including
wetlands under federal jurisdiction. The Clean Water Act also requires the establishment of state water
quality standards for surface waters, as well as federal water quality standards, and the development of
guidelines to identify and evaluate the extent of nonpoint-source pollution. Section 401 of the act, “Water
Quality Certification,” gives states the authority to review projects that must obtain federal licenses or
permits and that result in a discharge to state waters. The purpose of the water quality certification is to
ensure that a project will comply with state water quality standards and other appropriate requirements of
state law, and it is required for any project that also requires a USACE Section 404 wetland permit, such
as this plan does.

Executive Order 13112, “Invasive Species”
Executive Order 13112, signed on February 3, 1999, established the National Invasive Species Council to
prevent the introduction of invasive species and provide for their control, and to minimize the economic,
ecological, and human health impacts that invasive species cause. The council is responsible for
establishing guidelines to ensure projects undertaken or funded by federal agencies minimize the spread
of invasive species. The executive order directed the council to develop a national-level invasive species
management plan. The plan has served as the framework for management of invasive species in the
United States.

Executive Order 13186, “Responsibilities of Federal Agencies to Protect Migratory Birds”
Migratory birds are of great ecological and economic value to this country and to other countries. They
contribute to biological diversity and bring tremendous enjoyment to millions of people who study,
watch, feed, or hunt these birds throughout the United States and other countries. The United States has
recognized the critical importance of this shared resource by ratifying international, bilateral conventions
for the conservation of migratory birds. Such conventions include the Convention for the Protection of
Migratory Birds with Great Britain on behalf of Canada 1916, the Convention for the Protection of
Migratory Birds and Game Mammals–Mexico 1936, the Convention for the Protection of Birds and Their
Environment–Japan 1972, and the Convention for the Conservation of Migratory Birds and Their
Environment–Union of Soviet Socialist Republics 1978. These migratory bird conventions impose
substantive obligations on the United States for the conservation of migratory birds and their habitats, and
through the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the United States has implemented these migratory bird
conventions with respect to the United States. This executive order directs executive departments and
agencies to take certain actions to further implement the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.

Executive Order 13508, “Chesapeake Bay Protection and Restoration”
This executive order and supporting reports (Federal Leadership Committee for the Chesapeake Bay
2009, 2010) direct federal agencies to lead the effort in restoring and protecting the Chesapeake Bay.
Federal agencies will share federal leadership, planning, and accountability while restoring Chesapeake
Bay water quality, developing agricultural practices to protect the Chesapeake Bay, reduce water

pollution from federal lands and facilities, and protect Chesapeake Bay as the climate changes. Agencies
will also assist in expanding public access to the Chesapeake Bay and conserve landscapes and
ecosystems, monitoring and decision support for ecosystem management, and identifying living resources
protection and restoration. Key goals are the restoration of 4,000 acres of wetlands per year, to reach
30,000 acres by 2025, and wetlands enhancement goals of 10,000 acres per year, for a total of 150,000
acres by 2025. The restoration of Dyke Marsh contributes directly to both of these goals.

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER PARK PLANNING DOCUMENTS, POLICIES, AND ACTIONS
2005 George Washington Memorial Parkway Long-range Interpretive Plan
There is no current general management plan or resource management plan for the parkway. The 2005
George Washington Memorial Parkway Long-range Interpretive Plan (NPS 2005b) is used in this EIS as
a guiding document and serves several purposes: it serves as an interpretive document for the various
units of the park, acts as a guide for visitor use and experience, and sets forth the major interpretive
themes for the entire parkway, which ultimately will inform all projects that occur within any of the
parkway units. There are individual plans for each of the parkway’s management units, including Dyke
Marsh.

Superintendent’s Compendium, George Washington Memorial Parkway (2007)
The compendium for the George Washington Memorial Parkway exercises the discretionary authority of
the superintendent of the park to manage permits, closures, and other restrictions within the park. The
compendium also serves as the rules governing the park and directs management plans and other actions.
Provisions for the protection of natural and cultural resources within the specific management units are
enumerated in the compendium.

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER STATE AND LOCAL PLANNING DOCUMENTS, POLICIES, AND
ACTIONS
Chesapeake Bay Agreements
In 1983 and 1987, the states of Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania; the District of Columbia; the
Chesapeake Bay Commission; and the USEPA signed agreements that established the Chesapeake Bay
Program to protect and restore the Chesapeake Bay’s ecosystem. This agreement committed to living
resource protection and restoration, vital habitat protection and restoration, water quality protection and
restoration, sound land use, and stewardship and community engagement. In June of 2000, the parties
listed above signed Chesapeake 2000, a new agreement for the restoration of the Chesapeake Bay
(Chesapeake Bay Program 2000). The signatories pledged to implement over 100 specific actions
designed to restore the health of the bay and its living resources. This plan includes a goal to restore
25,000 acres of both tidal and nontidal wetlands. Activities on federal land must be consistent with the
provisions of this agreement. A newly signed 2014 agreement continues goals from previous agreements,
including wetland restoration and water quality goals (Chesapeake Bay Program 2014).

Virginia Coastal Resources Program
The Virginia Coastal Resources Program is a network of programs administered by a number of agencies
and is the state’s program under the federal CZMA. Pertinent programs and laws relate to wetlands
management, subaqueous lands management, and sediment and erosion control, in addition to stormwater
management and point-source pollution control, which do not apply in the case of Dyke Marsh. Federal

30

Related Federal Laws, Policies, Regulations, and Plans

actions that can have reasonably foreseeable effects on Virginia’s coastal resources or uses must be
consistent with this program. Federal agencies must obtain all applicable permits and approvals listed
under the enforceable policies of the program prior to commencing any project that would affect coastal
resources. Further discussion of the specific programs follows.
Virginia Floodplain Development Regulations
Floodplain development in Virginia is governed by Code 10.1-602, “Floodplain Code,” and 44 CFR 60.1,
“Criteria for Land Management and Use.” The Floodplain Code and Criteria for Land Management and
Use set forth several strategies to prevent or mitigate flood damage. When development is proposed in
flood hazard areas the following measures are required:


permits



review of the proposed development



review of permit applications to determine whether development will be reasonably safe from
flooding



water supply systems that are designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into
the systems



sanitary sewage systems that are designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters
into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters



development that is engineered and designed to prevent hazards associated with flooding.

Uses not permitted in the floodplain include structures intended for human habitation; storage of materials
that are buoyant, flammable, explosive, or injurious to human, animal, plant, fish, or other aquatic life;
sewage systems or wells; solid or hazardous waste disposal facilities; wastewater treatment ponds or
facilities except as otherwise permitted by Virginia Administrative Code; and filling that would cause an
obstruction to flow that is not otherwise permitted. Activities allowed in the floodplain must meet the
following criteria: (1) there must be no rise in the base flood elevation and (2) the activities must relate to
certain structures necessary to open space or historical areas and campgrounds. The Dyke Marsh project
would affect the floodplain, but it is not an activity that involves the placement of structures in the
floodplain.
Virginia Water Control Law
Virginia has received authority from the USEPA to implement the requirements of the federal Clean
Water Act, including setting water quality standards, designating uses, and implementing the National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit programs. Virginia’s Water Control Law is the vehicle by
which the protection of high-quality state waters is mandated. The law also provides for the restoration of
all other state waters so they will allow reasonable public uses and will support the growth of aquatic life.
The Water Control Law frames how state water quality standards are derived and outlines the designated
uses for the waters of the commonwealth.
Virginia Endangered Plant and Insect Species Act (1979)
The Endangered Plant and Insect Species Act, Chapter 10, Sections 3.2-1000–1011 of the Code of
Virginia, as amended, mandates that the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services
conserve, protect, and manage endangered and threatened species of plants and insects. Program
personnel cooperate with the USFWS, the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation (VA

DCR), Division of Natural Heritage, and other agencies and organizations on the recovery, protection, or
conservation of listed threatened or endangered species and designated plant and insect species that are
rare throughout their worldwide ranges. The Virginia Departments of Game and Inland Fisheries and
Agriculture and Consumer Services share legal authority for endangered and threatened species and are
responsible for their conservation in Virginia. A third state agency, the VA DCR, Division of Natural
Heritage, produces an inventory of the commonwealth’s natural resources and maintains a data bank of
ecologically significant sites.
Virginia Chesapeake Bay Preservation Act (1988)
The Virginia Chesapeake Bay Preservation Act requires that the counties, cities, and towns near tidal
waters in the commonwealth incorporate general water quality protection measures into their
comprehensive plans, zoning ordinances, and subdivision ordinances. It also requires that Chesapeake
Bay Preservation Areas be defined and protected. It is the policy of the NPS to consider the local laws
during the planning process and comply with them to the extent possible.
Virginia Erosion and Sediment Control Law
The goal of the state erosion and sediment control program is to control soil erosion, sedimentation, and
nonagricultural runoff from regulated land-disturbing activities to prevent the degradation of property and
natural resources. The regulations behind the law specify minimum standards, which include criteria,
techniques, and policies that must be followed on all regulated activities. The Department of Conservation
and Recreation Erosion and Sediment Control Program oversees state and federal activities such as would
occur during Dyke Marsh restoration activities.

Maryland Coastal Zone Management Program
The Potomac River is under the jurisdiction of the State of Maryland to the shoreline on the Virginia side
of the river. Although the restoration work in Dyke Marsh is planned within Virginia waters, the project
should undergo coordination and consultation with Maryland. As with Virginia’s program, Maryland’s
CZMP requires a consistency determination for all federal actions within designated coastal zone areas
and tidal waters.

Maryland Wetlands and Waterways and Water Management Programs
Like Virginia, Maryland has been granted authority to implement the requirements of the Clean Water
Act and to protect and manage tidal and nontidal waters and wetlands. The Wetlands and Waterways
Program at the Maryland Department of the Environment regulates all activities within Maryland waters
and wetlands. The Water Management Program, also within the Maryland Department of the
Environment, regulates discharge into Maryland waterways and water quality. Although the restoration
would occur in Virginia waters, coordination with this Maryland program should occur.

Fairfax County Chesapeake Bay Preservation Ordinance and Policy, 1993, as Amended
Following from the Virginia Chesapeake Bay Preservation Act, the county ordinance has been passed,
according to Section 118-5, “Purpose and Intent,” to “encourage and promote (1) the protection of
existing high-quality state waters, (2) the restoration of all other state waters to a condition or quality that
will permit all reasonable public uses and will support the propagation and growth of all aquatic life…,
(3) the safeguarding of the clean waters of the commonwealth from pollution, (4) the prevention of any
increase in pollution, (5) the reduction of existing pollution, and (6) water resource conservation in order

to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the present and future citizens of Fairfax County and the
Commonwealth of Virginia.”
Under this ordinance, all tidal wetlands, such as in Dyke Marsh, have been designated “Resource
Protection Areas.” Disturbance and development activity in such areas is subject to county review.
Indigenous vegetation is encouraged, as is minimization of disturbed area and impervious surfaces.
Although no structures would be likely to be built for the proposed restoration, review would still be
required.

Fairfax County Wetlands Zoning Ordinance and Wetlands Board
The lands between mean low and mean high tide are subject to the Fairfax County Wetland Zoning
Ordinance, and disturbance in these areas requires a permit from the county’s Wetlands Board. The board
works in close coordination with state and federal agencies in the determination of the need for permits
and the appropriateness of activities. The Fairfax County Wetlands Board issues permits for all shoreline
activities that may impact vegetated or nonvegetated wetland areas along the shoreline in Fairfax County.
The Wetlands Board considers whether or not alteration or stabilization of the shoreline is warranted
based on the guidelines of the Virginia Marine Resources Commission. The goal of the board, through the
public hearing and permitting process, is “to…protect public and private property…and the natural
environment, [by] preserving wetlands wherever possible…and to accommodate development in a
manner consistent with wetlands preservation.” As with other local and state regulations, the NPS
considers local laws in the planning process.

Alternatives

CHAPTER 2: ALTERNATIVES
This chapter describes the various actions that could be implemented to restore and provide long-term
management of Dyke Marsh Wildlife Preserve (Dyke Marsh). National Environmental Policy Act
(NEPA) requires federal agencies to explore a range of reasonable alternatives and to analyze what
impacts the alternatives could have on the human environment, which the act defines as the natural and
physical environment and the relationship of people with that environment. The analysis of impacts from
these alternatives is presented in “Chapter 4: Environmental Consequences,” and the conclusions are
presented in the summary of environmental consequences later in this chapter.
Alternatives are developed by working from the purpose of and need for action statements in “Chapter 1:
Purpose of and Need for Action,” as well as the objectives statements, also in chapter 1; gathering public
input; and informing the process with sound scientific and technical data. Alternatives must meet the
project objectives to a large degree and address the reason for this Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and
Long-term Management Plan / Environmental Impact Statement (plan/EIS). Alternatives must fall within
stated constraints, including compliance with National Park Service (NPS) policies. They also must be
based on environmental differences and not technical, logistical, or economic differences.
The alternatives under consideration must include a “no-action” alternative, as prescribed by NEPA
regulations in 40 CFR 1502.14. The no-action alternative is the alternative in which existing conditions
and trends are projected into the future without any substantive changes in management. In this
document, the no-action alternative is the continuation of current management activities in Dyke Marsh,
without any modifications to hydrologic conditions or restoration of marsh vegetation.

ALTERNATIVES DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
The alternatives development process ensured that the scientific and technical feasibility of marsh
restoration approaches were explored and important elements of the restoration were identified. Desired
outcomes and objectives were established and used in the development of the alternatives.
A science team that consisted of experts from the NPS, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), and academics with extensive knowledge of Dyke Marsh met
several times to discuss marsh restoration and possible alternatives. It was decided at an early alternatives
development meeting that more information was needed on hydrology and current conditions before
alternatives could be finalized. The NPS then engaged the USACE to further update the bathymetry for
the marsh, conduct hydrologic modeling, and develop conceptual alternatives based on the outcome of the
models. The public and science team provided feedback during the planning process. Because these
action alternatives would be technically and economically feasible, and show evidence of common sense,
they are considered reasonable (CEQ 1981). In addition, the USGS also completed research on erosion in
the marsh that informed the development of alternatives (Litwin et al. 2011). That report is discussed in
more detail in chapters 1 and 3.
The USACE performed 1- and 2-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling, sediment transport modeling, and
examined how different alternative scenarios would affect the hydrologic regime in the marsh, deflect
some of the erosive energies of the river during storms, and encourage sediment deposition in the
restoration areas of the marsh.

Final Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and Long-term Management Plan / EIS

35

Chapter 2: Alternatives

The USACE then prepared a conceptual design for each of the alternatives, proposed phasing for
containment cells and types of materials that would be used, and reviewed these alternatives with the NPS
through a series of meetings. These alternatives were presented to the public at a public meeting in May,
2012. Comments from this meeting further informed the alternatives.
In September 2013, the NPS conducted a Choosing by Advantages / Value Analysis workshop to identify
a preferred alternative by determining which alternative offered the most advantages for the best value.
The discussions and analysis at the workshop led to further refinement of the alternatives that had been
previously presented to the public in May 2012. One alternative was dismissed because it was redundant
with the elements of another alternative, and elements of two alternatives were combined to create a new
alternative that had more advantages than what was previously presented. Alternatives and alternative
elements that were dismissed are discussed in the “Alternatives Considered but Dismissed from Further
Detailed Analysis” section in this chapter.

INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW OF ALTERNATIVES
This chapter describes the alternatives developed by the interdisciplinary team for this plan/EIS.
Restoration alternatives include actions to restore hydrologic conditions and marsh vegetation as well as
strategies for long-term management of the marsh. In addition, this chapter provides background
information used in determining the restoration alternatives and the long-term management actions
considered in this plan/EIS. The chapter provides a summary of adaptive management approaches and
benchmarking metrics, discusses alternatives considered but dismissed, and identifies the NPS preferred
and environmentally preferable alternative. The alternatives were developed to a 10 percent design
completion, a level typical for completion of NEPA analyses for design and construction projects.
The alternatives carried forward for detailed analysis are briefly summarized below.
Alternative A: No Action—Under this alternative, there would be no restoration. Current management
of the marsh would continue, which includes providing basic maintenance related to the Haul Road,
control of nonnative invasive plant species, ongoing interpretive and environmental education activities,
scientific research projects, boundary marking, and enforcement of existing regulations. There would be
no manipulation of the marsh other than emergency, safety-related, or limited improvements or
maintenance actions. The destabilized marsh would continue to erode at an accelerated rate (Litwin et al.
2011).
Alternative B: Hydrologic Restoration and Minimal Wetland Restoration—Under alternative B, the
focus is on the most essential actions that would reestablish hydrologic conditions that shield the marsh
from erosive currents and protect the Hog Island Gut channel and channel wall. A breakwater structure
would be constructed on the south end of the marsh, in alignment with the northernmost extent of the
historic promontory, and wetlands would be restored to wherever the water is less than 4 feet deep. This
alternative also includes fill of some deep channels near the breakwater. The final element of this
alternative is the reestablishment of hydrologic connections to the inland side of the Haul Road to restore
bottomland swamp forest areas that were cut off when the Haul Road was constructed. Approximately 30
acres west of the Haul Road could be influenced by tidal flows as a result. These actions would not
necessarily happen in any particular order, and may be dictated by available funds. However, it is
assumed that the breakwater would be constructed first. This alternative would create approximately 70
acres of various new wetland habitats and allow the continued natural accretion of soils and establishment
of wetlands given the new hydrologic conditions.

36

George Washington Memorial Parkway

Alternative A: No Action

Alternative C: Hydrologic Restoration and Fullest Possible Extent of Wetland Restoration
(Preferred Alternative)—Under alternative C, the marsh would be restored in a phased approach up to
the historic boundary of the marsh and other adjacent areas within NPS jurisdictional boundaries, except
for the area immediately adjacent to the marina. The initial phase would install a breakwater, fill the deep
channels within the park, establish marsh in the outline of the historic promontory, and restore marsh
along the existing edge to the negative 4-foot contour (approximately 40 acres) to stabilize the marsh and
protect Hog Island Gut. Future phases would continue marsh restoration until a sustainable marsh is
achieved and meets the overall goals of the project, and breaks would be installed to reintroduce tidal
flows west of the Haul Road. The outer edges of the containment cell structures would be placed at the
park boundary in the river. Restoration of 16 acres of wetlands south of the breakwater is also included as
an option. Approximately 180 acres of various wetland habitats could be created overall.

ALTERNATIVE A: NO ACTION
Under alternative A, no restoration would occur, and the marsh would be managed as it is currently,
including providing basic maintenance related to the Haul Road, controlling non-native invasive plant
species, and enforcing existing regulations (table 2-1 lists management actions). There would be no
manipulation of the marsh other than emergency, safety-related, or limited improvements or maintenance
actions. The destabilized marsh would continue to erode at an accelerated rate (Litwin et al. 2011).
Current management actions that would continue to be implemented include continuation of scientific
research and evaluation in the marsh and continuation of management of nonnative invasive plants.
Educational and interpretive activities would continue to inform the public about marsh ecology and
natural processes in the marsh. Cooperation with various entities, such as the group “Friends of Dyke
Marsh,” would continue.

IMPLEMENTATION COSTS—ALTERNATIVE A
Costs related to the no-action alternative include costs for oversight or participation in monitoring, data
management, and research activities; management and coordination of activities such as educational and
interpretive activities, enforcement of existing regulations that would protect the marsh, and facilities
management related to the park. Annual cost for these activities can range in value, but have been about
$16,000 per year over the past several years (Steury, pers. comm. 2013).

Description
Currently several ongoing monitoring and research efforts are taking place in Dyke
Marsh. These activities would continue, although they might be modified as necessary,
and new studies might be added after being approved and permitted by the NPS.
Research activities include the following:
 Conduct NPS-initiated research concerning marsh ecology, as well as hydrology
and water levels.
 Cooperate with other government, university, and non-government organization
research. Examples of these types of research at Dyke Marsh include sediment
elevation tables, vegetation studies, fish and wildlife studies, bird counts and
breeding bird surveys, and cultural and social science research studies related to
environmental compliance.
 Conduct other research as funded (e.g., National Science Foundation Grant to
Katia Engelhardt at University of Maryland). This research is looking at the
feedback between tidal marsh geomorphology and ecology. The goal of the
research is to forecast the impact of sea level rise on tidal freshwater marsh
diversity, sediment dynamics, and the maintenance of marsh surfaces.

ELEMENTS COMMON TO BOTH ACTION ALTERNATIVES
Several elements are common to both action alternatives (i.e., alternatives B and C). These include the
creation of a breakwater structure in the general historic location of the promontory at the south end of the
marsh that provided protection from waves during strong storms, and filling the deep channels within the
park boundary just north of the historic promontory. Other common elements include the approaches to
construction of containment cells, achievement of natural edges on the outer perimeter of restored marsh
area, creation of breaks in the Haul Road to hydrologically reconnect the former bottomland swamp forest
with tidal flows, and approach to vegetation reestablishment. It is also expected that the research,

Elements Common to Both Action Alternatives

maintenance, invasive plant control, enforcement, and educational actions described under the no-action
alternative (alternative A) would continue under all of the action alternatives. In addition, issues related to
sea level rise and appropriate elevations for the containment cell fill will be considered during the design
stage. This will ensure that the marsh restoration will be able to accommodate rising water levels over
time.
Finally, the park would implement public education and public awareness activities to explain the
restoration, the reason for restoration, and what can be expected during and after construction.

GENERAL CONSTRUCTION APPROACH
Construction would take place from the water to the greatest extent possible, using marine construction
equipment. Material would be brought in by barge and stored on the barges. There would be little, if any,
need for staging areas on land in the park.

BREAKWATER STRUCTURE AT LOCATION OF HISTORIC PROMONTORY
All of the action alternatives include the construction of a breakwater structure in the historic location of
the promontory that was dredged and, as a result, altered the hydrology of the marsh. Construction of the
breakwater in that area would redirect erosive flows in the marsh, particularly during strong storms, and
would reestablish hydrologic conditions that would encourage sediment accretion (Litwin et al. 2011;
USACE 2013).
One of the most prominent and important features of the Dyke Marsh system is the large tidal gut, Hog
Island Gut. The gut once meandered through the marsh with its mouth facing in a northerly direction.
Direct dredge mining and erosion of the marsh has removed the promontory and other wetlands that
created the bend in the tidal gut channel, and it now empties to the south and downstream, thereby
increasing its vulnerability to erosion and channel widening within the gut channel itself (Litwin et al.
2011). The USACE models indicate that establishment of a breakwater just downstream of the current
mouth of the gut would both protect the gut by introducing a bend in the channel and would also redirect
flows and encourage sediment accretion. Therefore, a breakwater structure is included in both action
alternatives.
Under alternative B, the breakwater would be placed on historic northern edge of the promontory, close to
the historic edge of Hog Island Gut, forcing flows in the gut to turn to the north, as this channel once did.
No other restoration would be associated with the breakwater. It would extend into the river about a half
of the distance that the original promontory extended into the river.
Under alternative C, the breakwater would be aligned with the historic southern edge of the promontory,
and emergent marsh would be created within the outline of the historic promontory to the north of the
breakwater (figure 2-1).
The breakwater structure would be constructed of armorstone or riprap to create a stone breakwater.
Armorstone boulders are typically larger than 2,000 pounds each, and Class III riprap is smaller rock,
which in Virginia ranges from 500 to 1,500 pounds (Chesapeake Materials 2013). A stone breakwater
would be constructed in a trapezoidal shape. The side slopes of the stone would be approximately 2:1
from the top of the breakwater to the river bottom elevation, including at the end section (figures 2-2 and
2-3). It is expected that the stone would be brought in by barge and placed from the water. The use of
stones was selected for analysis over other options because it would have the most natural appearance and
a relatively low need for maintenance over time.

Maximum bottom width of stone breakwater is: northern boundary – 58 feet and southern

DEEP CHANNEL FILL WITHIN NPS BOUNDARIES
All action alternatives include fill in the deep channel assumed to be formed by dredging (Litwin et al.
2011) just north of the historic extent of the promontory in an area that is approximately 12.6 acres (see
figures 2-7 and 2-8 later in this chapter for the location of these channels). The deep channel fill would
help to reestablish some of the hydrologic conditions conducive to accretion rather than erosion. The
channels would be filled with larger material (gravel or larger), and placement of fill in the channels
would be delivered to the site via barge. The backhoe equipment would use sonar and Global Positioning
System (GPS) coordinates to deposit the material in the appropriate areas.

41

Chapter 2: Alternatives

CONSTRUCTION APPROACH FOR CONTAINMENT CELLS
The restored marsh would be constructed using a series of containment cells that would be filled with
hydraulic slurry using clean fill that has been tested. Dredge material used for fill would be evaluated by
the USACE for level of contaminants, particle or grain size, and consolidation rates. Only clean fill will
be used for construction of the containment cells, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. The
particle size and consolidation testing will ensure the fill is appropriate for the site and will develop
characteristics of marsh soils and sediments over time that can support vegetation. A containment cell is a
structure placed in the open water that allows for fill to be placed inside to raise the elevation of the river
bed. Depending on the location of the cells, a variety of materials would be used to construct the
containment cell walls. Although several cells, especially those within the 4-foot depth contour, would be
smaller to address specific situations, larger cells would be generally used, although the NPS would adjust
size and configurations of the containment cells to address design and construction constraints. Phasing of
the restoration would generally target filling cells adjacent to vulnerable areas, such as next to the channel
wall of Hog Island Gut, and areas immediately along the shoreline first, and then work outward toward
the river channel.
Staked-in-place hay bales or coir biologs would be used as
containment cell walls for cells that are closer to shore, in shallower
water, and more protected from wave action or flow. Hay bales
secured with stakes can be placed in more protected water up to 4
feet deep before it becomes difficult to stabilize them against the
current (USACE 2013). These biodegradable options would last
long enough for construction to be completed, the fill to settle, and
the marsh to establish itself. Similar materials also might be used if
internal subdivisions are needed within a larger containment cell
with harder outer edges.

Coir biologs are tubes or logs
made of coir or coconut fiber
bound by high strength twisted coir
netting that provide attenuation of
wave energy in shallow places;
over time, the logs will degrade.

Steel sheet piling would be used to protect the containment cells
Geotextile tubes are large tubes
during restoration for cells that are further into the river in deeper
water and are more exposed to flow and wave action. Sand-filled
made from high strength fabric
geotextile tubes might also be used in select areas (geotextile tubes
filled with sand slurry; they can be

after restoration. The sheet piling would be configured to allow
intertidal exchange when installed, or cut or perforated once the fill
has been placed but before any planting takes place to begin to allow the development of a seed bank
(figure 2-4). Once all restoration activities are complete, the sheet piling would be removed, cut, or driven
into the river bed so the result would be a soft edge to the marsh. Plans addressing intertidal exchange
would be developed in greater detail at later stages of design.
Vinyl sheet piling might be used for containment cells that are located in only slightly deeper water,
where hay bales would not be sturdy enough but steel sheet piling would not be necessary. As with the
steel sheet piling, the vinyl sheet piling would be installed from the water using pile drivers or vibrating
equipment. The vinyl piling would be cut or driven into the river bed when the restoration activities are
complete. A list of all options for containment cell materials is shown in table 2-3.

Chapter 2: Alternatives

NATURAL EDGES ON THE OUTERMOST EXTENT OF THE CONTAINMENT CELLS
Whichever alternative is selected for implementation, the outermost edge of the restored marsh (the edge
furthest from the shore) would be designed to be a soft, natural edge without noticeable armoring or sheet
piling. Achieving a soft, natural edge would require that the outermost containment cell not be completely
filled and be designed so the toe of the slope is at the outermost wall of the containment cell at the NPS
boundary. Emergent marsh vegetation would not be established all the way to the edge of this cell
because the slope and increasing water depth would not support emergent marsh vegetation throughout
the cell (figure 2-5). However, it is likely that submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) would become
established in the deeper waters riverward of the emergent marsh. Based on the conceptual design, a
possible approach would be to place some sort of barrier, such as riprap or armorstone, geotextile tubes,
or possibly coir biologs, in increments back from the sheet piling so that the area on the lee side of the
barriers would be at an approximate 20:1 slope, and the outside of the barriers would be closer to a 3:1
slope where the fill material has been allowed to slump over the barriers. In some places where the outer
channel is particularly deep, the toe of the steeper slope may need to be hardened. Vegetation would be
established at the appropriate elevations, with plants such as yellow pond-lily (Nuphar lutea) in deeper
areas and narrowleaf cattail (Typha angustifolia) in shallower areas. SAV would likely become
established on its own in the deeper water. Where the toe is hardened, the 20:1 slope would be extended
as far out as possible to maximize the areas where SAV would be able to become established.

FIGURE 2-5. CONCEPTUAL ELEVATION DRAWING OF THE OUTER CONTAINMENT CELL TO ACHIEVE SOFT,
NATURAL EDGES

To achieve natural edges for the newly created tidal guts, the openings and the beginnings of the channels
would be cut mechanically, and additional guts would be allowed to form naturally over time. The walls
of the tidal gut mouths would be stabilized with biodegradable materials until the guts reach equilibrium.

APPROACHES TO VEGETATION REESTABLISHMENT
Both of the action alternatives include some degree of marsh reestablishment. Use of vegetation
appropriate to the elevation (water depth) within the containment cells is an important component of the
44

George Washington Memorial Parkway

Elements Common to Both Action Alternatives

restoration process. Several options can be used, depending on factors such as available seed sources, type
of wetlands desired in a cell, available plant material, and cost constraints. These options include allowing
plants to establish naturally by seed or other propagules, seeding mudflats, or transplanting plugs of
nursery plants. Revegetation activities could be conducted by NPS staff, contractors, or volunteers. The
NPS would prepare the planting plans. Plant species used for the plantings would include narrowleaf
cattail, river bulrush (Bolboschoenus fluviatilis) if available, wild rice (Zizania aquatica), jewelweed
(Impatiens capensis), arrow arum (Peltandra virginica), pickerel weed (Pontederia cordata), and yellow
pond-lily, among others. It is expected that SAV would volunteer and become established on its own
where appropriate depths and other conditions exist.
In addition, goose exclosures would be used to prevent herbivory by geese. Exclosures consist of stakes
placed around the edges of the restored marsh, with strings stretched between the stakes and flagged so
they are visible by birds and other wildlife (figure 2-6). The strings would be placed at intervals that
prevent geese from landing between them, and the areas would be surrounded by plastic or wire mesh
fencing. Costs for vegetation reestablishment would vary depending on the type of planting strategy used,
and the type of labor used.

FIGURE 2-6. EXAMPLE OF GOOSE EXCLOSURES AT ANACOSTIA PARK, WASHINGTON, DC

With regard to nonnative invasive vegetation, the NPS would monitor for and remove nonnative invasive
species according to methods described in the National Invasive Species Management Plan (NISC 2008).

WASHINGTON GAS PIPELINE
A Washington Gas pipeline, buried beneath the river bottom, passes through the project area for both
action alternatives (figures 2-7 and 2-8), near the area of the historic promontory. As discussed in chapter
3, the pipeline is grandfathered from a permit issued to Washington Gas in 1961. The NPS will work with
Washington Gas to ensure appropriate construction practices are used so that vibrations in the vicinity of
the pipeline are minimized and there are no adverse impacts to the pipeline. Washington Gas has provided
a list of mitigation measures, including specific requirements for pile driving and minimum distances to
ensure that the northern promontory and sheet piling do not impact the gas line during construction. There
would be no expected impacts on the gas line after construction is completed.

REESTABLISH HYDROLOGICAL CONNECTIONS TO THE INLAND SIDE OF THE HAUL
ROAD
All action alternatives include the reintroduction of tidal flows to both sides of the Haul Road via the
installation of culverts or bridges. Reintroduction of intertidal exchange would encourage reestablishment
of a floodplain swamp forest and facilitate the management of nonnative invasive vegetation species that
have established in the area. Although the configuration and materials used for the culverts and bridges
would be determined later in the design process, it is likely that two to three breaks would be introduced
in the road, although the final design will determine the exact number. Contractors would use heavy
equipment, such as a backhoe, to cut each break in the road. To minimize disturbance of individual sites,
contractors would work backwards out of the Haul Road toward the marina driveway. Contractors would
prepare the site, install a bridge or concrete box culvert, and move toward the marina driveway to install
the next break. The road would be reestablished over the breaks, and would continue to serve as a trail to
the marsh after construction is complete. Appropriate sediment and erosion control practices would be
used, and the removal of trees, should removal be necessary, would be mitigated by planting new native
trees or possibly other appropriate native vegetation in the disturbed area.

ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT APPROACHES INCLUDED IN THE
ACTION ALTERNATIVES
Adaptive management is used when there are clearly defined desirable outcomes to a project, but there is
uncertainty or incomplete information to ensure that the outcome will be achieved. According to a
Department of the Interior technical guide on adaptive management prepared for its bureaus and agencies
(Williams, Szaro, and Shapiro 2007), adaptive management is
a systematic approach for improving resource management by learning from management
outcomes…An adaptive approach involves exploring ways to meet management
objectives, predicting the outcomes of alternatives based on the current state of
knowledge, implementing one or more of these alternatives, monitoring to learn about the
impacts of management actions, and then using the results to update knowledge and
adjust management actions. Adaptive management focuses on learning and adapting,
through partnerships of managers, scientists, and other stakeholders who learn together
how to create and maintain sustainable resource systems…
Adaptive management will be a key element in the implementation of all the action alternatives in this
plan/EIS. Marsh restoration would be phased, and there are many factors that could affect the success of
this restoration project, contributing to uncertainty. Adaptive management would be useful in this
planning effort to make adjustments to vegetation establishment, manage nonnative invasive species
throughout the marsh, and track the overall restoration approach to ensure restoration is successful.

Adaptive management frameworks describe the initial actions being taken, metrics used to ensure
objectives are being met, monitoring actions to be taken, and subsequent actions that would be taken if
monitoring indicates the objectives are not being met. The adaptive management framework for this
project is discussed in detail in appendix A, and focuses on key indicators of success. The plan would
establish baseline preconstruction conditions, monitor postconstruction conditions, and compare
conditions to control sites or reference marsh. The marsh at Piscataway Park on the Potomac River would
be used as a control site and reference marsh. The marshes at Piscataway Park were selected because they
are on the Potomac River and are freshwater tidal marshes with similar vegetation. They contain
hydrologic historic conditions similar to the conditions at Dyke Marsh. The park is also part of the
national park system; decisions relating to marsh management would be similar, and research could be
readily conducted and overseen by the NPS. The NPS would monitor vegetation establishment (amount
of vegetation and species types), elevation, and rates of erosion or accretion. Vegetation in the newly
created marsh should be approximately the same as what is currently in the existing marsh or in the
reference control marsh at Piscataway Park, a limit on nonnative species (in terms of percentage of
overall vegetation) would be established, and nonnative species would be removed upon discovery.
Characteristics such as elevation, erosion, and accretion would be monitored to make sure the breakwater
and other changes are working as expected. Hydrology and salinity would also be monitored.
Observations of SAV would be made as opportunities arise.

ALTERNATIVE B: HYDROLOGIC RESTORATION AND
MINIMAL WETLAND RESTORATION
Alternative B would achieve a minimal level of marsh restoration, and focuses on the most essential
actions to reestablish hydrologic conditions that would shield the marsh from erosive currents and protect
the Hog Island Gut channel and channel wall.
A breakwater structure would be constructed just south of the historic Hog Island Gut channel, in
alignment with the northern extent of the historic promontory. No additional marsh would be created
within the historic extent of promontory.
North of the breakwater, wetlands would be restored in the areas where current water depth is 4 feet or
less (the outer extent of which is shown as the negative 4-foot contour line on plans) and would be phased
so that containment cells would first be placed along the weakest areas of the Hog Island Gut channel
identified in the USGS study (Litwin et al. 2011). The USGS has identified several points in the channel
as being particularly susceptible to breaching, and these areas would be the first ones to be protected with
new wetland cells. The remaining cells would be constructed in the areas less susceptible to breaching. In
addition, the deep channel areas adjacent to the historic promontory and the proposed breakwater would
be filled. The final element of this alternative would include the reestablishment of hydrologic
connections to the inland side of the Haul Road to restore bottomland swamp forest areas that were cut off
when the Haul Road was constructed.
Overall, work would be phased so that initial restoration would provide the most benefits and protection,
and would allow future stages to build upon the initial benefits. Generally, construction of the breakwater
and possibly the deep channel fill would take place first, to protect the marsh restoration area and Hog
Island Gut. This would be followed by protection of the weakening outer walls of Hog Island Gut,
particularly where there is danger of breaching.
Implementation of this alternative would create up to approximately 70 new acres of wetland habitat of
various types, including approximately 25 acres of restored marsh, and allow the continued natural
accretion of soils and establishment of wetlands due to the restored hydrologic conditions (figure 2-7).

Chapter 2: Alternatives

IMPLEMENTATION COSTS—ALTERNATIVE B
Implementation costs include several elements, including mobilization and demobilization, earthwork cut
and fill for the proposed marsh, deep channel fill, the breakwater, using the cost for the more expensive
riprap construction, hay bales, and vegetation. With this type of construction project, the most substantial
costs are associated with mobilization and demobilization, or getting the barges, material, and equipment
in place. The other major cost is associated with the construction of the breakwater. The breakwater for
alternative B would be less expensive than for the other action alternatives because it would be shorter
and constructed in shallower waters for the most part, requiring less material for construction. Costs are
not included for fill material in any of the alternatives, because it is assumed that fill will be donated from
dredging activities in the region as it becomes available; although the NPS would purchase fill, if funds
are available, and an adequate amount of suitable fill is not available for donation at the time of
construction, to expedite the construction process and minimize mobilization and demobilization costs.
The overall cost for alternative B is between $4 and $7 million, depending on the materials for the
breakwater and the approach to revegetation. Revegetation costs could range between $0 and $40,000 per
acre, depending on the methods used. Because design for all of the alternatives is in the very early stages,
estimated costs are general, and have been rounded to the nearest million to provide an order of
magnitude estimate.

ALTERNATIVE C: HYDROLOGIC RESTORATION AND FULLEST
POSSIBLE EXTENT OF WETLAND RESTORATION (PREFERRED
ALTERNATIVE)
As with alternative B, the two primary objectives of alternative C would be to reestablish hydrologic
conditions that would protect Hog Island Gut and redirect erosive flows through the establishment of a
breakwater. Under alternative C, the marsh would be restored in a phased approach up to the historic
boundary of the marsh and other adjacent areas within NPS jurisdictional boundaries (figure 2-8), with
the exception of the area immediately around the marina west of Dyke Island. Phased restoration would
continue until a sustainable marsh is achieved and meets the overall goals of the project. The historic
boundaries lie between the historic promontory and Dyke Island, the triangular island off the end of the
Haul Road. The outer edges of the containment cell structures would be placed at the park boundary in
the river.
The initial phase of this alternative would first fill the deep channels on NPS property and establish a
breakwater structure at the southern alignment of the historic promontory to provide immediate protection
to Dyke Marsh from erosion. Emergent marsh would be restored within the area of the historic
promontory to simulate the original extent of the land mass, and allow for the future phases to be
implemented and allow for full restoration. The deep channel areas north of the historic promontory
would also be filled within the NPS boundary prior to placement of the containment cells. After the
breakwater is established and the deep channel areas are filled, the marsh would then be restored to the
negative 4-foot contour at strategic locations to further reduce the risk of erosion and storm surges and
promote sedimentation within the existing marsh. Up to 35 acres of marsh would be restored during this
first phase. The southern alignment of the breakwater would be longer and would allow for somewhat
more protection of the marsh from erosive storm waves than alternative B. As with alternative B, work
would be phased overall so that initial restoration would provide the most benefits and protection, and
would allow future stages to build upon the initial benefits. Generally, construction of the breakwater and
possibly the deep channel fill would take place first, to protect the marsh restoration area and Hog Island
Gut. This would be followed by protection of the weakening outer walls of Hog Island Gut, particularly
where there is danger of breaching.

Alternative C: Hydrologic Restoration and Fullest Possible Extent of Wetland Restoration (Preferred Alternative)

All subsequent phases would establish containment cells no further than the historic marsh boundary. The
location of these cells would be prioritized based on the most benefits the specific locations could provide
to the existing marsh (i.e., erosion protection, increased sedimentation potential, improved hydrology,
etc.). The timing of these subsequent phases and the size and number of cells built during these phases
would be dependent upon available funds and materials.
In addition to the construction of containment cells, tidal guts would be cut into the restored marsh area
that would be similar to the historical flow channels of the original marsh. The final design will optimize
the flows within the marsh based on the current conditions present in the marsh. The outer edges of the
containment structures would be placed at the park boundary, the historic limit of the marsh. However,
with the intent to establish soft, natural edges on the outside of the restored marsh, the extent of restored
marsh would be inside the outermost edge of the containment cells when restoration is complete.
This alternative, like alternative B, would also introduce breaks in the Haul Road, returning tidal flows to
approximately 20–30 acres west of the Haul Road, which would help to re-establish the historic swamp
forest originally found on the site.
Approximately 16 additional acres of wetland may be restored south of the new breakwater to fill out the
southernmost historic extent of the marsh. This area would not be protected from storms, and would be
one of the last features implemented. In addition, the marsh restoration would extend west of Dyke Island,
and tidal guts would be created. Restoration of the area south of the breakwater would include future
modeling at the time of final design. This would ensure that the optional fill and associated changes in
hydrology would not result in erosion of restored marsh or cause adverse impacts to properties
immediately south of the breakwater (in the form of either shoreline erosion or accretion of sediments). In
total, under this alternative, approximately 180 acres of various wetland habitats could be created.

IMPLEMENTATION COSTS—ALTERNATIVE C
As noted previously, mobilization and demobilization would comprise a considerable portion of the cost.
The cost of the breakwater assumes the use of the more expensive riprap in construction. Steel and vinyl
sheet piling and the cost of armorstone for the underwater barriers to create the slopes for the soft marsh
edge represent substantial portions of the cost. The cost for fill material is not included because it is
assumed these portions would be donated; although the NPS would purchase fill, if funds are available,
and an adequate amount of suitable fill is not available for donation at the time of construction, to
expedite the construction process and minimize mobilization and demobilization costs. The initial phase,
including deep channel fill, construction of the breakwater, and vegetation restoration to the negative 4foot contour, would cost up to $10–12 million. Overall costs could range between $35 and $45 million,
depending on which approach to revegetation is selected.

SUMMARY OF ALTERNATIVES AND HOW THEY MEET THE
PLAN OBJECTIVES
Table 2-4 compares the alternatives and summarizes the actions being considered within each alternative.
Table 2-5 compares how each of the alternatives described in this chapter would meet the plan objectives.
The action alternatives analyzed must meet all objectives, as stated in “Chapter 1: Purpose of and Need
for Action,” and they must address the stated purpose of taking action and resolve the need for action.
Therefore, the alternatives were individually assessed in light of how well they would meet the objectives
for this plan/EIS, which are stated in the “Objectives in Taking Action” section in chapter 1. Alternatives
that did not meet the objectives were not analyzed further (see the “Alternatives Considered but
Dismissed from Further Detailed Analysis” section).
The environmental analysis described in “Chapter 4: Environmental Consequences” looks at the effects of
each alternative on each impact topic; these impacts are summarized in table 2-6.

Natural Resources
Restore, protect, and maintain tidal
freshwater wetlands and associated
ecosystems to provide habitat for fish,
wildlife, and other biota.

Does not meet objective; current
management would allow continued
erosion and eventual disappearance
of the marsh.

Meets objective; would protect and
stabilize important areas of the
marsh and restores additional
acreage.

Meets objective; would protect and
stabilize important marsh features and
allows for full restoration of the marsh.

Ensure that management actions
promote native species while minimizing
the intrusion of nonnative invasive
plants.

Partially meets objective; nonnative
invasive species would be removed
according to current management
practices in the marsh.
Establishment of additional native
species would be difficult with
eroding marsh.

Meets objective; would allow
establishment of additional marsh,
which is habitat for native species.
Potential for establishment of
nonnative invasive species
increases with acres of marsh
restored over the short term, but
monitoring and adaptive
management would discourage and
prevent establishment of nonnative

establishment of additional marsh,
which is habitat for native species.
Potential for establishment of
nonnative invasive species increases
with acres of marsh restored over the
short term, but monitoring and adaptive
management would discourage and
prevent establishment of nonnative

acres would ultimately allow for
establishment of more native species
than alternative B.

Reduce erosion of the existing marsh
and provide for erosion control
measures in areas of restored marsh.

Does not meet objective; alternative
would allow for continued erosion
and eventual disappearance of the
marsh.

Meets objective; alternative would
provide for stabilization of marsh
through construction of breakwater.

Meets objective; alternative would
provide for stabilization of marsh
through construction of breakwater,
and southern alignment of the
breakwater allows for somewhat more
protection of the marsh from erosive
storm waves than alternative B.

To the extent practicable, restore and
maintain hydrologic processes needed

Alternative C: Hydrologic
Restoration and Fullest Possible
Extent of Wetland Restoration
(Preferred Alternative)

Protect populations of species of
concern such as swamp sparrow
(Melospiza georgiana) and river bulrush
(Bolboschoenus fluviatilis).

Does not meet objective; habitat
would decrease for all species of
concern over time and marsh would
eventually disappear.

Meets objective; would stabilize
marsh and protect existing marsh
areas, as well as adding additional
acres of marsh that can support
species of concern.

Meets objective; would stabilize marsh
and protect existing marsh areas, as
well as adding additional acres of
marsh that can support species of
concern. More fully meets this
objective than alternative B because
more marsh would be restored.

Increase the resilience of Dyke Marsh
by providing a natural buffer to storms
and provide for flood control in
populated residential areas.

Does not meet objective; marsh
would eventually disappear and its
ability to provide a buffer would
decrease over time and eventually
cease.

Meets objective; would increase
marsh acreage, and breakwater
would help buffer wave energy
during storm events.

Meets objective; would increase marsh
acreage, and breakwater would help
buffer wave energy during storm
events. The higher acreage of marsh
restored means this alternative would
better meet this objective than
alternative B.

Does not meet objective; would
allow for eventual disappearance of
the marsh, a component landscape,
and erosion would threaten
undiscovered archeological
resources and hasten deterioration
of remnants of the historic dike.

Partially meets objective; would
increase marsh acreage and
stabilize it, therefore protecting and
enhancing the viewshed from some
directions, and also protecting dike
remnants and possible archeological
resources. Breakwater would be
very obvious from some
perspectives, and would be a new
element in the component
landscape.

Meets objective; would increase marsh
acreage and stabilize it, therefore
protecting and enhancing the viewshed
from some directions, and protecting
dike remnants and possible
archeological resources. Breakwater
would be much less visible, if at all,
because it would be further away from
the open part of the parkway than the
location of the breakwater in alternative
B, and would also have marsh
screening it.

Does not meet objective; interpretive
and educational opportunities would
decrease over time as marsh
erodes.

Meets objective; restoration would
allow for increased opportunities for
education and interpretation.

Meets objective; same as alternative B.

Cultural Resources
Protect the historic resources and
cultural landscape features associated
with Dyke Marsh and the George
Washington Memorial Parkway.

Visitor Experience
Enhance appropriate educational,
interpretation, and research
opportunities at Dyke Marsh and
enhance accessibility for diverse

TABLE 2-6. SUMMARY OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES

Alternative A: No Action
Hydrology
The existing flow regime would continue,
and Sediment and there would be continued erosion and
Transport
loss of marsh over time. The marsh would
disappear without intervention, and there
would be no opportunity for beneficial
hydrologic conditions or sediment accretion;
unique characteristics of the marsh,
including the marsh itself, would be lost.
This would result in a significant long-term
adverse effect on hydrology and sediment
transport.
Cumulative: The no-action alternative
would contribute adverse effects to the
impacts of other past, present, and
reasonably foreseeable projects in this
area. This contribution would be
appreciable because of the marsh expected
to be lost as a result of hydrologic change
and erosion.

Alternative B: Hydrologic Restoration and
Minimal Wetland Restoration
Construction of the breakwater would allow
significant beneficial changes to hydrology and
sediment transport to occur by shielding the marsh
from storms, redirecting flows, and creating low
energy areas in which sediment would settle out,
accrete, and marsh areas could develop.
Construction of the breakwater would result in
localized, significant beneficial impacts on
hydrology because it would restore natural
hydrologic and sediment transport processes that
were present in the marsh prior to the removal of
the historic promontory. The establishment of
these fundamental changes would also allow for
measurable benefits to other key resources in the
marsh.
The marsh restoration configuration would also
create long-term benefits on hydrology and
sediment transport by establishing restored
wetlands areas and protecting Hog Island Gut,
furthering the beneficial impacts created by the
breakwater. The breaks in Haul Road would
beneficially reintroduce tidal flows to lower areas
west of Haul Road.
Construction would temporarily divert flows,
creating some adverse impacts on hydrology and
sediment transport within the marsh. These
impacts would not be significant.
Cumulative: Alternative B would contribute mostly
beneficial impacts on hydrology and sediment
transport to the impacts of other past, present, and
reasonably foreseeable projects. The contribution
would be noticeable because most of the
cumulative impacts from other actions are
localized and have a limited effect on the
hydrology and sediment transport in the immediate
area of the marsh.

Final Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and Long-term Management Plan / EIS

Alternative C: Hydrologic Restoration and
Fullest Possible Extent of Wetland Restoration
(Preferred Alternative)
As under alternative B, the construction of the
breakwater would allow significant beneficial
changes to hydrology and sediment transport to
occur by shielding the marsh from storms,
redirecting flows, and creating low energy areas
in which sediment would settle out and accrete.
Construction of the breakwater would result in
localized, significant beneficial impacts on
hydrology because it would restore natural
hydrologic and sediment transport processes that
were present in the marsh prior to the removal of
the historic promontory. The establishment of
these fundamental changes would also allow for
measurable benefits to other key resources in the
marsh.
More wetland acreage (up to 180 acres) would
ultimately be restored than under alternative B,
and would result in similar but larger beneficial
impacts than alternative B. Impacts of the Haul
Road would be the same as under alternative B.
Short-term construction impacts under alternative
C would be similar to, but of a slightly greater
magnitude than those described under alternative
B, and they would be similar to alternative B
under phase one of the project.
Cumulative: The contribution of the beneficial
impacts of alternative C on Dyke Marsh and the
Potomac River to the impacts from past, present,
and reasonably foreseeable projects would be
appreciable because the impacts of the other
projects are for the most part localized, and the
scale of the Dyke Marsh restoration under this
alternative would be relatively large.

59

Chapter 2: Alternatives

Alternative A: No Action
Soils and
Sediments

60

Marsh soils would erode over time, and the
marsh would disappear without
intervention. Unique characteristics of the
marsh would be lost. This would result in a
significant long term adverse effect on soils,
because soils are necessary for a healthy
marsh.
Cumulative: The no-action alternative
would continue to contribute adverse
impacts on soils and sediments in Dyke
Marsh and the Potomac River to the mostly
adverse impacts from other past, present,
and reasonably foreseeable future projects.
The contribution would be appreciable
because of the magnitude of the loss of
soils in the marsh, and the relatively
localized impacts from the other projects.

Alternative B: Hydrologic Restoration and
Minimal Wetland Restoration
Sediments on the river bottom would be covered
with fill that would eventually become wetland
soils. There are no significant ecological benefits
from replacing one type of soil or sediment with
another. The soils west of Haul Road would
become hydric and support the reestablishment of
wetlands in this area.
Soil disturbance and river bottom compaction from
construction activities would be both short- and
long-term, adverse, and relatively minor.
Cumulative: Alternative B would contribute
beneficial impacts on soils and sediments in Dyke
Marsh and the Potomac River to the mostly
adverse impacts from other past, present, and
reasonably foreseeable future projects. The
contribution would be noticeable because most of
the cumulative impacts from other actions are
localized and have a limited effect on the soils and
sediment in the immediate area of the marsh.

Alternative C: Hydrologic Restoration and
Fullest Possible Extent of Wetland Restoration
(Preferred Alternative)
Impacts on soils and sediments would be similar
to but larger in scale than impacts under
alternative B. Sediments on the river bottom
would be replaced with fill that would eventually
become wetland soils, resulting in beneficial
impacts and allowing marsh restoration to
succeed. The impacts on soils west of Haul Road
would be the same as under alternative B. These
benefits would be substantial, but not significant.
The breakwater would be longer than alternative
B, so impacts related to covering of the river
bottom with armorstone for the breakwater would
be the similar to, but slightly greater than impacts
under alternative B.
Cumulative: Alternative C would contribute longterm beneficial impacts on soils and sediments in
Dyke Marsh and the adjacent Potomac River to
the mostly adverse impacts from other past,
present, and reasonably foreseeable projects.
The contribution would be appreciable,
particularly because the cumulative impacts are
localized for the most part, and the scale of the
Dyke Marsh restoration under this alternative
would be relatively large.

George Washington Memorial Parkway

Table 2-6. Summary of Environmental Consequences

Alternative A: No Action
Surface
Water Quality
in the
Potomac
River

Erosion would continue and the marsh
would eventually disappear. Marsh
sediments would be carried downstream.
Fewer wetlands would decrease the filtering
ability of the marsh, and lower the ability of
the marsh to provide water quality
improvements locally. Impacts would be
long-term and adverse, but given the
overall volume of water in the Potomac
River flowing by Dyke Marsh, adverse
effects would be relatively minor, and not
significant.
Cumulative: The adverse impacts on water
quality of continued and accelerated
erosion of the marsh from the no-action
alternative would be a noticeable but not
appreciable contribution to the impacts on
water quality from other projects, because
the impacts from the marsh erosion would
largely be localized.

Alternative B: Hydrologic Restoration and
Minimal Wetland Restoration
Marsh restoration would provide localized benefits
to water quality by increasing marsh acreage, and
increasing water quality benefits of restored
marsh. These mostly localized benefits would not
be significant.
Construction would cause short-term adverse
impacts related to disturbing sediments on the
bottom. Best management practices (BMPs)
would be used to prevent water quality issues;
containment walls would also prevent and
minimize impacts. There would be some initial
scour around the breaks in Haul Road. These
impacts would not be significant.
Cumulative: Alternative B would contribute mostly
localized long-term beneficial impacts on water
quality in the marsh and the river to the impacts of
other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable
projects. The contribution would be only somewhat
noticeable, given the localized nature of the
impacts from alternative B and the impacts of
many of the other projects.

Final Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and Long-term Management Plan / EIS

Alternative C: Hydrologic Restoration and
Fullest Possible Extent of Wetland Restoration
(Preferred Alternative)
The benefits to water quality would be greater
than but similar in nature to those under
alternative B. The benefits would be noticeable,
but mostly localized, and not significant.
Similar to alternative B, construction would cause
short-term adverse impacts related to disturbing
the sediments on the bottom; BMPs would be
used during installation to prevent water quality
issues. Impacts would not be significant.
Cumulative: Implementation of alternative C
would possibly contribute long-term beneficial
impacts on water quality to the impacts of other
past, present, and reasonably foreseeable
projects. The contribution would be noticeable,
but not appreciable, because the impacts from
alternative C would still be mostly localized, even
with the larger acreage of expansion.

61

Chapter 2: Alternatives

Alternative A: No Action
Floodplains

62

The continued erosion of the marsh under
the no-action alternative would not change
the base flood elevation, but would
adversely affect floodplain functions and
values, including the ability of the marsh to
provide a buffer to the parkway and inland
properties in storm conditions, and provide
habitat for floodplain species of plants and
wildlife. These impacts would be noticeable,
but would not be significant; the impacts
would become evident slowly over time.
Cumulative: The continued erosion of the
marsh and reduction of floodplain function
and values under alternative A would
contribute adverse impacts to the mostly
beneficial cumulative impacts on floodplains
from other projects over time. The
contribution would be noticeable, and not
appreciable, because the impacts from the
erosion of the marsh would affect only the
immediate vicinity of the marsh.

Alternative B: Hydrologic Restoration and
Minimal Wetland Restoration
Restoration of the marsh would raise the base
flood elevation by 1.2 inches, but would also
increase marsh area that would provide a buffer to
the parkway and inland properties during storm
events, and could therefore lessen the severity of
floods. Other floodplain functions and values
would also be increased. The magnitude of the
benefits would be less than the magnitude of
benefits under alternative C. Although important,
these benefits would not be significant.
Cumulative: Alternative B would contribute
beneficial, but mostly localized impacts to the
mostly beneficial impacts of other past, present,
and reasonably foreseeable projects, resulting in
overall benefits to the floodplain in Dyke Marsh
and on the Potomac River. The contribution of
alternative B to the cumulative scenario would be
noticeable, but not appreciable, because the
impacts would be mostly localized.

Alternative C: Hydrologic Restoration and
Fullest Possible Extent of Wetland Restoration
(Preferred Alternative)
Restoration of the marsh would raise the base
flood elevation by 1.8 inches, but would also
noticeably increase marsh area. The increases in
marsh area would provide a greater buffer from
flooding to the parkway and inland properties
during storm events than alternative B. Other
floodplain functions and values would also be
increased. There would also be some short-term
adverse impacts on floodplain function and values
as the result of the placement of the containment
structures that could restrict the assimilative
capacity of the existing marsh temporarily.
Although the beneficial impacts would be
important, these benefits and the short-term
adverse impacts would not be significant.
Cumulative: Alternative C would contribute
beneficial, but localized impacts to the beneficial
impacts from other projects, as well as short-term
adverse construction-related impacts, resulting in
overall benefits to the floodplain in Dyke Marsh
and on the Potomac River. The contribution from
the long-term beneficial impacts would be
noticeable, whereas the contribution from the
short-term adverse impacts would be
imperceptible.

George Washington Memorial Parkway

Table 2-6. Summary of Environmental Consequences

Alternative A: No Action
Vegetation
The no-action alternative would result in
and Wetlands erosion and disappearance of the marsh
and its vegetation over time, including
plants such as river bulrush. Additional
impacts include reduced or eliminated
functions and values that Dyke Marsh
wetlands provide. These adverse effects on
vegetation and wetlands would be
significant because tidal freshwater marsh
is regionally threatened, and Dyke Marsh is
important in a regional context. In addition,
the river bulrush community is unusual, and
there are very few tidal freshwater wetlands
in this region, particularly with similar plant
communities.
Cumulative: The no-action alternative
would continue to contribute noticeable
adverse effects on wetlands and vegetation
in the marsh to the impacts from other past,
present, and reasonably foreseeable
projects. The contribution of impacts from
the no-action alternative would be
appreciable because of the types of
vegetation and the acreage affected.

Alternative B: Hydrologic Restoration and
Minimal Wetland Restoration
The new restored wetland vegetation (70 acres)
would protect existing vegetation, including river
bulrush and other unusual plants, in addition to
increasing overall marsh acreage and protecting
the tidal freshwater marsh from disappearing.
Because the new vegetation under alternative B is
protecting this important regional resource, the
beneficial impacts would be significant. It is
expected that SAV would colonize around the
shallow edges of the restored marsh over time.
The breaks in Haul Road and resulting hydrologic
reconnections would discourage continued
establishment of nonnative invasive plants
because repeated inundation favors the
reestablishment of native plants over nonnative
plants.
Anticipated impacts and changes in vegetation as
a result of water depth and salinity changes
associated with climate change would be
monitored and addressed through the adaptive
management monitoring plan.
Cumulative: Implementation of alternative B
would contribute beneficial long-term impacts to
the mostly localized impacts of other projects. The
contribution would be noticeable, and not
appreciable, because most of the cumulative
impacts from other actions are localized and have
a limited effect on the wetlands and vegetation in
the immediate area of the marsh.

Alternative C: Hydrologic Restoration and
Fullest Possible Extent of Wetland Restoration
(Preferred Alternative)
The new restored wetland vegetation (180 acres)
would protect existing vegetation, including river
bulrush and other unusual plants, in addition to
increasing overall marsh acreage and protecting
the tidal freshwater marsh from disappearing.
Implementation of phase one would protect the
existing marsh then allow additional restoration to
move forward in the future. It is expected that
SAV would colonize around the shallow edges of
the restored marsh over time. Long-term
beneficial impacts would be significant, because
alternative C would protect an important regional
resource.
Benefits associated with the breaks in Haul Road
would be the same as for alternative B.
Anticipated impacts and changes in vegetation as
a result of water depth and salinity changes
associated with climate change would be
monitored and addressed through the adaptive
management monitoring plan.
Cumulative: Alternative C would contribute longterm benefits to the impacts from other projects,
including protection of the marsh from some of
the erosive effects of other projects. The
contribution of the beneficial impacts of alternative
C on wetland restoration and vegetation
colonization in Dyke Marsh would be appreciable,
particularly since the cumulative impacts of other
past, present, and reasonably foreseeable
projects are for the most part localized, and the
scale of the Dyke Marsh restoration under this
alternative would be relatively large.

Chapter 2: Alternatives

Alternative A: No Action
Fish and
Wildlife

64

Dyke Marsh would continue to provide
suitable habitat for invertebrates, as well as
juvenile and adult fish species. However,
the amount of habitat available for use by
fish and wildlife would continue to slowly
decline over time with the loss of marsh due
to erosion. Some of these species are
species of concern; these species and
other unusual species such as the marsh
wren would be adversely affected. As a
result of the loss of marsh under this
alternative and the associated magnitude of
adverse impacts on wildlife, impacts would
be significant.
Cumulative: In the short term, contributions
of adverse effects from the no-action
alternative to the effects on terrestrial and
aquatic fish and wildlife in the area from
other projects would likely be imperceptible,
but in the long term, with the continued
erosion of the freshwater tidal marsh and
loss of habitat, the no-action alternative
would likely contribute noticeable adverse
effects to the overall adverse cumulative
effects on terrestrial and aquatic fish and
wildlife species in the area.

Alternative B: Hydrologic Restoration and
Minimal Wetland Restoration
Alternative B would increase wetland and marsh
habitat by approximately 70 acres, allowing a
greater habitat area, which would increase the
number of species and population sizes over the
long term. Although there are new acres added,
and the marsh would be stabilized, the amount of
new habitat and associated benefits would be
noticeable, but not significant.
Construction-related impacts would result from the
use of marine equipment, and include temporary
displacement of fish and wildlife as the result of
construction noise and vibrations. Less mobile
species of aquatic wildlife could be buried during
the fill process. Restrictions on construction
periods would likely be put in place per
agreements with state wildlife agency to minimize
adverse effects from vibration and construction
noise on species of fish and wildlife that breed in
the marsh. Adverse construction impacts are not
likely to be large enough to be significant under
alternative B.
Cumulative: Alternative B would contribute mostly
beneficial impacts on wildlife in Dyke Marsh and
the Potomac River to the impacts from other past,
present, and reasonably foreseeable future
projects. The contribution would be somewhat
noticeable because it would increase the amount
of available habitat to species in the local area.

Alternative C: Hydrologic Restoration and
Fullest Possible Extent of Wetland Restoration
(Preferred Alternative)
Alternative C would increase wetland and marsh
habitat by up to 180 acres, with a smaller first
phase that would stabilize and slightly increase
overall marsh acreage, and would substantially
increase the number of species and population
sizes over the long term. The amount of new
habitat and associated benefits would be
noticeable and potentially significant.
Similar construction-related impacts as alternative
B, but larger in scope.
Cumulative: Alternative C would contribute longterm beneficial impacts on wildlife to the mostly
localized impacts from other past, present, and
reasonably foreseeable projects. The contribution
would be appreciable because the cumulative
adverse impacts of projects are for the most part
localized, and the scale of the Dyke Marsh
restoration under this alternative would be
relatively large.

George Washington Memorial Parkway

Table 2-6. Summary of Environmental Consequences

Alternative A: No Action
Species of
Special
Concern

The continuing loss of marsh soils and the
lack of new soils being formed from
sediment deposition would lead to loss of
habitat for existing communities of river
bulrush and giant bur-reed. Because these
plants both function to bind marsh soil, loss
of colonies of river bulrush and giant burreed would make adjacent parts of the
marsh more vulnerable to erosion.
Loss of marsh would also result in loss of
potential nesting and forage habitat for the
least bittern and swamp sparrow, and
would result in long-term adverse impacts
for both species of birds.
Because it is expected that the marsh
would completely erode over time and it
provides important habitat for these statelisted species of concern, the adverse
impacts on the river bulrush, giant bur-reed,
and both bird species would be significant.
Under the no-action alternative, the
floodplain swamp behind Haul Road would
continue to be hydrologically restricted and
habitat for Davis’ sedge and rough avens
would continue to be lost.
Cumulative: The no-action alternative
would continue to contribute adverse
effects on the three plant species of
concern and both bird species of concern in
the marsh to the adverse impacts from
other projects. The contribution from the
impacts of the no-action alternative would
be appreciable because of the large
acreage of marsh that would eventually be
lost, and because habitat would be
reduced.

Alternative B: Hydrologic Restoration and
Minimal Wetland Restoration
Restoration of marsh would provide additional
nesting and foraging habitat for both the swamp
sparrow and the least bittern, and increase
acreage in which river bulrush and giant bur-reed
could become established, resulting in long-term
beneficial impacts.
Temporary displacement of both bird species near
the construction area would be likely during
construction. Both bird species would be expected
to readily recolonize the marsh after construction
was complete. To prevent disturbance of the birds
during their breeding seasons, restrictions on
construction would be put into place in
consultation with the state.
Reconnection of tidal flows west of Haul Road
would discourage continued establishment of
nonnative invasive plants in the areas with
restored hydrologic connection, and would create
conditions that would encourage reestablishment
of rough avens and Davis’ sedge. The NPS would
identify the populations of Davis’ sedge and rough
avens prior to construction, and protect the plants
during construction activity.
The long-term benefits would be noticeable, but
not large enough in magnitude to be significant.
Because BMPs would be incorporated and there
would be limitations on construction during
breeding periods, impacts related to construction
would be short-term adverse, but not significant.
Cumulative: Alternative B would contribute longterm beneficial impacts on habitat for the plant and
bird species of concern in Dyke Marsh to the
mostly localized but adverse impacts of other
projects. This contribution would be noticeable.
The alternative would also contribute some shortterm adverse impacts to the overall scenario. With
mitigation, the contribution of these short-term
adverse construction-related impacts would be
imperceptible.

Final Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and Long-term Management Plan / EIS

Alternative C: Hydrologic Restoration and
Fullest Possible Extent of Wetland Restoration
(Preferred Alternative)
The impacts on Davis’ sedge and rough avens
would be the same as under alternative B. The
larger acreage restored under alternative C would
provide similar benefits for the marsh plants river
bulrush and giant bur-reed, and for both bird
species, by increasing acreage in which the
plants could occur, and by increasing nesting and
foraging habitat. The magnitude of the benefits
could result in these impacts being significant.
Construction impacts would be similar to those
described under alternative B, although they
would be more extensive, and would be
temporary. Restrictions on construction periods
would be put in place in consultation with the
state to avoid interference with breeding seasons.
Cumulative: Alternative C would contribute longterm beneficial impacts on habitat for the plant
and bird species of concern in Dyke Marsh to the
mostly localized adverse impacts of other
projects. The contribution would be noticeable,
and possibly appreciable, given the greater extent
of marsh restored under alternative C than
alternative B. The contribution of short-term
adverse construction impacts from this alternative
would be more noticeable than under alternative
B, but would still be imperceptible.

65

Chapter 2: Alternatives

Alternative A: No Action
Archeological Ongoing erosion would wash away or
Resources
potentially damage the archeological
resources of the George Washington
Memorial Parkway. The surviving section of
the dyke that gave the marsh its name
would be threatened, as would other
archeological resources that might be
present in the marsh, but have not been
discovered. Impacts from the no-action
alternative (alternative A) would not be
significant because the adverse effects are
not certain. However, if the dyke or other
resources are damaged, it would constitute
an adverse effect under Section 106 of
National Historic Preservation Act.
Cumulative: The no-action alternative
would allow the marsh to continue to erode,
threatening the surviving remnant of the
dyke and any other archeological resources
that might be present along the river’s
shoreline, and would contribute potential
adverse effects to the effects of the other
projects. This contribution would likely
range from imperceptible to noticeable,
depending on whether the dyke remnants
are harmed.

66

Alternative B: Hydrologic Restoration and
Minimal Wetland Restoration

Alternative C: Hydrologic Restoration and
Fullest Possible Extent of Wetland Restoration
(Preferred Alternative)

Same as alternative B.
Restoration activities under both alternatives
would stabilize the marsh and substantially reduce
erosion, which would therefore protect
archeological resources in and adjacent to the
marsh. The impacts would be the same for both
alternatives. Introduction of low energy tidal flows
west of Haul Road would not affect any
archeological resources. Construction activities in
the marsh would take place from the water and
would not affect archeological resources.
Additional testing at the sites of the breaks in the
Haul Road would occur prior to construction. The
beneficial impacts would not be significant.
Cumulative: The restoration of the marsh and
reduction of erosion under alternative B would
contribute beneficial impacts on archeological
resources in the park to impacts from other
projects by protecting the archeological resources
in Dyke Marsh. The contribution would be
appreciable.

George Washington Memorial Parkway

Table 2-6. Summary of Environmental Consequences

Alternative A: No Action
Historic
Structures,
Districts, and
Cultural
Landscapes

Erosion of the marsh under alternative A
would result in long term adverse effects
under NEPA on historic districts and
associated component landscapes: a
landscape feature important to the George
Washington Memorial Parkway and Mount
Vernon Memorial Highway would
disappear. These impacts would be
noticeable, and could rise to a level of
significance because of the marsh’s
importance as a scenic feature in the
historic district.
Cumulative: The no-action alternative
would contribute an adverse effect to the
impacts of the other projects in the park.
The contribution would therefore be
appreciable, because the no-action
alternative would result in the loss of a
prominent landscape feature.

Alternative B: Hydrologic Restoration and
Minimal Wetland Restoration
Marsh restoration under alternative B would
stabilize and restore the marsh, resulting in
beneficial impacts on the historic landscape. The
existing remnants of the dike would be protected
by reduced erosion, and by measures put in place
during construction. The breakwater would be
constructed of large stones, and would therefore
look somewhat natural, but it would be visible from
the parkway, and would not be screened, resulting
in adverse impacts on the historic landscape.
Changes introduced to the landscape by the
breakwater would be very noticeable and possibly
significant, depending on the viewpoint and
duration of the view.
Cumulative: Alternative B would contribute
beneficial impacts to the impacts from the other
projects by halting the erosion of Dyke Marsh and
therefore limiting the deterioration of the
landscape, but it would also contribute adverse
effects to the viewshed, and would not mitigate the
cumulative harm from the other projects that affect
the viewshed. The contribution of beneficial
impacts would be noticeable, and the contribution
of adverse effects to the viewshed would range
from noticeable to appreciable depending on the
viewpoint and duration of the view (duration
depends on whether the viewer is in the park or
driving by the park).

Final Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and Long-term Management Plan / EIS

Alternative C: Hydrologic Restoration and
Fullest Possible Extent of Wetland Restoration
(Preferred Alternative)
Marsh restoration under alternative C would
stabilize and restore a large area of marsh,
resulting in beneficial impacts on the historic
landscape. The existing remnants of the dike
would be protected by reduced erosion, and by
measures put in place during construction. The
breakwater would be constructed of large stones,
would be further south than the breakwater under
alternative B, and would be screened with marsh
plantings, so it would not be particularly
noticeable from the parkway. It would represent a
minimal intrusion into the historic landscape, and
would not be significant.
Cumulative: Restoration of Dyke Marsh under
alternative C would contribute beneficial impacts
on the cultural landscape and historic district to
the adverse impacts of the other projects. The
contribution would be appreciable, because
erosion of the marsh would be prevented and the
breakwater would not be highly intrusive.

67

Chapter 2: Alternatives

Alternative A: No Action
Visitor Use
and
Experience

68

Marsh erosion would adversely alter visitor
use and experience over time. Nature
viewing would be altered and access to the
marsh would decrease and disappear over
time, including access to the end of the
Haul Road trail, although visitors could still
recreate in the area by boat, and the
changes would be gradual. Because the
changes would happen gradually, for most
visitors the changes would not be
noticeable. For other users, such as bird
watchers, the changes could represent a
measurable adverse effect as opportunities
decrease, and the number of species and
number of individual birds decrease.
Overall, the impacts on visitor use and
experience would not rise to a level of
significance.
Cumulative: Alternative A would contribute
long-term adverse impacts to the impacts of
other past, present, and reasonably
foreseeable projects. Because the changes
would occur over a long period of time, the
contribution would be imperceptible.

Alternative B: Hydrologic Restoration and
Minimal Wetland Restoration
There would be some long-term beneficial impacts
on visitor use and experience related to
experiencing improved wetland and marsh
habitats and having more marsh to explore by
paddle craft after restoration is complete. The
largest impacts would occur during construction
and would be adverse. Construction activity would
be evident over an extended period of time, and
parts of the park would be closed during
construction. These impacts would be temporary
and would not be significant. However, public
education, information signs, and other outreach
would explain the project. Long-term beneficial
impacts on visitor use and experience would not
be significant.
Cumulative Implementation of alternative B would
contribute mostly long-term beneficial and shortterm adverse impacts to the overall adverse
impacts of the cumulative projects. The
contribution of beneficial impacts would be
noticeable. Contribution of adverse impacts would
be imperceptible.

Alternative C: Hydrologic Restoration and
Fullest Possible Extent of Wetland Restoration
(Preferred Alternative)
There would be long-term beneficial impacts on
visitor use and experience related to experiencing
improved wetland and marsh habitats and having
more marsh to explore, including new tidal guts,
by paddle craft after restoration is complete.
Long-term beneficial impacts on visitor use and
experience would not be significant.
As with alternative B, the largest impacts would
occur during construction and would be adverse.
Construction activity for future phases would
cover a larger area than alternative B, and would
be evident over a period of years. Impacts on the
visitor use of the marina would be minimal. Parts
of the park would be closed during construction,
although the areas would change as work is
completed and new cells or phases are started.
Because the impacts would take place over a
period of years, and would be noticeable,
construction-related impacts could be significantly
adverse, although they would end when
construction was complete. Public education,
information signs, and other outreach would
explain the project.
Cumulative: Alternative C would contribute both
short-term adverse and long-term beneficial
impacts to the relatively small adverse cumulative
effects. The contribution of the impacts would be
noticeable, because the impacts from C would be
of a larger scale than the impacts from the
cumulative projects.

George Washington Memorial Parkway

Table 2-6. Summary of Environmental Consequences

Alternative A: No Action
Adjacent
Property
Owners, and
the Marina

Alternative A would have minimal impacts
on adjacent property owners and the
marina. Erosion of the marsh would
exacerbate flooding in adjacent areas, and
overtime, the marina could become more
exposed, which could affect how much
shelter the mooring field provides, and the
ease of using the marina. Erosion of the
marsh could also increase the amount of
maintenance and protection needed on the
parkway as the shoreline moves closer to it
in the future. These impacts would be
noticeable, but would not be a large enough
magnitude to be significant.
Cumulative: No past, present, or future
actions have been identified that would
impact adjacent landowners. Therefore, no
cumulative impacts are anticipated to occur
to adjacent landowners as a result of this
alternative.

Alternative B: Hydrologic Restoration and
Minimal Wetland Restoration
Construction activities would affect adjacent
landowners by increasing noise and large
equipment in the Dyke Marsh area. The
magnitude of construction-related impacts would
not be as large under alternative B as under
alternative C. Over the long term, alternative B
would provide some additional buffering from
flooding in the adjacent community, and provide
some protection for the parkway itself. The
breakwater would be visible from properties to the
south but would be less visible than the
breakwater proposed in alternative C. There may
be increased noise during hunting season,
although the restored marsh would still be
relatively far from the property line, so hunting
would increase noticeable in adjacent waters.
These impacts are all relatively minor and would
not be significant.
Cumulative: No past, present, or future actions
have been identified that would impact adjacent
landowners. Therefore, no cumulative impacts are
anticipated to occur to adjacent landowners as a
result of this alternative.

Final Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and Long-term Management Plan / EIS

Alternative C: Hydrologic Restoration and
Fullest Possible Extent of Wetland Restoration
(Preferred Alternative)
Construction activities would affect adjacent
landowners by increasing noise and large
equipment in the Dyke Marsh area. The
magnitude of construction-related impacts would
larger than under alternative B. Over the long
term, alternative C would provide noticeably more
buffering from flooding in the adjacent community
than currently exists, and would also provide
some protection for the parkway itself. The
breakwater would be visible from properties to the
south but would be less visible than the
breakwater proposed in alternative C. There may
be noticeably more noise during hunting season
with the extent of the restored marsh closer to the
property line, making it more likely that waterfowl
would be found closer to the property line. The
restored marsh south of the breakwater is not
expected to affect the depth of the water or result
in shoreline erosion of nearby properties south of
the breakwater. Modeling would be done at final
design to ensure that adverse impacts to
neighboring property owners would not occur.
Anticipated impacts are all relatively minor and
would not be significant.
Cumulative: No past, present, or future actions
have been identified that would impact adjacent
landowners. Therefore, no cumulative impacts are
anticipated to occur to adjacent landowners as a
result of this alternative.

69

Chapter 2: Alternatives

Alternative A: No Action
Park
Management
and
Operations

70

Under the no-action alternative (alternative
A), the marsh would continue to erode,
which would result in decreased research
and educational opportunities, and increase
maintenance efforts to protect the parkway,
Mount Vernon trail, and other facilities
adjacent to the marsh. The marina is
expected to continue to operate at capacity,
but might experience a loss of revenue from
decreased rentals of paddle craft over an
extended period of time as the marsh
erodes. The mooring field and other parts of
the marina could become more exposed
over time and less appealing to marina
users. Increased maintenance would not
likely become necessary for the next fifteen
years, however, and these impacts would
not be significant.
Cumulative: No past, present, or future
actions have been identified that would
impact park management and operations.
Therefore, there would be no cumulative
impacts on park management and
operations from this alternative.

Alternative B: Hydrologic Restoration and
Minimal Wetland Restoration
Both action alternatives require the
implementation of a monitoring program to ensure
the restoration is successful, and increased
management to ensure that geese exclosures and
nonnative invasive plant management is working.
During construction, staff time would be required
to interact with construction personnel, and
research and educational activities might be
refocused. Overall, the level of effort necessary
under alternative B would be less than under
alternative C, and would not be of a magnitude
that could be considered significant.
Cumulative: No past, present, or future actions
have been identified that would impact park
management and operations. Therefore, there
would be no cumulative impacts on park
management and operations from this alternative.

Alternative C: Hydrologic Restoration and
Fullest Possible Extent of Wetland Restoration
(Preferred Alternative)
Both action alternatives require the
implementation of a monitoring program to ensure
the restoration is successful, and increased
management to ensure that geese exclosures
and nonnative invasive plant management is
working. A greater amount of staff time would be
required to interact with construction personnel
under alternative C, and research and educational
activities would be refocused. Overall, the level of
effort necessary under alternative C would be
much greater than under alternative B, but it
would likely be spread out over time, and would
be focused over short amounts of time and would
therefore not be significant.
Cumulative: No past, present, or future actions
have been identified that would impact park
management and operations. Therefore, there
would be no cumulative impacts on park
management and operations from this alternative.

George Washington Memorial Parkway

Alternatives Considered but Dismissed from Further Detailed Analysis

ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED BUT DISMISSED FROM
FURTHER DETAILED ANALYSIS
The following alternatives were considered but dismissed from further detailed analysis for reasons
explained below.
1. Restore to the extent of 1937 marsh with marsh edges extending to the edge of the park
boundary. This alternative would not be technically feasible because construction would be
needed outside the park boundary to achieve this extent of restored wetland, and the NPS does
not have authority to work outside the boundaries of its property. In addition, very deep channels
at the north end of the park would need to be filled; it may not be technically feasible to fill them
to the extent required. The alternative is very similar to alternative D, although it would result in
more adverse impacts; it would be more costly due to the amount of fill required, and would
probably result in less natural marsh edges than would result from alternative D. This alternative
was therefore considered and dismissed from more detailed analysis.
2. Restore only in accretion areas identified in 2009 study (NPS 2009c), south of the Haul Road
and north to the area just south of the Belle Haven Marina; just north of the historic promontory;
and from the historic promontory south of Hog Island Gut. Further hydrologic modeling has
shown that these areas are not actually accreting, so the alternative would not be technically
feasible without other modifications, and would therefore be unreasonable even with the
restoration of the historic promontory that would restore hydrologic conditions. This alternative is
similar to alternative B because it also considers fill to the negative 4-foot contour. This
alternative was therefore considered but dismissed from further analysis.
3. Alternative C presented at Public Scoping and Alternatives Meetings: Hydrologic
Restoration and Intermediate Extent of Wetland Restoration. This alternative was presented
during public scoping and alternatives meetings (figure 2-9). This alternative, which made use of
large containment cells, and only restored wetlands between the breakwater and Dyke Island, was
considered redundant to, and offers less flexibility than, the new alternative C, phased hydrologic
restoration and full extent of wetland restoration presented in this chapter.
4. Restore the marsh using the 1976 USACE Demonstration Cell (28 acres). The USACE
proposed a marsh restoration demonstration cell in 1976. The demonstration cell was 28 acres
and was proposed to be placed “in the area outside of the existing Haul Road between the larger
wooded island (Coconut Island south of Dyke Island) and the remnant spit” (NPS 1977), and
would have included diking and natural revegetation. The location of the demonstration cell
designed by the USACE in 1976 is not in a protected location and would be highly vulnerable to
erosion and lacks inclusion of tidal guts. The alternative would not meet the purpose and need of
the plan, because the restoration would not be successful over the long term. This alternative
included restoration of the historic promontory, which has been incorporated into action
alternatives carried forward for analysis.

Final Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and Long-term Management Plan / EIS

71

Chapter 2: Alternatives

FIGURE 2-9. DISMISSED ALTERNATIVE C, AS SHOWN IN PUBLIC MEETING ALTERNATIVES DISPLAY

5. Fill all the deep channels on the north end of the marsh to restore marsh hydrology, and
restore the historic promontory. These deep channels extend outside the park boundaries, and it
would not be feasible to fill them successfully without working outside the park boundaries. In
addition, based on the modeling for other alternatives, it is unlikely that filling these channels
would noticeably affect restoration one way or the other and would therefore not be technically
feasible. The more important element to restoration of marsh hydrology is the restoration of the
historic promontory in some form, and although restoration of the historic promontory is part of
this alternative, this feature has been incorporated into other action alternatives carried forward
for analysis. Alternative B would accomplish much the same objective as this alternative, and has
a higher likelihood of success and would also be less expensive (the cost of deep fill could be
high). Therefore, this alternative was dismissed.
6. Construction option B: use of small containment cells during restoration construction. In
preparing the conceptual designs for the alternatives carried forward for analysis, the USACE
proposed two options for containment cell configurations: small and large containment cells. The
small cells option was dismissed from further analysis because the larger cells of the other
options would accomplish the same purpose and objective, but would be substantially less
expensive.
7. Restore marsh in other areas on the Potomac. It was suggested during public scoping that
restoring other areas outside the original extent of Dyke Marsh should be considered. This
proposal would not meet the purpose of or need for restoration of Dyke Marsh; therefore, was
dismissed from further analysis.
8. Construct the breakwater using steel sheet piling. Use of steel sheet piling filled with earth
(slurry fill) was considered for the breakwater along the historic promontory. The depth of a sheet
piling breakwater wall would be approximately three times the river depth. About two-thirds of
the sheet piling would be embedded below the river bottom to ensure the breakwater is strong
72

George Washington Memorial Parkway

Consistency with the Purposes of the National Environmental Policy Act

enough (figures 2-4 and 2-5). Similar to the stone breakwater, the construction would be expected
to take place from the water. The sheet piling would be put in place using boats equipped with
either pile drivers or vibrating equipment that would slide the sheet piling into the river bottom.
This construction method was dismissed because it is similar in cost to building an armorstone
breakwater, requires more maintenance over time and might need replacement, and is less
visually consistent with the historic and natural character of the George Washington Memorial
Parkway. The armorstone breakwater is also more permeable than the steel sheet piling, allowing
for the creation of more habitat for various species of fish and wildlife.
9. Construct a breakwater on the north end of the marsh. This alternative was suggested during
public scoping. Because a breakwater located on the north end of the marsh would not restore
hydrologic conditions necessary for successful restoration, and would not meet the project
purpose and objectives, it was dismissed.

CONSISTENCY WITH THE PURPOSES OF THE NATIONAL
ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT
NEPA requires an analysis of how each alternative meets or achieves the purposes of the act (Section
101[b]). Each alternative analyzed in a NEPA document must be assessed as to how it meets the
following purposes:
1. fulfill the responsibilities of each generation as trustee of the environment for succeeding
generations;
2. ensure for all Americans safe, healthful, productive, and aesthetically and culturally pleasing
surroundings;
3. attain the widest range of beneficial uses of the environment without degradation, risk of health or
safety, or other undesirable and unintended consequences;
4. preserve important historic, cultural, and natural aspects of our national heritage and maintain,
wherever possible, an environment that supports diversity and variety of individual choice;
5. achieve a balance between population and resource use that will permit high standards of living
and a wide sharing of life’s amenities; and
6. enhance the quality of renewable resources and approach the maximum attainable recycling of
depletable resources (42 USC 4331).
The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) has promulgated regulations for federal agencies’
implementation of NEPA (40 CFR 1500–1508). Section 1500.2 states that federal agencies shall, to the
fullest extent possible, interpret and administer the policies, regulations, and public laws of the United
States in accordance with the policies set forth in the act (Sections 101(b) and 102(1)); therefore, other
acts and NPS policies are referenced as applicable in the following discussion, which describes to what
extent the various alternatives meet the purposes of NEPA listed above.

Purpose 1: Fulfill the Responsibilities of Each Generation as Trustee of the Environment
for Succeeding Generations
George Washington Memorial Parkway is a unit of the national park system. As the trustee of the land,
the NPS would continue to fulfill its obligation as trustee of Dyke Marsh for future generations.
Alternative A (no action) would not support this purpose well because the alternative would not allow for
restoration and protection of wetland resources, plant and animal communities, and natural ecosystem

Final Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and Long-term Management Plan / EIS

73

Chapter 2: Alternatives

functions that have been damaged by previous human uses and are subject to continuing environmental
threats. Additionally, alternative A would not restore Dyke Marsh, as required under P.L. 93-251 and the
Water Resources Development Act of 2007. Alternatives B and C would provide better long-term
protection of Dyke Marsh. Alternative C would best meet this purpose because it would result in the most
acreage of existing wetlands being protected from erosion, nonnative invasive plant species, loss of
habitat, and altered hydrologic regimes. Alternative C would restore wetlands and ecosystem functions
and processes to a greater degree than alternative B. Both alternatives B and C would create conditions
that would allow the enhancement of Dyke Marsh and George Washington Memorial Parkway and
improved ecosystem services that benefit the Potomac River Watershed and the Chesapeake Bay. The
anticipated benefits to the environment increases with the acreage of wetlands restored and protected.

Purpose 2: Ensure for All Americans Safe, Healthful, Productive, and Aesthetically and
Culturally Pleasing Surroundings
The alternatives would meet this purpose similar to the way they meet Purpose 1, based on the difference
in the amount of wetlands to be restored and protected. Under alternative A, there would be no wetlands
restoration. Current management of the marsh would continue, which includes providing basic
maintenance related to the Haul Road, control of nonnative invasive plant species, ongoing interpretive
and environmental education activities, scientific research projects, boundary marking, and enforcement
of existing regulations. There would be no manipulation of the marsh other than emergency, safetyrelated, or limited improvements or maintenance actions. The destabilized marsh would continue to erode
and would not contribute to productive or aesthetically pleasing surroundings. Alternatives B and C
would allow the NPS to ensure a safe, healthful, productive, and more pleasing environment within the
boundaries of Dyke Marsh as a result of planting of native vegetation in areas of fill that would ultimately
mature and blend in with the remainder of the marsh. Restoring and expanding the tidal freshwater marsh
would enhance the cultural landscape. The anticipated benefits associated with productive and
aesthetically pleasing surroundings increase with the acreage of wetlands restored and protected.

Purpose 3: Attain the Widest Range of Beneficial Uses of the Environment Without
Degradation, Risk of Health or Safety, or Other Undesirable and Unintended
Consequences
Similar to Purpose 1, alternative A would not meet this purpose since the alternative would not allow for
restoration and protection of wetland resources, plant and animal communities, and natural ecosystem
functions that have been damaged by previous human uses and are subject to continuing environmental
threats. Additionally, alternative A would not restore Dyke Marsh, as required under P.L. 93-251 and the
Water Resources Development Act of 2007. The action alternatives, in particular alternative C, would
allow for the widest range of beneficial uses of the environment by providing habitat for fish, wildlife,
and other biota; protecting rare populations of state rare species, as well as protecting historic resources
and enhancing visitor use and experience of Dyke Marsh. Both action alternatives would result in some
temporary adverse environmental impacts or degradation as a result of construction activities; however, in
the long-term, successful wetland restoration would have positive effects on water quality by increasing
wetland and floodplain functions, on soils from decreased erosion, and on wildlife and wildlife habitat as
a result of increased areas of native vegetation. However, both alternatives include mitigation that would
limit or reduce any degradation and other unintended consequences.

Consistency with the Purposes of the National Environmental Policy Act

Purpose 4: Preserve Important Historic, Cultural, and Natural Aspects of our National
Heritage and Maintain, Wherever Possible, an Environment that Supports Diversity and
Variety of Individual Choice
Alternative A would not provide for protection of important cultural and historic aspects of Dyke Marsh
because the marsh would continue to erode. The marsh is a component landscape of the George
Washington Memorial Parkway historic district. It was present in George Washington’s time and when
the George Washington Memorial Parkway was created. Its loss has an appreciable impact on the George
Washington Memorial Parkway historic district. Continued erosion of Dyke Marsh would therefore
degrade the cultural landscape of the George Washington Memorial Parkway. Without marsh restoration,
wetland vegetation, include species of concern, would have a decrease success of colonization, which
could indirectly affect the natural aspects of the park’s heritage, such as changing or impeding river views
from the parkway and the shore adjacent to the marsh and may limit some individual choices regarding
visitor use of Dyke Marsh. Alternative A would allow for Haul Road to continue to erode, possibly to the
point where visitor use (particularly by birders as they areas is heavily used by this group) of the area
would be restricted. Alternative B would preserve the cultural, historic, and natural aspects of the
environment and would provide individual choice as a result of wetland restoration and protection.
Alternative C would provide the most preservation of these aspects of the park’s heritage and allow for
more individual choice at Dyke Marsh with regards to future management of the area.

Purpose 5: Achieve a Balance Between Population and Resource Use that Will Permit High
Standards of Living and a Wide Sharing of Life’s Amenities
Alternative A would not lend itself to a balance between population and resource use because it would
allow for continuation of existing management of Dyke Marsh, resulting in further destabilization of the
marsh from continued erosion, and NPS would only take emergency actions to remedy the issue.
Alternative A would have limited benefits regarding the balance between population and resources use of
Dyke Marsh. Alternatives B and C would restore and protect Dyke Marsh and aim to strike a balance
between population and resource use by limiting impacts to park resources through restoration and
protection activities while allowing for increased recreational, educational, and research uses and
opportunities by the local population as well as research organizations such as the National Science
Foundation and universities. Restoration adjacent to the marina is not included in alternatives B or C,
which accounts for optimal balance of natural and recreational uses.

Purpose 6: Enhance the Quality of Renewable Resources and Approach the Maximum
Attainable Recycling of Depletable Resources (42 USC 4331)
None of the alternatives directly addresses the recycling of depletable resources, although the marsh
would eventually erode to the point it would disappear under alternative A. Both action alternatives
involve wetland restoration and protection and would result in enhancing the quality of renewable natural
resources in the park by allowing for NPS management and protection of the wetlands and wildlife at
Dyke Marsh. Alternative C would meet this purpose to a greater degree than alternative B because more
acres of wetlands would be restored and protected to support the renewable resources of Dyke Marsh and
the George Washington Memorial Parkway.

Chapter 2: Alternatives

NATIONAL PARK SERVICE PREFERRED ALTERNATIVE
The preferred alternative is the alternative “which the agency believes would fulfill its statutory mission
and responsibilities, giving consideration to economic environmental, technical, and other factors” (CEQ
1981). The NPS has identified alternative C as its preferred alternative upon consideration of factors such
as the degree to which alternatives would meet plan objectives (see table 5), environmental impacts (see
“Chapter 4: Environmental Consequences”), the degree to which alternatives provide management
flexibility, and costs. Alternative C would provide the greatest amount of benefits from its initial phases
of restoration by stabilizing the marsh and allows for flexibility in restoration approaches such that full
marsh restoration is possible.

ENVIRONMENTALLY PREFERABLE ALTERNATIVE
The NPS is required to identify the environmentally preferable alternative in its NEPA documents for
public review and comment. The NPS, in accordance with the Department of the Interior NEPA
regulations (43 CFR 46) and the CEQ’s Forty Questions, defines the environmentally preferable
alternative (or alternatives) as the alternative that best promotes the national environmental policy
expressed in NEPA (Section 101(b)) (516 DM 4.10). The CEQ’s Forty Questions (CEQ 1981) further
clarifies the identification of the environmentally preferable alternative stating:
this means the alternative that causes the least damage to the biological and physical
environment; it also means the alternative which best protects, preserves, and enhances
historic, cultural, and natural resources (CEQ 40 Questions, Question 6a).
Alternative C was identified as the environmentally preferable alternative because it would provide the
most beneficial impacts on resources and values, including short-term stabilization of the marsh and
minimization of erosion. The alternative would also allow for future restoration of the entire marsh by
placing the breakwater on the southern alignment, and therefore allowing restoration of the promontory.
This alternative would allow for the most environmental benefits, including creation of habitat, water
quality and floodplain protection benefits, restoration of cultural landscapes, and improvement of visitor
experience. Under alternative B, future restoration would be limited by the configuration of the
breakwater, and under alternative A (no action), the marsh would continue to erode, eventually entirely;
therefore neither of those alternatives would be considered environmentally preferable.

CHAPTER 3: AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT
This “Affected Environment” chapter describes existing conditions of the natural and cultural
environments that would be affected by the implementation of the actions considered in this Dyke Marsh
Wetland Restoration and Long-term Management Plan / Environmental Impact Statement (plan/EIS).
This chapter discusses the following natural and cultural environments:


Hydrology and Sediment Transport



Soils and Sediments



Surface Water Quality in the Potomac River



Floodplains



Vegetation and Wetlands



Fish and Wildlife



Species of Special Concern

Impacts for each of these topics are analyzed in “Chapter 4: Environmental Consequences.” In all but the
“Adjacent Property Owners and the Marina” sections, the affected environment described is the extent of
the Dyke Marsh Wildlife Preserve (Dyke Marsh), located in the George Washington Memorial Parkway,
and includes Dyke Marsh proper and the associated lands around it.

HYDROLOGY AND SEDIMENT TRANSPORT
The mean tidal range in the area of the marsh is between 0.5 and 0.9 meter (1.64 and 2.95 feet) (UMCES
2004), and U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) data show that the mean streamflow in the Potomac River
ranged between 4,017 and 23,760 cubic feet per second between the years of 1931 and 2011. The highest
flows generally tend to occur in the spring months, such as March and April, due to upstream snowmelt
and spring rain events. Some annual high flows also occur in other months due to storm events (USGS
2012). Nutrients and sediments, which are critical to the health of the marsh, are delivered to the marsh
through the hydrology of the tidal guts and the process of water washing over the wetlands during the ebb
and flow of tides.

Hydrology and Sediment Transport

Drainage in the marsh is controlled both by tidal flows and general flow in the Potomac River (UMCES
2004). A 2009 bathymetry study in the marsh indicates that although the main channel of the river used
for shipping is on the east side of the Potomac, there are deep channels that may have been created by or
enlarged as a result of hydrologic changes caused by past sand and gravel dredging activity (NPS 2009b).
These channels run upstream–downstream through the marsh and act as main channels that exacerbate
erosive effects in the marsh (figure 3-2). The depth of the Potomac River adjacent to the eastern edge of
the marsh was historically shallow (≤4 feet) and provided some protective measures to the shoreline
(Litwin et al. 2011). However, the current deep channels, approximately 12 to 16 feet deep, off the eastern
edge of the marsh allow wave energy to impact the shoreline (Litwin et al. 2011). These effects have been
compounded by the removal of a small promontory from the southern end of the marsh, immediately
downstream of the two channels (see figure 1-2 for changes to the marsh over time). This removal took
place during the first stages of dredging for sand and gravel in the 1930s. This promontory served as an
energy barrier for the southern marsh, especially from storm-induced waves from the south; prevented the
full brunt of flood flows from pushing up the Hog Island Gut; and allowed sediments to aggrade in the
marsh (Litwin et al. 2011). The islands on the northern end of the marsh, originally tidal guts that have
now become isolated, are also allowing increased flow through these channels.
Hog Island Gut, the last significant tidal gut remaining in
the marsh, currently empties downstream into the river near
the location of the historic dikes and the location of the
former promontory. In the past, this gut and other guts in the
marsh had more meanders and emptied upstream toward the
north. Historic photos and the USGS study show evidence
of changes in flow regime and morphology in the gut,
creating straighter channels that now drain downstream to
the south, rather than bending north and emptying upstream
(Litwin et al. 2011). Existing river flows are directed
through the marsh and the marsh outflows are in a southerly
direction. Additionally, the mouth of Hog Island Gut is
Shoreline Erosion
slowly moving deeper into the marsh due to sediment
deposition in that area, and the smaller tidal tributaries are
being eroded (Litwin et al. 2011). These changes have allowed for more efficient flow into and out of the
guts as tides flow and ebb, and increased erosion and widening in the guts. The two islands at the
upstream extent of the marsh, which are remnants of tidal guts, help protect the marsh from southeasterly
flows and provide shelter to a large section of marsh. Figure 3-3 shows Hog Island Gut in 2009 and in
1939, and how its configuration has changed, as well as the location of the promontory of land removed
in the dredging process. It also shows the channels that connect the gut with the surrounding
neighborhoods discussed in the “Adjacent Property Owners and the Marina” section.

Chapter 3: Affected Environment

The bathymetry study showed that the marsh is currently in an erosional state, with losses of shoreline on
the western bank of the Potomac River, particularly in the southern two-thirds of the marsh, and around
Hog Island Gut (NPS 2009b). Currently the erosional processes that seem to be having the most impact
on Dyke Marsh are due to wave action and sediment transport rather than flooding (Litwin et al. 2011).
From 1987 to 2006, shoreline erosion resulted in the lateral loss of at least 90 feet of shoreline for much
of the eastern marsh edge (Litwin et al. 2011). Although vertical shoreline scour due to wave action is
dampened by the presence of exposed root systems, minimum scour depths are approximately 45 to 60
centimeters (18 to 24 inches) (Litwin et al. 2011). Some areas in the upstream end of the marsh are
depositional, although the two islands in the northern end of the marsh have lost land mass since 1992
(NPS 2009b). The rate of erosion of the southern marsh is greater than that of the northern marsh islands;
recently, the erosion of the southern marsh has increased following a breach of a protective peninsula
(Litwin et al. 2011). Figure 1-4 in chapter 1 shows the areas of the marsh that are accreting and those that
are eroding. More recent hydrodynamic modeling used to characterize possible impacts shows sediment
transport and flow velocities confirm current conditions with regard to erosion and accretion.
Other historical hydrologic influences on the marsh have been flows from Hunting Creek and Cameron
Run, which drain into the Potomac River to the north of Dyke Marsh. These waterways traditionally
brought sediment to the marsh. Hunting Creek joins Cameron Run at its confluence with the Potomac
River. Cameron Run has been channelized upstream, and in the last century, Hunting Creek has been
significantly altered due to the construction of a golf course, the construction of the bridge on the
parkway, and construction of Interstate 495 (I-495) and its access ramps immediately adjacent to the
mouth of Hunting Creek. The hydrology has changed and there is now noticeable deposition in the mouth
of the creek and increasingly large mud flats in the embayment in the Potomac River immediately south
of the creek, but upstream of Dyke Marsh. These water bodies are shown on figure 3-1.

SOILS AND SEDIMENTS
Dyke Marsh is situated on top of recently deposited alluvium that is approximately 50 feet thick (NPS
1977). To a large extent, the surface soils at Dyke Marsh reflect the source materials in the uplands to the
west of the marsh, although some of the smaller materials could be derived from materials almost
anywhere in the Potomac River drainage.
Extensive boring in the marsh, performed from 1932 to 1934 by Smoot Sand and Gravel Corporation
(SSGC) as preparation for the dredging and mining operations, and in 1976 by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers (USACE), has revealed the predominance of sand and gravel deposits between 16 feet and 50
feet, overlain by soft depositional mud and with lenticular interlaid units of silt and clay. Such a
sedimentary sequence reflects the changing conditions in depositional environment from one of swiftmoving waters, where only heavy sands and gravel would fall out of the water column, to one of slack
water, allowing finer silts and clays to settle (NPS 2000b). The years of dredging and marsh removal
(from the early 1930s to 1972) have altered the marsh and riverbed topography. Where shallow contours
once existed, there are now deep holes and channels that contribute to the erosion of the marsh, because
shallower sediments slough off into these deeper waters.
In March 2004, soil samples collected in the marsh were analyzed for particle size. All samples collected
had higher than 60 percent organic matter and were composed largely of silt and clay with little, if any,
sand. Soil types in these marsh samples included silty clay, silty clay loam, clay, silt loam, and clay loam,
with the majority of samples being silty clay and silty clay loam (UMCES 2004). Major soil types in the
marsh are Honga peat, Woodstown sandy loam, Mattapex loam, and Gunston silt loam. These soils are
described in table 3-1.

Soil Name

Description

Honga peat

This very deep soil is found in coastal plains in brackish submerged upland marshes
along tidally influenced bays and rivers. Its parent material consists of organic
deposits of intermediate decomposition, derived from salt-tolerant herbaceous
plants, and is underlain by loamy mineral sediments. This soil is flooded by tidal
waters and is very poorly drained, but becomes extremely acidic when drained.

Woodstown sandy loam

This very deep, moderately well-drained soil is found on the Atlantic coastal plain in
upland marine terraces, and old stream terraces at elevations of 5 to 120 feet. Its
parent material consists of sandy marine and old alluvial sediments.

Mattapex loam

This very deep, moderately well-drained soil is found on the Atlantic coastal plain in
flat depressions, swales, marine terraces, and uplands at 5 to 120 feet. Its parent
material consists of silty aeolian deposits over fluviomarine sediments.

Gunston silt loam

This very deep, somewhat poorly drained soil is found on the Atlantic coastal plain in
uplands and on summits and shoulders on hillsides. Its parent material consists of
marine sediments.

More recently, sediment sampling and physical property testing was completed to assess sediment
transport trends within the Dyke Marsh area of the Potomac River. Thirty sediment samples were
obtained and physical property testing (sieve analyses) completed. The majority of samples consisted
predominantly of clay and silt with sediments often dark olive gray with no overall structure or layering.
The clay and silt were typically soft and loose near the surface, and became firmer one to two feet down.
Core samples taken from the northern part of Dyke Marsh and near the mouth of Cameron Run appeared
to have a greater fraction of sand and fine sand (USACE 2010).

SURFACE WATER QUALITY IN THE POTOMAC RIVER
Dyke Marsh and the Dyke Marsh Wildlife Preserve are located on the upper tidal portion of the Potomac
River, immediately south of the City of Alexandria, Virginia, near Washington, D.C. The portion of the
Potomac River where Dyke Marsh is located, shown in figure 3-1, is tidally influenced, although the
water is fresh. The Potomac River and its upstream tributaries flow through agricultural, forested, and
highly urbanized areas, and are subject to pollution from point-source discharges and nonpoint-source
runoff from many land uses. The reach of the river around Dyke Marsh is dominated by urban runoff and
effluent (NPS 1977; Johnston 2000; UMCES 2004). Water quality concerns in this area include high
nutrient loads, turbidity, some heavy metals, and toxic chemicals from stormwater runoff, combined
sewer overflows from the District of Columbia during heavy rains, and legacy sources of chemicals. The
portion of the river near and around Dyke Marsh has been listed under Section 303(d) of the Clean Water
Act as impaired for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Most of the waters of the Dyke Marsh project area
are not listed for bacteria; however, Hunting Creek and its adjacent embayment are listed as impaired for
bacteria. These impaired waters include a portion of the northern waters of the Dyke Marsh project
around the Belle Haven Marina (VA DEQ 2012b). The states or the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (USEPA) must therefore develop total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) on the listed water bodies
for these pollutants. TMDLs are the maximum daily amount of pollutant that can enter the waterway and
allow that waterway to attain and maintain water quality standards. A TMDL for PCBs was developed
and approved in 2007 (ICPRB 2007) and is designed to bring the concentrations of PCBs in the water
column down to levels that would meet applicable water quality criteria and ultimately lead to fish tissue
concentrations of PCBs that would not exceed jurisdictional thresholds. As of late 2012, fish consumption

83

Chapter 3: Affected Environment

advisories continue for fish caught in the river around Washington, D.C., due to the higher than normal
concentrations of PCBs found in the tissue of these fish.
In spite of the water quality issues, the marsh and nearby river are able to attain a number of their various
designated uses, such as supporting aquatic life, as required by the Clean Water Act. Under the state
classification of waterways, the part of the river around Dyke Marsh is designated as a Class II waterway,
or tidal water in the Chesapeake Bay or its tributaries, and is to be maintained to support aquatic life and
for beneficial uses such as swimming and boating. The Virginia Department of Environmental Quality
has noted that the area around Dyke Marsh supports aquatic life uses and wildlife, although it does not
support fish consumption in the area due to the accumulation of PCBs in fish tissue. The Virginia
Department of Environmental Quality also noted that the waters within the Dyke Marsh project boundary
support recreational use of the marsh, although the waters immediately north of the project boundary
cannot support recreational use (VA DEQ 2012a) due to elevated levels of the bacterium Escherichia coli
(E. coli). This bacterium is an indicator organism for other pathogens, and its presence can pose health
risks to those who experience full-body exposure (e.g., from swimming), or even partial exposure to
waters being discharged from the Hunting Creek/Cameron Run tributary. The District of Columbia and
the USEPA developed a bacteria TMDL for the portion of the Potomac and its tributaries under District
jurisdiction, but the Virginia TMDL for bacteria has not been developed.

FLOODPLAINS
Floodplains are fluvial lands adjacent to freshwater streams and rivers that receive floodwaters once the
water has overtopped the bank of the main channel. This is typically the result of a higher than normal
influx of upstream water supplies (water moving from higher elevations to lower elevations). Floodplains
are important resources in the storage and filtering of these floodwaters. Dyke Marsh provides several
floodplain functions and values, including flood storage and natural moderation of floods, nutrient
reduction, wildlife habitat for floodplain species, scenic open space.
A flood zone is an area subject to the risk of flooding by any natural means, either by water cresting the
banks of channels (fluvial floodplain) or by tidal storm surges. Tidal storm surges occur when water is
pushed by high winds from a low elevation to a higher elevation because of coastal storms and hurricanes.
Dyke Marsh is located in the upper reaches of the Potomac River estuary where freshwater discharges
from the Potomac River headwaters are present. Flooding of the project site is more closely associated
with winds, changing barometric pressure, and storm surges than with influx from spring runoff. This is
due primarily to the fact that the average land elevation is near sea level, and the river, has a large flood
storage capacity.
The maximum elevation throughout Dyke Marsh is approximately +6 feet relative to mean low water.
Flooding of the entire project area only occasionally occurs. The Federal Emergency Management
Agency has identified the entire extent of Dyke Marsh to be flood zone affected environment, or below
the 100-year flood elevation of 10.8 feet National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 (FEMA 1990; County
of Fairfax 2010).

saturated soils. In these forests, receding water leaves silt clinging to the
lower trunks of many trees. These trees then send out new adventitious
roots from the buried trunk into the soil just below the surface. Floodplain forests are characterized by a
dense understory of herbaceous plants that grow rapidly during summer months in the absence of woody
shrubs. These forests become established on building banks and in areas with sandbars or sandy beaches
with natural levees where light, wind-blown seeds germinate and establish in the moist open areas (Searcy
n.d.). Throughout the history of Dyke Marsh, the floodplain forest has remained a relatively stable
community (NPS 1993), with the floodplain’s co-dominant tree species being pumpkin ash and red
maple. Swamp forest, temporarily and seasonally flooded forest, such as Central Appalachian Maple/Ash
Swamp Forest, is also present in Dyke Marsh on disturbed mesic areas underlain by rich soils with
moderately high base saturation levels (NVI 2009).

Vegetation and Wetlands

Marsh Wetland Vegetation
Dyke Marsh contains an extensive,
valuable wetland complex
characterized as a freshwater tidal
mixed high marsh, which is the
principal marsh community along all
the estuarine rivers in the northern half
of Virginia, from the Potomac River to
the James River. This association
occupies the higher-elevation zone of
freshwater to slightly oligohaline
(brackish) river marshes. These are
mixed, dense, and often diverse
marshes with highly variable species
composition and patch dominance.
Vegetation occurring in wetland areas
of Dyke Marsh is described in the
following “Wetlands” section.
Vegetation at Dyke Marsh
More than 373 species of vascular
plants (representing 93 families) have been inventoried in the marsh proper and its adjoining swamp
forest and floodplain forest (Xu 1991; Steury 2011). Of these 373 species, 60 are species found only in
wetland areas (Engelhardt, Seagle, and Hopfensperger 2005). Elevation is a good predictor of vascular
plant species distribution at Dyke Marsh. For example, although both annual and perennial dominant
species of the marsh can occur on the majority of the marsh elevation gradient, orange jewelweed was not
identified at elevations lower than 0.15 meter (6 inches), and narrow-leaved spatterdock (Nuphar
sagittifolia) was not identified at elevations higher than 0.49 meter (1.6 feet) (UMCES 2004).

WETLANDS
Most of the vegetation of Dyke Marsh is classified as wetland vegetation. Wetlands are areas inundated or
saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support a prevalence of
vegetation adapted for life in saturated soil conditions (USACE 1987). Wetlands provide important
environmental and economic functions and values to their immediate environment and to their adjacent
upland areas. For example, wetlands trap sediment and pollutants from stormwater runoff and provide a
natural filter before this runoff enters local waterways. Wetlands can store large volumes of water and
function as a “sponge,” reducing the likelihood of flooding during storm events and protecting the
shoreline from erosion. Additionally, wetlands provide excellent habitat for fish, shellfish, and wildlife.
The USACE requires that an area be dominated by hydrophytic vegetation, contain hydric soils, and
display indicators of wetland hydrology to be considered a wetland. The National Park Service (NPS)
definition of wetlands is similar to that of the USEPA and USACE; however, the NPS definition is
broader in scope and affords a greater jurisdiction than that of the USACE. The NPS classifies wetlands
based on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) Classification of Wetlands and Deepwater
Habitats of the United States, also known as the Cowardin classification system. Based on the Cowardin
classification system, a wetland must have one or more of the following attributes:


The habitat at least periodically supports predominantly hydrophytic (wetland) vegetation.



The substrate is predominantly undrained hydric soil.

Final Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and Long-term Management Plan / EIS

87

Chapter 3: Affected Environment



The substrate is nonsoil and saturated with water, or is covered by shallow water at some time
during the growing season (Cowardin et al. 1979).

As described above, Dyke Marsh has tidal freshwater marsh, swamp forest, and floodplain forest, with
wetland areas within the forested areas. Two wetland types, as identified by the National Wetlands
Inventory, comprise the majority of the preserve: palustrine (freshwater), persistent emergent, seasonally
tidal (PEM1R); and palustrine, broad-leaved deciduous forested, seasonally tidal (PFO1R). The remainder
of the wetlands in the preserve are composed of smaller, fragmented wetland areas and are a combination
of scrub-shrub wetlands and forested wetlands, including palustrine, broad-leaved deciduous scrub-shrub,
seasonally tidal (PSS1R); palustrine, broad-leaved deciduous scrub-shrub / persistent emergent,
seasonally tidal (PSS1/EM1R); palustrine, broad-leaved deciduous forested, temporarily tidal (PFO1S);
palustrine, broad-leaved deciduous forested, temporarily flooded nontidal (PFO1A); and palustrine,
broad-leaved deciduous forested / persistent emergent, seasonally tidal (PFO1/EM1R) (USFWS 2000).
These wetlands can be loosely grouped into freshwater emergent wetlands, freshwater forested wetlands,
and freshwater scrub-shrub wetlands, as well as the riverine wetlands that form the guts in the marsh
(figure 3-4). The forested wetlands also loosely correspond with the swamp forest and floodplain forest
vegetation communities discussed above.
The PEM1R wetland plant community is dominated by several different species, such as narrowleaf
cattail (Typha angustifolia), spotted touch-me-not or orange jewelweed (Impatiens capensis), rice
cutgrass (Leersia oryzoides), arrow arum (Peltandra virginica), sweetflag (Acorus calamus), river bulrush
(Bolboschoenus fluviatilus), and spatterdock (Nuphar lutea) (Hopfensperger 2007). The PFO1R wetland
plant community is dominated by pumpkin ash (Fraxinus profunda), box elder (Acer negundo), red maple
(Acer rubrum), common water willow (Justicia americana), and silver maple (Acer saccharinum),
(Hopfensperger 2007).

CHANGES IN VEGETATION OVER THE YEARS
According to available research and historical data, substantial changes have occurred in the vegetation
communities of Dyke Marsh in recent decades. These changes demonstrate the dynamics found in an
active marsh ecosystem (NPS 2000b) and provide evidence of changing sedimentation patterns in the
marsh (UMCES 2004). The presence of SAV has increased in recent years, despite experiencing an
overall decline in past decades. Prior to the 1930s, SAV had a major presence in the marsh and
surrounding waters (UMCES 2004). SAV began to decline in the late 1930s and was not recorded as
present in the 1977 Dyke Marsh Environmental Assessment (NPS 1977). SAV began to reappear in the
early 1980s, and by 1986 the cover of SAV in continuously inundated portions of the marsh was 70
percent to 100 percent (UMCES 2004). Prior to 1996, various reports concluded that SAV was
reestablishing in the Potomac River, including Dyke Marsh (Johnston 2000). In 2003, Hurricane Isabel
affected the majority of the SAV near Dyke Marsh. Beds that were mapped in 2002 were not observed in
2003. VIMS data from 2003 show zero percent coverage within Dyke Marsh waters; however, by 2008,
SAV coverage was mostly between 70 and 100 percent (VIMS 2014).
The dominant SAV species is hydrilla (Hydrilla verticillata), a nonnative species. Other species include
eelgrass (Vallisneria americana), waternymph (Najas minor), and common hornwort (Ceratophyllum
demersum). Both waternymph and common hornwort are also nonnative. Although native species are
preferred, nonnative SAV still provide functions and values similar to native species. They provide
sources of food, safety, and habitat for aquatic animals; thus, SAV beds are valued even if they are of
lower quality (Valley, Cross, and Radomski 2004; NPS 2010c).

Chapter 3: Affected Environment

NONNATIVE INVASIVE PLANT SPECIES
Several nonnative invasive plant species exist in and around Dyke Marsh. They include a possibly
nonnative variety of hedge false bindweed (Calystegia sepium), lady’s thumb (Polygonum persicaria L.),
hydrilla, brittle naiad (Najas minor), common reed, and climbing nightshade (Solanum dulcamara). In the
marsh itself, there are two small existing patches of Phragmites that are currently being managed by the
park with NPS-approved herbicides and physical removal. The area west of Haul Road, which has been
cut off from tidal inundation, contains several invasive species including porcelain berry (Ampelopsis
brevipedunculata), bush honeysuckle (Lonicera amur), Japanese honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica), and
English ivy (Hedera helix). Purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria) is another known invasive species that
has been observed in very small patches on the edges of the islands and the marsh; however, no purple
loosestrife has been observed in the interior of the emergent marsh (UMCES 2004; Hopfensperger 2007).

FISH AND WILDLIFE
One of the most important functions of
marshes and wetlands is to provide habitat
and food web support for fish and wildlife.
The fish and wildlife of Dyke Marsh are
indicative of species that occupy the
freshwater and terrestrial communities in
the Washington, D.C., area (NPS 2000b).
Previous dredging of the marsh has greatly
reduced its size, changed its hydrologic
functions, and altered the amount and type
of habitat available to support both
resident and migratory fish and wildlife
species. However, despite these
alterations, the marsh provides habitat for
38 fish species, 16 reptile species, 14
amphibian species, 34 mammal species,
more than 200 bird species, and many
Five-lined Skinks
species of invertebrates (UMCES 2004;
Barrows and Kjar 2003; Johnston 2000; Mangold et al. 2004; FODM 2012). The number of breeding bird
species in the marsh varies; in a 2003 breeding bird survey, there were at least 46 species of birds
confirmed to be breeding in the marsh (Booth 2006), but in 2011 there were 40 confirmed breeding
species (FODM 2012).

TERRESTRIAL WILDLIFE
Amphibians and Reptiles
Many species of amphibians and reptiles inhabit the emergent marsh, the most common being the
bullfrog, leopard frog, common snapping turtle, painted turtle, and several species of water snakes (for
scientific names, see table 3-3) (NPS 1977). The most commonly observed of these species are listed in
table 3-3.

Birds
Dyke Marsh is important to many resident and migratory bird species, which form the most conspicuous
and diverse faunal element at Dyke Marsh. Currently, at least 40 species are confirmed breeding species.
A survey of breeding birds in 2003 found 46 species that were confirmed to be breeding in the marsh, 6
species that were probable breeders, 15 species that were possible breeders, and 25 species that make use
of the marsh at some part of the year, but were deemed not to be in suitable breeding habitat (Cartwright
2004; see appendix B for the full list of breeding bird species in 2011). A more recent survey found 40
species of confirmed breeding birds, 9 species of probable breeders, and an additional 19 species that
were possibly making use of the marsh for breeding habitat (FODM 2011). Migratory birds generally
inhabit Dyke Marsh from July 9 to November 11 (NPS 2000b). Table 3-4 provides a list of some of the
commonly observed bird species in Dyke Marsh.

The bald eagle, black duck, mallard, green wing teal, Virginia rail, osprey, and great blue heron are
common in the marsh (NPS 2000b). Dyke Marsh also supports the only known nesting population of
marsh wrens (Cistothorus palustris) in the upper Potomac tidal zone, although this species began a
decline in 2000 and has shown only limited indications of recovery in succeeding years (FODM 2009).
According to a study of reproductive success of marsh wrens by Spencer (2000), territories of male marsh
wrens, which prefer dense, tall vegetation near more steeply sloped shorelines, comprised 13.89 acres (30
percent) of the total available habitat in Dyke Marsh. All the successful breeding nests of marsh wrens
were found attached only to cattail. Alternative vegetation species with attached nests include sweetflag,
swamp mallow (Hibiscus moscheutos), common reed, tidalmarsh amaranth (Amaranthus cannabinus),
rush (Juncus spp.), and river bulrush.
Bird populations at Dyke Marsh have changed over time. For instance, ospreys, warbling vireos, and
prothonotary warblers have noticeably increased their population size since 1993. In 2008, an estimated
total of 21 prothonotary warbler territorial males were documented in at least two nest locations, whereas
such sightings were rare in the early 1990s. Another example of the dynamic change occurring in bird
populations is the replacement of American crows by fish crows as Dyke Marsh breeders (for scientific
names, see table 3-4). American crows have not bred at Dyke Marsh since 2005. Breeding pairs of fish
crows were documented in 2006 and again in 2008 (FODM 2009). Breeding pairs of both purple martins
(Progne subis) and screech owls (Megascops asio) were documented in 2012 and 2013.

Mammals
A total of 34 species of mammals, with the majority being insectivores, have been observed at Dyke
Marsh (UMCES 2004; Johnston 2000). Among these, the most commonly observed species are listed in
table 3-5.

One species that has been severely affected by human activity is the muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus). This
species historically had large stable populations in the marsh but is now in decline, presumably as a result
of dredging activities, which have dramatically changed the macro-environment and size of the marsh
(NPS 1993).

AQUATIC WILDLIFE
Fish
Dyke Marsh provides habitat for a large variety fish species. Fish habitat consists of the marsh surface,
vegetated and unvegetated near shore shallows (less than 3 feet deep) and some deeper pools (between 15
feet and 25 feet deep) (Mangold et al. 2004; NPS 2009f). Thirty-seven fish species were identified in a
three-year inventory conducted by the USFWS between 2001 and 2003. The 3 most common fish species
were bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus), pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus), and banded
killifish (Fundulus diaphanus). Dyke Marsh provides suitable nursery habitat for juveniles of American
shad (Alosa sapidissima), blueback herring (Alosa aestivalis), and alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus). Other
species found in the marsh include white perch (Morone americana), yellow perch (Perca flavescens),
striped bass (Morone saxatilis), largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), and possibly Atlantic sturgeon
(Acipenser oxyrhynchus) (Mangold et al. 2004). Two tagged sturgeon from a 2007 study stayed mostly
downstream, but passed outside Dyke Marsh on their way upstream to spawn and did not enter in the
boundaries of Dyke Marsh (Kynard et al. 2007). Several anadromous fish, which live in the ocean but
breed in freshwater, use the Potomac River for spawning, during which time they are more susceptible to
disturbances. Examples of such fish are alewife, blueback herring, white perch, American shad, and
striped bass (NPS 2000b).

Chapter 3: Affected Environment

Invertebrates
The exact composition of the benthic community in Dyke Marsh is not known, but reports show the
presence of a variety of worms, mollusks, arthropods, and insects (UMCES 2004). A variety of native
snails and clams are common in the marsh, as well as species characteristic of polluted waters, such as
tubifex worms (Tubifex tubifex), leeches (Macrobdella decora), and chironomid flies (family:
Chironomidae). Over 300 individual species were identified in the preserve during an arthropod inventory
conducted by the NPS and the Laboratory of Entomology and Biodiversity at Georgetown University
(Barrows and Kjar 2003). Cavey et al. (2013) documented 36 species of leaf beetles from Dyke Marsh.

SPECIES OF SPECIAL CONCERN
As noted in chapter 1, although there are no federally listed species found in the marsh, several statelisted species of both plant and animal are found in Dyke Marsh. Based on input from the USFWS, the
USACE, NPS staff, and local academics with knowledge of the marsh, six state-listed species of special
concern occur in the preserve, including two bird species and four plant species (table 3-6). In addition,
the marsh is used as foraging habitat by the bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), a recently delisted
species; one bald eagle nest was recently confirmed in the forest adjacent to the marsh between the Haul
Road and Hog Island Gut (Steury, pers. comm. 2014). Other bird species, the king rail (Rallus elegans),
Virginia rail (Rallus limicola), and sora (Porzana carolina) are extremely rare transients in Dyke Marsh
and are not known to nest in or near the marsh. These species are included on the 2013 VA DCR Species
Watch List as S3 (king rail and Virginia rail) and S2 (sora) for presence only (nonbreeding status) (VA
DCR 2014).
In 1984, the endangered green floater (Lasmigona subviridis), a small mussel, was found along the
Potomac River, but not in the marsh (UMCES 2004). Also, two species of sturgeon, the Atlantic and
shortnose, have been found in the Potomac River, but have not been found in Dyke Marsh. It is possible
that both species of sturgeon may pass by the area on the way to and from spawning up river, but there are
no data showing that they use the marsh in any way (Kynard et al. 2007; Mangold et al. 2004).

LEAST BITTERN
The least bittern (Ixobrychus exilis), considered a species of special concern by the Commonwealth of
Virginia and the NPS, typically inhabits herbaceous or scrub-shrub wetlands, favoring marshes with tall
emergent vegetation. Heavy growths of cattail, bulrush, bur-reed, and reeds are favored feeding sites,
where the birds can forage in shallow water or along banks (NatureServe 2009).

94

George Washington Memorial Parkway

Species of Special Concern

The birds typically arrive at nesting grounds in April or early May. Peak nesting occurs from late May to
early July, and birds leave breeding areas by September or October. Nesting usually occurs among dense,
tall vegetation, including cattail, sedge, and bulrush. Nests are built over shallow water (0.3–3.3 feet [0.1–
1.0 meter] deep) using the surrounding emergent vegetation to create a nesting canopy. Currently, there
are fewer than six nesting birds at Dyke Marsh per year (NatureServe 2009; NPS 2009f), but they have
been confirmed to be breeding in the marsh.
Loss of wetlands poses the most substantial threat to this species. Wetland losses are primarily caused by
drainage, pollution, urbanization, agricultural practices, dredging, and siltation (resulting from erosion of
farmlands and runoff containing insecticides). Marshland invasions by common reed and purple
loosestrife may alter and degrade least bittern habitats as well (NatureServe 2009).

SWAMP SPARROW
The swamp sparrow (Melospiza georgiana) is a small perching bird that uses a variety of wetland
habitats, including herbaceous and scrub-shrub wetlands (NatureServe 2009). Habitat requirements for
this species include shallow, standing water; low, dense cover; and scattered, elevated perches. Swamp
sparrows are ground and water feeders, and frequently forage on the water’s edge (Wiland 2007). Swamp
sparrows are uncommon in the marsh, particularly depending on the season. Single individuals have been
confirmed (Cartwright, pers. comm. 2013), and breeding pairs have also been confirmed (FODM 2009,
2011; Johnston 2000; Cartwright, pers. comm. 2013). Breeding habitat for the swamp sparrow includes
brackish and freshwater marshes, bogs, and swamps. Nests are sometimes built on the ground, but most
are located above water (1.0 foot [0.3 meter]) in dense vegetation like cattails, grass, or sedge
(NatureServe 2009; Wiland 2007).
Threats to the swamp sparrow are similar to those of the least bittern. The birds continue to be threatened
by urban and suburban expansion. They are vulnerable to habitat loss through filling and draining of
swamps, bogs, and marshes (Leberman 2009). Additional threats include tidal flooding, which reduces
the reproductive success of the nesting birds (Eyler et al. 1999).

DAVIS’ SEDGE
Davis’ sedge (Carex davisii), which has been found in the park and for the first time in Virginia, is
perennial and is typically found on calcareous soils in floodplain forests (the primary habitat in the
northeast), dry to moist fields or woods, and alluvial meadows. This plant, which flowers from May to
July, is native to eastern North America, ranging from eastern Canada, west to North Dakota, and south to
Texas and Tennessee (Steury 2004; Thompson 2003). Many species rely on the seeds of this plant for
food, including various insects and bird species (Hilty 2009).
Nonnative invasive species are opportunistic and have the potential to outcompete beneficial native
species, such as Davis’ sedge (NPS 2008b). In addition to nonnative species, habitat alteration and loss
pose a great threat to this plant. Habitat alteration and loss result from river impoundment, habitat
fragmentation and conversion, trash dumping, and human disturbance via off-road trails (Thompson
2003).

RIVER BULRUSH
River bulrush (Bolboschoenus fluviatilis), considered a dominant species in the existing marsh (NPS
2009f), is a common and important wetland plant found in dense colonies at the edges of marshes and
along streams in shallow freshwater or mildly brackish wetlands (NHESP 2008; Runkel and Roosa 1999).
This perennial sedge, which flowers from July to September, is found across southern Canada, south to
Final Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and Long-term Management Plan / EIS

95

Chapter 3: Affected Environment

Virginia, and west to California. Waterfowl and ducks use the seeds from this plant as a major source of
food. In addition to providing cover for a variety of wetland animals, river bulrush is also used by
muskrats to construct houses (NHESP 2008; Runkel and Roosa 1999).
Threats to river bulrush include habitat disruption, loss, and degradation. Other threats include fertilizers
and septic systems, which can degrade water quality and possibly increase the success of many nonnative
plant species that take over the species’ habitat (NHESP 2008).

ROUGH AVENS
Rough avens (Geum laciniatum) is found in a wide range of habitats, including hardwood forests,
limestone woodlands, muddy riverbanks, forested swamps, marshes, and roadsides. This perennial herb is
found in most of the United States east of the Mississippi, and flowers from June to July with fruit
developing from mid-July to mid-September (NYNHP 2009). At Dyke Marsh, rough avens grows against
the edge of Haul Road and is being lost to succession as other plants around it mature and outcompete the
rough avens (NPS 2009f).

GIANT BUR-REED
Giant bur-reed (Sparganium eurycarpum) grows on mud, sand, or gravel and can be found in shallow
standing water, on the edges of streams and marshes, and in brackish swamps (NHDFL 2002; Runkel and
Roosa 1999), and was found in Dyke Marsh during Natural Heritage Inventory surveys (Johnston 2000).
This perennial aquatic herb is considered a good soil binder at marsh edges and along streams (Runkel
and Roosa 1999). The plant flowers in early June with fruit developing from July to September (Runkel
and Roosa 1999; NHDFL 2002). Bur-reed occurs throughout a large portion of North America, and
provides food and shelter for a variety of wetland animal species (Runkel and Roosa 1999). Threats to
giant bur-reed are similar to those for the plant species listed above, and include vegetation loss, poor
water quality, and invasive nonnative species (NHDFL 2002).

ARCHEOLOGICAL RESOURCES
An archeological assessment of the Dyke Marsh vicinity was completed in 2009 (NPS 2009a). This study
included a surface inspection of the upland areas adjacent to the marsh to look for indicators of that
archeological resources might be present, the compilation of a detailed history of the property, and a
review of the history of the marsh itself to gain an understanding of the potential for archeological sites in
the area. Although an assessment was performed, no archeological survey was conducted, and no sites
have been recorded in the marsh or on the adjacent upland areas. The assessment concluded with
recommendations for a formal survey that would identify specific archeological sites at Dyke Marsh.
Based on studies of sea level rise in the Chesapeake estuary, the marsh was dry land until at least 6000
BC and probably until 3000 BC. Therefore, Paleo-Indian and Archaic period campsites may be present in
the undisturbed portions of the marsh. Because no underwater prehistoric archeological sites have ever
been found in the Potomac River, the existence of such sites is speculative, but the possibility of their
presence cannot be discounted. Sites related to the use of the marsh after it was diked in the 19th century,
such as hunting cabins or illegal taverns, might also be present. Where dredging has occurred, these sites
have likely been destroyed. The upland areas adjacent to the marsh also have high potential for
archeological sites, mostly for the Woodland Period, circa 1000 BC to AD 1600, and for the 19th century.

Historic Structures and Districts, and Cultural Landscapes

HISTORIC STRUCTURES AND DISTRICTS, AND CULTURAL
LANDSCAPES
HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF DYKE MARSH
During colonial times, Dyke Marsh was part of a plantation called West Grove (NPS 2009a). The owners,
the West family, were prominent planters and associates of their neighbor George Washington. The
marshland was actually not claimed during the initial patenting of land in the area. The claiming of land
during the initial “land rush” period of the 1660s was based on highly inaccurate surveys, and in 1762,
Colonel John West discovered that more than 1,000 acres around his home had never been claimed. He
then patented 295 acres of the marsh and two other tracts.
The marsh remained part of West Grove until 1796, when the property was divided among four heirs and
sold. After passing through the hands of speculators, the marsh and the rest of West Grove were acquired
from 1811 to 1816 by Augustus J. Smith. The Fairfax County tax books show that by 1819, Augustus
Smith owned approximately 1,322 acres located between the south bank of Great Hunting Creek and the
west bank of the Potomac River. Smith was a physician by training and commanded in the Virginia
militia during the War of 1812. His agricultural operations focused on livestock and dairying.
Another project of Smith’s was the construction of a dike around the marsh. His intention was to turn the
tidal marsh into a large meadow by excluding the waters of the Potomac. Smith expected that the
proximity of his meadow to the Potomac River’s shipping channel would allow seagoing vessels to
unload cargo closer to the shore, turning the otherwise unusable marshland into a port. No information
has been found indicating that ships used the area. Although his attempts to create a new port on the
Potomac River had failed, Smith continued raising livestock in the newly claimed meadow. After his
death, Smith’s children put West Grove up for sale; the advertisement, published in the Alexandria
Gazette on November 4, 1831, provides a good description of the property at that time:
West Grove, residence of the late Col. Augustine J. Smith, for sale opposite Alexandria
on Great Hunting Creek at its confluence with the river Potomac, extending and binding
on both streams upwards of three miles and embracing one of the most extensive and
valuable river bottoms and pocosins in this country. The pocosin has been recently
reclaimed by the construction of a dyke with gravel brought from the hills, at great
expense, by which it is perfectly secured from overflowing…upwards of 1,800
acres…includes two fisheries…the mansion house is large and convenient, situated
within a few yards of a never failing spring of the finest water, near which is erected a
large two story stone and brick dairy, the stream passing through it. Kitchen,
smokehouse, quarters, blacksmith shop, all brick…large new barn, stables, corn house,
carriage house, etc.…on the lower part of the farm, called Wigton, are…brick overseers
house, orchard, etc.…(NPS 2009a)
Dyke Marsh remained part of farms owned by various families until 1891. During the 19th century the
area’s importance as a farming community declined, and instead it attracted residential and business
development, as well as hunters and fishermen. The swamps and marshes along this stretch of the
Potomac were sometimes called ‘Hell Hole,’ said by the Alexandria Gazette to be
a grand and wild place, and, save for the miasma and mosquitos which reign there preeminent, would be a magnificent abode for those fond of following the pursuits of
Nimrod and Walton (Virta 2012a).

Final Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and Long-term Management Plan / EIS

97

Chapter 3: Affected Environment

Nimrod was the Biblical hunter, Walton the author of the Compleat Angler. Numerous small shacks were
built along the river to shelter sportsmen, and stores were set up to cater to their needs.
The Potomac’s banks also drew shadier characters. After the Civil War the city’s authorities tried to crack
down on the prostitution, gambling, and drinking that had burgeoned during the conflict. Some operators
responded by embarking on house boats that could be sailed to other jurisdictions when law enforcement
in one state or city grew troublesome. These “arks” often frequented the Virginia shore of the Potomac,
since the state boundary between Virginia and Maryland ran along that bank. This probably included
Dyke Marsh. Some of the fishermen’s cabins built out over the river, legally in Maryland but accessible
only from Virginia, may have been houses of gambling or prostitution. During Prohibition, bootleggers
used the same tactics, and there are numerous stories of illegal stills in the marshlands. In 1931 the
Washington Post recounted the seizure of illegal liquor at Gus Quayle’s “place” a on the dyke itself (Virta
2012a).
In 1891 the farm that included Dyke Marsh was purchased by agents of the New Alexandria Land and
River Improvement Company. These developers planned to construct a new town, complete with streetcar
service to Alexandria and Washington. The streetcar line was completed in 1892, but soon afterward the
project was abandoned, a victim of the depression that gripped the country from 1892 to 1896. The New
Alexandria Company lingered for a while but filed for bankruptcy in 1924. In 1929, trustees of the
company sold property to the U.S. government for the construction of the Mount Vernon Memorial
Highway. Much of the rest of the property, including the marsh, came into the hands of Bucknell
University.
On December 21, 1929, Bucknell granted the U.S. government a 26-acre, 200-foot-wide tract for a rightof-way to construct the Mount Vernon Memorial Highway along the western edge of Dyke Marsh along
the same route as the former Washington, Alexandria, and Mount Vernon Electric Railway.
M. B. Barlow, an Alexandria businessman, is credited with the original concept for a road from
Washington to Mount Vernon in the late 1880s. Interest in the project declined with the construction of
the Washington, Alexandria, and Mount Vernon Electric Railway. The number of visitors to Mount
Vernon increased during the 1890s, most arriving by rail (NPS 1994). The concept of a parkway was
revisited by the 1902 McMillan Commission, which stated that the palisades along the Potomac River
from Great Falls to Mount Vernon should be safeguarded. It envisioned a parkway, the purpose of which
would be recreation restricted to pleasure vehicles, “arranged with regard for scenery, topography, and
similar features rather than for directness” (NPS 1994). Authorization for the highway was not received
until 1928, spurred by the ever-increasing amount of motor traffic, poor road conditions, and, most
importantly, the approaching bicentennial of George Washington’s birth in 1932. Three routes were
studied, but the one selected followed the riverfront. The highway, built by the Bureau of Public Roads,
was the first modern highway built by the federal government and was important in popularizing
advanced highway engineering and landscape design features in parkways and highways throughout the
country. In order to produce a seemingly natural landscape, unusual care was taken to wind the road
around preexisting trees and use large native and nursery transplants. The completed road, extending 15.2
miles from the gates of Mount Vernon to Memorial Bridge in Arlington, was open by January 1932,
although planting continued throughout the remainder of the year.
Throughout the planning and construction process, emphasis was put on purchasing land adjacent to the
highway to protect the land from incompatible uses. Dyke Marsh’s woods, meadows, and marshlands
were planned from the outset of the project to be a 500-acre bird refuge and wildlife sanctuary. The
densely vegetated areas of Dyke Marsh and surrounding woodlands were part of the designer’s plans to
manipulate motorists’ experience along the highway, alternating broad vistas with enclosed woodland
corridors through selective cutting and planting (NPS 1994).

George Washington Memorial Parkway

Historic Structures and Districts, and Cultural Landscapes

The creation of the George Washington Memorial Parkway was authorized by the Capper-Cramton Act;
an “Act providing for a comprehensive development of the park and playground system of the National
Capital.” The act stated the parkway was
to include the shores of the Potomac, and adjacent lands, from Mount Vernon to a point
above the Great Falls on the Virginia side, except within the city of Alexandria, and from
Fort Washington to a similar point above the Great Falls except within the District of
Columbia, and including the protection and preservation of the natural scenery of the
Gorge and the Great Falls of the Potomac, the preservation of the historic Patowmack
Canal, and the acquisition of that portion of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal below Point
of Rocks. (Capper-Cramton Act)
The bill also called for the transfer of the Mount Vernon Memorial Highway to become part of the
George Washington Memorial Parkway (NPS 1996, Capper-Cramton Act).
The remainder of the Dyke Marsh property was not acquired by the federal government for another 30
years. In 1935, reeling from the Depression, Bucknell sold the marsh to the SSGC, who began dredging
the marsh in the 1940s. The land was acquired by the NPS in 1960, but the agreement allowed Smoot to
continue dredging for an additional 20 to 30 years. Dredging in the marsh continued until 1972. By that
time, about half the marsh had been destroyed, and most of the dike had been removed.
Currently, the only visible remains of West Grove are two short sections of the old dike, along the south
side. The location of the West Grove house is outside the project area, and no remains of any historic
structures associated with that property are visible (NPS 2009a).

Present Conditions of the Historic District and the Dyke
Today Dyke Marsh is part of the George Washington Memorial Parkway, which is listed in the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) as a historic district (NPS 1981; NPS 1995). The historic district is
nationally significant under Criteria B and C. Under Criterion C, the district is significant for its
landscape architecture as part of the long and continuous planning of the Washington, D.C., region. As a
parkway, the district has several areas of significance: community planning and development, landscape
architecture, transportation, commemoration, and preservation. The parkway was a product of master
landscape architects such as Gilmore D. Clarke. The parkway also has significance as a means of
conservation, protecting scenic and recreational resources from development along the river corridor.
Under Criterion B the historic district is significant for its commemorative association with George
Washington and Clara Barton (for the Clara Barton Parkway in Maryland). The older Mount Vernon
section and the upper parkway commemorate the life of Washington, who had a strong association with
the Potomac River corridor and was responsible for the selection of the nation’s new capital site.
The stretch of the parkway adjacent to Dyke Marsh preserves much of this original vision. Traffic flows
unimpeded, as the original planners intended. The heaviest use of the parkway has become commuting,
however, rather than its original intention for recreational use. The parkway there passes through an
extensive complex of woodlands and marshes, which still draws birds and other wildlife. Dense trees
screen the parkway from residential development on the inland side, contributing to an atmosphere
removed from urban bustle.
The only remaining portions of the historical dike are located on the south side of Dyke Marsh, and are
occasionally visible at low tide. No surveys have been completed on the conditions of these remaining

Final Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and Long-term Management Plan / EIS

99

Chapter 3: Affected Environment

portions of the dike. All other structures associated with 19th or early 20th century land uses are no longer
extant. Other than the dike, there are no structures in the survey area.

CULTURAL LANDSCAPES
Dyke Marsh has not yet been formally identified as a cultural landscape, although it may qualify as a
component landscape of the George Washington Memorial Parkway historic district. As defined by the
NPS, a component landscape is “a definable physical area of a landscape that contributes to the
significance of a National Register property, or, in some cases, is individually eligible for listing in the
National Register” (NPS 1998b). A future cultural landscape inventory would be needed to formally
identify the character-defining features of the Dyke Marsh landscape as they relate to the Mount Vernon
Memorial Highway. The scenic qualities of the marsh area and the views to it from the parkway are noted
in the NRHP nomination and cultural landscape report (NPS 1995; NPS n.d.c).
The cultural landscape report identifies the design principles, or the landscape features that defined the
original design principles, that guided the planning of the Mount Vernon Memorial Highway: alignment,
grading, planting, views, structures, and materials. South of Alexandria, the road was characterized by its
horizontally and vertically curving alignment. This alignment allowed the road to follow the land’s
natural topography and controlled driving speeds, which were originally designed to be 35 miles per hour
(mph). Median strips, wide lanes, and limited access were also designed to increase safety. Separated
byways for horseback riding were planned to parallel the road, although only the section from Hunting
Creek to New Alexandria was originally laid out. Although grading took place, transitions in grade were
made with long vertical curves. Areas that were regraded were rounded for 10 feet to ease the transition
between the new road and the existing topography.
Plantings along the parkway were to follow “the natural arrangement of native plants in large masses, in
border plantations” (NPS n.d.c). These plantings were to screen objectionable views, emphasize important
views, separate and accentuate pictures in the landscape composition, preserve open, unobstructed vision
for traffic, and minimize maintenance. The overall effect was “to create a varied sequence of large bays
and narrow corridors” achieved by new plantings and selective clearing (NPS n.d.c).
Views along the highway were to prepare the traveler headed south from Washington to Mount Vernon
with views up, down, and across the Potomac River. Views were constructed through the plantings, which
framed a succession of scenes.
Buildings and structures were designed especially for the highway, to include concession buildings at
Mount Vernon, bus shelters constructed of stained timber, and rustic cedar lighting standards along the
Mount Vernon Memorial Highway. Small-scale features included directional signs and guardrails that
were designed to preserve the memorial character of the road (NPS n.d.c).
The Dyke Marsh section of Mount Vernon Memorial Highway provided natural views of the waterfront
and the marsh. As such, existing plantings around the marsh were cleared as little as possible. Minor
plantings were added to finish the edges between the road and existing woodland. Azalea species, St.
John’s wort (Hypericum spp.), and honeysuckle were used in large masses along the road, sometimes
replacing the wood guardrail. Trees included hornbeam (Carpinus caroliniana), dogwood (Cornus spp.),
and eastern redbud (Cercis canadensis). Small-scale features originally in the section included rustic
guardrails and cedar light standards. Views from this section included a view across the river where the
road widened to include an overlook turnout. (NPS n.d.c).

Visitor Use and Experience

Present Conditions of the Cultural Landscape
The Dyke Marsh section of the parkway remained relatively unchanged until the 1984 Improvements
Program. Circulation was modified with the improvement of the Morningside Lane intersection, which
had become a major commuter traffic funnel. A deceleration lane was added for southbound traffic. New
curbs, gutters, and underdrains were also constructed at that time. Other changes to the parkway included
the removal of the cedar light standards, signs, and wood guardrails. The natural growth of the woodland
edge has narrowed space and constricted views.
Other than the landscape features associated with the George Washington Memorial Parkway, the only
cultural landscape elements in the survey area are the extant sections of the dike. Those are the only
remaining structures in Dyke Marsh.
The marsh is visible from the parkway at certain points, as the parkway passes in and out of wooded
areas. The parkway also passes over the marsh where Hog Island Gut extends to the west of the parkway,
offering sweeping views of the marsh. The southern portion of the marsh is visible just north of the
former promontory that was dredged. It is in this area that the remnants of the historic dike are located.

VISITOR USE AND EXPERIENCE
The George Washington Memorial Parkway links a group of parks and places that provide a variety of
experiences to millions of people each year. These parks include historic sites and recreational areas, such
as Jones Point Lighthouse within Jones Point Park, Riverside Park, Fort Hunt Park, and Mount Vernon.
The parkway connecting these sites also provides visitors with an opportunity to travel to historic and
recreational areas, as well as to natural areas such as Dyke Marsh, through a planned and landscaped road.
The parkway is a component of the much larger system of parks, parkways, and playgrounds in the
National Capital Region.
From a visitor use and experience perspective,
one of the mission goals of the park is to
provide a comprehensive park, parkway, and
playground system in the National Capital
region (NPS 2005b). As such, recreation
becomes a fundamental element for the park
units. As a scenic natural area, Dyke Marsh
represents a relatively scarce resource in this
highly urbanized location, both as an open
green space and as a wetland area. In the
project area, typical recreational uses include
hiking, bird-watching, and nature study.
Anglers also frequent the area, and enjoy
fishing the deeper holes created by the
dredging. Bicyclists and people walking their
dogs also make use of the area on the multi-use
trail alongside the parkway, along Haul Road,
or on the lands around the edges of the marsh.

View along Haul Road

Belle Haven Marina, located adjacent to the northern edge of the marsh on NPS property, and operated by
a concessionaire, provides boat storage, sailing instruction, and canoe and kayak rentals. Boating,
including paddle sports, sailing, and some power boating, is a popular activity in the open waters near the
marsh. The Mount Vernon Trail allows for access to Belle Haven Picnic Area, which is maintained by the
Final Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and Long-term Management Plan / EIS

101

Chapter 3: Affected Environment

NPS as a public use facility, allowing visitors to walk, jog, or bike from Mount Vernon to Theodore
Roosevelt Island and alongside the marsh. The Belle Haven Picnic Area also allows for other passive
recreation, including picnicking, bird-watching, walking, and nature study.
Recreational demand is high for the Mount Vernon Trail, Belle Haven Picnic Area, and the marina,
whereas use within Dyke Marsh is modest in comparison. Dyke Marsh caters primarily to passive
recreation. Although no specific visitor amenities are available at Dyke Marsh and no permanent NPS
interpretive facilities are located in the marsh area, Sunday morning bird walks along Haul Road and the
Mount Vernon Trail near the marsh are conducted by the Friends of Dyke Marsh organization. Also,
periodic interpretation is provided by park staff, volunteers, and Friends of Dyke Marsh (NPS 2000b).
Visitors typically use this area for studying the natural wetland environment, bird- and wildlife-watching,
and nature study. Bulletin boards and waysides in this area provide information on various natural
resources at Dyke Marsh. Use of the Dyke Marsh area for educational programs by local school systems
is rapidly increasing, and the NPS has an active Parks-as-Classrooms Program that makes use of the
marsh for this purpose.
This area is viewed as a national treasure because of its proximity to the nation’s capital and a large
urban/suburban population, because of its history, and because of its current potential for the provision of
ecological services, recreational values, and educational opportunities. Because of its location and setting,
there is an opportunity to enhance environmental education in the Dyke Marsh area. The park has several
educational programs, including “Bridging the Watershed,” and educational wayside exhibits proposed
for the boardwalk at Dyke Marsh (NPS 2005b).
Visitation at George Washington Memorial Parkway generally has ranged between 6.8 million and 7.6
million visitors since 2000. In 2007, the park hosted 6,837,139 recreational visits, of which approximately
85 percent were local residents (Stynes 2011). In 2011, the park hosted 7,417,397 recreational visits (NPS
2012a). The traffic counts at Belle Haven Marina in 2011 included 251,986 vehicles. Assuming many of
the visitors would be groups or families and a corresponding average of 2.6 visitors per car, this equals
approximately 655,163 visitors to Belle Haven, or 8.8 percent of the park’s total recreational visits (NPS
2012a). Based on the most recent Dyke Marsh and Belle Haven visitor survey, conducted in 1993 and
discussed in the park’s long-range interpretive plan, recreational visitors used the Mount Vernon Trail (55
percent), went to the Belle Haven Picnic Area (44 percent), visited the marina (31 percent), and walked
the Dyke Marsh Trail (21 percent) (NPS 2005b). Ten percent of the visitors rented boats during their
stays. If these percentages still hold, approximately 448,130 recreational visits to Dyke Marsh and Belle
Haven Marina occurred in 2008, and approximately 44,813 visitors rented boats from the Belle Haven
Marina, 246,471 hiked the trails in the area, and 197,177 visited the picnic area.

BELLE HAVEN MARINA
Belle Haven Marina is located at the northern part of Dyke Marsh and is approximately 2 miles south of
Old Town Alexandria, an area composed of numerous retail outlets, restaurants, lodging, historical
venues, and residential properties. Belle Haven Marina provides a place for the public to enjoy recreation
on the waterways of the Washington metropolitan area. For over 50 years, Belle Haven Marina has served
as a pleasure boat marina, providing opportunities for sailing instruction and catering to both visitors and
the local community. The marina provides opportunities for adjacent communities to access the Potomac
River and surrounding waterways in a largely urban environment. Visitors have the option at Belle Haven
of launching their own boats or renting a boat to experience the Potomac River. They can also rent slips to
store their boats to use at any time (NPS 2005a).

ADJACENT PROPERTY OWNERS AND THE MARINA
The area south of Dyke Marsh is characterized by mostly high-value homes and estates, many of which
have docks. The NPS recently purchased land south of Dyke Marsh, the Crim property, which is part of
the study area. The 5.7-acre Crim property at Dyke Marsh is the newest land acquisition for the George
Washington Memorial Parkway, and includes both fast land and area over open water and marsh. This
purchase completed the acquisition of land comprising the extent of the preserve, an acquisition process
which began even before the establishment of Mount Vernon Memorial Highway in 1932. The purchase
was made in 2008 at a cost of $37,250 (Feldman, pers. comm. 2009). Four adjacent properties with docks
extend into the waters of the newly acquired tract. The park has not yet determined how it will address
homeowners with docks that extend into parkland waters and how and when dock owners can maintain,
repair, alter, or replace the docks (Feldman, pers. comm. 2009).
Dyke Marsh is adjacent to parkland to the north, bounded by the Belle Haven Marina, and by park-owned
woodland and the parkway itself along much of the western edge of the marsh. However, Hog Island Gut
crosses under the parkway, and the guts to the west of the parkway abut the land for residential
apartments and condominiums, both garden-style and high-rise, as well as single-family residences. There
is an elementary school in the vicinity as well.
Several channels that carry tidal flows branch out from the arms of the Hog Island Gut to the west of the
parkway and run between buildings into the adjacent Belle View condominium community and the New
Alexandria neighborhood to the north of Belle View. These communities sustained severe flooding in
Hurricane Isabel in 2003 when water was pushed up the Potomac River, as well as the channels off the
guts.

WASHINGTON GAS PIPELINE
Washington Gas has a revocable easement across the Potomac River that crosses the Dyke Marsh area in
the vicinity of the historic promontory. There is a natural gas pipeline buried below the river bottom with
the NPS permit issued to Washington Gas in 1961 (NPS 1961). Terms and conditions have been
developed governing pile driving and other activities in the area of the pipeline (Washington Gas n.d.).

PARK MANAGEMENT AND OPERATIONS
The following discusses the composition of the park staff responsible for various functions at the park,
including the management of Dyke Marsh and the oversight of the Belle Haven Marina concession
operation.
The Dyke Marsh area is serviced by staff from five of the park’s divisions: the Cultural Resources
Division, the Maintenance Division, the Interpretation Division, the Natural Resources Division, and the
Park Police. The Natural Resources Division spends up to 20 percent of their time in the Dyke Marsh
area, whereas the other divisions spend less time there, although the amount of time spent in the area
varies depending on need and on responsibilities elsewhere in the park.

MAINTENANCE DIVISION
The Maintenance Division serves the entire park area, providing services to Dyke Marsh on an as-needed
basis, and these services are limited to scheduled work order requests for routine and cyclical work.
Upkeep of wayside and interpretive signs is the responsibility of park rangers. In addition, the
Maintenance Division assists with conducting emergency stabilization projects. Maintenance Division
employees do not spend more than 20 percent of their time in the area during a typical week. This
division conducts routine maintenance and upkeep for various facilities in the area, most notably Haul
Road and its interpretive signs. This division also supports the Division of Technical Services with
emergency stabilization as protection from storms, and coordinates with rangers 3 to 4 times per year to
pick up trash after shoreline cleanups with volunteer groups (Bibbs, pers. comm. 2013). Currently, no
major ongoing maintenance activities are occurring in the Dyke Marsh area (Bibbs, pers. comm. 2013).

INTERPRETATION, RECREATION, AND RESOURCE MANAGEMENT DIVISION
Interpretation Services
The park’s interpretation services are divided into four sites or divisions that serve different areas of the
park. The Dyke Marsh area is served by the park’s Virginia District. This district is a division of
Interpretation, Recreation, and Resource Management, which also includes Natural and Cultural Resource
Management, as well as other visitor services. The Virginia District provides interpretation services to the
area along the parkway corridor from its northern terminus at the I-495 Capital Beltway south to Mount
Vernon, excluding Arlington House. The Arlington House, Great Falls, and Glen Echo / Clara Barton
Parkway sites are served by other interpretive staff. The Virginia District has a total of three full-time,
permanent employees, and two to three seasonal employees per year. These employees spend less than 20
percent of their time in the Dyke Marsh area (Werst, pers. comm. 2013).
Environmental education is an important part of current management policy at Dyke Marsh. Interpretation
Division staff host watershed clean-up days, conduct curriculum-based programs for children, and
oversee the bird walks conducted by the Friends of Dyke Marsh (NPS 2008a).
Currently, Dyke Marsh has one bulletin board, and has installed four interpretive and educational wayside
exhibits that discuss marsh function, wildlife, and cultural resources. All of these have been installed
along Haul Road, and support interpretive activities (Werst, pers. comm. 2013).

George Washington Memorial Parkway

Park Management and Operations

Cultural Resources Management Program
The Cultural Resources Management Program is involved with the identification, research, protection,
and preservation of all cultural resource features of the George Washington Memorial Parkway, including
the Dyke Marsh area. The Cultural Resources Management Division assists with prehistoric or historic
education and outreach through efforts such as presenting talks about historical research. Primary
educational programming is provided through the George Washington Memorial Parkway Interpretation
and Education divisions. Two full-time, permanent employees work in the Cultural Resources
Management Division, and they service the entire park, spending less than 10 percent of their time in the
Dyke Marsh area (Virta pers. comm. 2013).

Natural Resources Management Program
The Natural Resources Management Program has three full-time, permanent employees who serve the
entire park area, including Dyke Marsh. They spend approximately 20 percent of their time working in
the Dyke Marsh area (Steury, pers. comm. 2009).
The Natural Resources Management Program is in charge of conducting on-the-ground management
activities as they pertain to the Dyke Marsh’s biological and geologic resources. One such activity is the
control of nonnative plants, which includes applying herbicides and supervising volunteer groups to assist
in the removal of nonnative plants. The division also manages the area’s sedimentation/erosion tables,
recording and storing data on the accretion or subsidence of the marsh (NPS 2008a).
The Natural Resources Division is responsible for managing the National Environmental Policy Act
(NEPA) compliance associated with all restoration activities (Steury, pers. comm. 2009).

PARK POLICE
The Park Police serve the Dyke Marsh area on an as-needed basis. They patrol the area, respond to
emergency calls, and limit the public’s access to the marsh during the ecologically sensitive wren
breeding season. Major issues associated with Dyke Marsh law enforcement include the poaching of
turtles, bow hunting for fish, poaching of catfish, setting of trotlines, and setting of turtle traps, as well as
illegal commercial trawl fishing and illegal waterfowl hunting within park boundaries. Current Park
Police staffing is sufficient to meet the park’s needs (Steury, pers. comm. 2009).

CONCESSION AT BELLE HAVEN MARINA
The concession that operates at Belle Haven Marina is described earlier in this chapter under the Visitor
Use and Experience topic and is discussed here because restoring Dyke Marsh may affect the
management and operation (and related revenues) of this concession.
Five marinas are located in the area surrounding Belle Haven Marina, two of which are along the parkway
and host concession facilities (PwC 2003). Washington Sailing Marina can accommodate much larger
boats than the Belle Haven Marina can and is the only other marina in the area providing sailing
instruction and sailboat rentals, dry storage, and wet slips. However, Belle Haven has kayak and canoe
rentals not provided elsewhere to the south of the District. Belle Haven has consistently maintained 100
percent occupancy levels for moorings and for wet and dry storage rentals (PwC 2003; Lebel, pers.
comm. 2009).

Environmental
Consequences

CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES
INTRODUCTION
The “Environmental Consequences” chapter analyzes both beneficial and adverse impacts that would
result from implementing any of the alternative elements described in chapter 2 of this Dyke Marsh
Wetland Restoration and Long-term Management Plan / Environmental Impact Statement (plan/EIS). It is
organized by resource topic and provides a standardized comparison among alternatives based on the
topics discussed in chapter 1 and further discussed in chapter 3.
The chapter also presents a summary of laws and policies relevant to each impact topic, methods used to
analyze impacts, and the analysis methods used for determining cumulative impacts. This plan/EIS
addresses (in quantitative terms, to the maximum extent practicable) the direct and indirect potential
environmental impacts from all aspects of the Dyke Marsh Wildlife Preserve (Dyke Marsh) restoration
project. As required by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations implementing the
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), a summary of the environmental consequences for each
alternative is provided in table 2-6, which can be found at the end of chapter 2.

SUMMARY OF LAWS AND POLICIES
Three environmental protection laws and their implementing policies guide the actions of the National
Park Service (NPS) in the management of its parks and their resources—the Organic Act of 1916, NEPA
and its implementing regulations, and the Omnibus Management Act. For a complete discussion of these
and other guiding authorities, refer to the “Related Federal Laws, Policies, Regulations, and Plans”
section in chapter 1. These guiding authorities are briefly described below.
The Organic Act of 1916 (16 USC 1), as amended or supplemented, commits the NPS to making
informed decisions that perpetuate the conservation and protection of park resources unimpaired for the
benefit and enjoyment of future generations. NEPA is implemented through regulations of the CEQ (40
CFR 1500–1508). The NPS has, in turn, adopted procedures to comply with these requirements, as found
in Director’s Order 12 (NPS 2011a) and its accompanying handbook (NPS 2001). The Omnibus
Management Act (16 USC 5901 et seq.) underscores NEPA provisions in that both acts are fundamental
to park management decisions. Both acts provide direction for connecting resource management decisions
to the analysis of impacts and communicating the impacts of those decisions to the public, using
appropriate technical and scientific information. Director’s Order 12 provides a standard for best available
information and a framework and process for evaluating the impacts of the alternatives considered in this
plan/EIS.

METHODOLOGY FOR ASSESSING IMPACTS
The following elements were used in analyzing the potential effects of the alternatives on each resource
category:


General analysis methods as described in guiding regulations, including the context and duration
of environmental effects.



Basic assumptions used to formulate the specific methods used in this analysis.

Final Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and Long-term Management Plan / EIS

107

Chapter 4: Environmental Consequences



Methods used to assess significance of impacts.



Methods used to evaluate the cumulative impacts of each alternative in combination with
unrelated factors or actions affecting park resources.

These elements are described in more detail below.

GENERAL ANALYSIS METHODS
The analysis of impacts follows CEQ guidelines and Director’s Order 12 procedures and is based on the
underlying purpose, as stated in “Chapter 1: Purpose of and Need for Action,” of developing and
implementing actions for restoration and long-term management of the tidal freshwater marsh and other
associated wetland habitats lost or impacted in the Dyke Marsh Wildlife Preserve (Dyke Marsh) on the
Potomac River in Virginia. This analysis incorporates the best available scientific literature applicable to
the region and setting, the species being evaluated, and the actions being considered in the alternatives.
For each resource topic addressed in this chapter, the applicable analysis methods and assumptions are
discussed.

HYDRODYNAMIC MODELING
As described in chapters 1 and 2, the anticipated outcome of the efforts to restore Dyke Marsh has been
partially estimated using hydrodynamic modeling. A successful model provides information needed to
meet the goals of a project. The model needs to be dynamic, capable of handling 2-way flows, and
capable of determining change in water surface elevation over time.
HEC-RAS 1-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling and 2-dimensional Finite Element Surface Modeling
System (FESWMS/SMS) modeling were used to understand what would happen hydrologically and
hydraulically under each alternative, and how sediment would be transported through the marsh (see
figures for the alternatives in chapter 2) (USACE 2010; USACE 2012a). The sediment transport process
includes deposition (accretion) of sediment within the marsh and erosion of sediment from the marsh. The
modeling also indicates where freshwater tidal marsh vegetation would colonize as the tidal plain
elevation increases. These processes are described in detail in this chapter. Estimated acres of new
wetland vegetation were also developed using model results and GIS.

ANALYSIS PERIOD
Goals, objectives, and specific implementation actions needed to restore Dyke Marsh are established for
the next 15 years; therefore, the analysis period used for assessing impacts is up to 15 years. The impact
analysis for each alternative is based on the principles of adaptive management, which would allow the
NPS to change management actions as new information emerges from monitoring the results of
restoration and management actions and ongoing research throughout the life of this plan.

GEOGRAPHIC AREA EVALUATED
Unless otherwise stated, the geographic study area (or area of analysis) for assessment of indirect and
direct impacts includes the entirety of the original configuration of Dyke Marsh. The study area extends
west to east, from the parkway to the eastern extent of the historic marsh, and north to south from the
Belle Haven Marina to the area north of the private property south of the park (figure 1-1). Some research
topics (hydrology and sediment transport, surface water quality in the Potomac River, and floodplains)
use a larger area of analysis, which considers the tidal channels that extend through the neighborhoods,
and immediately adjacent land, upstream along the Potomac River to the confluence of Hunting

108

George Washington Memorial Parkway

Methodology for Assessing Impacts

Creek/Cameron Run with the Potomac River, and downstream to the Horticultural Society property where
the Virginia/Maryland State line rejoins the banks of the Potomac River. The study area for these topics
also includes the Potomac River and its shore on the Maryland side of the river between these
upstream/downstream limits.

DURATION AND TYPE OF IMPACTS
Several basic assumptions are used for all impact topics (the terms “impact” and “effect” are used
interchangeably throughout this document):


Short-term impacts—Impacts associated with construction actions that are temporary and would
not have long-lasting effects. These impacts could last several years, as construction could last
multiple years, but they would not be permanent.



Long-term impacts—Impacts that would last beyond the time when construction is complete,
generally longer than three years and possibly lasting through the life of the plan, with potentially
permanent effects.



Direct impacts—Impacts that would occur as a direct result of NPS management actions.



Indirect impacts—Impacts that would occur from NPS management actions and would occur
later in time or farther in distance from the action.



Beneficial—A positive change in the condition or appearance of the resource or a change that
moves the resource toward a desired condition.



Adverse—A change that degrades, or moves the resource away from a desired condition or
detracts from its appearance or condition.

Direct and indirect impacts are addressed in the analysis, although they may not be specifically labeled as
such.

ASSESSING SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACTS
The impacts of the alternatives are assessed using the CEQ definition of “significantly” (1508.27), which
requires consideration of both context and intensity:
1. Context—This means that the significance of an action must be analyzed in several contexts such
as society as a whole (human, national), the affected region, the affected interests, and the
locality. Significance varies with the setting of the proposed action. For instance, in the case of a
site-specific action, significance would usually depend upon the effects in the locale rather than in
the world as a whole.
2. Intensity—This refers to the severity of impact. Responsible officials must bear in mind that more
than one agency may make decisions about partial aspects of a major action. The following
should be considered in evaluating intensity:
a. Impacts that may be both beneficial and adverse. A significant effect may exist even if the
federal agency believes that on balance the effect would be beneficial.
b. The degree to which the proposed action affects public health or safety.
c. Unique characteristics of the geographic area such as proximity to historic or cultural
resources, parklands, prime farmlands, wetland, wild and scenic rivers, or ecologically
critical areas.

Chapter 4: Environmental Consequences

d. The degree to which the effects on the quality of the human environment are likely to be
highly controversial.
e. The degree to which the possible effects on the human environment are highly uncertain or
involve unique or unknown risks.
f.

The degree to which the action may establish a precedent for future actions with significant
effects or represents a decision in principle about a future consideration.

g. Whether the action is related to other actions with individually insignificant but cumulatively
significant impacts. Significance exists if it is reasonable to anticipate a cumulatively
significant impact on the environment. Significance cannot be avoided by terming an action
temporary or by breaking it down into small component parts.
h. The degree to which the action may adversely affect districts, sites, highways, structures, or
objects listed in or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or
may cause loss or destruction of significant scientific, cultural, or historical resources.
i.

The degree to which the action may adversely affect an endangered or threatened species or
its habitat that has been determined to be critical under the Endangered Species Act of 1973.

j.

Whether the action threatens a violation of federal, state, or local law or requirements
imposed for the protection of the environment.

An assessment of significance of the impacts of the alternatives is provided in the conclusion section,
which follows the analysis of impacts of the alternatives. The analysis of significance considered the
factors identified above, where applicable, and also examined other factors such as how noticeable or how
large in magnitude the impacts are overall; if the impact is a primary driver of other effects; if the
resource affected is of regional or national importance; or if the resource is a rare or important component
of the ecosystem or considered fundamental to the park.

CUMULATIVE IMPACTS ANALYSIS METHODS
The CEQ regulations to implement NEPA require the assessment of cumulative impacts in the decisionmaking process for federal projects. Cumulative impacts are defined as “the impact on the environment
which results from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past, current, and reasonably
foreseeable future actions regardless of what agency (federal or non-federal) or person undertakes such
other actions” (40 CFR 1508.7). As stated in the CEQ handbook, Considering Cumulative Effects Under
the National Environmental Policy Act (CEQ 1997), cumulative impacts need to be analyzed in terms of
the specific resource, ecosystem, and human community being affected and should focus on effects that
are truly meaningful. Cumulative impacts are considered for all alternatives, including alternative A (no
action).
Cumulative impacts were determined by combining the impacts of the proposed alternative with other
past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions that would also result in beneficial or adverse
impacts. The greater the impacts of the proposed alternative are, the greater the relative contribution to the
cumulative impact. Therefore, it was necessary to identify those other actions at the parks and the
surrounding areas (as appropriate) that could affect the various resources discussed in this plan and that
are in addition to the actions already addressed within the alternatives.

Methodology for Assessing Impacts

The analysis of cumulative impacts was accomplished using four steps:
Step 1—Identify Resources Affected: identify resources affected by any of the alternatives.
Step 2—Set Boundaries: identify appropriate spatial and temporal boundaries for each resource.
Step 3—Identify Cumulative Action Scenario: determine which past, current, and reasonably
foreseeable future actions to include for each resource. These actions are not only those within or
undertaken by the park but also those actions by any entity that have had or will have an effect on
the resources impacted by this plan.
Step 4—Cumulative Impact Analysis: determine the combined impact of the proposed alternative
and the other identified actions of the cumulative scenario.
Table 4-1 summarizes the actions that were identified for the cumulative impact scenario for this plan,
and additional information is provided in the following narrative for those projects not discussed
elsewhere. The spatial boundaries vary, but the temporal boundaries for all impact topics except
archeological resources, historic structures and districts, cultural landscapes, and visitor use and
experience are back in time to the development of the golf course at Belle Haven Country Club
(approximately late 1920s or early 1930s); and forward 15 years, the life of the plan.
Belle Haven Golf Course—The golf course, built in the 1920s or early 1930s, cleared land, hardened
shorelines on Hunting Creek and resulted in more sediments and nutrients entering adjacent waters. The
shorelines adjacent to the golf course are currently relatively natural and have riparian buffers.
Development of National Harbor—National Harbor is a relatively new mixed use development on the
Maryland side of the river across from Dyke Marsh, just south of Woodrow Wilson Bridge. The
development includes a waterfront hotel and convention center, marina, and shoreline hardened with
riprap. Ferries to National Harbor run from Mount Vernon, Old Town Alexandria, and the Georgetown
Waterfront. The Mount Vernon ferry passes Dyke Marsh several times a day. The boat is a single hull
commercial vessel that can create wakes (Potomac River Boat Company 2013), but stays in the
commercial channel that is closer to the Maryland shoreline near Dyke Marsh. A Ferris wheel was
installed in the summer of 2014. A casino that includes a hotel tower and several large video screens is
planned in the future.
Replacement of Woodrow Wilson Bridge and associated wetlands mitigation—The Interstate-95
Woodrow Wilson Bridge over the Potomac River north of Dyke Marsh was replaced in the early 2000s,
with the new bridge opening to traffic in 2006. As part of the project, interchanges and roads around the
bridge were reconfigured. Approximately 25 acres of tidal and nontidal wetlands, and submerged
vegetation were disturbed as part of the project. Wetlands mitigation included preservation or creation of
100 acres of wetlands in Virginia, Maryland, and the District of Columbia (Coastal Resource, Inc. n.d.;
Bridge Pros 2003).
DC Water Clean Rivers Project—DC Water is in the process of implementing infrastructure
improvements to reduce or eliminate combined sewer overflow, which during heavy rain can discharge
untreated sewage into the Anacostia River, Potomac River, and Rock Creek. Projects include construction
of two large capacity tunnels, one of which is under construction. The tunnels will be able to hold
stormwater during rain events and prevent overload of the system, contribute to green infrastructure
initiatives that would reduce stormwater runoff volume at the source, and address water quality concerns.
Ultimately, implementation of the Clean Rivers Project is expected to improve water quality in the

Final Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and Long-term Management Plan / EIS

111

Chapter 4: Environmental Consequences

Anacostia and Potomac, as well as Rock Creek, particularly by reducing bacteria loading improving
dissolved oxygen levels (DC Water 2013).
Potomac Yards Metrorail Station—The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority plans to open
a new station in Alexandria near the Potomac Yards development on Route 1. NPS land in the George
Washington Memorial Parkway may be part of the project. It is anticipated that the project area could
impact archeological and other cultural resources, and mitigation for impacts to these resources could be
necessary under Section 106 of the National Historical Preservation Act.
Arlington National Cemetery Expansion—The cemetery is planning to expand burial space onto land
previously administered by the NPS. Through Section 106 consultation, it was determined that the project
would result in an adverse effect to a portion of the wooded area that contributes to the NRHP listed
Arlington House, the Robert E. Lee Memorial, which is administered by the George Washington
Memorial Parkway. NEPA and National Historical Preservation Act compliance have been completed for
this project, and the cemetery will likely proceed with construction within the year.
George Washington Memorial Parkway North Parkway Rehabilitation—Elements of the north
parkway have deteriorated and require corrective treatment. George Washington Memorial Parkway is
coordinating the treatment effort with the Federal Highway Administration. The Federal Highway
Administration advocates the implementation of modern safety improvements into the project. This
includes elements such as larger guide walls that could impact the historic integrity of the George
Washington Memorial Parkway. Archeological resources could be impacted as well. An environmental
assessment (EA) for this project is in process.
Arlington Memorial Bridge Rehabilitation—Components of the bridge have deteriorated to the point
that corrective treatment is required. Some of the alternatives proposed have the potential to impact the
historic character of the bridge and its visual appearance within the landscape of the George Washington
Memorial Parkway. An EA is currently being developed to evaluate these alternatives.
Memorial Circle Safety Improvements—A road safety audit was conducted for Memorial Circle and its
immediate vicinity. The audit proposed a number of modifications to the circle in order to address
identified safety issues. Some of the proposed alternatives could result in conspicuous visual impacts to
the historic George Washington Memorial Parkway. An EA is in planned to evaluate these alternatives.
External Projects—There are several high-rise development projects in planning stages or underway in
Arlington County and Alexandria (including development in the vicinity of Potomac Yard independent of
the proposed Metrorail station at that site) that will likely result in visual impacts to the George
Washington Memorial Parkway.

IMPACTS OF THE ALTERNATIVES ON HYDROLOGY AND
SEDIMENT TRANSPORT
GUIDING REGULATIONS AND POLICIES
As discussed in chapter 1, the restoration is guided by NPS Management Policies 2006, specifically,
“Chapter 4: Natural Resources,” which states that “the National Park Service will strive to understand,
maintain, restore, and protect the inherent integrity of the natural resources, processes, systems, and
values of the parks while providing meaningful and appropriate opportunities to enjoy them” (NPS 2006).
Two instances that apply here in which the NPS would intervene in natural biological or physical
processes are when it is directed to do so by Congress, which is the case with Dyke Marsh, and to restore
natural ecosystem functions that have been disrupted by past or ongoing human activity. Dyke Marsh has
been substantially altered by past dredging activity and is eroding. The NPS Management Policies 2006
also direct the NPS to manage watersheds as complete hydrologic systems and manage stream processes,
such as erosion and deposition that affect Dyke Marsh. Construction activities would be guided by state
and federal laws, including the Clean Water Act (Section 404) and Section 9 of the Rivers and Harbors
Act of 1899. The implementation of the project would follow in-water construction management practices
required by the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation (VA DCR) in the Virginia Erosion

Final Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and Long-term Management Plan / EIS

115

Chapter 4: Environmental Consequences

and Sediment Control Manual (VA DCR 1992), and the Virginia Department of Game and Inland
Fisheries (VDGIF) concerning construction in tidal waters.

METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS
Success of the restoration relies on the ability to restore hydrologic conditions that would allow for and
encourage sediment deposition and accrual in the marsh. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)
characterized existing conditions in the marsh, and modeled anticipated future conditions in the marsh
under both action alternatives. Analysis included 2-dimensional modeling using the FESWMS/SMS
platform that characterized diurnal tides, the base flow of the Potomac River, and flow depths to
understand how tidal flows affect the marsh currently and how they would affect the marsh under the
different alternatives. This information was used to assess potential impacts including changes to flow,
development of high or low energy areas that would result in erosion (in the high energy areas) or
sediment accretion (in the low energy areas), and how that would affect the hydrologic processes and the
overall restoration, along with information from a bathymetric study in 2009 (NPS 2009b); data from
sediment transport modeling (USACE 2010); and information with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)
study (Litwin et al. 2011) in which the authors measured existing erosion rates.

IMPACTS OF THE NO-ACTION ALTERNATIVE (ALTERNATIVE A)
Under the no-action alternative, no restoration efforts would occur and the marsh would continue to
degrade. The existing marsh is not in a geologically sustainable state, and would “continue to be subjected
to strong lateral shoreline erosion and stream piracy” (Litwin et al. 2011). Tidal freshwater marsh is a
regionally threatened resource on the Potomac River and in nearby water bodies, making the adverse
effects of the erosion of the marsh more acute. Sediments would continue to be carried past the marsh.
The Litwin et al. study and the hydrologic modeling conducted for this restoration plan predicts that the
current hydrologic situation would result in erosion in the marsh at a rate of 6–7.8 feet per year, and that
there is little or no natural protection from erosion provided to Hog Island Gut (Litwin et al. 2011;
USACE 2012a). Erosion of the gut is primarily the result of the removal of the promontory during
dredging, which changed the hydrology of the area, and has allowed incoming tides and storm surges to
flow more directly into Hog Island Gut. Erosion since the promontory was removed has further truncated
the gut, and caused it to discharge to the south, which encourages incoming tides and flow from storms to
flow into and out of the gut in a relatively straight line without attenuation from meanders in the channel,
allowing tidal flows and storm surges to flow in and out of the gut with greater velocities. The higher
velocities in the channel during tidal flows have eroded the channel banks, widening and straightening
them, and this process would continue (Litwin et al. 2011). At the same time, with the promontory no
longer in place, the undeflected flow on the outer edges of the marsh have caused erosion of the outer
wall of the Hog Island Gut channel, narrowing the channel wall, to the point there are currently locations
where the channel is in danger of being breached (Litwin et al. 2011). In addition, there are deep channels
adjacent to the marsh that direct flow through the area at higher velocities that exacerbate erosion in the
marsh. With no restoration efforts, relatively high energy conditions would continue to exist adjacent to
the marsh allowing suspended sediments in the river to continue to be carried straight downstream past
the marsh. There would continue to be relatively few, if any, places in the existing marsh that would
provide the low energy conditions needed for sediments to settle out of the water column and accumulate
on the river bottom (figure 4-1). The arrows on the images in figure 4-1 show direction of water flows
during different tidal stages, and shading indicates relative depths, with red being deeper, and the purple
being shallower. There would be no change to the hydrology or sediment transport in the Haul Road area.
The area west of Haul Road would continue to be disconnected hydrologically from the rest of the marsh,
and there would be no opportunities to reintroduce tidal flows into this area and restore it to the
bottomland swamp forest that existed there previously, because the necessary hydrologic conditions that
supported this forest, specifically periodic tidal influence, would not exist.

Impacts of the Alternatives on Hydrology and Sediment Transport

Overall, under the no-action alternative, the existing erosive hydrologic processes created by past human
disturbance would continue, river flow past the marsh would be undeflected by breakwaters (as compared
with the action alternatives) (figure 4-1), and it is expected that the marsh would continue to erode
noticeably, disrupting the organic mat under the marsh, and carrying sediments out of the marsh, with the
potential that the marsh could disappear almost entirely with no intervention (Litwin et al. 2011).

Cumulative Impacts
Several past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions in the vicinity of Dyke Marsh have the
potential to impact both hydrology and sediment transport in the marsh and the adjacent Potomac River.
The construction of the new Woodrow Wilson Bridge in Alexandria in the 2000s, the development of the
Belle Haven Golf Course early in the 20th century, and the development of Belle Haven Marina in the
1950s all affected the hydrology and sediment transport in the Potomac River and in Dyke Marsh, though
most impacts were localized. The construction of the bridge, which included dredging and pile driving,
has affected the hydrology by forcing water around the bridge piers. Also, flow velocities are higher in
the narrower shipping channel where the water is deeper. The construction of the golf course has
increased runoff and sediment deposition in Cameron Run and Hunting Creek. When coupled with
upstream development along Cameron Run, this has resulted in sediments being transported from
Cameron Run to the confluence with the Potomac River, where large mud flats are developing. That
sediment is not being carried downstream in the direction of Dyke Marsh. Possible future dredging of the
accumulating mudflats at the mouth of Cameron Run would affect hydrology and sediment transport
including in Dyke Marsh. Dredging a channel in this area could temporarily allow additional sediment to
flow from Cameron Run and Hunting Creek downstream toward Dyke Marsh and beyond, but the
mudflats would continue to accumulate sediment and develop into vegetated wetlands. There are
currently areas where vegetation has become established, and this would continue, even with dredging a
small channel.
Development at National Harbor includes dredging and addition of piers and a marina, and has caused
localized changes to hydrology on the opposite side of the river. Those changes would not noticeably
affect hydrology and sediment transport in Dyke Marsh, however, and future development at National
Harbor would not affect hydrology or sediment transport.
The development of the Belle Haven Marina altered the hydrology of Dyke Marsh by extending docks
into the river and south toward the marsh, and through the maintenance of a navigation channel into the
marina. There is noticeable sediment accumulation in the flats behind and west of the marina by the canoe
launch, but the area where there is a deep dredging hole that has become the mooring area remains
relatively deep, and there is no sediment accumulation in the mooring field area. The no-action alternative
would contribute adverse effects to the overall beneficial and adverse cumulative effects in this area. This
contribution would be appreciable, because of the marsh expected to be lost as a result of hydrologic
change and erosion.

Conclusion
Under the no-action alternative, the existing flow regime would continue, and there would be continued
erosion and loss of marsh over time. Without intervention, the marsh would disappear, and there would be
no opportunity for beneficial hydrologic conditions or sediment accretion. Unique characteristics of the
marsh, including its freshwater tidal wetlands and ecologically critical areas, would be lost. Hydrology
and sediment transport are driving factors for wetland restoration and ecological changes in the marsh, so
impacts on hydrology and sediment transport are of great importance. For these reasons, the impacts on
hydrology and sediment transport under alternative A would be considered significant.

Final Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and Long-term Management Plan / EIS

119

Chapter 4: Environmental Consequences

The no-action alternative would contribute adverse effects to the impacts of other past, present, and
reasonably foreseeable projects in this area. This contribution would be appreciable because of the marsh
expected to be lost as a result of hydrologic change and erosion.

IMPACTS COMMON TO BOTH ACTION ALTERNATIVES
Changes in Flow and Sediment Transport in the Main Marsh Areas
Both action alternatives include elements that create low energy areas in the marsh and reduce the
velocity of currents that are currently causing erosion, especially in and along the tidal guts. The
installation of a breakwater structure and placement of fill in the deep channels at the southern end of the
existing marsh would dissipate wave and flow energy, and protect the mouth of Hog Island Gut. The
breakwater structure mimics the function of the historic promontory, which would deflect both daily tidal
and occasional storm wave energy from the long fetch to the south. Although there is a different location
and length for the breakwater in each action alternative, the placement of the breakwater would redirect
the flows around it from both directions, resulting in the creation of lower energy systems behind it. This
reduction in energy would allow for and encourage sediment accretion (USACE 2012a) in the historic
marsh areas. Filling the deeper channels with heavier and rougher material just upstream of the
breakwater would start to remove the narrow raceway through which water is being directed at higher
velocities, and would be expected to spread the flows more evenly across the river bottom and
concentrate the line of fastest flow back into the main part of the river where it was historically. It is also
likely that for a time, until other sediments settle on top of the fill, the rougher surface of the deep channel
fill would also help slow the water energy due to the friction the rough surface would create (Litwin, pers.
comm. 2011). However, the 2-D modeling showed that filling the channel to the 12-foot deep contour
would not noticeably alter velocity vectors or their direction in the area, with the caveat that limitations to
the model may have limited the ability of the model to recognize the benefits of the deep channel fill
(USACE 2012a). The modelers also noted that filling the channels to 8 or 4 feet deep may also provide
more noticeable benefits, but did not evaluate these scenarios. Erosive energy from higher velocity flows
would be dissipated by the fill of the deep channels, contributing to the creation of low energy systems in
the marsh, particularly around the mouth of Hog Island Gut. Where low energy areas are created, there is
more likely to be sediment accretion, as sediments drop out of the flow and settle on the marsh or river
bottom (Litwin, pers. comm. 2011).
The specific impacts would vary according to the placement of the breakwater and are discussed in the
impact analysis for each alternative. However, by encouraging renewed deposition of sediment within the
marsh area through the construction of the breakwater that resembles the historic promontory, some
amount of sediments in the water column that have been flowing downstream unimpeded would be
removed from the water column, and this may affect downstream areas where accretion of sediments is
occurring. However, because the modeling stopped just south of Dyke Marsh, and did not extend
downstream of Dyke Marsh, there are no data available to determine the downstream extent of the
impacts of the predicted reduced sediment load on the areas where the suspended sediments are currently
settling out. The flow trace study does show that it is likely that sediments would settle out immediately
south of the breakwater in the southernmost wetlands, as occurred when the historic promontory was
present, (figure 4-2), although the FESWMS/SMS model runs indicate that there is still a lot of flow
around the breakwater, so sediments may not settle out (figure 4-3).

Impacts of the Alternatives on Hydrology and Sediment Transport

FIGURE 4-2. FLOW TRACE PATTERNS IN THE POTOMAC RIVER WITH A BREAKWATER

In addition, both action alternatives include the construction of new marsh surface using containment
cells. The new marsh would change the hydrology and sedimentation patterns by creating friction and a
rougher surface for water to flow over, generally slowing flows down in the marsh, and allowing for
sediment accretion in some parts of the marsh. The use of natural and unhardened edges along the marsh
would also result in beneficial impacts on hydrology and sediment deposition in the marsh by allowing
natural and tidal flow over restored wetlands, impeded only by the plants themselves, and natural
attenuation of flow velocities in and out of marsh. The result of this approach on hydrology and sediment
in the marsh would be the establishment of a more natural flow regime in the marsh over the long term,
with associated sediment deposition in the low energy areas to encourage marsh accretion.

Changes of Hydrology and Sediment Transport along Haul Road
Under both action alternatives, the creation of breaks along Haul Road would allow tidal flows to pass
under the road and into the former bottomland swamp forest, along with sediment transfer associated with
those tidal flows over the long term. The reconnections would allow tidal flows in the area, so that it
would be inundated more frequently and more regularly with the tides. This change in hydrology would
discourage continued establishment of nonnative and invasive plants in these areas by making conditions
less suitable for the nonnative species and improving hydrologic conditions for native species found in
bottomland swamp forests that grow well in regularly inundated conditions. The hydrologic reconnections
would also result in improvements in floodplain values by improving bottomland floodplain forest
habitat, and increasing floodplain capacity, all of which are discussed in other sections. Although the area
in which the breaks would be placed is relatively sheltered, with lower flow velocities, there would still
be some scour at the culverts or bridges where tidal flows are forced through. The modeling did not
address this area, so the degree of scour cannot be predicted at this time. A scour analysis would be
conducted during later stages of the design process to ensure scour would be minimized.

Chapter 4: Environmental Consequences

Impacts from Construction Activities
Under both action alternatives, the marsh would be reestablished using mostly large containment cells,
with smaller, strategically placed containment cells, to complete the first phase of restoration. The cells
would be designed to hold fill material until enough fill can be placed at a suitable elevation to support
appropriate vegetation, and then settled so that plants can colonize or the area can be planted. Various
best management practices (BMPs) or construction design approaches for the containment cells would
prevent sediments from being lost from the containment cells during the fill process, but allow intertidal
exchange once fill placement is complete. Intertidal exchange in the wetlands outside the containment
cells would continue, although water would flow around the cells, and up Hog Island Gut. There would
therefore be short-term effects on hydrology and sediment transfer related to construction. The cells
would partially block or force redirection of flow to the existing marsh behind the containment structures
while they are in place, and could force water along the back edges of the containment structures, creating
friction and erosion at the edges. This would have localized adverse short-term effects on the marsh.
There would also be some erosion along the outermost edge of the containment cell. However,
containment structures would not block the entrance to Hog Island Gut under either of the action
alternatives, and water would still flow into Hog Island Gut. The cells would create beneficial effects by
sheltering the larger marsh from erosive storm waves while they are in place.
There would be no construction-related impacts on hydrology associated with constructing the
breakwater.
Regardless of whether bridges or culverts are installed at the breaks in Haul Road, it is likely that a barrier
would be placed along the shore while work is performed to prevent water from getting into the
construction area. In addition, erosion and sediment control BMPs would be used to prevent accidental
discharge of sediments into Dyke Marsh and the Potomac River during construction. Because there is no
existing flow to the inland side of Haul Road, there would be no impacts on hydrology or sediment
transport, specifically unanticipated delivery of sediment to the marsh and river, during construction.

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE B
Under alternative B, the focus is on the most essential actions that would reestablish hydrologic
conditions that shield the marsh from erosive currents and on protection of the Hog Island Gut channel
and channel wall. The restoration activities would create beneficial hydrological and sediment deposition
conditions that would promote successful marsh restoration over the long term. The breakwater under this
alternative would be constructed at the northern edge of the historic promontory, adjacent to Hog Island
Gut. The location of the breakwater would introduce a bend to the gut and cause it to empty to the north.
This change in orientation for the outlet would greatly lessen and could even reverse the scour effect that
is currently taking place in the southern-facing outlet.
Hydrodynamic modeling by the USACE (USACE 2012a) predicts that the breakwater would redirect
flow in a way that would provide tidal resistance, disrupt the energy of the fetch from the south, and
provide an adequate wave shadow to protect the mouth of Hog Island Gut and the wetlands on the
southern end of Dyke Marsh from storms and higher energy waves. Restored marsh to the negative 4-foot
contour would also help shelter the Hog Island Gut channel from destructive and erosive wave energy.

Impacts of the Alternatives on Hydrology and Sediment Transport

Figure 4-3 serves to illustrate the changes predicted by the model under this alternative. As compared
with alternative A, in which erosion would continue, under alternative B, the marsh would stabilize. With
both the breakwater and restored marsh area north of the breakwater, at high tide water would flow across
the proposed marsh around Coconut Island at the north end of the marsh (see figure 2-7 in chapter 2 for
the locations of the islands). At the receding mid-tide, flows would be pulled toward the southern end of
the marsh in a low energy state that would promote deposition of sediments and marsh accretion in this
area. Flows would be redirected around the breakwater at Angel Island at the mouth of Hog Island Gut.
At low tide, the low energy flow would continue to be pulled into the south marsh, and flows at Coconut
Island would no longer overtop the island, but would be redirected in a northerly direction. At mid-tide on
the incoming tide, flows to the north would be pushed around the breakwater and up Hog Island Gut. A
noticeable tidal lag would be created. Under normal conditions at all tidal stages, less water would flow
over the top of the marsh, but would be directed into the marsh through Hog Island Gut and its tributaries
(figure 4-3 shows flows during all four tidal stages). Approximately 70 acres of swamp forest wetlands,
and vegetated high and emergent marsh would be created. Although there would be less marsh area
restored than existed historically, hydrologic conditions would be similar to conditions before the historic
promontory was removed. The flows would no longer be largely erosive, and there would be long-term
benefits to the marsh, possibly allowing for natural accretion of marsh in the future (USACE 2012a).
There would be a very small number of containment cells, and the placement of the cells would be
designed to protect the channel walls of Hog Island Gut. The modeling shows a larger than desirable
amount of water in the marsh at low tide, but the model was run before the design process. The final
design would need to more carefully account for marsh elevations and sizing of the tidal guts so that a
greater portion of the marsh is drier at low tide, and can support appropriate marsh vegetation. Design
would also need to account for velocities at the outermost edge of the marsh so that the additional soils
would not erode.
Construction-related impacts from the partial blockage of flows into the existing marsh by the
containment structures would be as described in the section “Impacts Common to Both Action
Alternatives,” but would be relatively small, given the scope of marsh restoration under this alternative.

Cumulative Impacts
The same past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects that are discussed under the no-action
alternative are considered under alternative B, and the impacts on hydrology and sediment transport in
Dyke Marsh and the Potomac River from these projects would be the same. Alternative B would
contribute beneficial impacts on hydrology and sediment transport to the beneficial and adverse impacts
from other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future projects. This contribution would be
noticeable because most of the cumulative impacts from other actions are localized and have a limited
effect on the hydrology and sediment transport in the immediate area of the marsh.

Conclusion
Several benefits to hydrology and sediment transport would result from alternative B. The most
noticeable benefit would be from the construction of the breakwater. The breakwater is a fundamental
design component of the restoration, and would allow beneficial changes to hydrology and sediment
transport by shielding the marsh from storms, redirecting flows, and creating low energy areas in which
sediment would settle out, accrete, and marsh areas could develop. Construction of the breakwater would
result in localized, significant beneficial impacts on hydrology because it would restore natural hydrologic
and sediment transport processes that were present in the marsh prior to the removal of the historic
promontory. The establishment of these fundamental changes would also allow for measurable benefits to
other key resources in the marsh.

Chapter 4: Environmental Consequences

The marsh restoration configuration for alternative B would create long-term benefits on hydrology and
sediment transport by establishing restored wetlands areas and protecting Hog Island Gut, furthering the
beneficial impacts created by the breakwater. Finally, the breaks in Haul Road would beneficially
reintroduce tidal flows to areas west of Haul Road, resulting in beneficial impacts.
Construction would divert flows temporarily, creating some adverse impacts on hydrology and sediment
transport within the marsh, but these impacts would not be significant, because they would not be very
intense or of a large magnitude, and would be short-lived.
Alternative B would contribute mostly beneficial impacts on hydrology and sediment transport to the
impacts of other past, present and reasonably foreseeable projects. The contribution would be noticeable,
because most of the cumulative impacts from other actions are localized and have a limited effect on the
hydrology and sediment transport in the immediate area of the marsh.

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE C
Under alternative C, there would be a much greater extent of marsh restoration than under alternative B.
The impacts from the initial phase of the restoration, in which wetlands would be restored to the negative
4-foot contour along the eastern edge of the marsh, would be similar to those impacts described under
alternative B, because the configuration of the restoration would be similar. One noticeable difference
between alternative B and the first phase of alternative C is the location of the breakwater, which would
be in the southern location, and would have wetland cells to the north of it, simulating the historic extent
of the promontory’s land mass. Under alternative C, the breakwater alignment would be longer than the
alignment under alternative B, and would therefore offer more overall protection to the marsh because it
would deflect more waves from the south. Restoration would continue to the full extent of the marsh in
future phases.
Overall, up to 180 acres of marsh and wetlands, including high marsh, emergent marsh, tidal guts, and
areas of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), as well as bottomland swamp forest, could be restored
under this alternative. The 180 acres includes an option for about 16 acres of restoration south of the
breakwater, as well as the area west of Haul Road. Tidal guts would also be cut into the restored marsh
area in future phases, similar to historical flow paths, to allow crucial intertidal flows into the heart of the
marsh.
Modeling indicates that the configuration of the breakwater under alternative C would function similarly
to the breakwater proposed under alternative B, deflecting flows around the breakwater, and creating a
low energy system in the area around Hog Island Gut, which would encourage sediment deposition in the
southern end of the marsh and protect Hog Island Gut (USACE 2012a). The lower bend in the Hog Island
Gut channel would be reestablished with the breakwater and restored wetland cells within the outline of
the historic promontory forming a new channel wall, and its mouth would discharge in a more northerly
direction around the restored wetlands recreating the extent of the promontory land mass. As under
alternative B, the final design would need to more carefully account for marsh elevations and sizing of the
tidal guts so that a greater portion of the marsh is drier at low tide, and can support appropriate marsh
vegetation, as well as accommodate fluxes in groundwater levels during the tide cycle. Design would also
need to account for velocities at the outermost edge of the marsh so that the additional soils would not
erode. The current model, performed in the early stages of the design process, shows a high percentage of
the marsh remains wet during low tide, although this is likely an anomaly of the model.
The southern alignment of the breakwater would initially provide less protection of Hog Island Gut than
the northern alignment (Litwin, pers. comm. 2011), but mimics the historic promontory that previously
existed there. The longer length of the breakwater would provide more protection of the marsh over the

126

Impacts of the Alternatives on Hydrology and Sediment Transport

long term than the one proposed under alternative B. However, the proposed containment cell phasing
would provide early protection until the marsh establishes itself. Either configuration of the breakwater
would result in redirected flows and low energy areas that would protect Hog Island Gut from erosion.
The construction sequence would ensure that the breakwater and containment cells immediately adjacent
to the existing terminus of Hog Island Gut would be constructed early in the process (see figure 2-9 for
proposed phasing of containment cells). Therefore, the channel of the gut would be protected from high
energy erosive flows, and the meanders would be restored so that scour in the gut channel would be
minimized as early as possible in the construction sequence, and desirable lower energy hydrologic
conditions would begin to be restored to the gut (figure 4-4).
Additionally, a new tidal gut would be constructed north of the new mouth of Hog Island Gut and due
south of the terminus of Haul Road. The new tidal gut would empty in a southerly direction into an
embayment formed at the mouth of Hog Island Gut. This new gut would help to distribute flows and
sediments in the northern part of the main marsh.
Under alternative C, up to 180 acres of wetlands and marsh, including high marsh, emergent marsh, tidal
guts, and SAV, could be created using large containment cells, although with the soft edge approach, the
full extent of the outer containment cells and modeling shows that generally, flow would be directed
around the breakwater as intended. At high tide, the marsh would be inundated, but flow in the marsh
would primarily be limited to the tidal guts and around the marsh. An erosion hot spot could possibly
develop near Coconut Island as a result of the redirection of strong flows. At mid-tide (receding), marsh
areas would begin to drain, and there would be mixing in the embayment of outflow from both Hog
Island Gut and the new tidal gut. At low tide, the marsh would continue to drain, there would be tidal
resistance at Hog Island Gut, and a low energy area would be created in the embayment between the two
tidal guts, protecting the marsh. The marsh would continue to drain through the tidal guts during the lowtide cycle. The modeling indicates that a shallow shelf is likely to develop at the outflow of Hog Island
Gut; this shelf existed historically. At mid-tide on the incoming tide, model results indicate that the flow
would be forced around the breakwater and associated wetlands, and up the tidal guts. The wetlands
would be inundated. Small local depressions typical of marshes would be created once vegetation
becomes established. (USACE 2012a)
The final design would need to carefully account for marsh elevations and sizing of the tidal guts so that a
greater portion of the marsh is drier at low tide, and can support appropriate marsh vegetation. Design
would also need to account for velocities at the outermost edge of the marsh so that the additional soils
would not erode. However, under alternative C, the flows would be forced around the breakwater and
around the restored wetlands and up the tidal guts.
Impacts related to cell design, and related to the introduction of breaks in Haul Road are discussed in the
“Impacts Common to Both Action Alternatives” section.
Construction-related impacts would be as described under impacts common to all, but more far-reaching
than under alternative B, because there would be a larger amount of marsh restored, and a larger number
of containment cells would be used, around which water would need to flow to reach the existing marsh.
The containment cells could reduce flows into the existing marsh, but would also protect it from erosion.
Restoration of the optional cells south of the breakwater would be established if it could be shown that the
hydrology would not erode restored marsh, given the changes to flow around the breakwater. This area
was not modeled during the ten percent design process. If marsh could be successfully established south
of the breakwater, however, sediments would accumulate in the new marsh areas over time to create a
stable marsh area. This marsh could expand slightly and slowly over time, but would be more generally

127

Chapter 4: Environmental Consequences

vulnerable to erosive flows than the restored marsh north of the breakwater; however, this should not
result in noticeable changes to sediment transport south of the marsh. Additional modeling would be done
during final design to ensure that the design would not cause adverse erosion or sedimentation in the areas
upstream or downstream of the optional cells. Therefore, there would not be any impacts to hydrology
and sediment transfer from the establishment of these cells.

Cumulative Impacts
Impacts on hydrology and sediment transport from other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future
projects would be the same as discussed under the no-action alternative. Alternative C would contribute
mostly beneficial long-term and some short-term adverse impacts to the other beneficial and adverse
cumulative impacts. The contribution would be appreciable because the cumulative impacts of other past,
present, and reasonably foreseeable projects are for the most part localized, and the scale of the Dyke
Marsh restoration under this alternative is relatively large.

Conclusion
There are longer term impacts common to both action alternatives that would result in beneficial impacts
on both hydrology and sediment transport. The breaks in Haul Road would reintroduce tidal flows west of
Haul Road. As with alternative B, the construction of the breakwater is a fundamental design component
of the restoration, and would allow beneficial changes to hydrology and sediment transport by shielding
the marsh from storms, redirecting flows, and creating low energy areas in which sediment would settle
out, accrete, and marsh areas could develop. Construction of the breakwater would result in localized,
significant beneficial impacts on hydrology because it would restore natural hydrologic and sediment
transport processes that were present in the marsh prior to the removal of the historic promontory. The
establishment of these fundamental changes would also allow for measurable benefits to other key
resources in the marsh.
The marsh restoration configuration for alternative C would create long-term benefits for hydrology and
sediment transport in the marsh. More wetland acreage (up to 180 acres) would ultimately be restored
than under alternative B, and the first phase would establish restored wetlands areas to the negative 4-foot
contour, thereby protecting Hog Island Gut, and increasing the beneficial impacts created by the
breakwater.
Short-term construction impacts under alternative C would be similar to alternative B under phase one of
the project. Impacts would be similar to, but of a slightly greater magnitude than those described under
alternative B. Construction would divert flows around the containment cells temporarily, creating adverse
impacts on hydrology and sediment transport, but impacts would not be significant.
The contribution of the beneficial impacts of alternative C on Dyke Marsh and the Potomac River to the
impacts from past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects would be appreciable because the impacts
of the other projects are for the most part localized, and the scale of the Dyke Marsh restoration under this
alternative would be relatively large.

Impacts of the Alternatives on Soils and Sediments

IMPACTS OF THE ALTERNATIVES ON SOILS AND SEDIMENTS
GUIDING REGULATIONS AND POLICIES
The current restoration effort proposes several action alternatives to restore the eroding marsh and its
associated processes and functions. Therefore, this restoration is guided by NPS Management Policies
2006, specifically the policies discussed in “Chapter 4: Natural Resources,” described in the “Impacts on
Hydrology and Sediment Transport Section” (NPS 2006). Two instances applicable to Dyke Marsh in
which the NPS would intervene in natural biological or physical processes are when it is directed to do so
by congress and to restore natural ecosystem functions that have been disrupted by past or ongoing human
activity. Construction activities would be guided by state and federal laws, including the Clean Water Act
(Section 404) and Sections 9 and 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899. The implementation of the
project would follow in-water construction management practices required by the VA DCR in the
Virginia Erosion and Sediment Control Manual (VA DCR 1992), and the VDGIF concerning
construction in tidal waters. Sediments would need to be tested to ensure they are clean and suitable for
use as fill material in the project.

METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS
Success of the restoration relies on the restoration of marsh conditions and processes such that these
would allow for the retention of existing soils and encourage additional sediment deposition and accrual
in the marsh supporting and enhancing appropriate marsh elevation and adjacent riverine bathymetry.
Litwin et al. (2011) reports average vertical sediment accumulation rates of approximately 3.06 mm/year
and 5.25 mm/year for Dyke Marsh. Several tests for sediment accumulation include the use of sediment
collection tiles, graduated stakes, and surface elevation tables. The analysis of the impacts on soils and
sediment is based on modeling and studies of existing soils and hydrological processes and their effect on
the movement of sediment. Analysis included 2-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling using the
FESWMS/SMS modeling platform that characterized the existing conditions in the marsh and anticipated
future conditions in the marsh under the three action alternatives (USACE 2012a). Outputs are further
characterized by daily tides, the base flow of the Potomac River, and flow depths to understand how tidal
flows affect the marsh currently and how they would affect the marsh under the different alternatives. A
second source included a USGS study (Litwin et al. 2011), which measured existing erosion rates,
potential impacts including changes to flow, development of high or low energy areas that would result in
erosion (in the high energy areas) or sediment accretion (in the low energy areas), and how that would
affect the hydrologic processes and the overall marsh restoration. Additional information supporting the
analysis included results from a bathymetric study in 2009 (NPS 2009b) and data from sediment transport
modeling (USACE 2010).

IMPACTS OF THE NO-ACTION ALTERNATIVE (ALTERNATIVE A)
Under the no-action alternative, no restoration efforts would occur and the marsh would continue to
degrade under current conditions. The main impacts on soils and sediments would be due to erosive
forces acting laterally on the shoreline and on the channel of Hog Island Gut (Litwin et al. 2011), and the
lack of sediment accretion. Shoreline erosion is mainly due to the removal of the promontory and the deep
dredge/scour channels on the riverbed adjacent to the eastern marsh shoreline; both are results of historic
dredging operations. The Litwin et al. study and the hydrologic modeling conducted for this restoration
plan predict that the current conditions would result in average shoreline marsh soil erosion of 6–7.8
linear feet per year (Litwin et al. 2011; USACE 2012a). Erosion of the gut is also primarily the result of
the removal of the promontory during the historic dredging, which has allowed incoming tides and storm

131

Chapter 4: Environmental Consequences

surges to flow more directly into Hog Island Gut, eroding the channel banks (i.e., widening and
straightening them). Because there is little or no natural protection from erosion for Hog Island Gut, this
process would continue under the no-action alternative (Litwin et al. 2011). In addition, there are deep
channels, due to dredging and subsequent scouring, adjacent to the eastern marsh boundary that direct
flow through the area at higher velocities that exacerbate erosion in the marsh. Furthermore, with no
restoration efforts, these relatively high energy conditions would continue adjacent to the marsh allowing
suspended sediments in the river to continue to be carried straight downstream past the marsh. There
would continue to be relatively few, if any, places in the existing marsh that would provide the low
energy conditions needed for sediments to settle out of the water column and accumulate on the river
bottom (figure 4-2). Sediments would continue to be carried past the marsh without accreting and adding
to the marsh area (figure 4-2). In summary, under the no-action alternative, it is expected that the marsh
soils and sediments would continue to erode noticeably due to the existing erosive hydrologic processes
created by past human disturbances, disrupting the organic mat under the marsh, and carrying sediments
out of the marsh, leading to potential complete marsh disappearance with no intervention (Litwin et al.
2011).
In addition, there would be no change to the soils or sediment transport in the Haul Road area. The area
west of Haul Road would continue to be hydrologically disconnected from the rest of the marsh, thereby
continuing to impede sediment accretion in this area and the processes and conditions necessary for the
development and upkeep of the hydric soils that previously supported a bottomland hardwood forest.

Cumulative Impacts
Other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions in the vicinity of Dyke Marsh have the
potential to impact soils and sediment in the marsh and the adjacent Potomac River. The construction of
the new Woodrow Wilson Bridge in Alexandria in the 2000s, the development of the Belle Haven Golf
Course in the early 20th century, and the development of Belle Haven Marina in the 1950s all affected the
soils and sediment in the Potomac River and in Dyke Marsh; most impacts were localized although some
impacts may have extended further downstream. The bridge construction included sediment disturbing
activities, such as dredging and pile driving, which likely had local and possibly downstream effects on
sediments depending on sediment transport. Construction disturbed tidal and nontidal wetlands, which
may have led to longer term effects on sediments and sediment movement through the disturbance and the
degradation of the sediment retention capabilities of the wetlands. The clearing and development of land
for the golf course brought about increased runoff and sediment deposition in Cameron Run and Hunting
Creek while increased urban development upstream on Cameron Run resulted in additional sediment
being carried out of Cameron Run. The large amount of increased suspended sediments is settling out at
the confluence with the Potomac River forming large mud flats. As a result, that sediment is not being
carried downstream in the direction of Dyke Marsh for possible marsh accretion as might have occurred
in the past. Possible future dredging of the accumulating mudflats at the mouth of Cameron Run would
affect soils and sediment in the immediate in the area as well as in Dyke Marsh. Dredging a channel in
this area could temporarily allow additional sediment to flow from Cameron Run and Hunting Creek
downstream toward Dyke Marsh and beyond, but the process of sediment deposition and accumulation
and mudflat formation would continue as would their development into vegetated wetlands. There are
currently areas where vegetation has become established and sediment accretion would continue even
with the dredging of a small channel. The development of the Belle Haven Marina altered soils and
sediment of Dyke Marsh, changing the tidal creek outflow that previously existed south of the marina and
through the maintenance of a navigation channel into the marina. There is noticeable sediment
accumulation in the flats behind and west of the marina by the canoe launch but there is no sediment
accumulation in the deep dredging hole used as a boat mooring area.

Impacts of the Alternatives on Soils and Sediments

The no-action alternative would continue to contribute adverse impacts on soils and sediments in Dyke
Marsh and the Potomac River to the mostly adverse impacts from other past, present, and reasonably
foreseeable future projects. The contribution would be appreciable because of the magnitude of the loss of
soils in the marsh, and the relatively localized impacts from the other projects.

Conclusion
Under the no-action alternative, there would be continued erosion of wetlands soils and loss of marsh
over time. Without intervention, the marsh would disappear, and there would be no opportunity for
beneficial hydrologic conditions or sediment accretion to occur. This would result in a significant long
term adverse effect because the soils needed to support the marsh would no longer be present.
The no-action alternative would continue to contribute adverse impacts on soils and sediments in Dyke
Marsh and the Potomac River to the mostly adverse impacts from other past, present, and reasonably
foreseeable future projects. The contribution would be appreciable because of the magnitude of the loss of
soils in the marsh, and the relatively localized impacts from the other projects.

IMPACTS COMMON TO BOTH ACTION ALTERNATIVES
Changes in Soils and Sediment in the Main Marsh Areas
All of the action alternatives include elements that directly and indirectly affect soils and sediments.
Direct impacts on soils and sediment within the main marsh areas would be due to constructing the
containment cells and the breakwater, and filling the deep dredge/scour holes at the southern end of the
existing marsh. Indirect effects to soils and sediments due to the action alternatives include those from
changes to hydrology and sediment transport, deposition, and erosion processes (discussed in detail in the
hydrology and sediment transport analyses section).
Both action alternatives include the construction of new marsh surface

sediments. The composition of soils or gravel on the river bottom is
unknown, but the sediments probably have some hydric characteristics,
including being somewhat anoxic. The new marsh soils would have different elevations, chemical and
physical characteristics, and hydric soil indicators than existing Dyke Marsh soils, but would become
more hydric and similar to existing marsh soils over time as tides wet and rewet the marsh, and plant
matter grows and decays in the restored marsh. The fill material would initially consist of clean dredge
material combined with local river water to make placement of the material easier. The fill would likely
be higher in mineral content than organic matter and would have an unknown nutrient concentration. As
described in chapter 2, the fill would be placed to appropriate elevations to allow for native high and low
marsh wetland vegetation growth. The fill material initially would likely not have hydric soil
characteristics. These altered soil and sediment characteristics would have impacts on other resources
such as flora, fauna, and hydrology and sediment transport (discussed in detail in the hydrology and
sediment transport, vegetation and wetlands, fish and wildlife, and species of special concern resources
analyses sections). The duration of these impacts depends on the specific condition and characteristics of
the fill material used in the containment cells. It is assumed that over time the fill material soils would
become more similar to existing marsh soils.
The impacts on river bottom sediment from the breakwater structure would likely be similar to those
described for containment cells. The stone breakwater would cover an area of benthic sediments or deeper

133

Chapter 4: Environmental Consequences

channel fill. Sediment function of the area under the breakwater would be lost, although the adjacent
restoration in the footprint of the historic promontory would eventually become hydric and function as
marsh soils. The fill in these cells would be placed to appropriate elevations to allow for native high and
low marsh wetland vegetation growth. In addition, the fill material would have chemical and physical
characteristics that differ than those of the benthic sediments.
The filling of the deep dredge channels would place new, heavier, and rougher material on top of
sediments and gravel deposits, and could have different physical and chemical characteristics than the
surrounding sediment. The characteristics of the new fill material and the characteristics of the existing
river bottom in the deep channels are both unknown, although new fill would be clean, and existing deep
channel bottoms is likely a mix of naturally occurring gravel and benthic sediments similar to those found
outside the deep channels. The duration of these impacts on sediments would likely be longer than the
construction period although this would depend on the exact fill material used. The sediments in these
areas would likely be covered with finer material over time because rougher sediments tend to slow river
flows allowing for sediments to settle out. Also the addition of this fill material would cause long-term
impacts on the bottom contours and bathymetry of the channel.
As discussed in the “Hydrology and Sediment Transport” section, the addition of the breakwater would
greatly reduce erosion in the marsh over the long-term.

Changes of Soils and Sediments along Haul Road
Under all the action alternatives, the creation of breaks along Haul Road would allow tidal flows to pass
under the road and into the former bottomland swamp forest, along with sediment transfer associated with
those tidal flows over the long-term. Soil and sediment impacts from these actions include the addition of
natural sediments to the former wetland. The action of reestablishing tidal flow into the area would
reintroduce periods of saturation and inundation necessary for the formation of hydric soils. Although the
area was once a bottomland forested wetland, it has likely been cut off from the tidal water supply since
the early 1970s when the road was constructed (Litwin et al. 2011). With regular hydrology, the soils
could be saturated, flooded, or ponded for long enough during the growing season to develop anaerobic
conditions in the upper part and be considered hydric soils. As the area receives natural hydrology and
sediment inputs, the current invasive vegetation that does not tolerate these conditions would likely not
survive, ultimately giving way to vegetation that thrive in these conditions. As native vegetation
recolonizes, over time the organic content of the soil would increase as the vegetation dies, accumulates,
and begins to decompose. The addition of hydrology and organic matter would assist in the development
of soil characteristics necessary to support wetlands and wetlands functions in approximately 30 acres
west of Haul Road. Potential scouring around the installed breaks could remove some soil in localized
areas; however, appropriate design of the break structures and scour analysis during the design stage
would help to minimize the amount of scour.

Impacts from Construction Activities
Under both of the action alternatives, the marsh would be reestablished using large and some smaller,
strategically placed containment cells. The cells would be designed to hold fill material until enough fill
can be placed to the correct elevation to support appropriate vegetation, and then plants could colonize or
the area could be planted as the fill material within the cells settles. Intertidal exchange in the wetlands
outside the containment cells would continue, although the cells would act as an obstruction and water
would flow around the cells and up Hog Island Gut. Therefore, there could be short-term effects on
sediment transfer and associated sediment erosion and deposition related to construction. While the cells
are in place they would partially block or redirect flow to the existing marsh behind the containment
structures. This could force water along the outermost and back edges of the containment structures,

134

George Washington Memorial Parkway

Impacts of the Alternatives on Soils and Sediments

resulting in erosion and localized adverse short-term effects on the marsh and its soils. The cells would
also create beneficial effects on soils by sheltering the existing marsh area and associated soils from
erosive storm waves while they are in place. The construction of the breakwater, the breakwater
containment cells, and the marsh restoration containment cells would impact the benthic sediments on
which the construction materials are placed by covering them entirely. However, these impacts would be
short term due to the ultimate creation of a new soil/sediment habitat within the containment cells. Design
would accommodate ground water level fluxes within the containment cells. The construction of these
structures could potentially have short-term adverse impacts on the adjacent sediments and soils through
sediment disturbance due to equipment or construction methods. There is the potential for accidental
discharge of sediments into the river in the case of an accident or structural failure of the containment
cells. If a large amount of sediment were released, it could result in extremely turbid waters and related
impacts on water quality and aquatic life (discussed in appropriate resource topic analyses) as well as
downstream soil and sediment quality. However, the risk of such an event would be minimized by
following requirements of permits and erosion and sediment control plans and in-stream BMPs outlined
the Virginia Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook 1992. Some BMPs include turbidity curtains in the
water and silt fences and erosion control blankets on the constructed surface.
Even if the fill material from the containment cells is not accidentally discharged, soil and sediment
impacts could result from the type and physical and chemical characteristics of the fill material used.
Soils within Dyke Marsh tend to be mainly fine-particles of silt or clay with 60–70 percent organic matter
or more (Gee and Bauder 1986). If the fill material has different characteristics it could have an impact on
the ability of the soil to support native vegetation and biota. The following soil features of the fill material
that could have an impact include organic matter content, texture, nitrogen and metal concentrations,
nutrient retention, and drainage capabilities (UMCES 2004). The consolidation rate of fill material soil
could impact the stability and settling of the soil in the containment cells and thereby affect marsh
elevation and vegetation (UMCES 2004). Specifications for fill characteristics and placement will be
established for construction so that these impacts are minimized.
Construction activities related to creating breaks in Haul Road could have several impacts on soils. Soils
would be compacted in a localized area around the break due to construction equipment and design
requirements. Specifics of the break designs are unknown at this time but would likely require the
addition of fill material in some places for grading purposes and soil removal at the breaks to achieve an
appropriate elevation for successful tidal exchange. Furthermore, during construction activities to
reconnect the two sides of Haul Road, erosion and sediment control BMPs would be used to prevent
accidental discharge of sediments into Dyke Marsh and the Potomac River. The BMPs used would
depend on the type of break (i.e., bridge or culvert) in Haul Road. Several examples that could be used
include culvert inlet protection, a silt fence, or a turbidity curtain placed farther away at the marsh-water
edge. BMPs would be consistent with the Virginia Erosion and Sediment Control Manual (VA DCR
1992).

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE B
Under alternative B, the focus is on the most essential actions that would reestablish hydrologic
conditions to shield the marsh from erosive currents and protect the Hog Island Gut channel and channel
wall. The direct and indirect impacts on soils and sediments would be the same as those discussed in the
section “Impacts Common to Both Action Alternatives.” This alternative includes the installation of
containment cells, a breakwater structure, and fill of the deep dredge channels. The difference in impacts
on soils and sediments under this alternative is that the geographic extent of impacts is the smallest out of
the two action alternatives. This alternative uses seven containment cells covering approximately
30-40 acres, in addition to the 30 acres behind Haul Road that would receive reintroduced tidal flows, for
70 acres overall. The cells under this alternative would not extend as far into the river as they would in

Chapter 4: Environmental Consequences

alternative C. In addition, the breakwater structure would be placed at the northernmost extent of the
historic promontory, which is different than the location in the other two action alternatives; therefore the
impacts due to the installation of the breakwater would be localized to that area. The breakwater location
would encourage sediment deposition and accretion in the area north of the breakwater. The action of
filling of the dredge/scour hole is the same for both action alternatives and the impacts from the channel
filling would be the same as those described in the section “Impacts Common to Both Action
Alternatives.” Any indirect effects to soils and sediments due to changes to hydrology and sediment
transport, deposition, and erosion processes are discussed in the hydrology and sediment transport
analyses section for alternative B. However, these impacts would likely be limited as compared to those
under alternative C due to the limited geographic extent of the actions under this alternative. The
hydrology and sediment processes would act on different locations than the other two action alternatives
and these processes would result in soil and sediment impacts in those different locations. As described in
detail in the hydrology and sediment transport section, processes include the decrease in erosive forces on
the Hog Island Gut channel and outer channel walls and the shoreline of the main marsh as well as the
increase in sediment accretion around Coconut Island and the main marsh shoreline.

Cumulative Impacts
The same past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future projects and their impacts on soils and
sediments in Dyke Marsh and the Potomac River discussed under the no-action alternative would be
considered for alternative B. Alternative B would contribute beneficial impacts on soils and sediments in
Dyke Marsh and the Potomac River to the mostly adverse impacts from other past, present, and
reasonably foreseeable future projects. The contribution would be noticeable, because most of the
cumulative impacts from other actions are localized and have a limited effect on the soils and sediment in
the immediate area of the marsh.

Conclusion
Under alternative B, sediments on the river bottom would be replaced with fill that would eventually
become wetland soils. The soils west of Haul Road would eventually be converted back to hydric soils.
There are no significant ecological benefits from replacing one type of soil or sediment with another. Soil
disturbance and river bottom compaction from construction activities would be both short and long term,
and adverse, but relatively minor, and not significant.
Alternative B would contribute beneficial impacts on soils and sediments in Dyke Marsh and the Potomac
River to the mostly adverse impacts from other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future projects.
The contribution would be noticeable because most of the cumulative impacts from other actions are
localized and have a limited effect on the soils and sediment in the immediate area of the marsh.

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE C
Under alternative C, there would be a greater extent of marsh restoration than under alternative B,
resulting in up to 180 acres of restored wetlands and marsh, including optional marsh restoration south of
the breakwater. The breakwater structure would be placed at the southern alignment of the historic
promontory to protect Hog Island Gut, and that would be coupled with restored wetlands upstream of the
breakwater that would simulate the historic extent of the land mass. Tidal guts would also be cut into the
restored marsh area, similar to historical flow paths, to allow crucial intertidal flows into the heart of the
marsh. The direct and indirect impacts on soils and sediments would be the same as those discussed in the
section “Impacts Common to Both Action Alternatives” except for the differences discussed below. As
with the alternative B, this alternative includes the installation of containment cells, a breakwater
structure, and filling of the deep channels, and also includes creation of new tidal guts. The difference in

136

George Washington Memorial Parkway

Impacts of the Alternatives on Soils and Sediments

impacts on soils and sediments under this alternative is that the geographic extent of impacts due to the
containment cells is greater than those in alternative B. The cells cover similar area along the marsh
shoreline as alternative B with the addition of cells in the southern marsh area adjacent to the breakwater
structure in the upstream direction and all the cells extend out towards the river past the alternative B limit
(i.e., the negative 4-foot contour) to the historic 1937 marsh limit adding up to 180 acres of wetland
habitat. In addition, the breakwater structure is placed at the southernmost extent of the historic
promontory which is a different location than alternative B. The action of filling of the deep channels is
the same for both action alternatives and the impacts from filling the channels would be the same as those
described in the section “Impacts Common to Both Action Alternatives.” An additional difference under
this alternative is the impact on soils and sediments due to the cutting of new tidal guts into the
containment cells, which would disturb and remove higher soil to create benthic sediments in the new
tidal gut channels.
Any indirect effects to soils and sediments due to changes to hydrology and sediment transport,
deposition, and erosion processes are discussed in the hydrology and sediment transport analysis section.
However these impacts would likely be more extensive than those described for alternative B due to the
greater area restored. It is likely that there would be increased protection from erosive forces and
therefore less sediment transport away from the marsh. The hydrology and sediment processes would act
on different locations than under alternative B and these processes would result in soil and sediment
impacts in different locations. As more fully discussed in the hydrology and sediment transport impact
analyses section, the southern location of the breakwater would promote sediment deposition and
accretion upstream of the breakwater and lead to the development of a shallow shelf at the Hog Island Gut
outflow but could provide less protection for the gut until the completion of the containment cells
adjacent to the breakwater. The placement and extent of the containment cells could limit the erosive
forces at high tide to a localized area around Coconut Island, slow down receding tidal flows, and create a
low energy deposition area between the two tidal guts at low tide. Construction-related impacts would be
the as those described in the section “Impacts Common to Both Action Alternatives,” but more extensive
than under alternative B because of the larger amount of marsh and wetlands restored (70 acres versus up
to 180 acres), the difference in breakwater installation location (southern versus northern location), and
the creation of the tidal guts.

Cumulative Impacts
The impacts on soils and sediments in Dyke Marsh and the Potomac River from past, present, and
reasonably foreseeable future projects would be the same as those discussed under the no-action
alternative. Alternative C would contribute long-term beneficial impacts on soils and sediments in Dyke
Marsh and the adjacent Potomac River to the mostly adverse impacts from other past, present, and
reasonably foreseeable projects. The contribution would be appreciable, particularly because the
cumulative impacts are localized for the most part, and the scale of the Dyke Marsh restoration under this
alternative is relatively large.

Conclusion
Impacts on soils and sediments under alternative C would be similar to but larger in scale than impacts
under alternative B. Sediments on the river bottom would be replaced with fill that would eventually
become wetland soils. The soils west of Haul Road would eventually be converted back to hydric soils.
There are no significant ecological benefits from replacing one type of soil or sediment with another. Soil
disturbance and river bottom compaction from construction activities would be both short and long term,
and adverse, but relatively minor, and not significant.

IMPACTS OF THE ALTERNATIVES ON SURFACE WATER
QUALITY IN THE POTOMAC RIVER
GUIDING REGULATIONS AND POLICIES
NPS Management Policies 2006 specifically addresses water quality in Section 4.6.3 (NPS 2006). The
policy states:
The pollution of surface waters and groundwater by both point and nonpoint sources can
impair the natural functioning of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems and diminish the
utility of park waters for visitor use and enjoyment. The Service will determine the
quality of park surface and groundwater resources and avoid, whenever possible, the
pollution of park waters by human activities occurring within and outside the parks. The
Service will


Work with appropriate governmental bodies to obtain the highest possible standards
available under the Clean Water Act for the protection for park waters;



Take all necessary actions to maintain or restore the quality of surface waters and
groundwater within the parks consistent with the Clean Water Act and all other
applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations; and



Enter into agreements with other agencies and governing bodies, as appropriate, to
secure their cooperation in maintaining or restoring the quality of park water resources.

Applicable state regulations include regulations and guidance that ensure construction activities minimize
or prevent runoff of sediment and associated pollutants into the State’s waterways. These regulations
include the Virginia Erosion and Sediment Control Manual (VA DCR 1992).

METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS
Potential impacts on water quality are based on impacts on the chemical, physical, or biological
constituents of the water column, and an assessment of the processes that affect these constituents. The
analysis of possible impacts on water quality was based on a review of existing literature and maps,
information provided by the NPS and USACE, including the hydrodynamic modeling and the sediment
flow modeling, as well as experience related to restoration of tidal freshwater marshes in the area, and
professional judgment.

IMPACTS OF THE NO-ACTION ALTERNATIVE (ALTERNATIVE A)
As discussed in the analysis of impacts on hydrology in this chapter, the marsh would continue to erode
under alternative A, carrying organic matter from the wetland root mats and sediment downstream as a
result (Litwin et al. 2011). The sediment and any nutrients bound to the wetland root mats would be wellsuspended around the marsh, given the results of sediment transport modeling, but it is unknown where
suspended solids would settle out downstream along the Potomac River. Erosion at the marsh would

138

George Washington Memorial Parkway

Impacts of the Alternatives on Surface Water Quality in the Potomac River

contribute to turbidity and nutrient loads in the river and adversely affect downstream water quality, but
given the size of the river, these impacts would not be particularly noticeable. Locally, incremental loss of
marsh area would gradually decrease the ability of Dyke Marsh to filter pollutants and provide general
water quality benefits to the river and immediately surrounding waters, benefits the marsh currently
provides.

Cumulative Impacts
There are several past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future projects that have or may have impacts
on water quality, including the replacement of the Woodrow Wilson Bridge in the 2000s, the
development of the Belle Haven Golf Course in the early 20th century, and the National Harbor
Development, including installation of a marina. Installation of a large Ferris wheel on the pier and
eventual construction of a large casino at National Harbor would not affect water quality, as stormwater
and erosion control practices would be used as needed. Many of these projects have changed the
shorelines and added sediments and sediment-bound nutrients to the water column in the river, although
wetland mitigation for the bridge contributed beneficial impacts on water quality with many new acres of
new wetlands and also provided permanent protection of wetlands that increased pollutant filtering in the
Potomac River watershed. The DC Water stormwater storage tunnels and other actions to address
stormwater and combined sewer overflow issues may have profound benefits on water quality in the
Potomac River by reducing bacterial loads and large loads of other stormwater-related pollutants. Impacts
from the marsh erosion would largely be localized. Therefore, the adverse impacts on water quality of
continued and accelerated erosion of the marsh from the no-action alternative would be a noticeable but
not appreciable contribution to the adverse and beneficial impacts on water quality from other projects.

Conclusion
Under the no-action alternative, erosion would continue and the marsh would eventually disappear. Marsh
sediments would be carried downstream. Fewer wetlands would also decrease the filtering capacity of
Dyke Marsh, lowering the ability of the marsh to provide water quality improvements locally. Similarly,
the continued erosion of the marsh and reduction of floodplain function and values under alternative A
would contribute noticeable adverse impacts to the overall cumulative impacts on water quality over time.
Impacts would be long term and adverse, but given the overall volume and velocity of water in the
Potomac River flowing by Dyke Marsh, the effects of the continued loss of marsh on water quality would
be locally adverse but not significant because the impacts would be localized.
The adverse impacts on water quality of continued and accelerated erosion of the marsh from the noaction alternative would be a noticeable but not appreciable contribution to the impacts on water quality
from other projects, because the impacts from the marsh erosion would largely be localized.

IMPACTS COMMON TO BOTH ACTION ALTERNATIVES
Long-term Restoration-related Impacts
As discussed under the impacts on water quality under alternative A, wetlands filter nutrients and other
pollutants in the water column of the Potomac River, and provide filtering for additional pollutants carried
off from the land in stormwater. Increasing marsh acreage would increase the ability of the marsh to filter
pollutants, fix nutrients, and settle sediment, improving water quality in the river around the marsh under
both action alternatives, although the extent would vary by alternative. Water quality parameters such as
dissolved oxygen and turbidity might be expected to improve, based on pre- and post-construction
monitoring at Kenilworth Marsh (Hamerschlag 1998). Other water quality parameters would be expected
to stay relatively constant.

Final Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and Long-term Management Plan / EIS

139

Chapter 4: Environmental Consequences

There would not be noticeable adverse impacts on water quality in the Potomac River as a result of
reintroduction of intertidal flows west of Haul Road. Intertidal flows would now reach west of the road,
connecting with land and soils that have not been regularly flooded in decades, but have not been
disturbed, so they would have a limited ability to adversely affect water quality overall. However, it is
likely that there would be some erosion or scour around the culverts or bridge pilings until a hydrologic
equilibrium is established. This would result in a small amount of soils and sediments, and any bound
nutrients or pollutants being carried into the marsh and river over the short amount of time after
construction is complete. Whatever soluble pollutants are in the soil west of Haul Road could be
transported into the river with the newly introduced intertidal flows.

Construction-related Impacts
Consistent with the Virginia Erosion and Sediment Control policies and regulations, construction would
use BMPs such as silt fences around the construction area at the breaks in Haul Road, and would use
practices for construction in waterways that are appropriate for the situation. The containment cells
themselves serve as sediment control devices, but additional BMPs, such as sediment curtains, could be
specified as necessary as the design and permitting process moves forward. In addition, fill materials for
the containment cells for the restored wetlands would be tested to ensure they do not contain harmful
pollutants, and would therefore not impact water quality.

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE B
Because alternative B would involve the smallest amount of restored wetland acres (up to 70 acres), water
quality impacts would be more limited in scale than under alternative C. There would be some water
quality benefits from increased filtration of pollutants as a result of increased marsh acreage, and the
overall rate of erosion would decrease or reverse over time.

Cumulative Impacts
The cumulative scenario is the same as discussed under the no-action alternative. Alternative B would
contribute mostly localized long-term beneficial impacts on water quality in the marsh and the river to the
adverse and beneficial impacts of other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects. The
contribution would be only somewhat noticeable, given the localized nature of the impacts from
alternative B and the impacts of many of the other projects.

Conclusion
Wetlands provide filters for nutrients and other pollutants, and marsh restoration under alternative B
would provide local benefits to water quality by increasing marsh acreage, as opposed to degradation of
water quality under the no-action alternative (alternative A). The scope of these benefits would be
somewhat restricted under alternative B, because only 70 acres of wetland and marsh would be restored.
The benefits would be mostly localized, and would not be particularly noticeable in the larger Potomac
River system, given the overall large volume and velocity of water in the river. The beneficial impacts on
water quality would not be significant.
Construction would cause short-term adverse impacts related to disturbing the sediments on the bottom,
although BMPs would be used during installation to prevent water quality issues, and the containment
walls would also prevent and minimize impacts. There would be some scour around the breaks in Haul
Road, at least initially, but that would affect a small amount of soils. Construction impacts would be
localized and would not be significant.

140

Impacts of the Alternatives on Floodplains

Alternative B would contribute mostly localized long-term beneficial impacts on water quality in the
marsh and the river to the impacts of other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects. The
contribution would be only somewhat noticeable, given the localized nature of the impacts from
alternative B and the impacts of many of the other projects.

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE C
Alternative C would restore noticeably more marsh than alternative B, up to 180 acres of various wetland
habitats, and would therefore result in more benefits to water quality because most of the improvements
to water quality would be the result of increased filtering capacity in the marsh. The increased filtering
capacity of the additional marsh acres under alternative C could introduce noticeable, and localized longterm improvements in water quality in Hog Island Gut as well as the newly created tidal guts.

Cumulative Impacts
Cumulative Impacts would be the same as under alternative B. Implementation of alternative C would
possibly contribute long-term beneficial impacts on water quality to the adverse and beneficial impacts of
other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects. The contribution would be noticeable, but not
appreciable, because the impacts from alternative C would still be mostly localized, even with the larger
acreage of expansion.

Conclusion
The scope of these benefits to water quality under alternative C would be greater than but similar in
nature to those under alternative B, because more acres of wetland would be restored. As with alternative
B, the benefits would be noticeable, but not significant. They would be mostly localized, given the size of
the Potomac River and the volume of water flowing by the marsh.
Similar to alternative B, construction would cause short-term adverse impacts related to disturbing the
sediments on the bottom, although BMPs would be used during installation to prevent water quality
issues, and the containment walls would also prevent and minimize impacts. There would be some scour
around the breaks in Haul Road, at least initially, but that would affect a small amount of soils, and the
adverse effects would not be large in magnitude. Impacts would not be significant, because they would be
localized and of limited magnitude.
Implementation of alternative C would possibly contribute long-term beneficial impacts on water quality
to the impacts of other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects. The contribution would be

IMPACTS OF THE ALTERNATIVES ON FLOODPLAINS
GUIDING REGULATIONS AND POLICIES
As discussed in chapter 1, the restoration is guided by NPS Management Policies 2006, specifically,
“Chapter 4: Natural Resources,” which states that “the National Park Service will strive to understand,
maintain, restore, and protect the inherent integrity of the natural resources, processes, systems, and
values of the parks while providing meaningful and appropriate opportunities to enjoy them” (NPS 2006).
Floodplain functions and values (store floodwaters, minimize erosion of adjacent soils, provide riparian

habitat, etc.) are intrinsic to floodplains and cannot be easily duplicated or replaced. Certain portions of
the Clean Water Act and the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act of 1899 also apply.
An Executive Order and an NPS Director’s Order guide analysis of impacts on floodplains, including
floodplain values and functions, apply:


Executive Order 11988 directs all federal agencies to avoid long- and short-term impacts
associated with occupancy, modification, and development of floodplains when possible.



NPS Director’s Order 77-2 implements Executive Order 11988 and established NPS policy to
preserve floodplain values and minimize potentially hazardous conditions associated with
flooding.

METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS
Success of the restoration relies on the ability to restore hydrologic conditions that would allow for and
encourage sediment deposition and accrual in the marsh, and could alter existing base flood elevations.
The USACE modeling discussed under the impacts on hydrology sections anticipated future conditions in
the marsh under the three action alternatives, including how the floodplain elevations would generally
change. This information was used in the analysis, along with a qualitative analysis of how restored marsh
would affect floodplain function and values. Scientific studies are cited to the extent possible when
discussing changes to either floodplain function or values.

IMPACTS OF THE NO-ACTION ALTERNATIVE (ALTERNATIVE A)
Under the no-action alternative, although marsh would continue to erode, the base flood elevation would
remain unchanged. However, the marsh itself would erode and shrink in size, reducing the assimilative
capacity of the marsh to buffer the adjacent uplands from flood events (USEPA 1995), an important
function of the floodplain. Haul Road would serve as a barrier to flood water and continue to prevent
inundation in the area of the former bottomland floodplain swamp forest.
In addition to assimilative floodplain capacity, the most notable floodplain value in Dyke Marsh is habitat
value. As the marsh erodes and shrinks, habitat value would also be reduced, as would the ability of the
marsh to filter nutrients, and the quality of the scenic open space as a floodplain value would be lessened.

Cumulative Impacts
Past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future projects affecting the floodplain around Dyke Marsh
include the wetland removal and mitigations projects associated with the Woodrow Wilson Bridge
Construction, development of the Belle Haven Country Club Golf course, and the Clean Rivers Project
under construction by DC Water. The wetlands mitigation projects associated with the bridge enhanced
floodplain capacity along the Potomac River, by the creating and preservation of more wetlands than were
impacted by the bridge. Development of National Harbor also affected the floodplain on the Maryland
side of the Potomac River by hardening the shoreline, and therefore affects the floodplain function on the
Virginia side. Future development at National Harbor is not expected to affect floodplain values or
functions. The Clean Rivers Project will indirectly improve floodplain capacity by storing potentially
large volumes of stormwater and reducing flood volumes downstream. The continued erosion of the
marsh and reduction of floodplain function and values under alternative A would contribute adverse
impacts to the mostly beneficial cumulative impacts on floodplains from other projects over time. The
contribution would be noticeable, and not appreciable, because the impacts from the erosion of the marsh
would affect only the immediate vicinity of the marsh.

142

George Washington Memorial Parkway

Impacts of the Alternatives on Floodplains

Conclusion
The continued erosion of the marsh under the no-action alternative would not change the base flood
elevation, but would adversely affect floodplain functions and values, including the ability of the marsh to
provide a buffer to the parkway and inland properties in storm conditions, and provide habitat for
floodplain species of plants and wildlife. These impacts would be noticeable, but would affect only
nearby properties, and the impacts would become evident slowly over time as the marsh erodes.
Therefore the impacts would not be of a large enough magnitude to be significant.
The continued erosion of the marsh and reduction of floodplain function and values under alternative A
would contribute adverse impacts to the mostly beneficial cumulative impacts on floodplains from other
projects over time. The contribution would be noticeable, and not appreciable, because the impacts from
the erosion of the marsh would affect only the immediate vicinity of the marsh.

IMPACTS COMMON TO BOTH ACTION ALTERNATIVES
The restoration of marsh would have a variety of impacts on the immediately surrounding floodplains.
Both alternatives would slightly increase the base flood elevation along the shoreline immediately
adjacent to the marsh. Generally, increases in wetland acreage increase flood storage capacities in the
floodplain, so all three alternatives would result in benefits to the floodplain in the adjacent parkland and
community, although to varying extent. In addition, meanders and additional stream length would be
restored to Hog Island Gut. The branches of the gut extend through the adjacent Belleview and New
Alexandria neighborhoods that are largely within the 100-year floodplain. The additional length and
meanders would reduce flow velocities and water volumes up the gut, in addition to adding more storage
capacity, making it less likely for the channelized sections of the gut (channelized through the
neighborhood outside the park boundaries) to flood, or lessen the severity of the flooding when flood
events occur.
Construction of the breaks in Haul Road would provide direct benefits to the floodplain west of the
roadway by restoring tidal flows. The land in this area is already in the floodplain, but is not as frequently
inundated, and therefore does not support the bottomland floodplain forest that it once did. The base flood
elevation in the area would change as predicted by the modeling (which varies by alternative). The
impacts on the floodplain in this area would otherwise be the same for both action alternatives.
Construction-related impacts on the floodplain would be limited. Installation of the walls of the
containment cells, particularly with the steel sheet piling that could be in place the longest, could displace
water and potentially exacerbate flooding in the area while the containment cells are in place.

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE B
Impacts on floodplains under alternative B would be the same as described above, but would affect the
fewest acres of the action alternatives, and would represent a detectable improvement over alternative A.
The models predict that the base flood elevation would increase approximately 0.10 foot (1.2 inches)
(USACE 2013). There would be some increase in flood storage capacity and that capacity would likely
increase to a limited degree over time. Habitat for marsh and floodplain fauna species would also be
increased, and would likely continue to increase somewhat over time, as the breakwater would allow for
accretion of sediments and slow expansion of marsh habitat.
Alternative B would result in the fewest construction-related floodplain impacts because the containment
cells would be relatively small and narrow, and there would not be many of them.

Final Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and Long-term Management Plan / EIS

143

Chapter 4: Environmental Consequences

Cumulative Impacts
The cumulative scenario of past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future projects is the same as under
alternative A. Alternative B would contribute beneficial, but mostly localized impacts, as well as shortterm adverse impacts to the mostly beneficial impacts of the past, present, and reasonably foreseeable
projects, resulting in overall benefits to the floodplain in Dyke Marsh and on the Potomac River. The
contribution of beneficial impacts from alternative B to the cumulative scenario would be noticeable, but
not appreciable, because the impacts would be mostly localized. The contribution of the short-term
impacts would be imperceptible.

Conclusion
Restoration of the marsh under alternative B would raise the base flood elevation by 1.2 inches, but would
also increase marsh area that would provide a buffer to the parkway and inland properties during storm
events, and could therefore lessen the severity of floods. Other floodplain functions and values would also
be increased. The benefits from alternative B would reverse the adverse effects under alternative A.
Although important, these benefits would not be large enough to be significant.
Alternative B would contribute beneficial, but mostly localized impacts to the mostly beneficial impacts
of other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects, resulting in overall benefits to the floodplain in
Dyke Marsh and on the Potomac River. The contribution of alternative B to the cumulative scenario
would be noticeable, but not appreciable, because the impacts would be mostly localized.

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE C
Impacts on floodplains under alternative C would be the similar to those described above for alternative
B, but would affect a larger number of acres than under alternative B, as more wetlands would be
restored. Although the models predict that the base flood elevation would ultimately increase up to 0.15
feet (1.8 inches) (USACE 2013), there would be a more noticeable increase in flood storage capacity than
alternative B, and that capacity would likely further increase to a limited degree over time as more marsh
builds naturally in the accretion areas behind the breakwater. Habitat for the marsh and floodplain species
would be increased directly as the result of restoration construction, and would likely further increase
somewhat over time because the breakwater would allow for accretion of sediments and slow expansion
of marsh habitat.
Alternative C also would result in more construction-related floodplain impacts because the containment
cells would be larger in size and more numerous, and they would cover a larger area overall, so more
water would be temporarily displaced than under alternative B.

Cumulative Impacts
The cumulative scenario of past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future projects is the same as under
alternative A. Similar to alternative B, alternative C would contribute beneficial, but localized impacts to
the beneficial impacts from other projects, as well as short-term adverse construction related impacts,
resulting in overall benefits to the floodplain in Dyke Marsh and on the Potomac River. The contribution
from the long-term beneficial impacts would be noticeable, whereas the contribution from the short-term
adverse impacts would be imperceptible.

144

George Washington Memorial Parkway

Impacts of the Alternatives on Vegetation and Wetlands

Conclusion
Restoration of the marsh under alternative C would raise the base flood elevation by 1.8 inches, but would
also noticeably increase marsh area. The increases in marsh areas under alternative C would provide a
greater buffer from flooding to the parkway and inland properties during storm events than alternative B,
and could therefore further lessen the severity of floods in areas near the marsh. Other floodplain
functions and values would be increased. There would also be some short term adverse impacts on
floodplain function and values as the result of the placement of the containment structures that could
restrict the assimilative capacity of the existing marsh temporarily. Similar to alternative B, although the
beneficial impacts would be important, and larger than under alternative B, these benefits and the shortterm adverse impacts on floodplain function and values would be localized and relatively small. They
would not be large enough in magnitude to be significant.
Alternative C would contribute beneficial, but localized impacts to the beneficial impacts from other
projects, as well as short-term adverse construction-related impacts, resulting in overall benefits to the
floodplain in Dyke Marsh and on the Potomac River. The contribution from the long-term beneficial
impacts would be noticeable, whereas the contribution from the short-term adverse impacts would be
imperceptible.

IMPACTS OF THE ALTERNATIVES ON VEGETATION AND
WETLANDS
GUIDING REGULATIONS AND POLICIES
As stated in chapter 1 and above, the restoration is guided by NPS Management Policies 2006,
specifically, “Chapter 4: Natural Resources,” which states that “the National Park Service will strive to
understand, maintain, restore, and protect the inherent integrity of the natural resources, processes,
systems, and values of the parks while providing meaningful and appropriate opportunities to enjoy them”
(NPS 2006). The NPS has been directed by Congress to restore Dyke Marsh to its natural ecosystem
functions, which have been disrupted by past and ongoing human activity. The NPS is also obligated
under Director’s Order 77-1, Wetland Protection (NPS 2002) and its accompanying guidance (NPS
2011b), to implement Executive Order 11990, Protection of Wetlands,” first issued in 1977 by President
Jimmy Carter. Director’s Order 77-1 mandates the NPS to achieve a goal of no net loss of wetlands
within their resources; thus adopting a restoration program for Dyke Marsh would help to achieve that
goal.
The NPS is obligated to minimize the harmful effects that nonnative invasive species have on their lands,
under Executive Order 13112, Invasive Species, first issued by President Clinton in 1999. Under
Executive Order 13112, federal agencies are to use the national-level invasive species management plan,
created by the Invasive Species Council, to prevent the further spread of invasive species on federal lands.
Construction activities would be guided by state and federal laws, including the Clean Water Act (Section
404) and Section 9 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899. The implementation of the project would
require consultation with the VA DCR under its Virginia Water Protection Permit process and the
Virginia Marine Resources Commission to address any potential impacts on the existing wetlands that
may occur during construction.

Chapter 4: Environmental Consequences

METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS
Successful restoration of wetlands depends on the consistent accumulation of marsh soil, which is
deposited from suspended sediment, and on the gradual buildup of organic matter. Additionally, the
success of wetland restoration will be measured by the regeneration of wetland plant species across
several elevation zones, including high marsh, emergent marsh, submerged areas, and forested swamps.

IMPACTS OF THE NO-ACTION ALTERNATIVE (ALTERNATIVE A)
Under the no-action alternative, no restoration efforts would occur and the marsh and its wetland
vegetation would continue to degrade; however, the floodplain and swamp forest vegetation would
remain relatively stable. Throughout its history, the floodplain forest in Dyke Marsh has remained
relatively stable (NPS 1993); this is likely because these forests are not located in proximity to the erosive
forces along the shoreline. As a result of the removal of the promontory during dredging, erosive forces
increased along the eastern side of the marsh, which created marsh erosion in a landward direction
(Litwin et al. 2011). Additionally, the removal of the promontory caused Hog Island Gut to lose its
protection against surging tides; as a result, the mouth of Hog Island Gut has widened and has become
more susceptible to continued erosion from stronger tidal waters entering. Because tidal waters flowing
into and ebbing from Hog Island Gut are moving at an increased velocity, sediment that historically
would have accrued in Dyke Marsh is leaving the system and entering the Potomac River. Therefore, as
discussed under other resource topic analyses, there is a twofold loss of wetland soils; increased tidal
velocity is causing marsh soils to erode and leave the marsh system, and sediment that would normally
settle out from tidal waters is instead remaining in suspension. Under the no-action alternative these
processes of erosion and sediment loss would continue (Litwin et al. 2011).
Based on photographic interpretation, Dyke Marsh is decreasing by approximately 0.75 acres per year
(Litwin et al. 2011). The continuing loss of marsh would lead to the corresponding loss of wetland
vegetation in Dyke Marsh. The acreage of low marsh communities, such as pond lily and pickerelweed
tidal marshes, would continue to decrease, as would the communities of freshwater tidal high marsh.
Species of concern such as river bulrush and giant bur-reed would be affected, and occurrences of these
plants would decrease in the marsh. Under the no-action alternative, present communities of SAV could
also be impacted. As the marsh erodes and releases sediment to the adjacent Potomac River, the resultant
sediment could block sufficient light from reaching the SAV. However, as the marsh edge recedes, there
is a potential for the SAV communities to reestablish themselves further landward. Although this may
result in a temporary no net loss scenario for SAV, it is not sustainable for SAV or marsh vegetation.
The continuing loss of wetlands under the no-action alternative would remove the functions and values
that wetlands provide as already discussed in the impacts on floodplains and water quality analyses. The
majority of floodplain and swamp forest vegetation in Dyke Marsh would continue to remain relatively
stable (NPS 1993). Construction of the Haul Road changed the hydrology of Dyke Marsh, because the
area west of the Haul Road was cut off from the historic hydrology. As a result, the vegetation west of
Haul Road has developed into a successional community with several nonnative invasive species (NPS
2009g). Under the no-action alternative, NPS would continue to remove invasive species either by hand
or with approved chemical applications in this area.

Cumulative Impacts
Other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions in the vicinity of Dyke Marsh have the
potential to impact both wetlands and vegetation in the marsh and the adjacent Potomac River. The
construction of the new Woodrow Wilson Bridge in Alexandria in the 2000s, the development of the
Belle Haven Golf Course early in the 20th century, the development of the National Harbor in the 2000s,

146

George Washington Memorial Parkway

Impacts of the Alternatives on Vegetation and Wetlands

and the present DC Water Clean Rivers Project all affected wetlands, though most impacts were
localized. The construction of the bridge affected wetlands and vegetation along the shore at both ends of
the bridge. There was mitigation for wetland and vegetation disturbance. Hydrologic changes associated
with the bridge did not exacerbate Dyke Marsh erosion and adverse effects on wetlands and vegetation in
the marsh in any noticeable way, because higher flow velocities are directed into the shipping channel on
the far side of the river from the marsh.
The construction of the golf course and the associated increased runoff and sediment deposition in
Cameron Run and Hunting Creek, when coupled with the development upstream on Cameron Run, has
resulted in sediments being carried out of Cameron Run and settling out at the confluence with the
Potomac River, where large mud flats are developing; that sediment is not being carried downstream in
the direction of Dyke Marsh, thus marsh erosion is attenuated due to lower deposition rates.
The development of the National Harbor in Prince Georges County, Maryland, has led to increased ferry
traffic in the Potomac River (Potomac River Boat Company 2013). Although the ferries cross the river
north of the marsh, or remain in the shipping channel as they head south to Mount Vernon, they can
create wakes that can cause short-term increases in wave energy that can cause erosion on the edges of
Dyke Marsh.
The no-action alternative would continue to contribute noticeable adverse effects on wetlands and
vegetation in the marsh to the beneficial and adverse impacts from these other projects. The contribution
of impacts from the no-action alternative would be appreciable because of the types of vegetation and the
acreage affected.

Conclusion
The no-action alternative would result in erosion and disappearance of the marsh and its vegetation over
time, including plants such as river bulrush that are species of concern. Additional impacts include
reduced or eliminated functions and values that wetlands of Dyke Marsh provide. Erosion and
disappearance of Dyke Marsh would result in significant adverse effects on vegetation and wetlands
because tidal freshwater marsh is regionally threatened, and Dyke Marsh is important in a regional
context. In addition, the river bulrush community is unusual, and there are very few tidal freshwater
wetlands in this region, particularly with similar plant communities. Prevalence of the river bulrush is rare
within Virginia, and it is a dominant component in the marsh.
The no-action alternative would continue to contribute noticeable adverse effects on wetlands and
vegetation in the marsh to the impacts from other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects. The
contribution of impacts from the no-action alternative would be appreciable because of the types of
vegetation and the acreage affected.

IMPACTS COMMON TO BOTH ACTION ALTERNATIVES
Changes in Wetlands along Haul Road
Under all the action alternatives, the creation of breaks along Haul Road would allow tidal flows to pass
under the road and into the former bottomland swamp forest, which would allow for the restoration of the
bottomland swamp forest. The restored hydrology and sediment transfer would result in beneficial
impacts on hydrology and sediment transfer in the area behind Haul Road because the breaks would allow
past hydrologic conditions to be reestablished, and that would allow desirable ecologic conditions to be
reestablished. The reconnections would discourage continued establishment of nonnative and invasive
plants because repeated inundation favors the reestablishment of native plants over nonnative plants. The

Final Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and Long-term Management Plan / EIS

147

Chapter 4: Environmental Consequences

reconnections would also result in improvements in floodplain values, as described in the floodplains
section.

Impacts from Climate Change
Impacts to vegetation in the marsh generally, and in the restored marsh specifically, can be expected over
time, as water levels and/or salinity may change as a result of climate change. The marsh will be
monitored as part of the adaptive management plan (see “Adaptive Management Approaches Included in
the Action Alternatives” in chapter 2) and designed to be resilient to avoid adverse impacts to the marsh
related to climate change.

Impacts from Construction Activities
Under all the action alternatives, the marsh would be reestablished using large containment cells and
some smaller, strategically placed containment cells. The cells would be designed to hold fill material
placed to the right elevation to support appropriate vegetation, and then settled so that plants can colonize
or the area can be planted. Once fill has been placed, intertidal exchange and groundwater flows through
the new marsh area would facilitate establishment of desired plant communities that are consistent with
the existing marsh. Intertidal exchange in the wetlands outside the containment cells would continue,
although water would flow around the cells, and up Hog Island Gut.
Under all of the alternatives, construction of new wetland areas would occur adjacent to existing marsh.
The construction activity would take place from the water using barges, so there would be no impacts on
existing marsh wetlands from construction equipment traversing the existing marsh. Construction would
place containment cells abutting existing marsh which could prevent erosive forces from continuing to
degrade their edges which could reduce erosion and fragmentation.
Construction of the breakwater would also affect subaqueous wetlands. Based on preliminary design,
about 191 linear feet of breakwater would be placed in water that is 6 feet deep or shallower. Assuming
that the breakwater would be 7 feet in elevation when the water is 6 feet deep, it is estimated that the base
of the breakwater would be about 35-feet wide at the bottom. At that width, a 191-foot breakwater would
cover approximately 0.15 acres of subaqueous wetlands.
During construction of the containment cells or breakwater, existing SAV could be displaced if they exist
where the containment cells or breakwater are being placed. However, this would be a short-term impact
for the containment cell construction areas, because SAV would be expected to recolonize the resultant
new edge of the marsh (USACE 2013). As mentioned in chapter 3, nearly all of the SAV within Dyke
Marsh was observed to have disappeared in 2003 (VIMS 2014), likely the result of impacts from
Hurricane Isabel. However, by 2008, SAV levels exceeded those observed in 2002. Therefore, it is
anticipated that SAV will naturally recolonize around the shallow edges of the containment cells over
time. The loss of subaqueous wetland in the footprint of the breakwater would be permanent, but
minimal. In the event of an accidental sediment spill during construction, SAV could be impacted if the
sediment plume blocks light from reaching the plants or if sediment settles from the water onto the plants.
However, this situation is unlikely to occur because of erosion and sediment control plans and use of
BMPs. Finally, no impacts on wetlands are expected from filling the deep channel in the eastern portion
of the project area. No mapped marsh exists in that area and because the depth exceeds two meters, it is
unlikely that SAV are present. SAV species generally grow in water that is less than two meters deep due
to light requirements needed for photosynthesis (USEPA 1992).

Impacts of the Alternatives on Vegetation and Wetlands

Management of Nonnative Invasive Plant Species
Under all of the action alternatives, it is expected that the NPS would continue to monitor the presence of
nonnative plant species and work to remove them from Dyke Marsh. The removal activities would
include applying herbicides to eradicate Phragmites, purple loosestrife, and other nonnative invasive plant
species; managing volunteers who physically remove nonnative plants and tag/cut plants for later
application with NPS-approved herbicides; and removing nonnative plants and debris from the Haul Road
area.

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE B
Under alternative B, the focus is on the most essential actions that would reestablish conditions suitable
for the creation of wetlands north of the historic promontory. The restoration activities would create
beneficial hydrological and sediment deposition conditions that would promote successful marsh
accretion and the establishment of wetland vegetation communities over the long term. A breakwater
structure would be constructed on the south end of the marsh, in alignment with the northernmost extent
of the historic promontory, and wetlands would be restored to wherever the water is less than 4-feet deep.
This alternative would create approximately 70 new acres of various wetland habitats and allow the
continued natural accretion of soils and establishment of wetlands given the new hydrologic conditions.
Based on the data presented in the hydrology section, a significant tidal lag would be created, which
would slow the velocity of incoming tidal water. The effect would be that water that normally flows
directly over the top of the marsh would be directed to the marsh through tributary channels of Hog Island
Gut. Although not predicted by the flow models, this new hydrologic flow dynamic may decrease the
amount of water that is reaching the northwestern portion of the existing marsh; if this were the case, and
a portion of the marsh is cut off from its source of hydrology, it may be possible that areas within the
existing marsh would be converted from wetlands dominated by obligate plant species to those that are
more suited to a drier hydrologic regime. However, based on the hydrologic modeling, it is not expected
that any areas would be cut off from a reliable hydrologic source (USACE 2012a). The proposed breaks
in Haul Road are designed to address the concern that the northwestern area has lost its hydrologic
connection. Impacts created by the breaks in Haul Road are discussed in the section “Impacts Common to
Both Action Alternatives.”
Although the acreage of wetlands created under alternative B would be fewer than those that existed
historically, the conditions that were conducive to creating the historic marsh would be restored, thus it is
expected that steady accretion would occur and that wetland vegetation would colonize the expanding
marsh soil. The success of wetland colonization is dependent upon the nature of plant propagation.
Several revegetation approaches have been put forward, including seed dispersal and transplanting plugs.
Seed dispersal is often successful; however, it is often more successful if the seeds are dispersed via water
instead of by other forces such as wind (Neff and Baldwin 2005). Thus, it is important that hydrology be
restored adequately so that flowing and ebbing water can disperse seeds throughout the newly created
marsh.
Construction-related impacts from the partial blockage of flows into the existing marsh by the
containment structures would be as described in the section “Impacts Common to Both Action
Alternatives,” but would be relatively small, given the limited scope of marsh restoration under this
alternative. Construction-related impacts from the placement of containment cells on existing SAV beds
would be as described in the section “Impacts Common to Both Action Alternatives,” but would be short
term, because it is anticipated that SAV will recolonize around the shallow cell edges over time.

Chapter 4: Environmental Consequences

Cumulative Impacts
The projects and impacts on wetlands and vegetation in Dyke Marsh from past, present, and reasonably
foreseeable future projects would be the same as those discussed under the no-action alternative.
Implementation of alternative B would contribute beneficial long-term impacts to the mostly localized
beneficial and adverse impacts of other projects, and would include benefits that help mitigate some of
the adverse impacts from these other projects, such as protecting the marsh from erosive impacts of ferry
wakes that can exacerbate erosion. The contribution would be noticeable, and not appreciable, because
most of the cumulative impacts from other actions are localized and have a limited effect on the wetlands
and vegetation in the immediate area of the marsh.

Conclusion
Alternative B would result in the creation of 70 acres of various wetland habitats, and would reverse the
erosion and disappearance of the marsh described under alternative A. The new vegetation would protect
existing marsh, including river bulrush and other unusual plants, in addition to increasing overall marsh
acreage. There would be some adverse construction-related impacts that would be relatively small in
magnitude. Because the new vegetation under alternative B would protect this important regional
resource, the beneficial impacts would be significant.
In addition, the break in Haul Road and the resulting hydrologic reconnections would discourage
continued establishment of nonnative and invasive plants because repeated inundation favors the
reestablishment of native plants over nonnative plants, an important, but not significant effect.
Implementation of alternative B would contribute beneficial long-term impacts to the mostly localized
impacts of other projects. The contribution would be noticeable, and not appreciable, because most of the
cumulative impacts from other actions are localized and have a limited effect on the wetlands and
vegetation in the immediate area of the marsh.

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE C
Under alternative C, there would be a greater extent of marsh restoration than under alternative B,
resulting in up to 180 acres of restored wetlands and marsh, including high marsh, emergent marsh, tidal
guts, and areas of SAV, as well as bottomland swamp forest. The breakwater structure would be placed at
the southern alignment of the historic promontory to protect Hog Island Gut, and that would be coupled
with restored wetlands upstream of the breakwater that would simulate the historic extent of the land
mass. Tidal guts would also be cut into the restored marsh area, similar to historical flow paths, to allow
crucial intertidal flows into the heart of the marsh.
Impacts on wetlands and vegetation would be similar to those under alternative B. Under alternative C, up
to 110 more acres of wetlands would be restored than under alternative B, which could extend into the
river between approximately 400 feet and 2,000 feet from the current marsh edge (USACE 2013). Under
alternative C, there would be an establishment of SAV between the break in the emergent marsh and the
edge of the wetland cells; thus, not all of the created wetland area would be marsh. This scenario of
extending the edge of the existing marsh much farther toward the water would probably impact the
existing SAV, which are likely to be destroyed as their habitat is converted from open water to emergent
marsh. However, because the overall area of restored marsh would exceed that of the present Dyke Marsh
by up to 180 acres, there is the potential for an even greater area of SAV to develop in the shallow areas
around the edge of the marsh upon completion of construction after restoration.

150

Impacts of the Alternatives on Vegetation and Wetlands

The restored hydrology under alternative C would allow the marsh to be entirely inundated at high tide.
However, unlike under the current hydrology, areas of the marsh would be allowed to dry out at low tide,
thus providing the necessary ecological conditions for high marsh and low marsh vegetation to colonize
the formerly permanently inundated areas. High marsh vegetation is expected to grow in areas at least one
foot above the typical water surface elevation, low marsh vegetation is expected to grow in areas between
one foot and zero water surface elevation, and SAV are expected grow at a depth no deeper than five feet
below water surface elevation (USACE 2013). Although high marsh and low marsh species can cross
these depth zones, high marsh plants tend to perform better at higher elevations because the higher
elevation provides their roots more oxygenated soil zones. Conversely, low marsh plants are better able to
compete at lower elevations because of adaptations in their roots (Cronk and Fennessy 2001). In order to
maintain this transition from marsh to SAV and avoid continuing erosion, a 20:1 slope gradient would be
constructed at all edges (USACE 2013). The final design of the marsh would need to consider this and be
refined from the current design so that the appropriate ratio of high marsh to emergent marsh is created.
Impacts related to cell design, and related to the introduction of breaks in Haul Road are discussed in the
section “Impacts Common to Both Action Alternatives.”
Construction-related impacts would be as described under impacts common to all, but would be more far
reaching than under alternative B, because there would be a larger amount of marsh restored and a larger
number of containment cells would be used. The containment cells could reduce flows into the existing
marsh but would also protect it from erosion.

Cumulative Impacts
Cumulative impacts on wetlands and vegetation would be the same as discussed under the no-action
alternative. Alternative C would contribute long-term benefits to the beneficial and adverse impacts from
other projects, including protection of the marsh from some of the erosive effects of other projects. The
contribution of the beneficial impacts of alternative C on wetland restoration and vegetation colonization
in Dyke Marsh would be appreciable, particularly since the cumulative impacts of other past, present, and
reasonably foreseeable projects are for the most part localized, and the scale of the Dyke Marsh
restoration under this alternative is relatively large.

Conclusion
Like alternative B, alternative C would protect existing marsh and vegetation. It would also create up to
an additional 110 acres of various wetland habitats (a total of 180 acres of restored wetlands and marsh).
Alternative C would result in significant beneficial impacts both by protecting existing marsh and
vegetation and restoring and increasing overall marsh acreage. Implementation of phase one would
protect the existing marsh then allow additional restoration to move forward in the future. It is also
expected that SAV would colonize around the shallow edges of the restored marsh over time. There
would be some short-term adverse construction-related impacts that would be relatively small in
magnitude. All of the beneficial impacts would be associated with the core purpose of the project. Similar
to alternative B, because the new vegetation under alternative C would protect an important regional
resource, the long-term beneficial impacts would be significant.
Also as with alternative B, the break in Haul Road and the resulting hydrologic reconnections would
discourage continued establishment of nonnative and invasive plants because repeated inundation favors
the reestablishment of native plants over nonnative plants.
Alternative C would contribute long-term benefits to the impacts from other projects, including protection
of the marsh from some of the erosive effects of other projects. The contribution of the beneficial impacts

Chapter 4: Environmental Consequences

of alternative C on wetland restoration and vegetation colonization in Dyke Marsh would be appreciable,
particularly since the cumulative impacts of other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects are
for the most part localized, and the scale of the Dyke Marsh restoration under this alternative would be
relatively large.

IMPACTS OF THE ALTERNATIVES ON FISH AND WILDLIFE
GUIDING REGULATIONS AND POLICIES
Servicewide NPS regulations and policies, including the NPS Organic Act of 1916; NPS Management
Policies 2006; and the NPS Reference Manual 77, Natural Resource Management, direct national parks to
provide for the protection of park resources. The Organic Act directs national parks to conserve wildlife
unimpaired for future generations and is interpreted to mean that native animal life are to be protected and
perpetuated as part of a park unit’s natural ecosystem. Parks rely on natural processes to control
populations of native species to the greatest extent possible; otherwise, they are protected from harvest,
harassment, or harm by human activities. The NPS Management Policies 2006 state that the NPS would
maintain, as parts of the natural ecosystems of parks, all native plants and animals. The NPS Natural
Resources Management Guidelines state, “the National Park Service will seek to perpetuate the native
animal life as part of the natural ecosystem of parks” and that “native populations will be protected
against…destruction…or harm through human actions.”
The implementation of the project would follow in-water construction management practices required by
the VA DCR in the Virginia Erosion and Sediment Control Manual (VA DCR 1992) and the VDGIF
concerning the protection of fish and wildlife species during construction activities.

METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS
Potential impacts on terrestrial and aquatic fish and wildlife and their habitats were evaluated based on
known life histories and habitat requirements, and their past and present occurrence in the Dyke Marsh
preserve. Information on habitat and occurrence within the Dyke Marsh preserve and potential impacts on
species from the freshwater tidal marsh restoration efforts was acquired from park staff, available
literature, and the discussions of subject matter experts during the science team meetings that were
conducted for this restoration plan. The analysis also integrated the findings of the hydrodynamic
modeling of the marsh and the surrounding area of the Potomac River under the different alternatives.

IMPACTS OF THE NO-ACTION ALTERNATIVE (ALTERNATIVE A)
Terrestrial Wildlife
Under the no-action alternative, species present within Dyke Marsh, including species of concern, such as
the least bittern and swamp sparrow (discussed in more detail in the species of concern section), would
continue to occur, but would decrease over time because of the reduction of nesting and other suitable
habitat. The tidal freshwater marsh, swamp forest, and floodplain forest habitats would continue to persist
and provide habitat for amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. However, the amount of tidal
freshwater marsh habitat would continue to decline over time at a rate of approximately 6–7.8 feet per
year due to erosion (Litwin et al. 2011; USACE 2012a).
Given the current decline in the marsh wren population at Dyke Marsh, with the continued erosion of the
tidal freshwater marsh under the no-action alternative, enough habitat could eventually be lost that the
marsh wren may eventually disappear from the marsh.

152

Impacts of the Alternatives on Fish and Wildlife

Aquatic Wildlife
As a tidal freshwater marsh, Dyke Marsh provides forage and spawning habitat for adult fish species, as
well as nursery and refuge habitat for juvenile fishes (Mangold et al. 2004). The marsh also provides
habitat for a variety of invertebrates, as described in chapter 3. Under the no-action alternative, Dyke
Marsh would continue to provide suitable habitat for invertebrates, as well as juvenile and adult fish
species. However, the amount of habitat available for use by invertebrates and fish species would
continue to slowly decline over time with the loss of marsh due to erosion.

Cumulative Impacts
Other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions in the vicinity of Dyke Marsh have the
potential to impact both terrestrial and aquatic wildlife species in the marsh and the adjacent Potomac
River. The construction of the new Woodrow Wilson Bridge in Alexandria in the 2000s and development
at National Harbor have adversely impacted fish and wildlife species in the vicinity of Dyke Marsh
through the removal of SAV, wetlands, and benthic habitat, as well as the hardening of shoreline habitat.
In the short term, contributions of adverse effects from the no-action alternative to the effects on
terrestrial and aquatic fish and wildlife in the area from other projects would likely be imperceptible, but
in the long term, with the continued erosion of the freshwater tidal marsh and loss of habitat, the no-action
alternative would likely contribute a noticeable amount of adverse effects to the overall adverse
cumulative effects on both terrestrial and aquatic fish and wildlife species in the area.

Conclusion
Alternative A would result in several long-term adverse impacts on fish and wildlife in the marsh. Dyke
Marsh would continue to provide suitable habitat for invertebrates, as well as juvenile and adult fish
species. However, the amount of habitat available for use by invertebrates and fish species would
continue to slowly decline over time with the loss of marsh due to erosion. As the marsh erodes, habitat
for marsh dwelling birds and wildlife would disappear, and many fish and wildlife species would decrease
or disappear. Some of these species are species of concern; these species and other unusual species such
as the marsh wren would be adversely affected. As a result of the loss of marsh under this alternative and
the associated magnitude of adverse impacts on wildlife, impacts would be significant.
In the short term, contributions of adverse effects from the no-action alternative to the effects on
terrestrial and aquatic fish and wildlife in the area from other projects would likely be imperceptible, but
in the long term, with the continued erosion of the freshwater tidal marsh and loss of habitat, the no-action
alternative would likely contribute noticeable adverse effects to the overall adverse cumulative effects on
terrestrial and aquatic fish and wildlife species in the area.

IMPACTS COMMON TO BOTH ACTION ALTERNATIVES
Impacts from the Restoration of the Marsh
Under both action alternatives the construction of a breakwater in the vicinity of the historic promontory
and filling of the deep channels that resulted from dredging would decrease water velocities and
encourage sediment deposition, both of which would help protect Hog Island Gut and the existing marsh
from further erosion (see “Impacts of the Alternatives on Hydrology and Sediment Transport”). This,
along with the construction of new marsh surface using containment cells, would help preserve existing
habitat and add new marsh. The sloping of the fill within the containment cells to promote a natural soft
edge to the marsh would promote the growth of SAV habitat, although the amount of habitat marsh and
SAV habitat added would vary depending on the alternative selected. New tidal guts would be cut into the

Chapter 4: Environmental Consequences

restored marsh and allowed to grow naturally, providing additional marsh edge and channel habitat for
species. In addition, all of the action alternatives would provide new tidal connections between the marsh
and the back side of Haul Road, helping to reestablish floodplain swamp forest habitat for species to
utilize. Overall, an increase in abundance for both terrestrial and aquatic fish and wildlife species would
be expected under each of the action alternatives.
Terrestrial Wildlife—Amphibians and Reptiles
Dyke Marsh provides habitat for a variety of amphibians and reptiles. Protecting the existing marsh and
constructing new marsh would provide additional habitat and forage for species such as the bull, green,
and pickerel frogs; the American toad; the snapping, painted, red-bellied, red-eared, mud, and musk
turtles; the ring-neck, black rat, northern water, and eastern garter snake; as well as other species that use
the marsh habitat. Reconnecting the area behind Haul Road to tidal influence would enhance the
floodplain swamp forest habitat for species such as the two-lined and redbacked salamanders; the
American toad, the eastern gray treefrog, the green and pickerel frogs, the box turtle, the five-lined skink;
and a variety of snakes and other species that use that habitat for foraging, refuge, and reproduction.
Terrestrial Wildlife—Birds
Tidal freshwater marshes harbor a high diversity of birdlife. Low marsh and adjacent mudflats are used
by shorebirds (e.g., killdeer and spotted sandpiper), grasses and sedges characteristic of higher marsh
elevations support an abundance of seed-eating species (e.g., blackbirds, sparrows, finches, wrens and
others); tidal channels and pools provide habitat for shore birds (e.g., killdeer and spotted sandpiper);
while waterfowl (e.g., wood duck and mallard) use open water areas in addition to the marsh surface itself
Odum et al. 1984). Additionally, shrubs and trees found in the high marsh and along the upland-marsh
ecotone provide habitat for a large number of arboreal birds (e.g., swallows, flycatchers, kingbirds,
warblers and others) that can often be found feeding in or over the marsh as well (Odum et al. 1984).
Marsh restoration efforts would increase the amount of vegetated marsh habitat, as well as the amount of
tide channels and mudflat habitat, providing additional forage habitat for species, including those such as
the osprey that feed on fish in the marsh and peregrine falcons that feed upon small marsh birds. In
addition to increased forage habitat, the restored marsh would also provide additional nesting habitat for
those species that breed in the marsh. Species such as the red-winged blackbird, tree swallows, chipping
sparrows, and American goldfinch are known to nest in tidal freshwater marshes (Odum et al. 1984) and
have been recorded nesting at Dyke Marsh (Cartwright 2012).
Restoration efforts would also benefit the marsh wren and potentially help its population to grow. As
noted previously, marsh wrens have a very narrow habitat preference (tall, dense, emergent vegetation
adjacent to water) and as part of the restoration process, in addition to natural seed recruitment, the new
containment cells could be planted with cattails, river bulrush, and wild rice, along with other plant
species, depending on the ultimate approach to revegetation. These species of plants are the preferred
nesting habitat of the marsh wren (Gutzwiller and Anderson 1987). Among other factors, nesting success
in marsh wrens is dependent upon the density of other breeding marsh wrens and the distance between
marsh wren nests and the nearest red-winged blackbird nest (Gutzwiller and Anderson 1987). Adult
marsh wrens of both sexes destroy the eggs of other marsh wrens. As a result, typical territories for marsh
wrens range from 0.3 to 0.7 acres (Gutzwiller and Anderson 1987). Red-winged blackbirds aggressively
suppress the singing activities of marsh wrens, and therefore possibly reduce marsh wren reproductive
success (Gutzwiller and Anderson 1987). As a result, adding more preferred marsh habitat under all of the
action alternatives would increase the number of possible breeding territories for marsh wrens, although
the number of possible nests and breeding territories would vary with the amount of new habitat created
under the different alternatives.

Impacts of the Alternatives on Fish and Wildlife

Goose exclosures to prevent damage to wetland vegetation would be erected in the restored cells and
would consist of string stretched between stakes at intervals to prevent geese from landing between them.
The string and stakes would be flagged so that they are visible by birds and other wildlife to prevent
adverse impacts to other species. The exclosures have proven successful at Kingman Marsh on the
Anacostia River (Hammerschlag et al. 2006). Their use at Dyke Marsh would allow the restored marsh to
grow without the pressure of goose herbivory while providing habitat for birds and other wildlife. The
exclosures would not affect other smaller bird species or types of wildlife, because they could fit between
or under the exclosure strings, and the strings would be marked and flagged to deter wildlife from
accidentally coming into contact with them.
Terrestrial Wildlife—Mammals
Habitat for resident mammal species of the marsh, including opossum,
moles, mice, eastern cottontail, common muskrat, common raccoon, and
others would expand, though the amount of additional habitat available for
use would be dependent upon the amount of marsh to be restored under
each action alternative. The restored marsh would provide increased
foraging habitat in terms of invertebrates, fish, and marsh vegetation,
while the surrounding forested habitat would continue to provide den sites
and refugia.

Refugia are areas in which
a population of organisms
can survive through a period
of unfavorable conditions.

Aquatic Wildlife—Fish
As noted earlier, Dyke Marsh provides suitable habitat as a nursery and refuge for small and juvenile
fishes, including important species such as the anadromous American shad, blueback herring, and
alewife, while also providing spawning and foraging habitat for adult fish such as largemouth bass,
bluegill, and pumpkinseed, which are all important as recreational sport fish (Mangold et al. 2004). In
general, restoration of the marsh and creation of new tidal guts would provide additional habitat for these
uses resulting in long-term beneficial impacts on resident and transient fish species. However, as
restoration of the marsh occurs, some short- and long-term adverse impacts would occur under both
action alternatives.
In tidal freshwater marshes small species such as killifishes (e.g., mummichog and banded killifish)
aggregate in the shallows along the marsh edge or in tidal creek channels during low tide and then move
on to the marsh surface during high tide to seek refuge and feed (Odum et al. 1984). Species like the
mummichog also use the marsh surface as a nursery area, depending on it for spawning and survival of
juveniles (Kneib 1984). With marsh restoration and creation of new tidal guts, habitat for these resident
species would increase and their populations would likely grow, providing additional forage for larger
fish species such as largemouth bass, yellow perch, and white perch, as well as bird species that prey
upon them such as herons. However, exactly how much habitat is actually available for use by the various
fish species is dependent upon the amount of marsh restored under each action alternative and on its
accessibility. The number and location of tidal creeks, marsh surface, water depth, and hydroperiod
(length of time the marsh surface is inundated) all play key roles in determining how accessible the marsh
surface is to various species and life stages of fish and would likely vary among the different action
alternatives (Kneib and Wagner 1994; Minello et al. 1994; Peterson and Turner 1994; Rozas, McIvor, and
Odum 1988).
Part of the design for marsh restoration entails creating a soft, natural edge to the marsh. To accomplish
this, the fill material in the containment cells would be sloped so that water depths at the outer edge of the
containment cell would not support emergent marsh vegetation. However, it is likely that SAV would
become established in the deeper waters of the restored marsh edge. In studies of tidal freshwater

Chapter 4: Environmental Consequences

marshes, densities of species such as killifish were found to be higher on vegetated marsh surfaces and in
SAV habitats than over unvegetated bottom habitat (Castelloanos and Rozas 2001; Rozas and Odum
1987). The design of the marsh edge, which would likely help establish new SAV beds, would also
benefit small fish such as spot-tail shiners, tessellated darters, and silversides, along with killifish and
juveniles of other species that currently use the marsh habitat.
To attenuate water velocities and protect the marsh from wave energy, both action alternatives would
include the construction of a stone breakwater in the vicinity of the historic promontory and the filling of
the deep channels north of the promontory that are the result of past dredging. The holes and crevices
between the rocks would provide some structured habitat for fish species to use as refuge.
The deep channels, which have depths of approximately 10 to 26 feet (Normandeau Associates 2009),
would be filled with gravel or larger rock resulting in the loss of deep water habitat. Additionally,
individual holes located closer to the marsh edge would also be lost as they would be filled in to create
marsh habitat. However, the number and location of the deep holes to be filled would differ depending on
the action alternative. While tidal freshwater fish species are more often associated with shallows and
vegetation than with deeper channels, deep holes do provide refuge for larger fish such as catfish and
striped bass (Odum et al. 1984). Also, while juveniles of the centrarchid family (sunfish, crappies, and
bass) are most abundant in shallow water, larger adults can also be found in deeper water. Thus, filling
the deeper holes for marsh habitat would result in the loss of important fish habitat and cause long-term
adverse impacts. However, species would still be found in shallower waters within the park and there is
other nearby deep water habitat in the Potomac River outside of the park boundaries that fish could also
use.
As described in chapter 2, restoring the marsh would entail using a series of containment cells, which
would be made from a variety of materials such as hay bales or coir biologs in shallow waters or sheet
piling driven into the riverbed in deeper locations. While the sheet piling would be configured, cut, or
perforated to allow intertidal and groundwater exchange once the fill has been placed within it,
unimpeded tidal exchange in the vicinity of the containment cells would not occur until the restoration
activities are complete and the sheet piling cut or driven into the river bed. The hay bales and biologs
would also impede full tidal exchange with the marsh until they have biodegraded. As a result of the
containment walls, access to the marsh surface by small fish such as the mummichog and banded killifish
would be slightly reduced in the vicinity of the containment cells until the restoration process was
complete resulting in some small short-term impacts. These fish species would, however, still have full
access to the marsh surface via existing tidal guts or along the outer edge of the marsh where there are no
containment cells. Additionally, the walls of the containment cells would also inhibit movement of the
fish out of the marsh during the outgoing tide, potentially stranding individuals on the marsh at low tide
and making them more vulnerable to predation by birds and mammals. The magnitude of the adverse
impacts caused by the containment cells limiting fish access to the marsh surface would vary under each
alternative and be dependent on the number and size of the containment cells being employed at any one
time. Impacts would be minimized though through the phasing of restoration activities (i.e., not all
containment cells would be put in place at once).
Restoration of Dyke Marsh would also include reestablishing hydrological connections to the inland side
of Haul Road. Providing openings under Haul Road for tidal exchange to occur would open up potential
habitat for fish species to utilize, resulting in long-term beneficial impacts.
Aquatic Wildlife—Invertebrates
Information about the macroinvertebrate community in Dyke Marsh is not well documented, but the
marsh does contain over 300 individual species of arthropods, along with a variety of worms, mollusks,

Impacts of the Alternatives on Fish and Wildlife

and insects (Barrows and Kjar 2003; UMCES 2004). Restoration of the marsh would make more habitat
available including vegetated marsh, unvegetated tidal channels, and SAV for macroinvertebrates to
colonize, increasing their abundance and providing more forage for fish and wildlife species that prey
upon them. As mentioned in the “Birds” section previously, resident Canada goose populations can cause
damage to restored marshes through excessive herbivory, creating expansive unvegetated areas (Paul,
Krafft, and Hammerschlag 2006). The loss of vegetation due to goose herbivory at Kingman Marsh in the
Anacostia River estuary affected the macroinvertebrate community development in that restored marsh.
Paul, Krafft, and Hammerschlag (2006) found that while the unvegetated mudflats actually supported a
significantly greater density of macroinvertebrates (primarily chironomids [non-biting midges] and
oligochaetes [aquatic and terrestrial worms]) the vegetated sites promoted a greater diversity of species.
At Dyke Marsh, to prevent the loss of new vegetation due to grazing by resident Canada geese, goose
exclosures would be employed. By helping to eliminate potential unvegetated areas due to goose
herbivory, the exclosures would promote a more diversified macroinvertebrate community in the marsh.

Impacts from Construction Activities
To the greatest extent possible, access for construction under both action alternatives would be from the
water using marine construction equipment with materials brought in by barge. This includes activities for
constructing the breakwater in the vicinity of the historic promontory as well as the various containment
cells for creating new vegetated marsh. In general, construction activities would have short-term adverse
impacts on both terrestrial and aquatic fish and wildlife. Most impacts would be temporary displacement
of wildlife resulting from noise and vibration disturbances. Additional impacts on aquatic species would
include the potential burial or injury to less mobile species, and impacts from the resuspension of
sediments and increased turbidity.
Terrestrial Wildlife
During construction of the new breakwater and the containment cells there would be localized, temporary
adverse impacts on amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals in the vicinity of the construction. Species
would be temporarily displaced from habitat in the area of the construction due to noise and vibration
impacts. Because most species are highly mobile, mortality of terrestrial species would not be expected,
as most species would just avoid the disturbed areas. With construction activities occurring from the
water and only in those areas near the edge of marsh, wildlife located in the interior or landward edge of
the marsh may not be impacted. Once construction is completed, species would be expected to readily
recolonize the marsh.
Construction activities to reestablish the hydraulic connection to the inland side of Haul Road would
occur on the road, which is already a disturbed area. Some minor clearing of vegetation including trees
would likely be required. In addition to noise impacts temporarily displacing species from the localized
area, some minor tree habitat would be lost as well. However, to mitigate any lost habitat, new native
trees or possibly other appropriate native vegetation would be replanted in the disturbed area, resulting in
long-term benefits.
To protect selected wildlife during certain times of year (e.g., breeding season) when species may be most
sensitive to human activities (e.g., construction and land clearing activities), the VDGIF recommends
certain time-of-year restrictions (VDGIF 2013). For example, for general migratory and resident
songbirds, it is recommended to limit certain activities from March 15 to August 15 each year. The timeof-year restrictions are recommendations only to be considered as guidance for project planning purposes.
Whether or not the restrictions pertain to a specific project depends on the type of work proposed, the
location of the project relative to the resource area, and the timing and duration of the activity. Therefore,
the NPS would consult with the VDGIF during the permitting process for the project to develop

Final Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and Long-term Management Plan / EIS

157

Chapter 4: Environmental Consequences

appropriate construction measures and timing of the project activities to mitigate any potential adverse
impacts on terrestrial wildlife. However, given the potential adverse impacts on birds from construction
noise, it is likely that construction activities would be required to be conducted outside of their breeding
season.
Aquatic Wildlife
During construction of the new breakwater, filling of the deep channels, and construction of the
containment cells there would be localized, temporary adverse impacts on fish and macroinvertebrate
species in the vicinity of the construction. Fish species would be temporarily displaced from habitat in the
area of the construction due to noise and vibration impacts from driving the sheet piling into the sediment.
There could also be some mortality of sedentary and less mobile species (mainly macroinvertebrates such
as mollusks, snails, arthropods etc.) and life stages through burial during placement of materials on the
riverbed during construction of the breakwater, filling of the deep channels, and constructing and filling
the containment cells.
Construction activities would likely temporarily resuspend sediments in the river in the vicinity of the
marsh. Construction activities on Haul Road could cause sedimentation in the river through stormwater
runoff. Sedimentation in the river can cause local turbidity levels to increase which can have adverse
impacts on fish and other aquatic species. Many fish, such as sunfish, are visual feeders and increased
turbidity levels can hinder feeding success (Henley et al. 2000). Other impacts that can be caused by
increased turbidity include restricted habitat use and function through greater expenditure of energy, gill
tissue damage and associated respiratory impacts, lowered oxygen levels, and in some cases mortality
(Henley et al. 2000). Sedimentation may also smother spawning habitat, especially for substrate
spawners. If sedimentation occurs after spawning, then oxygen supply to eggs and sac fry in the substrata
may be decreased due to reductions in water circulation, increasing egg and larvae mortality.
In addition to fish, resuspended sediments settling to the riverbed can also reduce the available habitat for
macroinvertebrates as it fills the interstitial spaces between coarse substrata material (Henley et al. 2000).
Suspended sediments have also been shown to adversely affect the survival of freshwater mussels
(Henley et al. 2000).
Any adverse impacts from sedimentation and increased water column turbidity would be temporary and
minimal, because BMPs such as sediment curtains would be used to help contain resuspended sediments,
and erosion and sediment control BMPs would be used along Haul Road to prevent runoff during
construction in that area. Additionally, mobile species such as fish would likely flee the impacted areas to
surrounding waters where feeding and other impacts would be less problematic. Once construction is
completed, both fish and macroinvertebrates species would be expected to readily recolonize and use the
affected areas.
To protect freshwater species during certain times of year when species may be most sensitive (e.g.,
spawning season) to human activities (e.g., construction and land clearing activities), the VDGIF
recommends certain time-of-year restrictions for in-water work (VDGIF 2013). For example, to protect
general warm water species when they are spawning it is recommended to limit in-water work from April
15 to July 15; for anadromous fish, including the shortnose and Atlantic sturgeon, the recommended
timeframe is February 15 to June 30. The time-of-year restrictions are recommendations only to be
considered as guidance for project planning purposes. Whether or not the restrictions pertain to a specific
project depends on the type of work proposed, the location of the project relative to the resource area, and
the timing and duration of the activity. Therefore, the NPS would consult with the VDGIF during the
permitting process for the project to develop appropriate construction measures and timing of the in-water
project activities to mitigate any potential adverse impacts on aquatic wildlife.

Impacts of the Alternatives on Fish and Wildlife

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE B
Although the nature of the impacts described in the section “Impacts Common to Both Action
Alternatives” are consistent for both alternatives, the magnitude of the impacts differ slightly depending
on the alternative due to the amount of marsh to be restored.

Impacts from the Restoration of the Marsh
Terrestrial Wildlife
Under alternative B, approximately 70 acres of new marsh habitat would be restored, providing new
habitat and long-term benefits for amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals that inhabit the marsh.
However, the actual amount of vegetated marsh habitat created would be slightly less than 70 acres due to
the sloped design within the containment cells to provide for a soft natural edge to the marsh. Impacts
created from reestablishing the hydrological connection to the inland side of Haul Road are discussed in
the section “Impacts Common to Both Action Alternatives” above.
Aquatic Wildlife
Under alternative B the 70 acres of restored marsh and wetlands would provide additional refuge, forage,
and spawning habitat for fish and invertebrate species including some additional SAV habitat due to the
sloped design within the containment cells. While deep water habitat would be lost through the filling of
the deep channels, most other deep holes would remain intact since restoration activities would only take
place in areas where the current water depth is 4-feet or less. Impacts created from reestablishing the
hydrological connection to the inland side of Haul Road are discussed in the section “Impacts Common to
Both Action Alternatives” above.

Impacts from Construction Activities
The nature of construction-related impacts under alternative B would be the same as described in the
section “Impacts Common to Both Action Alternatives” above. The magnitude of the impacts, however,
would be the least among the three action alternatives due to the more limited scope of the marsh
restoration under this alternative.

Cumulative Impacts
The impacts on fish and wildlife in Dyke Marsh and the Potomac River from past, present, and
reasonably foreseeable future projects would be the same as those discussed under the no-action
alternative. Alternative B would contribute long-term beneficial impacts on wildlife in Dyke Marsh and
the Potomac River to mostly localized but adverse impacts from other projects. The contribution would be
somewhat noticeable, because it would increase the amount of available habitat to species in the local
area.

Conclusion
Alternative B would increase wetland and marsh habitat by approximately 70 acres, potentially allowing
for a corresponding increase in the number of species and larger population sizes over the long term.
Although the marsh would be stabilized and additional acres of habitat would be added, there would not
be enough ecological benefits to make the impacts significant.

Final Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and Long-term Management Plan / EIS

159

Chapter 4: Environmental Consequences

Construction-related impacts would result from the use of marine equipment, and include temporary
displacement of fish and wildlife as the result of construction noise and vibrations. Less mobile species of
aquatic wildlife could be buried during the fill process. Restrictions on construction periods would likely
be put in place per agreements with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and VDGIF to minimize
adverse effects from vibration and construction noise on species of fish and wildlife that breed in the
marsh. With BMPs and limits on construction during breeding periods, adverse construction impacts are
not likely to be large enough to be significant under alternative B.
Alternative B would contribute mostly beneficial impacts on wildlife in Dyke Marsh and the Potomac
River to the impacts from other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future projects. The contribution
would be somewhat noticeable because it would increase the amount of available habitat to species in the
local area.

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE C
Impacts from the Restoration of the Marsh
Terrestrial Wildlife
The nature of the impacts under alternative C would be the same as described in the section “Impacts
Common to Both Action Alternatives,” but greater in magnitude than under alternative B. There would be
a greater extent of marsh restoration than under alternative B, resulting in up to 180 acres of restored
marsh and other wetland habitats, including high marsh, emergent marsh, tidal guts, and areas of SAV.
Tidal guts would be cut into the restored marsh area, similar to historical flow paths, to allow crucial
intertidal flows into the heart of the marsh providing additional channel habitat for foraging. Impacts
created from reestablishing the hydrological connection to the inland side of Haul Road are discussed in
the section “Impacts Common to Both Action Alternatives” above.
Aquatic Wildlife
Under alternative C, up to 180 acres of restored wetland and marsh would provide additional refuge,
forage, and spawning habitat for both fish and invertebrate species allowing their populations to increase.
At high tide, the marsh would be inundated allowing small fish species such as mummichogs and killifish
to access most of the marsh surface. Although most impacts under alternative C would be beneficial, there
would be some long-term adverse impacts due to the loss of deeper water habitat. Unlike alternative B,
which would only restore marsh in waters less than 4-feet deep, marsh restoration under alternative C
would extend out beyond the negative 4-foot contour, filling in some of the deep holes that are often used
by fish. Some deep hole habitat north and west of Dyke Island and south of the new breakwater would
remain, but most other deep holes would be filled and restored to marsh habitat. Additionally, the deep
holes north and west of Dyke Island would also be lost to marsh restoration and if the option to restore
marsh habitat south of the new breakwater is exercised, the deep hole habitat in that area would be lost.
However, there are no species that exclusively use these holes, and there are other deep holes in the area.
Impacts created from reestablishing the hydrological connection to the inland side of Haul Road are
discussed in the section “Impacts Common to Both Action Alternatives” above.

Impacts from Construction Activities
The nature of construction-related impacts under alternative C would be the same as described in the
section “Impacts Common to Both Action Alternatives” above. The magnitude of the impacts, however,
would be greater than alternative B due to the number, size, and location of the containment cells that
would be constructed.

Impacts of the Alternatives on Species of Special Concern

Cumulative Impacts
The impacts on fish and wildlife in Dyke Marsh and the Potomac River from past, present, and
reasonably foreseeable future projects would be the same as those discussed under the no-action
alternative. Alternative C would contribute long-term beneficial impacts on wildlife to the mostly
localized adverse impacts from other projects. The contribution would be appreciable, because the
cumulative adverse impacts of other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects are for the most
part localized, and the scale of the Dyke Marsh restoration under this alternative is relatively large.

Conclusion
Alternative C would increase wetland and marsh habitat by up to 180 acres, following a smaller first
phase that would stabilize and slightly increase overall marsh acreage, and create a greater habitat area,
and would substantially increase the number of species and population sizes over the long term. The
amount of new habitat and associated benefits would be measurable and potentially significant.
Construction-related impacts would result from the use of marine equipment, and include temporary
displacement of fish and wildlife as the result of construction noise and vibrations. Less mobile species of
aquatic wildlife could be buried during the fill process. Restrictions on construction periods would likely
be put in place per agreements with USFWS and VDGIF to minimize adverse effects from vibration and
construction noise on species of fish and wildlife that breed in the marsh. With BMPs and limits on
construction during breeding seasons, adverse construction impacts are not likely to be significant despite
the larger extent of restored wetland under alternative C.
Alternative C would contribute long-term beneficial impacts on wildlife to the mostly localized impacts
from other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future projects. The contribution would be
appreciable because the cumulative adverse impacts of other projects are for the most part localized, and
the scale of the Dyke Marsh restoration under this alternative would be relatively large.

IMPACTS OF THE ALTERNATIVES ON SPECIES OF SPECIAL
CONCERN
GUIDING REGULATIONS AND POLICIES
Oversight of species of special concern is assumed by the Division of Natural Heritage in the VA DCR.
Dyke Marsh restoration is guided by NPS Management Policies 2006, specifically, “Chapter 4: Natural
Resources,” which states that “the National Park Service will strive to…protect the inherent integrity of
the natural resources, processes, systems, and values of the parks…” (NPS 2006). Such resources include
species of special concern.

METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS
Success of the restoration relies on the ability to restore hydrologic conditions that would allow for and
encourage sediment deposition and accrual in the marsh to support habitat for plant species of concern.
Although successful habitat creation is dependent upon marsh accretion, proper propagation of selected
plant species would increase the success of colonization by wetland plants, including species of concern.
Use of vegetation appropriate to the elevation (water depth) within the containment cells is an important
component of the restoration process. Several options can be used, depending on factors such as available
seed sources, type of wetlands desired in a cell, available plant material, and cost constraints. These

Final Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and Long-term Management Plan / EIS

161

Chapter 4: Environmental Consequences

options include allowing plants to establish naturally by seed or other propagates, seeding mudflats, or
transplanting plugs of nursery plants. Revegetation activities could be conducted by NPS staff,
contractors, or volunteers.
Potential impacts on bird species of special concern, as well as their habitats, were evaluated based on
known life histories and habitat requirements, and their past and present occurrence in the Dyke Marsh
preserve. Information on habitat and occurrence within the Dyke Marsh preserve and potential impacts on
species from the freshwater tidal marsh restoration efforts was acquired from park staff, available
literature, and the discussions of subject matter experts during the science team meetings that were
conducted for this restoration plan. The analysis also integrated the findings of the hydrodynamic
modeling of the marsh and the surrounding area of the Potomac River under the different alternatives.

IMPACTS OF THE NO-ACTION ALTERNATIVE (ALTERNATIVE A)
Davis’ Sedge
Under the no-action alternative, Dyke Marsh would continue to erode at its current or increased rate. As
stated in the vegetation and wetlands sections in chapter 3 of this document, the current rate of erosion is
having a greater impact on the marsh areas; however, because the floodplain forests are not adjacent to
the Potomac River, they have not been affected by the river’s erosive forces; thus, they have historically
been relatively stable (NPS 1993). However, the construction of Haul Road hydrologically has constricted
the floodplain forest behind Haul Road. As a result, normal dispersion of marsh plant seeds has been cut
off to this area, which gives an advantage to nonnative and invasive plants to colonize the floodplain
forest behind Haul Road and outcompete Davis’ sedge (Carex davisii, S1 – critically imperiled). Under
the no-action alternative, the floodplain swamp behind Haul Road would continue to be hydrologically
restricted and habitat for Davis’ sedge would continue to be lost.
Under all of the action alternatives, it is expected that the NPS will continue to monitor the presence of
nonnative plant species and work to remove them from Dyke Marsh. The removal activities will include
applying herbicides to eradicate Phragmites, purple loosestrife, and other nonnative invasive plant
species; managing volunteers who physically remove nonnative plants and tag/cut plants for later
application with NPS-approved herbicides; and remove nonnative plants and debris from the Haul Road
area. These practices will minimize the loss of habitat for Davis’ sedge mentioned in the preceding
paragraph.

Rough Avens
Under the no-action alternative, the areas behind Haul Road would continue to be hydrologically
restricted from the normal ebb and flow of the tides. As a result, normal dispersion of marsh plant seeds
has been cut off to this area, which gives an advantage to nonnative and invasive plants to colonize the
floodplain forest behind Haul Road and outcompete rough avens (Geum lacinatum, S1 – critically
imperiled). Under the no-action alternative, the floodplain swamp behind Haul Road would continue to be
hydrologically restricted and habitat for rough avens would continue to be lost.

River Bulrush and Giant Bur-reed
Under the no-action alternative, no restoration would occur and the marsh would continue to degrade at
its current or accelerated rate. The continuing loss of marsh soils and the lack of new soils being formed
from sediment deposition would lead to loss of habitat for existing communities of river bulrush
(Bolboschoenus fluviatilis, S2– imperiled) and giant bur-reed (Sparganium eurycarpum, S3 – watchlist,

162

George Washington Memorial Parkway

Impacts of the Alternatives on Species of Special Concern

vulnerable). Because these plants both function to bind marsh soil, loss of colonies of river bulrush and
giant bur-reed would make adjacent parts of the marsh more vulnerable to erosion.

Least Bittern
Loss of habitat and degradation of habitat are considered the primary threat to the least bittern
(Ixobrychus exilis, S3 – watchlist, vulnerable) (COSEWIC 2009), and under the no-action alternative tidal
freshwater marsh habitat within Dyke Marsh would continue to decline over time at a rate of
approximately 6–7.8 feet per year due to erosion (Litwin et al. 2011; USACE 2012b). This continued loss
of potential nesting and forage habitat for the least bittern would result in long-term adverse impacts.

Swamp Sparrow
Loss of and degradation of habitat is a primary threat to the swamp sparrow (Leberman 2009); therefore,
the continued loss of nesting and foraging habitat under the no-action alternative would result in longterm adverse impacts on the swamp sparrow (Melospiza georgiana, S1 for breeding– critically imperiled).

Cumulative Impacts
Other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions in the vicinity of Dyke Marsh have the
potential to impact plant and bird species of concern in the marsh and the adjacent Potomac River. The
construction of the new Woodrow Wilson Bridge in Alexandria in the 2000s and the development of the
National Harbor in the 2000s adversely impacted both bird species locally through the loss of wetlands
and the hardening of shoreline habitat in the vicinity of Dyke Marsh. The no-action alternative would
continue to contribute adverse effects on the three plant species of concern in the marsh to the adverse
impacts from other projects. The contribution from the impacts of the no-action alternative would be
appreciable because of the large acreage of marsh that would eventually be lost.
The loss of approximately 25 acres of tidal and nontidal wetlands habitat as part of the new Woodrow
Wilson Bridge was mitigated through the creation of an additional 100 acres of wetland habitat in
Virginia, Maryland, and the District of Columbia, which has likely benefited both species of birds
regionally. In the short term, contributions from the no-action alternative to the cumulative effects on the
least bittern and the swamp sparrow would likely be imperceptible, but in the long term, with the
continued erosion of the freshwater tidal marsh and loss of habitat, the no-action alternative would likely
contribute a noticeable amount of adverse effects to the overall cumulative effects on both species of birds
in the local area. The construction of the bridge included dredging and pile driving and has affected the
hydrology locally at the bases of the bridge structures by forcing the water around the bridge piers, and
where the water is deeper, in the narrower shipping channel, flow velocities are higher. Increased flow
velocities raise the erosion potential of Dyke Marsh; however, as stated above, these impacts are focused
more on the open marsh rather than the floodplain forest.
In addition, the development of the National Harbor in Prince George’s County, Maryland, has led to
increased ferry traffic in the Potomac River (Potomac River Boat Company 2013). Although the ferries
operate mostly in the commercial channel, it creates wakes that can cause short-term elevations in water
velocity that can cause erosion of the edges of Dyke Marsh; however, as stated above, these impacts are
focused more on the open marsh rather than the floodplain forest.
The no-action alternative would also continue to contribute adverse effects on both bird species of
concern in the marsh to the adverse effects from other projects. The contribution from these impacts
would be noticeable because habitat for these birds would be decreased over time.

Chapter 4: Environmental Consequences

Conclusion
Under the no-action alternative, the floodplain swamp behind Haul Road would continue to be
hydrologically restricted and habitat for Davis’ sedge and rough avens would continue to be lost.
The continuing loss of marsh soils and the lack of new soils being formed from sediment deposition
would lead to loss of habitat for existing communities of river bulrush and giant bur-reed. Because these
plants both function to bind marsh soil, loss of colonies of river bulrush and giant bur-reed would make
adjacent parts of the marsh more vulnerable to erosion. Continued loss of marsh would also result in loss
of potential nesting and forage habitat for the least bittern and swamp sparrow, and would result in longterm adverse impacts for both species of birds.
Because it is expected that the marsh would completely erode over time and it provides important habitat
for these state-listed species of concern, the adverse impacts on the river bulrush, giant bur-reed, and both
bird species would be significant.
The no-action alternative would continue to contribute adverse effects on the three plant species of
concern and both bird species of concern in the marsh to the adverse impacts from other projects. The
contribution from the impacts of the no-action alternative would be appreciable because of the large
acreage of marsh that would eventually be lost, and because habitat would be reduced.

IMPACTS COMMON TO BOTH ACTION ALTERNATIVES
Impacts from the Restored and Expanded Marsh
Under both action alternatives the construction of a breakwater in the vicinity of the historic promontory
and the filling of the deep channels that resulted from prior dredging would decrease water velocities and
encourage sediment deposition, both of which would help protect Hog Island Gut and the existing marsh
from further erosion (see “Impacts of the Alternatives on Hydrology and Sediment Transport”). This,
along with the construction of new marsh habitat using containment cells, would help preserve existing
habitat, as well as add new marsh habitat. As part of the restoration process, in addition to natural seed
recruitment, the new containment cells could be planted with cattails, river bulrush, and wild rice, along
with other plant species, or other revegetation methods would be used. Cattail and bulrush are two species
preferred by the least bittern for nesting (COSEWIC 2009), and cattails mixed with other vegetation, such
as sedge, is some of the preferred nesting habitat for swamp sparrows (U.S. Forest Service n.d.).
However, as discussed in detail in the section “Impacts of the Alternatives on Fish and Wildlife,” grazing
by resident Canada geese can greatly damage restored marsh vegetation. To prevent damage to new
vegetation by geese, and protect habitat for plant and animal species of special concern, goose exclosures
would be erected in the containment cells. The exclosures have proven successful at Kingman Marsh
(Hammerschlag et al. 2006) and their use at Dyke Marsh would allow the restored marsh to grow without
the pressure of goose herbivory while providing habitat for birds and other wildlife, including the least
bittern and the swamp sparrow.
In addition to nesting habitat, restoring Dyke Marsh would also provide long-term beneficial impacts on
the least bittern and swamp sparrow through increased foraging opportunities. Restoration of the marsh
would provide habitat for and increase the population of small fish such as killifish, as well as frogs, and
invertebrates which are all prey for the least bittern (Yolo Natural Heritage Program 2009). Insect
populations would also increase, as would the availability of plant seeds, which are the main staples in the
swamp sparrow’s diet (U.S. Forest Service n.d.). The magnitude of the impacts, however, would vary by
action alternative based on the amount of marsh habitat restored.

164

George Washington Memorial Parkway

Impacts of the Alternatives on Species of Special Concern

Changes in Wetlands along Haul Road
Under both action alternatives, the creation of breaks along Haul Road would allow tidal flows to pass
under the road and into the former bottomland swamp forest, which would allow for the restoration of the
bottomland swamp forest. The restored hydrology and sediment transfer would result in beneficial
impacts on hydrology and sediment transfer in the area behind Haul Road because the breaks would allow
past hydrologic conditions to be reestablished, and that would allow desirable ecologic conditions to be
reestablished. The reconnections would discourage continued establishment of nonnative and invasive
plants in the areas with restored hydrologic connection because of repeated inundation in which nonnative
plants do not grow well, and the creation of conditions that would encourage reestablishment of native
plants that prefer this type of habitat, including rough avens.
Because the bottomland floodplain swamp forest on the inland side of Haul Road does not provide habitat
for the least bittern or the swamp sparrow, reestablishing the hydrological connection to the inland side of
the road would not impact either the least bittern or the swamp sparrow.

Impacts from Construction Activities
Under both action alternatives, the marsh would be reestablished using mostly large and some smaller,
strategically-placed containment cells. The cells would be designed to hold fill material until enough fill
can be placed to the right elevation to support appropriate vegetation, and then settle enough that plants
can colonize or the area can be planted. The containment cells would purposely prevent flow into the
interior of the containment cells until the fill process is complete, and they are ready to be planted.
Intertidal exchange in the wetlands outside the containment cells would continue, although water would
flow around the cells, and up Hog Island Gut. Thus, there would be short-term adverse impacts on plant
species of concern behind the cells because sediment transfer patterns would change. Normal flow of tidal
water to the landward most area of the marsh would be restricted while the containment cells stabilize and
planted with vegetation. However, the containment cells would not block the entrance to Hog Island Gut;
therefore, water would still flow to the inside of the marsh, but the inside of the marsh may not experience
as long an inundation period as before construction.
Construction of the breaks under Haul Road would be contained, to the extent practicable, to the footprint
of Haul Road only. It would not be necessary to take construction equipment and machinery into the
marsh or the forested area behind Haul Road; additionally, detailed surveys for species of concern would
be performed prior to construction so that they may be avoided. Therefore, it is unlikely that there would
be impacts on plant species of concern from these activities. However, it is expected that the construction
activities along Haul Road would have short-term adverse impacts on the least bittern and the swamp
sparrow due to noise and increased human activity.
There would be no construction-related impacts on plant species of special concern associated with the
construction of the breakwater using armorstone because these activities would take place off land from
barges.
Construction activities under both action alternatives would take place from the water, to the greatest
extent possible, using marine construction equipment with materials brought in by barge. This includes
activities for constructing the breakwater in the vicinity of the historic promontory as well as the various
containment cells for creating new vegetated marsh. Temporary displacement of both bird species near
the construction area would be likely. With construction activities being conducted from the water and
only in those areas near the edge of marsh, individuals located in the interior or landward edge of the
marsh may not be impacted. Once construction is completed, both bird species would be expected to
readily recolonize the marsh. To prevent disturbance of the birds during their breeding seasons;

165

Chapter 4: Environmental Consequences

restrictions on construction activities would be put into place after consultation with VDGIF. Breeding
season for the least bittern is approximately April through mid- to late-June (Yolo Natural Heritage
Program 2009) and is mid-May through late-July for the swamp sparrow (U.S. Forest Service n.d.). The
NPS would coordinate with the VDGIF during the permitting process for the project.
Potential impacts to the bald eagle from construction activities would be negligible. The nest is more than
330 feet away from any of the construction activities planned for in that area, the distance provided in
state and federal guidelines for protection of bald eagles, and as specifically recommended by VDGIF and
the Center for Conservation Biology guidance in “Management of Bald Eagle Nests, Concentration
Areas, and Communal Roosts in Virginia: A Guide for Landowners” (2012). In addition, during the
permitting process, the joint application will be subject to review by both Virginia agencies and the
USFWS, at which time any remaining concerns regarding potential impacts to nesting eagles can be
incorporated into the permit conditions.

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE B
Davis’ Sedge
As stated above, both alternatives involve breaks in Haul Road, which would allow for tidal flows to pass
under Haul Road to the former bottomland floodplain swamp forest. This activity would allow for
ecological conditions more favorable for the development of suitable habitat for Davis’ sedge; the
restored hydrology would transport seeds of native species behind Haul Road, making them better able to
compete with the current assemblage of invasive nonnative plant species. Under these conditions, there
would be an increase in the preferred habitat of Davis’ sedge. Under all of the action alternatives, the NPS
would continue to eradicate nonnative invasive species, as mentioned under the no-action alternative
subsection of this section.
As stated above, there is slight risk of impacts from the construction of the breaks in Haul Road to species
of concern. If construction activity is allowed to occur off of Haul Road, existing populations of Davis’
sedge could potentially be impacted if they are not properly identified prior to construction. It is assumed
that the NPS would identify the populations of Davis’ sedge prior to construction, place protective
barriers around these populations, and alert construction crews to their whereabouts so that none of the
existing populations of Davis’ sedge would be impacted from construction activity. It is also assumed that
construction of the breaks in Haul Road would take place exclusively from Haul Road and that BMPs,
such as silt fencing, would be used if it is necessary to conduct construction activities in the forested area
behind Haul Road. BMPs include protecting existing populations of Davis’ sedge, as mentioned above,
and preventing construction debris from entering into the floodplain forest by establishing silt fences and
other erosion and sediment control measures.

Rough Avens
The population of rough avens identified in Dyke Marsh occurs along Haul Road (NPS 2009f). Impacts
on rough avens under alternative B, therefore, would be similar to those for Davis’ sedge.

River Bulrush and Giant Bur-Reed
Under alternative B, approximately 70 acres of restored marsh and other wetlands would be created,
including marsh north of the historic promontory. A breakwater structure would be constructed on the
south end of the existing marsh, in alignment with the northernmost extent of the historic promontory,
and wetlands would be restored to wherever the water is less than 4-feet deep. Marsh cells would be
placed along the edge of the existing marsh; these cells would be planted with native wetland species that

166

George Washington Memorial Parkway

Impacts of the Alternatives on Species of Special Concern

already exist in marshes of Dyke Marsh (USACE 2012a). Construction of the breakwater would attenuate
the velocity of flowing tidal water, which would shield the marsh from erosive currents and protect the
Hog Island Gut channel and channel wall. Decreasing the rate of erosion and attenuating the flow of tidal
water would prevent stabilized soil from eroding and allow suspended sediment to accrete on the
constructed marsh cells.
The construction of the breakwater along with the construction of the marsh cells would protect the
existing habitat of the river bulrush and giant bur-reed, as well as provide new habitat for these species of
concern. Because the roots of river bulrush and giant bur-reed provide a mechanism to stabilize marsh
soils (Runkel and Roosa 1999), their success would increase the probability that more habitat would form
under alternative B.
Construction-related impacts from the partial blockage of flows into the existing marsh by the
containment cells would be as described in the section “Impacts Common to Both Action Alternatives,”
but would be relatively small, given the more limited scope of marsh restoration under this alternative.

Least Bittern and Swamp Sparrow
While the nature of the impacts described in the section “Impacts Common to Both Action Alternatives”
do not vary among the action alternatives, the magnitude of the impacts differ depending on the
alternative due to the amount of marsh to be restored.
Under alternative B, approximately 70 acres of new marsh and wetland habitat would be restored,
providing long-term beneficial impacts through the creation of new nesting and foraging habitat for both
the least bittern and the swamp sparrow. However, the actual amount of vegetated emergent marsh habitat
created would be slightly less than 70 acres due to the sloped design within the outermost containment
cells to provide for a soft natural edge to the marsh.

Impacts from Construction Activities
The nature of construction-related impacts under alternative B would be the same as described in the
section “Impacts Common to Both Action Alternatives” above. The magnitude of the impacts under
alternative B would be the least among the action alternatives due to the more limited scope of the marsh
restoration under this alternative.

Cumulative Impacts
The impacts on species of concern in Dyke Marsh from past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future
projects on plant species and bird species of concern would be the same as those discussed under the noaction alternative. Alternative B would contribute long-term beneficial impacts on habitat for the plant
and bird species of concern in Dyke Marsh to the mostly localized but adverse impacts of other projects.
This contribution would be noticeable, because most of the cumulative impacts from other actions are
localized and have a limited effect on the vegetation in the immediate area of the marsh, and
implementation of alternative B would increase the marsh area overall and protect and stabilize the
current marsh area. The alternative would also contribute some short-term adverse impacts to the overall
scenario. Contribution of these short-term adverse construction-related impacts, with mitigation, would be
imperceptible.

Final Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and Long-term Management Plan / EIS

167

Chapter 4: Environmental Consequences

Conclusion
Restoration of marsh would provide additional nesting and foraging habitat for both the swamp sparrow
and the least bittern, and increase acreage in which river bulrush and giant bur-reed could become
established, resulting in long-term beneficial impacts. Approximately 70 acres of wetland and marsh
habitat would be restored.
Reconnection of tidal flows west of Haul Road would discourage continued establishment of nonnative
and invasive plants in the areas with restored hydrologic connection, and would create conditions that
would encourage reestablishment of rough avens and Davis’ sedge. The NPS would identify the
populations of Davis’ sedge and rough avens prior to construction, and protect the plants during
construction activity.
Temporary displacement of both bird species near the construction area would be likely during
construction. Both bird species would be expected to readily recolonize the marsh after construction was
complete. To prevent disturbance of the birds during their breeding seasons, restrictions on construction
would be put into place in consultation with the state.
The long-term benefits would be noticeable, but not large enough in magnitude to be significant. Because
BMPs would be incorporated and there would be limitations on construction during breeding periods,
impacts related to construction would be short-term adverse, but not significant.
Alternative B would contribute long-term beneficial impacts on habitat for the plant and bird species of
concern in Dyke Marsh to the mostly localized adverse impacts of other projects. This contribution would
be noticeable. The alternative would also contribute some short-term adverse impacts to the overall
scenario. With mitigation, the contribution of these short-term adverse construction-related impacts would
be imperceptible.

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE C
Davis’ Sedge
Impacts on Davis’ sedge under alternative C would be the same as those under alternative B.

Rough Avens
Impacts on rough avens under alternative C would be the same as those under alternative B.

River Bulrush and Giant Bur-Reed
Under alternative C, there would be a greater extent of marsh restoration than under alternative B,
resulting in up to 180 acres of restored wetland and marsh, including high marsh, emergent marsh, tidal
guts, and areas of SAV, as well as new tidal guts to allow crucial intertidal flows into the heart of the
marsh (USACE 2012a).
Under alternative C, the promontory mass would be reestablished as flows from the Hog Island Gut
channel would be directed in a northerly direction around the wetlands. Similar to alternative B, the
increased acreage of wetland cells would provide habitat for river bulrush and giant bur-reed. Although
alternative C would restore nearly 110 more acres of wetlands and marsh, not all of that area would
provide habitat for river bulrush or giant bur-reed as some of the area would be used for the restoration of
SAV. River bulrush and giant bur-reed are capable of inhabiting areas that experience daily inundation;

168

George Washington Memorial Parkway

Impacts of the Alternatives on Species of Special Concern

however, they cannot survive when permanently covered in water (Runkel and Roosa 1999; Gleason and
Cronquist 1991). Thus, in permanently submerged areas on the edge of the resultant marsh, SAV species
would potentially populate.
Construction-related impacts from the partial blockage of flows into the existing marsh by the
containment structures would be as described in the section “Impacts Common to Both Action
Alternatives,” but would be relatively small, given the more limited scope of marsh restoration under this
alternative.

Least Bittern and Swamp Sparrow
The nature of the impacts under alternative C would be the same as described in the section “Impacts
Common to Both Action Alternatives,” though there would be a greater extent of marsh restoration than
under alternative B, resulting in up to 150 acres of restored marsh (excluding the wetlands west of Haul
Road) extending from the breakwater to Dyke Island and east to the park property line as well as marsh
restoration south of the breakwater. As discussed under alternative B, due to the creation of a soft edge to
the restored marsh, the actual amount of emergent vegetation in the restored marsh that could provide
suitable nesting habitat for the least bittern and swamp sparrow would actually be less than the 180 acres.
Overall, the creation of new nesting and foraging habitat would result in long-term beneficial impacts.

Impacts from Construction Activities
The nature of construction-related impacts under alternative C would be the same as described in the
section “Impacts Common to Both Action Alternatives” above. The magnitude of the impacts, however,
would be greater than alternative B due to the number, size, and location of the containment cells that
would be constructed.

Cumulative Impacts
The impacts on species of concern in Dyke Marsh from past, present and reasonably foreseeable future
projects on plant species of concern would be the same as those discussed under the no-action alternative.
Alternative C would contribute long-term beneficial impacts on habitat for the plant and bird species of
concern in Dyke Marsh to the mostly localized adverse impacts of other projects. The contribution would
be noticeable, and possibly appreciable, given the greater extent of marsh restored under alternative C
than alternative B. The contribution of short-term adverse construction impacts from this alternative
would be more noticeable than under alternative B, but would still be imperceptible.

Conclusion
The impacts on Davis’ sedge and rough avens would be the same as under alternative B. The larger
acreage restored under alternative C would provide similar benefits for the marsh plants river bulrush and
giant bur-reed, and for both bird species, by increasing acreage in which the plants could occur, and by
increasing nesting and foraging habitat. The magnitude of the benefits could result in these impacts being
significant.
Construction impacts would be similar to those described under alternative B, although they would be
more extensive, and would be temporary. Restrictions on construction periods would be put in place in
consultation with VDGIF to avoid interference with breeding seasons. With these and other BMPs in
place, construction impacts would not be significant.

Chapter 4: Environmental Consequences

Alternative C would contribute long-term beneficial impacts on habitat for the plant and bird species of
concern in Dyke Marsh to the mostly localized adverse impacts of other projects. The contribution would
be noticeable, and possibly appreciable, given the greater extent of marsh restored under alternative C
than alternative B. The contribution of short-term adverse construction impacts from this alternative
would be more noticeable than under alternative B, but would still be imperceptible.

IMPACTS OF THE ALTERNATIVES ON ARCHEOLOGICAL
RESOURCES
GUIDING REGULATIONS
Impacts on archeological resources are regulated by the NEPA and Section 106 of the National Historical
Preservation Act, as well as the Archeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 and the Antiquities Act
of 1906.

METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS
The George Washington Memorial Parkway, which encompasses the Mount
Fastland is land
Vernon Memorial Highway, was conceived from its origin as having historical and
natural components, connecting key historic sites along a route regularly traveled
near water that is
by George Washington, as well as creating a public park along the scenic Potomac
high and dry.
River. Dyke Marsh is both a scenic natural resource and a surviving part of the
historic landscape of Washington’s era. The study area for the Archeological
Resource Impact study is identical with the project area narrowly defined, that is, the marsh itself and the
immediately surrounding areas that might be impacted by restoration efforts. Information on the
archeological resources of the marsh comes from the Phase IA archeological study (Shellenhamer 2008).
The most important archeological resource in the project area is the surviving remnant of the dyke that
gave the marsh its name. The Phase IA study raised the possibility that undiscovered archeological sites
from the Archaic or Paleoindian periods might be present in the undisturbed portions of the marsh,
although no such drowned sites have been documented anywhere along the Potomac River. Prehistoric or
historic period sites might also be present in the fastland portion of the project area behind Haul Road,
and in other upland areas.
Analysis of possible impacts on archeological resources has been guided by the assumption that
surviving, intact areas of marsh would be protected during construction.

IMPACTS OF THE NO-ACTION ALTERNATIVE (ALTERNATIVE A)
Under the no-action alternative, the marsh would continue to erode. This ongoing erosion would wash
away or potentially damage the archeological resources of the George Washington Memorial Parkway.
The short surviving section of the dyke that gave the marsh its name would be particularly threatened, and
might be completely lost in a few decades. If any undiscovered archeological sites are present in the
marsh, erosion would threaten them as well.

Cumulative Impacts of the No-action Alternative (Alternative A)
The impacts on archeological resources of past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects, including
the ongoing and future Potomac Yards metro station, George Washington Memorial Parkway North
Parkway Rehabilitation, the land exchange at Langley Fork Park, and the Arlington boathouse, as well as
the completed Woodrow Wilson Bridge replacement and associated work in Jones Point Park, have been,

or are expected to be addressed through the Section 106 consultation process. Archeological survey has
been or will be carried out as part of all of these projects, and measures to protect resources or mitigate
disturbance have been or will be implemented. The no-action alternative would allow the marsh to
continue to erode, threatening the surviving remnant of the dyke and any other archeological resources
that might be present along the river’s shoreline, and would contribute potential adverse effects to the
effects of the other projects. This contribution would likely range from noticeable to appreciable.

Conclusion
Ongoing erosion would wash away or potentially damage known and unknown archeological resources of
the George Washington Memorial Parkway. The short surviving section of the dyke that gave the marsh
its name would be particularly threatened, as would other archeological resources that might be present in
the marsh, but have not been discovered. Impacts from the no-action alternative (alternative A) would be
unlikely to be significant, because it is anticipated that the park would review the condition of known
archeological sites and implement a program to minimize the loss of integrity of sites threatened by
erosion or other factors.
The no-action alternative would allow the marsh to continue to erode, threatening the surviving remnant
of the dyke and any other archeological resources that might be present along the river’s shoreline, and
would contribute potential adverse effects to the effects of the other projects. This contribution would
likely range from imperceptible to noticeable, depending on whether the dyke remnants are harmed.

IMPACTS COMMON TO BOTH ACTION ALTERNATIVES
Long-Term Impacts
The impact on archeological resources for both of the action alternatives would be the same, because the
nature of the work is the same for both alternatives. The scale of the restoration under the two alternatives
would not affect the impacts on archeology. The most important impact would be the positive one of
stabilizing the marsh and reducing erosion, and therefore preventing unintentional exposure of unknown
archeological resources in the marsh. Reducing erosion would protect any Paleoindian, Archaic, or
historic sites that may be present in or adjacent to the marsh.
There are not expected to be impacts to archeological resources related to the reintroduction of tidal flows
to the area west of Haul Road. Tidal flows west of Haul Road would be low energy, and would not result
in much, if any, erosion in areas that might contain archeological resources. Some erosion is possible at
the breaks in Haul Road, but because the road itself is fill material, and engineering studies would
minimize erosion through proper design, impacts on undiscovered archeological resources would not be
likely to occur. Construction-related impacts associated with placing breaks in Haul Road are discussed in
the following section, “Construction-related Impacts.”

Construction-related Impacts
The new marsh areas would be constructed from barges to limit the impact on surviving areas of the
marsh. This approach would also limit damage to any archeological sites within the marsh. Archeological
sites within the existing marsh have likely been destroyed in areas that were previously dredged, while
any existing sites located underneath Haul Road would remain preserved, having been sealed underneath
the several feet of fill that was used to create the road (Shellenhamer 2008). The action alternatives all
call for approximately three cuts along Haul Road in order to reestablish hydraulic connections to the
landward side of the road. As such, archeological testing will be required within those proposed locations
to assess for the presence of intact cultural resources.

Final Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and Long-term Management Plan / EIS

171

Chapter 4: Environmental Consequences

Since it is believed that past dredging activity would have destroyed archeological remains other than the
dike remnants within the proposed construction areas, and construction methods would be used to protect
the dike remnants, no archeological resources would be disturbed, and there would be no constructionrelated impacts on archeological resources.
Although there are no known archeological resources other than the dike remnants in and adjacent to the
marsh, it is possible that archeological resources could be discovered during construction. If archeological
resources are discovered during construction, all work in the immediate vicinity of the discovery would
be halted until the resources can be identified and documented and an appropriate mitigation strategy can
be developed. Consultation with the Virginia State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO), the NPS, and/or
the NPS regional archeologist will be coordinated to ensure that the protection of resources is addressed.
In the unlikely event that human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural
patrimony are discovered during construction, provisions outlined in the Native American Graves
Protection and Repatriation Act (25 USC 3001) of 1990 would be followed. In addition, fill material
would come from approved sources, most likely river bottoms, and would not come from any areas with
archeological potential. Protection of the dike remnants are discussed under the impacts to historic
structures, districts, and cultural landscapes.

Cumulative Impacts Common to Both Action Alternatives
The cumulative scenario discussed under alternative A would apply for both action alternatives, and
impacts have been or will be identified, avoided, or mitigated under the Section 106 review process. The
restoration of the marsh and reduction of erosion under both action alternatives would contribute
beneficial impacts on archeological resources in the park to impacts from other projects by protecting the
archeological resources in Dyke Marsh. The contribution would be appreciable.

Conclusion
Restoration activities under both alternatives would stabilize the marsh and substantially reduce erosion,
which would therefore protect archeological resources in and adjacent to the marsh. The impacts would
be the same for both alternatives. Introduction of low energy tidal flows west of Haul Road would not
affect any archeological resources, although the locations for the cuts to Haul Road to reintroduce tidal
flows would be evaluated for the presence of archeological resources prior to construction. Construction
activities in the marsh itself would take place from the water and would not affect archeological
resources, reducing the likelihood of erosion and unanticipated exposure and harm to archeological
resources would be beneficial but not significant; erosion could still occur, and archeological resources
could still be harmed or washed away in large storm events.
The restoration of the marsh and reduction of erosion under both action alternatives would contribute
beneficial impacts on archeological resources in the park to impacts from other projects by protecting the
archeological resources in Dyke Marsh. The contribution would be appreciable.

Preservation Act.

172

George Washington Memorial Parkway

Impacts of the Alternatives on Historic Structures and Districts, and Cultural Landscapes

METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS
Dyke Marsh is part of the Mount Vernon Memorial Highway, which is part of the larger George
Washington Memorial Parkway. Both roads are listed in the NRHP as historic districts (NPS 1981; NPS
1995). The historic district is nationally significant under Criteria B and C. Under Criterion C, the district
is significant for its landscape architecture as part of the long and continuous planning of the Washington,
D.C., region. The George Washington Memorial Parkway was conceived from its origin as having
historical and natural components, connecting key historic sites along a route regularly traveled by
George Washington and creating a public park along the scenic Potomac River. Dyke Marsh fits into both
categories, as both a scenic natural resource and a surviving part of the historic landscape of
Washington’s era. The study area for the Historic Structures and Districts Impact study includes the
project area narrowly defined, that is, the marsh itself and the immediately surrounding areas that might
be impacted by restoration efforts, as well as the adjacent sections of the Parkway from which the marsh
might be visible.
Dyke Marsh has not yet been formally identified as a cultural landscape, although it may qualify as a
component landscape of the Mount Vernon Memorial Highway and George Washington Memorial
Parkway historic districts. As defined by the NPS, a component landscape is “a definable physical area of
a landscape that contributes to the significance of a National Register property, or, in some cases, is
individually eligible for listing in the National Register” (NPS 1998b). A future cultural landscape
inventory would be needed to formally identify the character-defining features of the Dyke Marsh
landscape as they relate to the Mount Vernon Memorial Highway cultural landscape or as they contribute
to a separate independent cultural landscape. Regardless, the scenic qualities of the marsh area and the
views to it from the parkway are noted in the NRHP nomination and cultural landscape report (NPS 1981;
NPS 1995; NPS n.d.c) and thus are important features of the parkway cultural landscape. None of the
alternatives would disturb, and therefore would not have any impact on the plantings or other landscape
elements along the Parkway.

IMPACTS OF THE NO-ACTION ALTERNATIVE (ALTERNATIVE A)
Under the no-action alternative, the marsh would continue to erode. Since the marsh is a feature of the
historic landscape and a contributing element of the cultural landscape, present in George Washington’s
time and when the George Washington Memorial Parkway was created, its loss would be a measurable
adverse impact on the George Washington Memorial Parkway historic district. Continued erosion of
Dyke Marsh would therefore degrade the cultural landscape of the George Washington Memorial
Parkway, and result in a long-term adverse impact on the historic districts and their component
landscapes; an important scenic component of the landscape would disappear.

Cumulative Impacts of the No-action Alternative (Alternative A)
Other recent major projects undertaken along the Potomac in the vicinity of the George Washington
Memorial Parkway, especially the construction of National Harbor, including new and proposed large
buildings and several large video screens, a new marina and pier, and a new Ferris wheel on the pier, and
the new Wilson Bridge have had or may have a noticeable impact on the George Washington Memorial
Parkway by changing or impeding river views from the parkway and the shore adjacent to the marsh.
Other projects, such as the land exchange at Langley Fork Park, the Potomac Yards Metro Station,
George Washington Memorial Parkway North Rehabilitation project, Memorial Circle safety
improvements and the proposed boathouse on parkway land in Arlington have the potential to affect the
George Washington Memorial Parkway historic district overall. The effects of many of these projects on
the historic district are not yet determined, but consultation with the SHPO is underway or will be
conducted to identify these impacts and identify mitigation measures or ways to minimize and avoid

Final Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and Long-term Management Plan / EIS

173

Chapter 4: Environmental Consequences

impacts. Under the no-action alternative, Dyke Marsh would experience continued loss to erosion, and
would contribute an adverse effect to the impacts of the other projects in the park. The contribution would
therefore be appreciable, because the no-action alternative would result in the loss of a prominent
landscape feature.

Conclusion
Erosion of the marsh under alternative A would result in long-term adverse effects under NEPA on
historic districts and associated component landscapes, because a landscape feature important to the
George Washington Memorial Parkway and Mount Vernon Memorial Highway would disappear. These
impacts would be noticeable, and could rise to a level of significance because of the marsh’s importance
as a scenic feature in the historic district.
The no-action alternative would contribute an adverse effect to the impacts of the other projects in the
park. The contribution would therefore be appreciable, because the no-action alternative would result in
the loss of a prominent landscape feature.

IMPACTS COMMON TO BOTH ACTION ALTERNATIVES
Long-term Impacts
The main impact of all the action alternatives on the historic district and cultural landscape would be the
positive effect of reducing or reversing the erosion of the marsh, as well as establishing additional marsh,
moving the close in views from the parkway toward how they would have looked when the parkway was
first constructed.
All of the action alternatives would also ultimately protect the surviving remnant of the original dyke
through the reversal of erosion and restoration of marsh around the dyke remnant. In addition, all of the
action alternatives would involve modifying Haul Road to allow water to pass through via culverts or
boardwalk bridges similar to those found further down Haul Road and along the length of the trail along
the parkway. Culvert structures, which are typically concrete boxes or pipes, could be a noticeable
modern feature, depending on how they are installed and how large they are. Boardwalk bridges would be
consistent with existing features on Haul Road and elsewhere in the park, and could represent a less
noticeable visual intrusion than the culverts. However, Haul Road is not considered a significant
landscape feature, and is not visible from the parkway, although they might be visible from the end of
Haul Road in the marsh, so these impacts on both the historic district and the cultural landscape would be
minimal.
The one new landscape feature proposed under all of the alternatives would be the armorstone breakwater
constructed at the historic promontory, extending into the river near the southern edge of the marsh. This
feature would represent an intrusion and change to the local landscape. The breakwater could be visible
from close distances, and would be visible from the parkway and Mount Vernon Trail under alternative B.
However, it would be low-profile, just tall enough to shield the marsh from waves during a storm and
would not block views of the marsh from the park. Views of the breakwater would be shielded or
completely obscured by restored marsh under alternative C, and would be further away from the point at
which it would be visible from the parkway. It would not be visible from the south along the parkway.

Construction-related Impacts
Construction activities would result in short-term adverse impacts on the cultural landscape of the park.
The containment cell structures, particularly those made of steel sheet piling, would be very visible in the

174

George Washington Memorial Parkway

Impacts of the Alternatives on Historic Structures and Districts, and Cultural Landscapes

near distance, and would disrupt the views beyond the natural marsh landscape. Construction barges
would also be relatively noticeable in the middle distance, and would stay in place for days to months.
The extent to which these construction features are noticeable would vary with each alternative and the
level of restoration effort. Because there are other disturbances to views in the further distance (described
under cumulative impacts), and there has long been substantial barge traffic on the river, the intensity of
these short-term impacts would be mitigated to some extent.
Both action alternatives propose restoration in the immediate vicinity of the surviving dyke remnants. In
the long term this would further protect the resource, but measures would have to be taken during
construction to ensure that no damage is done to these dyke remnants. The greatest danger is that the dyke
would be accidentally damaged by digging too close to its base, or by collisions with boats or barges. To
prevent such damage, an exclusion zone would be established around the dyke, extending perhaps 10 feet
from the feature, delineated by a high-visibility barrier such as snow fence with warning signs. Coupled
with a verbal briefing of construction personnel, this would greatly reduce the likelihood of accidental
impacts.

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE B
Long-term Impacts
Alternative B would restore the fewest acres of marsh vegetation of all the action alternatives. However,
this plan is intended to halt ongoing erosion of the marsh, and as such it would stabilize the historic
landscape and protect the dyke remnants, resulting in long-term beneficial impacts. The stone breakwater
would be visible from the opening in the parkway and Mount Vernon Trail near the turnaround/pulloff at
the southern end of the marsh. Approximately 2 feet of breakwater would be visible immediately south of
the opening in the view from the parkway, depending on the stage of the tide. There would be no
vegetation in place to screen the view of the breakwater, so it would be an adverse effect on the historic
viewshed.
Construction-related impacts would be the same as those described in the impacts common to all
alternatives sections, although they would be smaller in scale than impacts under alternative C.

Cumulative Impacts of Alternative B
The same projects discussed in the cumulative impact analysis for alternative A have impacted or would
impact historic district and cultural landscape of the George Washington Memorial Parkway under both
action alternatives, by changing or impeding river views. Alternative B would contribute beneficial
impacts to the impacts from the other projects by halting the erosion of Dyke Marsh and therefore
limiting the deterioration of the landscape, but it would also contribute adverse effects to the viewshed,
and would not mitigate the cumulative harm from the other projects that affect the viewshed. The
contribution of beneficial impacts would be noticeable, and the contribution of adverse effects to the
viewshed would range from noticeable to appreciable depending on the viewpoint and duration of the
view (duration depends on whether the viewer is in the park or driving by the park).

Conclusion
Marsh restoration under alternative B would stabilize and restore the marsh, resulting in beneficial
impacts on the historic landscape. The existing remnants of the dike would be protected by reduced
erosion, and by measures put in place during construction. The breakwater would be constructed of large
stones, and would therefore look somewhat natural, but it would be visible from the parkway, and would
not be screened, resulting in adverse impacts on the historic landscape. Changes introduced to the

landscape by the breakwater would be very noticeable and possibly significant, depending on the
viewpoint and duration of the view.
Alternative B would contribute beneficial impacts to the adverse impacts on cultural landscapes and
historic districts from the other projects by halting the erosion of Dyke Marsh and therefore limiting the
deterioration of the landscape, but it would also contribute adverse effects to the viewshed. The
contribution of the beneficial impacts would be noticeable, and the contribution of adverse effects to the
viewshed would range from noticeable to appreciable depending on the viewpoint and duration of the
view (duration depends on whether the viewer is in the park or driving by the park).

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE C
Long-term Impacts
Alternative C envisages substantial restoration of the marsh vegetation, which would have a positive
impact on the George Washington Memorial Parkway Historic District and its associated landscape.
There would be an adverse long-term impact from the construction of the breakwater. However, the
breakwater under alternative C would not be particularly noticeable because it would be a little over
500 feet south of the opening of the view near the parkway turnaround/pullout at the southern end of the
marsh, and would also mostly be screened or obscured by marsh plantings once restoration is complete.
The restoration of the marsh to much of its historic extent would be beneficial for the historic district,
since visitors would see something much more like the historic state of the marsh at the time the parkway
was created and earlier.

Construction-related Impacts
Construction-related impacts would be the same as discussed under impacts common to all, but would be
greater in magnitude than under alternative B, because of the larger area of restoration. Dyke remnants
would be protected.

Cumulative Impacts of Alternative C
Other recent major projects undertaken in the vicinity of the George Washington Memorial Parkway and
their impacts are the same as discussed under alternative A. Restoration of Dyke Marsh under alternative
C would contribute beneficial impacts on the cultural landscape and historic district to the adverse
impacts of the other projects. The contribution would be appreciable, because erosion of the marsh would
be prevented and the breakwater would not be highly intrusive.

Conclusion
Marsh restoration under alternative C would stabilize and restore a large area of marsh, resulting in
beneficial impacts on the historic landscape. The existing remnants of the dike would be protected by
reduced erosion, and by measures put in place during construction. The breakwater would be constructed
of large stones, would be further south than the breakwater under alternative B, and would be developed
into a wider promontory covered with marsh plantings, so it would not be particularly noticeable from the
parkway. It would represent a minimal intrusion into the historic landscape, and the impacts would not be
significant.
Restoration of Dyke Marsh under alternative C would contribute beneficial impacts on the cultural
landscape and historic district to the adverse impacts of the other projects. The contribution would be

appreciable, because erosion of the marsh would be prevented and the breakwater would not be highly
intrusive.

IMPACTS OF THE ALTERNATIVES ON VISITOR USE AND
EXPERIENCE
GUIDING REGULATIONS AND POLICIES
Enjoyment of park resources and values by the people of the United States is fundamental to the purpose
of all national parks. The NPS is committed to providing appropriate, high-quality opportunities for the
public to enjoy the parks. Because not all recreational activities are appropriate for each park, the NPS
will encourage activities that are appropriate to the purposes for which the park was established, are
appropriate to the unique park environment, will promote enjoyment through direct association with park
resources, and can be sustained without causing unacceptable impacts on park resources or values (NPS
2006, Section 8.2).
Overall, the management of visitor use and experience, like all management decisions affecting the
resources of a national park, is subject to the Organic Act. It is this foundational law that requires NPS to
“provide for the enjoyment” of the national parks while also leaving them “unimpaired for future
generations.” Where there is conflict between the public enjoyment of a park area and the conservation of
a park value or resource, then “conservation is to be predominant” (NPS 2006, Section 1.4.3).
Appropriate uses within Dyke Marsh include boating activities at the Belle Haven Marina as well as
passive recreation activities such as walking, running, biking, bird-watching, and nature study, as
described in chapter 3.

METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS
The Dyke Marsh restoration alternatives could impact the visitor experience by reducing or limiting the
principle visitor uses during construction. When available, quantitative information was used to assess the
overall change to any existing visitor use patterns or satisfaction levels. This assessment considers the
availability of existing recreational opportunities, as well as the accessible areas, to assess the level of
impacts for each action. Data used in this analysis, including visitor statistics, historic use patterns, and
visitor use observations obtained from park rangers, is presented in chapter 3.

IMPACTS OF THE NO-ACTION ALTERNATIVE (ALTERNATIVE A)
Under the no-action alternative, no restoration would occur. Existing visitor use in the area would
continue, mainly located along the Mount Vernon trail and within the Belle Haven Marina. Within the
marsh, existing volunteer program activities associated with shoreline cleanup and the River Steward
program would continue. Fishing, nature-viewing, kayaking, and canoeing could continue within the
vicinity of the marsh, although the increasing open water areas would be more exposed to wind and
currents over time, changing the nature of the experience from the water, and possibly decreasing the
enjoyment for many users.
No manipulation of the marsh would occur other than emergency, safety-related, or limited improvements
or maintenance actions and the marsh would continue to degrade. Without on-going maintenance, the
southern portion of Haul Road where it extends into the marsh could potentially become submerged as the
marsh erodes and disappears. This area is currently heavily used by birders. Should parts of Haul Road be
lost, these visitors would no longer be able to use those parts of the trail, and would experience long-term

Final Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and Long-term Management Plan / EIS

177

Chapter 4: Environmental Consequences

noticeable impacts on the quality of their visitor experience. Visitor use would be noticeably impacted as
visitor use in that area would be restricted, although changes to visitor use and experience would take
place gradually.

Cumulative Impacts
Two past actions contribute to cumulative visitor use and experience impacts. The Woodrow Wilson
Bridge was completed in 2006, replacing an existing bridge and slightly changing the viewshed from
Dyke Marsh. Given the amount of development within the area, this change was likely not noticeable to
visitors and did not change use patterns or existing experience. As a result of the bridge construction, 100
acres of wetlands were created or preserved within the metropolitan Washington region, providing
visitors with more protected wetlands to enjoy within the region. Past and planned construction at
National Harbor in Maryland, including new and proposed large buildings and several large video
screens, a new marina and pier, and a new Ferris wheel on the pier, may noticeably alter views from the
marsh and along the Mount Vernon Trail, but the changes have not been, and should not be, overly
intrusive to visitor experience in the future. Given the highly developed nature of this location, the two
past projects resulted in an imperceptible impact on visitor use and experience. Alternative A would
contribute long-term adverse impacts to the beneficial and adverse impacts of these cumulative projects.
Because the changes would occur over a long period of time, the contribution would be imperceptible.

Conclusion
Marsh erosion would adversely alter visitor use and experience over time. Nature viewing would be
altered and access to the marsh would decrease and disappear over time, including access to the end of the
Haul Road trail, although visitors could still recreate in the area by boat, and the changes would be
gradual. Opportunities for paddling and boating activities would still exist, but the area around the marsh
would become more exposed to wind and currents as the marsh erodes, and there would be more open
water. Because the changes would happen gradually, for most visitors, the changes would not be
noticeable. For other users, such as bird watchers, the changes could represent a measurable adverse
effect as opportunities decrease, and the number of species and number of individual birds decrease.
Overall, the impacts on visitor use and experience would not rise to a level of significance.
Alternative A would contribute long-term adverse impacts to the impacts of other past, present, and
reasonably foreseeable projects. Because the changes would occur over a long period of time, the
contribution would be imperceptible.

IMPACTS COMMON TO BOTH ACTION ALTERNATIVES
Both action alternatives include elements that create low energy areas in the marsh and reduce the
velocity of currents that are currently causing erosion, and the creation of breaks along Haul Road. The
installation of a breakwater structure and placement of fill in the deep channels at the southern end of the
existing marsh would dissipate wave and flow energy, and protect the mouth of Hog Island Gut. As a
result, Haul Road would be protected from erosion and require less NPS maintenance to maintain this
location for visitor use. Kayakers and canoeists would likely be better able to access Hog Island Gut,
providing an additional location for recreation.
The largest impact on visitor use and experience that is common to both action alternatives would occur
during construction. Construction could last several years, depending on availability of fill material.
While there would be limited construction equipment staging within the park, areas of visitor use may be
closed during construction periods, such as the Haul Road. Portions of Haul Road would be closed during
construction. Noise from construction equipment would likely temporarily displace wildlife and would

178

George Washington Memorial Parkway

Impacts of the Alternatives on Visitor Use and Experience

impact those visitors who use the vicinity for nature-viewing. Although construction may last for an
extended period of time, construction activities are likely to occur in discrete periods—during installation
of containment cells, while fill is being placed, when planting occurs, if it occurs, and when containment
cell materials are removed. In between these discrete periods, the containment cells would be visible, but
there would be little construction noise and most areas would be open to visitors.
Along Haul Road, birders may alter their visitor use patterns during construction due to the reduced
equality of their visitor experience. Bikers and hikers along the Mount Vernon Trail would likely continue
to use the trail, but may not stop for wildlife viewing within that portion of the trail during construction.
The Mount Vernon Trail would not be closed during construction, but may have occasional temporary
closures if necessary to accommodate construction.
During construction, public information signs and other tools would help explain the purpose for the
restoration and what can be expected during and after restoration. Such signs and other outreach would
increase public awareness and knowledge of the project and help alleviate adverse effects to visitor use
and experience caused by construction activities.
After construction is complete, visitors would experience beneficial impacts from the improved quality of
the water, Hog Island Gut, and Haul Road, resulting in a better environment for wildlife viewing.

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE B
Under alternative B, visitors would have the beneficial impact from the restoration of 70 acres of various
wetland habitats in addition to the reduced erosion along Haul Road, as described in the section
“Elements Common to Both Action Alternatives” in chapter 2. Restored marsh and wetlands would
provide a healthier environment for wildlife and could provide visitors with improved wildlife viewing
opportunities, although some people who fish could find the loss of some of the open water areas to be an
adverse impact. The restored ecosystem would also provide expanded interpretive and education
opportunities to visitors to learn about the wetland ecosystem. In place of the existing degrading marsh,
visitors would be able to experience a healthier wetland ecosystem.
During construction, visitor experience would be negatively impacted, as described in the section
“Elements Common to Both Action Alternatives” in chapter 2. Visitor access may be limited in particular
locations and there would be increased noise levels, which would detract from the overall visitor
experience. The trail along Haul Road would be closed during construction on the road.
The configuration of alternative B would not affect the use of the marina. Visitors would continue to be
able to rent kayaks, canoes, and sailboats, and use the boat ramp, although access to the marsh would be
restricted during construction.

Cumulative Impacts
Cumulative impacts under alternative B would be the same as described under the no-action alternative,
with past projects resulting in small-scale adverse impacts on visitor use and experience. Implementation
of alternative B would contribute mostly long-term beneficial and short-term adverse impacts to the
overall adverse impacts of the cumulative projects. The contribution beneficial impacts would be
noticeable. Contribution of adverse impacts would be imperceptible.

Final Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and Long-term Management Plan / EIS

179

Chapter 4: Environmental Consequences

Conclusion
There would be some long term beneficial impacts on visitor use and experience related to experiencing
improved wetland and marsh habitats and having more marsh to explore by paddle craft after restoration
is complete. The largest impacts would occur during construction and would be adverse. Construction
activity would be evident over an extended period of time, and parts of the park would be closed during
construction. However, these impacts would be temporary and would not be significant. Long-term
beneficial impacts on visitor use and experience would not attract enough additional visitation to make
the impacts significant.
Implementation of alternative B would contribute mostly long-term beneficial and short-term adverse
impacts to the overall adverse impacts of the cumulative projects. The contribution of beneficial impacts
would be noticeable. Contribution of adverse impacts would be imperceptible.

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE C
Impacts on visitor use and experience under alternative C would be the same as described under
alternative B. An additional 150 acres of wetland area (180 acres total) would be restored under
alternative C, providing a healthier ecosystem for visitors to enjoy under this alternative, resulting in a
long-term beneficial impact on visitor experience as described under alternative B.
There would be beneficial impacts on the experience of those visitors using the marina and its paddle
craft by creating more marsh to access and explore. Although there would be less open water, the areas
available to paddle would be more protected. Sailboats would continue to be able to access the docks and
mooring areas, and the boat ramp would not be affected.
Similar to alternative B, there would be short-term impacts on visitor use and experience during
construction, although construction could last for several years. It would be expected that these impacts
would be greater under alternative C due to the larger area of disturbance and longer construction period,
and could be very noticeable.

Cumulative Impacts
Cumulative impacts under alternative C would be the same as described under the no-action alternative,
with past projects resulting in adverse impacts on visitor use and experience. Alternative C would
contribute both short-term adverse and long-term beneficial impacts to the relatively small adverse
cumulative effects. The contribution of both the beneficial and adverse impacts would be noticeable,
because the impacts from C would be of a larger scale than the impacts from the cumulative projects.

Conclusion
Although there would be less open water to explore by boat, there would be long-term beneficial impacts
on visitor use and experience related to experiencing improved wetland and marsh habitats and having
more marsh to explore, including new tidal guts, by paddle craft after restoration is complete. Long-term
beneficial impacts on visitor use and experience would not attract enough additional visitation to make
the impacts significant.
As with alternative B, the largest impacts would occur during construction and would be adverse.
Construction activity for future phases would cover a larger area than alternative B, and would be evident
over a period of years. Impacts on the visitor use of the marina would be minimal. Parts of the park would
be closed during construction, although the areas would change as work is completed and new cells or

180

Impacts of the Alternatives on Adjacent Property Owners and the Marina

phases are started. Because construction-related impacts would occur over a period of years, and would
be noticeable, impacts could be significantly adverse, although they would end once construction was
complete.
Alternative C would contribute both short-term adverse and long-term beneficial impacts to the relatively
small adverse cumulative effects. The contribution of the impacts would be noticeable, because the
impacts from C would be of a larger scale than the impacts from the cumulative projects.

IMPACTS OF THE ALTERNATIVES ON ADJACENT PROPERTY
OWNERS AND THE MARINA
METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS
NPS Management Policies 2006 do not directly address effects on adjacent land uses or property owners,
but do mention cooperation and coordination with park neighbors in several areas (e.g., public
participation, public involvement, and consultation). The purpose of this impact analysis is to assess the
effects of the alternatives on the landowners surrounding Dyke Marsh. To determine impacts, the
potential access and impacts from changing water levels and flood potential, as well as visual changes,
were analyzed.

IMPACTS OF THE NO-ACTION ALTERNATIVE (ALTERNATIVE A)
Under the no-action alternative, there would be no impacts on adjacent landowners. Existing use levels,
including the amount of traffic generated from the site, would continue. The NPS would continue to
develop dock maintenance procedures in coordination with the four dock owners within the Crim
property.
During severe storm events, it would be expected that flooding could continue to occur along the western
portions of the Hog Island Gut, as was experienced during Hurricane Isabel. The docks and mooring field
for the concessionaire-operated marina could also become more exposed over time, making it less
pleasant or less functional to store boats or launch paddle craft.

Cumulative Impacts
No past, present, or future actions have been identified that would impact adjacent landowners. Therefore,
no cumulative impacts are anticipated to occur to adjacent landowners as a result of this alternative.

Conclusion
Alternative A would have minimal impacts on adjacent property owners and the marina. Erosion of the
marsh would exacerbate flooding in adjacent areas, and over time, the marina could become more
exposed, which could affect how much shelter the mooring field provides, and the ease of using the
marina. Erosion of the marsh could also increase the amount of maintenance and protection needed on the
parkway as the shoreline moves closer to it in the future. These impacts would be noticeable, but would
not be a large enough magnitude to be significant.
No past, present, or future actions have been identified that would impact adjacent landowners. Therefore,
no cumulative impacts are anticipated to occur to adjacent landowners as a result of this alternative.

Final Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and Long-term Management Plan / EIS

181

Chapter 4: Environmental Consequences

IMPACTS COMMON TO BOTH ACTION ALTERNATIVES
While the types of restoration activities that would occur under both action alternatives are the same, the
impacts on adjacent landowners would vary by alternative. As a result, common elements other than
construction impacts are described holistically under each alternative.
During construction, adjacent landowners may experience short-term adverse impacts from increased
construction equipment in the project area. Impacts could include increased noise and large equipment in
and out of the Dyke Marsh area. Construction equipment would be expected to operate within the current
noise regulations, limiting hours of operation to normal daylight working hours. Construction impacts
would be the same intensity for both alternatives, but would be longer in duration for alternative C as the
restored area increases by alternative.

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE B
The restoration of 70 acres of restored wetlands and marsh under alternative B would result in beneficial
impacts on residential neighbors to the north and west of Dyke Marsh. The restored marsh, combined
with the longer length of Hog Island Gut, would increase flood buffering and would provide a reduced
probability for flooding during severe weather events. The reduced flood potential is described fully
under the Floodplains section of this chapter.
Under alternative B, the NPS would be required to coordinate closely with Washington Gas so that
construction would not damage the submerged gas line, which is very close to the northern breakwater
alignment proposed under this alternative. Washington Gas has provided a list of mitigation measures,
including specific requirements for pile driving and minimum distances to ensure that the northern
promontory and sheet piling do not impact the gas line during construction. There would be no expected
impacts on the gas line after construction is completed.
Under alternative B, the marsh and water depth south of the marsh are expected to remain very similar to
existing water levels. Dock owners would be expected to be able to continue to use and maintain their
docks as they do under to the no-action alternative.
The stone breakwater would introduce a new visual element to the project area and would have long-term
visual impacts on adjacent properties. Under alternative B, the breakwater would be shorter and further
from the landowners south of the project area than the breakwater proposed under alternative C, and
would be a smaller visual impact for them than alternative C.
Alternative B does not include marsh restoration north of Dyke Island, so there would be no noticeable
impacts on the marina and its concession operator. The marina and the mooring field would continue to
be sheltered by the marsh to some extent.
Once restoration is complete, the marsh may attract an increase in waterfowl and hunters. There may be a
slight increase in noise from hunting from existing duck blinds that would be closer to restored marsh
areas than they currently are, which may negatively impact adjacent homeowners.

Cumulative Impacts
No past, present, or future actions have been identified that would impact adjacent landowners. Therefore,
no cumulative impacts are anticipated to occur to adjacent landowners as a result of this alternative.

182

George Washington Memorial Parkway

Impacts of the Alternatives on Adjacent Property Owners and the Marina

Conclusion
Construction activities would affect adjacent landowners by increasing noise and large equipment in the
Dyke Marsh area. The magnitude of construction-related impacts would be relatively small. Over the long
term, alternative B could provide some additional buffering from flooding in the adjacent community, and
provide some protection for the parkway itself. The breakwater would be visible from properties to the
south but would be relatively distant from these properties. There may be increased noise during hunting
season, although the restored marsh would still be relatively far from the property line, so hunting would
not increase noticeably in adjacent waters. These impacts are all relatively small and would not be
significant.
No past, present, or future actions have been identified that would impact adjacent landowners. Therefore,
no cumulative impacts are anticipated to occur to adjacent landowners as a result of this alternative.

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE C
Impacts on adjacent landowners to the north and west of Dyke Marsh under alternative C would be
expected to be similar to those described under alternative B. With a larger area of restoration (up to 180
acres), the marsh would have a larger flood storage capacity and, therefore, the reduction in flood
potential would be greater than as described under alternative B, even though the base flood elevation
would rise slightly. This greater reduction in flood potential would continue to result in long-term
beneficial impacts on these adjacent landowners.
Under alternative C, the southern promontory location would be farther from the pipeline area, and would
not result in adverse impacts on the Washington Gas pipeline. While measures to reduce vibration may
still be required, there would be minimal impacts on the line during the construction period.
Alternative C would restore marsh closer to the marina than alternative B, but would leave the mooring
field and waters adjacent to the marina untouched, so the marina and its concessioner would not be
noticeably or adversely affected by the restoration over the long term. In the short term, there would be
fewer or less attractive destinations for paddle craft renters from the marina during construction, but
otherwise use of paddle craft, sailboats, and use of the boat ramp, the mooring field, or private slips would
not be affected.
Restoration of the optional cells south of the breakwater would be established if it could be shown that the
hydrology would not erode restored marsh, given the changes to flow around the breakwater. This area
was not modeled during the ten percent design process. If marsh could be successfully established south
of the breakwater, however, sediments would accumulate in the new marsh areas over time to create a
stable marsh area. This marsh could expand slightly and slowly over time, but would be more generally
vulnerable to erosive flows than the restored marsh north of the breakwater; this should not be an issue for
property owners south of the marsh. Additional modeling would be done during final design to ensure
that the design would not cause adverse erosion or sedimentation in the areas upstream or downstream of
the optional cells. Therefore, there would not be any impacts to neighboring property owners from the
establishment of these cells.
Similar to alternative B, the rock breakwater options would introduce a new visual element to the project
area and would have long-term visual impacts on adjacent properties. Under alternative C, the southern
breakwater location would be used and therefore this visual element would be closer and more visible to
the adjacent properties to the south.

Final Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and Long-term Management Plan / EIS

183

Chapter 4: Environmental Consequences

Similar to alternative B, once restoration is complete, the marsh may attract an increase in waterfowl and
hunters, as the marsh would be closer to the location of the permitted hunting blinds. There may be some
increase in noise from hunting, which may negatively impact adjacent homeowners.

Cumulative Impacts
No past, present, or future actions have been identified that would impact adjacent landowners. Therefore,
no cumulative impacts are anticipated to occur to adjacent landowners as a result of this alternative.

Conclusion
Construction activities would affect adjacent landowners by increasing noise and large equipment in the
Dyke Marsh area. The magnitude of construction-related impacts would larger than under alternative B.
Over the long term, alternative C would provide noticeably more buffering from flooding in the adjacent
community than currently exists, and would also provide some protection for the parkway itself. The
breakwater would be visible from properties to the south and would be more visible than the breakwater
proposed in alternative B, because it would be several hundred feet closer to the properties south of it.
There may be noticeably more noise during hunting season with the extent of the restored marsh closer to
the property line, making it more likely that waterfowl would be found closer to the property line and
licensed hunting blinds. Sediment accretion in and adjacent to the restored marsh south of the breakwater
could slightly affect the depth of the water under adjacent docks, but it would not be noticeable and would
not affect the use of these docks. These impacts are all relatively minor and would not be significant.
No past, present, or future actions have been identified that would impact adjacent landowners. Therefore,
no cumulative impacts are anticipated to occur to adjacent landowners as a result of this alternative.

IMPACTS OF THE ALTERNATIVES ON PARK MANAGEMENT
AND OPERATIONS
GUIDING REGULATIONS AND POLICIES
As discussed in chapter 1, the restoration of Dyke Marsh is guided by NPS Management Policies 2006,
specifically, “Chapter 4: Natural Resources,” which states that “the National Park Service will strive to
understand, maintain, restore, and protect the inherent integrity of the natural resources, processes,
systems, and values of the parks while providing meaningful and appropriate opportunities to enjoy them”
(NPS 2006). The NPS is intervening in natural biological and physical processes in Dyke Marsh both
because it has been directed to do so by Congress and because it is restoring natural ecosystem functions
that have been disrupted by past or ongoing human activity as directed under NPS Management Policies
2006.

METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS
Success of the restoration of Dyke Marsh relies on the availability of park staff to actively manage for the
restoration of the marsh. This includes staff management of not only the restoration but of the
concessioners and visitor experience at the marsh as well. For the purpose of this analysis, park
management and operations refers to the quality and effectiveness of the park staff to maintain and
administer park resources and facilities and to provide for an effective visitor experience. Facilities
included in this project include the Dyke Marsh and the sites within Marsh including Belle Haven Marina,
Mount Vernon Trail, Haul Road, and the boardwalk at the end of Haul Road. Park staff who are
knowledgeable of issues related to Dyke Marsh were members of the planning team that evaluated the

184

George Washington Memorial Parkway

Impacts of the Alternatives on Park Management and Operations

impacts of each alternative. The impact analysis is based on the current description of park operations
presented in “Chapter 3: Affected Environment” of this document. The proposed project has the potential
to affect park management and operations after implementation through administrative and long-term
operations and maintenance or life-cycle costs. It should be noted that staffing and funding levels
associated with actions in the alternatives are difficult to project until final plans are completed.

IMPACTS OF THE NO-ACTION ALTERNATIVE (ALTERNATIVE A)
Under the no-action alternative, no restoration efforts would occur and the marsh would continue to
erode. Current management of the marsh would continue, which includes providing basic maintenance
related to Haul Road, control of nonnative invasive plant species, ongoing interpretive and environmental
education activities, scientific research projects, boundary marking, and enforcement of existing
regulations. No manipulation of the marsh would occur other than emergency, safety-related, or limited
improvements or maintenance actions. The destabilized marsh would continue to erode at an accelerated
rate (Litwin et al. 2011). It is likely that adverse impacts on park management and operations would be
noticeable in the long term under this alternative as park activities such as research and educational
activities would be impacted as the marsh erodes. Furthermore, it is anticipated that maintenance
activities to Haul Road or the Mount Vernon Trail under this alternative would continue to increase in the
long term in order to prevent or reduce the amount of erosion anticipated for these facilities.
The marina is currently at capacity and it is reasonable to expect that this condition would persist (Lebel,
pers. comm. 2009). The Dyke Marsh area would continue to be serviced by staff from five of the park’s
divisions. The Natural Resources Division would continue to spend up to 20 percent of their time in the
Dyke Marsh area. The mooring field and other parts of the marina could become more exposed over time
and less appealing to marina users, and could therefore affect the ability of the marina concession to rent
mooring spots.

Cumulative Impacts
No past, present, or future actions have been identified that would impact park management and
operations. Therefore, there would be no cumulative impacts on park management and operations from
this alternative.

Conclusion
Under the no-action alternative (alternative A), the marsh would continue to erode, which would result in
decreased research and educational opportunities, and increased maintenance efforts to protect the
parkway, Mount Vernon trail, and other facilities adjacent to the marsh. The marina is expected to
continue to operate at capacity, but might experience a loss of revenue from decreased rentals of paddle
craft over an extended period of time as the marsh erodes. The mooring field and other parts of the marina
could become more exposed over time and less appealing to marina users, and make it more difficult for
the marina concession to rent mooring spots. Increased maintenance would not likely become necessary
for the next 15 years, however, and overall these impacts would not be significant.

IMPACTS COMMON TO BOTH ACTION ALTERNATIVES
Long-term Impacts from Adaptive Management Activities
Adaptive management would be used under all of the action alternatives to make adjustments to
vegetation establishment, manage nonnative and invasive species throughout the marsh, and ensure
restoration is successful. It is anticipated that park management and operations impacts would increase in

Final Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and Long-term Management Plan / EIS

185

Chapter 4: Environmental Consequences

magnitude as restoration acreage increases. This increase arises from park staff having to progressively
monitor more marsh under each of these alternatives. Re-vegetation activities associated with newly
created marsh land would be conducted by NPS staff, contractors, or volunteers. It is anticipated that the
level of effort for NPS staff, contractors, or volunteers would increase in magnitude for alternative C, and
would vary in intensity depending choice of labor for the re-vegetation activities. Use of volunteers would
require the most coordination and staff time, while contractors would require the least staff time.

Changes to Park Management and Operations as a Result of Construction
In the short term, during construction, it is anticipated that some activities such as monitoring, data
management, research, and law enforcement would be affected, and some of these activities, such as
research, would likely be curtailed or refocused in the short-term due to interference by construction
activities. In the long term, it is anticipated that these activities, in addition to invasive plant control and
law enforcement activities, may increase in magnitude for alternative C, as more marsh area is created.
Under both of the action alternatives park management and operations would be impacted by the degree
to which park staff are required to manage the Dyke Marsh area as it undergoes restoration. For instance,
as hydrologic connections are reestablished to the inland side of Haul Road, some portions of this road
may have to be closed, requiring staff time to ensure the construction area is well marked and that road
closure signs remain visible, and are correctly placed. Additionally, it is anticipated that some impacts on
park management and operations would occur as a result of park staff interacting with construction
workers during the restoration of Dyke Marsh.
As construction would take place from the water to the greatest extent possible and material would be
transported by barge and stored on the barges, there would be little, if any, need for staging areas on land
in the park. Therefore, park management and operations activities on shore are not anticipated to be
affected by a majority of the construction operations.
Under each of the alternatives the boardwalk at the end of Haul Road is expected to remain in place;
however, park staff would likely have to close this off during the construction period due to the
disturbances along Haul Road.

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE B
Under this alternative, park management and operations may be affected by the establishment of
approximately 70 new acres of various wetland habitats as well as the construction of a new breakwater
and breaks along Haul Road. It is anticipated that adaptive management actions under this alternative
would have less of an impact on park staff than alternative C in the long term. Furthermore, it is
anticipated that this alternative would have the least impact on park staff conducting re-vegetation
activities as this alternative has the smallest amount of new marsh being created. It is anticipated that over
the long term, the area designated for research, maintenance, and educational activities would increase by
the smallest amount relative to alternative C. Furthermore, it is anticipated that invasive plant control and
law enforcement would be affected to the least degree under this action alternative relative to the other
action alternatives. In the long term, it is anticipated that the amount of time and effort expended on these
activities would increase due to the increase in marsh area and habitat for invasive plants. It is anticipated
that research, maintenance, and educational activities would be refocused the least during construction of
this alternative relative to the other action alternatives due to the relatively small area of new marsh being
created.

Impacts of the Alternatives on Park Management and Operations

Cumulative Impacts
No past, present, or future actions have been identified that would impact park management and
operations. Therefore, there would be no cumulative impacts on park management and operations from
this alternative.

Conclusion
Both action alternatives require the implementation of a monitoring program to ensure the restoration is
successful, and increased management to ensure that geese exclosures and nonnative plant management
are working. During construction, staff time would be required to interact with construction personnel,
and research and educational activities might be refocused. Overall, the level of effort necessary to carry
out the restoration actions under alternative B would not be of a magnitude that would be considered
significant.
No past, present, or future actions have been identified that would impact park management and
operations. Therefore, there would be no cumulative impacts on park management and operations from
this alternative.

IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE C
Under this alternative, park management and operations may be affected by the establishment of up to
180 new acres of various wetland habitats as well as the construction of a new breakwater, breaks along
Haul Road, and tidal guts that are cut into the restored marsh. The 180 acres includes an option to restore
an area south of the breakwater. The marina would continue its normal operations, since there would be
no fill placed in the mooring area or near marina docks under alternative C.
It is anticipated that adaptive management actions under this alternative would have a greater impact on
park staff compared to alternative B in the long-term. Furthermore, it is anticipated that this alternative
would have a greater impact on park staff conducting re-vegetation activities compared to alternative B
because a larger amount of new marsh would be created under alternative C. It is anticipated that over the
long term, the area designated for research, maintenance, and educational activities would increase by a
larger amount than under alternative B. Furthermore, it is anticipated that invasive plant control and law
enforcement would be affected to a higher degree under this alternative compared to alternative B. In the
long-term, it is anticipated that the amount of time and effort expended on these activities would increase
due to the increase in marsh area and habitat for invasive plants. It is anticipated that research,
maintenance, and educational activities would be more than under alternative B during construction of
this alternative relative to the other action alternatives due to the relative size of the new marsh being
created.

Cumulative Impacts
No past, present, or future actions have been identified that would impact park management and
operations. Therefore, there would be no cumulative impacts on park management and operations from
this alternative.

Conclusion
Both action alternatives require the implementation of a monitoring program to ensure the restoration is
successful, and increased management to ensure that geese exclosures and nonnative plant management is
working. A greater amount of staff time would be required to interact with construction personnel under

Final Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and Long-term Management Plan / EIS

187

Chapter 4: Environmental Consequences

alternative C, and research and educational activities would be refocused. Overall, the level of effort
necessary under alternative C would be much greater than under alternative B, but it would likely be
spread out over time, and would be focused over short amounts of time and would therefore not be
significant.
No past, present, or future actions have been identified that would impact park management and
operations. Therefore, there would be no cumulative impacts on park management and operations from
this alternative.

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SHORT-TERM USES OF THE
ENVIRONMENT AND MAINTENANCE AND ENHANCEMENT OF
LONG-TERM PRODUCTIVITY
NEPA regulations (40 CFR 1502.16) require an environmental impact statement (EIS) to consider the
relationship between short-term uses of the environment and the maintenance and enhancement of longterm productivity. Special attention should be given to impacts that narrow the range of beneficial uses of
the environment or pose a long-term risk to human health or safety.
Alternative A: No Action. NPS would not restore any marsh areas within Dyke Marsh. Current
management of the marsh would continue, which includes providing basic maintenance related to Haul
Road, control of nonnative invasive plant species, ongoing interpretive and environmental education
activities, scientific research projects, boundary marking, and enforcement of existing regulations. There
would be no manipulation of the marsh other than emergency, safety-related, or limited improvements or
maintenance actions. The destabilized marsh would continue to erode at an accelerated rate. Since this is
the environmental baseline and includes no restoration, no short-term impacts are expected. The longterm productivity of the park’s resources is expected to decline because the marsh would continue to
degrade. Sediments would continue to be carried past the marsh. Erosion in the marsh would continue at a
rate of 6–7.8 feet per year as there is little or no natural protection from erosion provided to Hog Island
Gut (Litwin et al. 2011; USACE 2012a). With no restoration efforts, relatively high energy conditions
would continue to exist adjacent to the marsh allowing suspended sediments in the river to continue to be
carried straight downstream past the marsh. Habitat degradation would continue due to altered hydrology
and would adversely impact management efforts for native species, wildlife, and special-status species, as
well as threatening the surviving remnant of the dyke and any other archeological resources that might be
present along the river’s shoreline.
Alternatives B: Hydrologic Restoration and Minimal Wetland Restoration. The activities associated
with the construction of a breakwater structure and containment cells, deep channel fill, establishment of
natural edges on the outermost extent of the containment cells, reestablishment of marsh vegetation, and
reintroduction of tidal flows to both sides of Haul Road and the installation of culverts or bridges would
result in a number of impacts that would alter long-term uses of park resources. The short-term use for
construction is essential to long-term productivity of the marsh. The installation of a breakwater structure
and placement of fill in the deep channels at the southern end of the existing marsh would dissipate wave
and flow energy, and protect the mouth of Hog Island Gut. The creation of breaks along Haul Road would
allow tidal flows to pass under the road and into the former bottomland swamp forest, along with
sediment transfer associated with those tidal flows over the long term. Establishing a natural edge would
allow SAV to become established in the deeper waters riverward of the emergent marsh. Reintroduction
of intertidal exchange west of Haul Road would encourage reestablishment of a floodplain swamp forest
and facilitate the management of exotic and invasive vegetation species that have established in the area.
Implementation of this alternative would create up to approximately 70 new acres of wetland habitat of
various types, including approximately 25 acres of restored marsh, and allow the continued natural

188

George Washington Memorial Parkway

Irreversible or Irretrievable Commitments of Resources

accretion of soils and establishment of wetlands due to the restored hydrologic conditions. All of these
long-term impacts would affect resources and the uses of those resources by wildlife, visitors, and park
personnel as well as influencing park operations and management in the long term.
Alternative C: Hydrologic Restoration and Fullest Possible Extent of Wetland Restoration
(Preferred Alternative). Similar to alternative B, impacts from proposed activities associated with the
construction of a breakwater structure and containment cells, deep channel fill, establishment of natural
edges on the outermost extent of the containment cells, reestablishment of marsh vegetation, and
reintroduction of tidal flows to both sides of Haul Road and the installation of culverts or bridges would
result in a number of impacts that would have short-term adverse effects, but would create long-term
benefits. Under this alternative, up to 180 acres of various wetland habitats could be created. Similar to
alternative B, all of these long-term impacts would affect resources and the uses of those resources by
wildlife, visitors, and park personnel as well as influencing park operations and management in the long
term.

IRREVERSIBLE OR IRRETRIEVABLE COMMITMENTS OF
RESOURCES
NEPA regulations (40 CFR 1502.16) require an EIS to address the irreversible and irretrievable
commitment of resources caused by the alternatives. An irreversible commitment of resources is defined
as the loss of future options. The term applies primarily to the effects of using nonrenewable resources
(such as minerals or cultural resources) or resources that are renewable only over long periods (such as
soil productivity). It could also apply to the loss of an experience as an indirect effect of a “permanent”
change in the nature or character of the land. An irretrievable commitment of resources is defined as the
loss of production, harvest, or use of natural resources; irretrievable resource commitments may or may
not be irreversible. The following identifies commitments of resources that are either irreversible or
irretrievable.
Under alternative A, the environmental conditions in Dyke Marsh would continue, including the potential
for continued erosion in the marsh, leading to eventual disappearance of the marsh. Marsh erosion would
be accompanied by habitat degradation and threats to historic resources. No manipulation of the marsh
would occur other than emergency, safety-related, or limited improvements or maintenance actions and
the marsh would continue to degrade and become smaller in size. As the marsh erodes, the end of Haul
Road could be threatened, and the southern portion of the road could potentially become submerged.
Should portions of Haul Road become submerged, visitors would no longer be able to use this location
and would experience long-term noticeable impacts on the quality of their visitor experience. Visitor use
would be noticeably impacted as visitor use in that area would be restricted. Impacts to these resources
are irretrievable and would continue into the future under current management. However, restoration is
based on the premise that current conditions are not irreversible. Restoration activities under alternatives
B and C would create beneficial hydrological and sediment deposition conditions that would promote
successful marsh restoration over the long term. Restoration of Dyke Marsh and the processes that
support a freshwater tidal marsh would gradually restore the area’s wetlands and ecosystem functions and
processes, and repair damage from previous human uses and other continuing threats, such as alterations
to the hydrology in the Potomac River and in nearby tributaries, and other effects from urbanization in the
surrounding region.

UNAVOIDABLE ADVERSE IMPACTS
Alternative A: No Action. Implementation of alternative A would lead to unavoidable adverse
environmental impacts. A decision by NPS to not restore the marsh would hinder regional restoration

Final Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and Long-term Management Plan / EIS

189

Chapter 4: Environmental Consequences

efforts and management of park resources. All resource areas would be adversely affected. The
destabilized marsh would continue to erode at an accelerated rate, and would eventually disappear,
adversely affecting hydrology and sediment transport, as well as soils and sediments, water quality,
floodplains, vegetation, and wetlands. Archeological resources and other cultural resources, such as
cultural landscapes, would be adversely affected by the erosion by increasing the potential that
archeological resources along the riverbank could be exposed and harmed, and by altering the component
landscapes of the historic districts. Marsh erosion would cause habitat degradation that would adversely
impact management efforts for native species, fish and wildlife, and species of special concern by
decreasing and eventually eliminating the habitat for these species. Visitor use and experience, park
management and operations, and adjacent property owners and the marina would also be adversely
affected by the disappearing marsh. Since no construction activities would be included in this alternative,
there would be no construction-related impacts.
Alternatives B: Hydrologic Restoration and Minimal Wetland Restoration. Implementation of
alternative B would lead to unavoidable adverse environmental impacts. Construction actions and
reintroduction of intertidal flows across Haul Road would be accompanied by limited unavoidable shortterm adverse impacts to hydrology and sediment transport, soils, water quality, vegetation, fish and
wildlife, visitor use and experience, and adjacent landowners. In addition, intermittent adverse impacts to
water quality could result have a limited ability to adversely affect water quality overall. However, it is
likely that there would be some minimal erosion or scour around the culverts or bridge pilings until a
hydrologic equilibrium is established. This would result in a small amount of soils and sediments, and any
bound nutrients or pollutants being carried into the marsh and river over the short amount of time after
construction is complete. Whatever soluble pollutants are in the soil west of Haul Road could be
transported into the river with the newly introduced intertidal flows. Construction would use BMPs such
as silt fences around the construction area at Haul Road, and would use practices for construction in
waterways that are appropriate for the situation. The containment cells themselves serve as sediment
control devices, but additional BMPs, such as sediment curtains, could be specified as necessary as the
design and permitting process moves forward. In addition, fill materials for the containment cells for the
restored wetlands would be tested to ensure they do not contain harmful pollutants, and would therefore
not impact water quality.
Short-term adverse impacts to fish and wildlife species and species of special concern would be limited to
the bird species and other fish and wildlife during the construction period. Impacts would be minimized
by placing restrictions on when construction can occur to avoid construction during the birds’ breeding
periods.
Alternative C: Hydrologic Restoration and Fullest Possible Extent of Wetland Restoration
(Preferred Alternative). Implementation of alternative C would lead to similar unavoidable adverse
environmental impacts as under alternative B. Although construction actions and reintroduction of
intertidal flows would support the long-term conversion of the project area to the desired marsh condition,
they are accompanied by unavoidable short-term adverse impacts on hydrology and sediment transport,
soil, water quality, vegetation, fish and wildlife, species of special concern, and visitor use and
experience. Similar to alternative B, these impacts would be managed and mitigated by BMPs and other
appropriate resource protection measures.

CHAPTER 5: CONSULTATION, COORDINATION, AND
REGULATORY COMPLIANCE
One intent of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) is to encourage the participation of federal
and state-involved agencies and affected citizens in the assessment procedure, as appropriate. This section
describes the consultation that occurred during development of this Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and
Long-term Management Plan / Environmental Impact Statement (plan/EIS), including consultation with
scientific experts and other agencies. This chapter also includes a description of the public involvement
process and a list of the recipients of the draft document.

HISTORY OF PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT
The public involvement activities for this plan/EIS fulfill the requirements of NEPA and National Park
Service (NPS) Director’s Order 12 (NPS 2011a).

THE SCOPING PROCESS
The NPS divides the scoping process into two parts: internal scoping and external or public scoping.
Internal scoping involved discussions among NPS personnel regarding the purpose of and need for
management actions, issues, management alternatives, mitigation measures, the analysis boundary,
appropriate level of documentation, available references and guidance, and other related topics.
Public scoping is the early involvement of the interested and affected public in the environmental analysis
process. The public scoping process helps ensure that people have an opportunity to comment and
contribute early in the decision-making process. For this plan/EIS, project information was distributed to
individuals, agencies, and organizations early in the scoping process and at a second meeting focused on
conceptual alternatives, and people were given opportunities to express concerns, identify important
issues, and provide input on the alternatives.
Taken together, internal and public scoping are essential elements of the NEPA planning process. The
following sections describe the various ways scoping was conducted for this plan/EIS.

INTERNAL SCOPING
Internal scoping began November 14–15, 2007, with a meeting at Daingerfield Marina on the parkway in
Alexandria, Virginia. During the two days of meetings, NPS employees reviewed background
information on the marsh, discussed the NEPA and planning process, reviewed and confirmed the project
purpose and need for action statements; identified issues and concerns (problems to solve, opportunities
to be taken); and defined objectives for taking action (what does the park hope to accomplish for the
action to be successful?). The group also began to analyze preliminary alternatives and data needs;
identified interested and affected members of the public, and developed a plan for public involvement.
As discussed in “Chapter 1: Purpose of and Need for Action,” the park convened a science team that
evaluated scientific literature and provided input into the planning process.

Chapter 5: Consultation, Coordination, and Regulatory Compliance

PUBLIC SCOPING
Public Notification
A Notice of Intent to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) was published in the Federal
Register on April 8, 2008 (Volume 73, Number 68).
A brochure was mailed on April 7, 2008, to the project’s preliminary mailing list of government agencies,
tribes, organizations, businesses, and individuals. The brochure announced public scoping meetings to be
held in April 2008, summarized the purpose of and need for the plan, listed preliminary alternatives,
provided background information on the project and planning process, and presented instructions on how
to comment on the plan.
A second brochure was prepared and mailed on April 24, 2012, to the project’s mailing list, comprising
the original preliminary list and those added after the first public scoping meeting. This brochure
summarized the alternative concepts that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) had developed for
the NPS.

Public Meetings
Public Scoping
On April 7, 2008, George Washington Memorial Parkway released the Public Scoping Newsletter for the
plan/EIS for public review and comment. The public was invited to submit comments on the scope of the
planning process and potential alternatives through May 23, 2008. During the scoping period, a public
scoping meeting was held at Belle View Elementary on April 22. The meeting presented information
about the development of the plan and planning processes. NPS staff was on hand to answer questions,
provide additional information to workshop participants, and record their input.
Alternatives Scoping
The George Washington Memorial Parkway released a newsletter detailing four alternative concepts for
the plan/EIS on April 24, 2012, and invited the public to attend a public meeting to learn more about these
alternatives. A public scoping meeting was held on May 8, 2012, at the Washington Sailing Marina in
Alexandria, Virginia, to review the additional research and alternatives developed by the USACE
following more than a year’s worth of modeling and research. The public comment period following this
meeting was held open until June 20, 2012. At the meeting, representatives from NPS introduced the
project and later discussed the NEPA process. Representatives from USACE presented the results of their
research, results of research conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and four alternative
scenarios for consideration in the plan/EIS. Comment cards were available, and attendees were also
encouraged to submit comments online on the NPS Planning, Environment, and Public Comment (PEPC)
website at http://parkplanning.nps.gov/gwmp.

Public Comment
Public Scoping
During the initial public scoping period, nearly 300 pieces of correspondence were entered into the PEPC
system either from direct entry by the commenter, or uploading of emails, faxes, and hard copy letters by
NPS staff. Of the approximately 50 letters submitted from outside the region immediately surrounding

192

George Washington Memorial Parkway

History of Public Involvement

Dyke Marsh Wildlife Preserve (Dyke Marsh) (District of Columbia, Maryland, Virginia), concerns
regarding hunting access in areas near Dyke Marsh were the almost exclusive topic of the
communications. Among commenters from the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia, the three
topics that received the majority of the comments were expressions of support for the restoration of Dyke
Marsh, concerns regarding the impact of the restoration on Belle Haven Marina, as well as concerns
regarding continued access to hunting in areas near Dyke Marsh.
It should be noted that prior to the April 22 public scoping meeting, a notice was posted on the National
Rifle Association’s website stating there was going to be a meeting that evening with officials from the
NPS and the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries (VDGIF) to discuss the future of hunting
in the Dyke Marsh area. The inaccurate information contained in the notice generated national interest in
the meeting and the process. Changing the current hunting opportunities available to the public outside of
the marsh boundary is outside the scope of the plan/EIS and was not considered in this document.
Alternatives Scoping
Comments following the 2012 alternatives meeting primarily expressed support or opposition for the four
alternatives, and also asked what the costs would be or expressed concern over likely project costs. Many
commenters expressed concern that the project would cause the Belle Haven Marina to close or would
restrict or reduce recreational access and opportunities in the marsh. Several commenters suggested
approaches that would allow the marina to remain open and still allow for restoration. For example,
several commenters suggested that alternative D should not include the option to fill the sailboat mooring
area, and others suggested that the minimal or intermediate restoration alternatives would be more
appropriate.
Several commenters also described the high-quality fishing grounds of the deeper holes in the marsh, and
were concerned about the filling of these deeper areas. Other commenters were in favor of the restoration
of wetland habitat for birds and other wetland-dwelling species.

PUBLIC REVIEW OF THE DRAFT PLAN/EIS
On January 15, 2014, the NPS published a Notice of Availability in the Federal Register for the draft
plan/EIS. The 60-day public comment period was open through March 18, 2014. The public comment
period was announced on the project website, posted on the park website and announced through a press
release. The draft plan/EIS was available on the PEPC website and via hard copy upon request from the
park. A public open house meeting was held at the Washington Sailing Marina on February 26, 2014, in
the middle of the public review period; 100 people attended the meeting.
Hard copies of the draft plan/EIS were mailed to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)
and state review agencies, and a newsletter announcing the release of the draft plan/EIS was sent to
interested parties, elected officials, and other appropriate local and state agencies, and were made
available at local libraries in Fairfax County. Members of the public were able to submit their comments
on the project through the PEPC website or by mailing comments to the park.
During the comment period, 313 pieces of correspondence were received. All correspondence that was
submitted outside of the PEPC system was entered into PEPC for analysis, including letters received by
email or through the U.S. mail and comments received at the public meetings. Each of these letters or
submissions is referred to as a piece of correspondence. Once all correspondences were entered into
PEPC, each was read, and specific comments within each piece of correspondence were identified. A total
of 621 comments was derived from the correspondences received, and substantive comments, or those
comments that “raise, debate, or question a point of fact or policy,” were further analyzed and responses

193

Chapter 5: Consultation, Coordination, and Regulatory Compliance

were prepared. Revisions were incorporated into the plan/EIS as necessary as the result of public
comment. All comments received were carefully considered and incorporated into the final plan/EIS.
Changes made in the final plan/EIS as a result of public comment include a modification to alternative C
to eliminate the optional fill area in the vicinity of Bell Haven Marina. Other changes made were factual
in nature and did not result in changes to the NPS preferred alternative or the outcome of the impact
analysis for any of the management alternatives considered.
Appendix D describes the public review process in greater detail, and includes a content analysis report,
concern response report, and comment letters received from businesses, organizations, and agencies.
This final plan/EIS will be made available for public inspection for a 30-day no-action period, which
begins with the publication of the USEPA Notice of Availability in the Federal Register. After the 30-day
no action period, a record of decision (ROD) will be signed by the Regional Director of the National
Capital Region that will document approval of the plan, select the alternative to be implemented, and set
forth any stipulations required for implementation.

AGENCY CONSULTATION
Consultation and coordination with several agencies has continued throughout the planning process for
this plan/EIS. The Baltimore and Norfolk Districts of USACE, Virginia and Maryland agencies, and the
Virginia State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) have all been informed of the project and the process.
Letters initiating consultation under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act and Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act and/or requesting information or comments were sent to the agencies
as described below. Copies of these letters and any responses are provided in appendix C.

U.S. FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE
As part of the planning process, a science team was convened to review information about the marsh and
provide input to the process. This team included two U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) personnel
who are very familiar with the marsh and surrounding habitat: John Gill, USFWS Maryland Fishery
Resources Office, Biologist (who had completed wetlands restoration for local projects and a fish
inventory of Dyke Marsh in 2001–2004); and Sandy Spencer, USFWS, Eastern Virginia Rivers National
Wildlife Refuge Complex, Wildlife Biologist (Masters research at Dyke Marsh beginning in 1997). No
federally listed species were identified during the discussions that addressed that subject.
A letter dated June 27, 2013, from George Washington Memorial Parkway was sent to reconfirm that
information and to initiate informal consultation with the USFWS about the presence of federally listed
rare, threatened, or endangered species in or near the parks. No response was received. A copy of the draft
plan/EIS was also sent to the USFWS. No response was received.

VIRGINIA STATE HISTORIC PRESERVATION OFFICE
A letter was sent in December 2009 from George Washington Memorial Parkway to the Virginia SHPO
in accordance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. The letter initiated consultation
with the Virginia SHPO and provided information about the archeological assessment conducted at the
marsh for this project. Virginia Department of Historic Resources responded on January 6, 2010, and
stated that they found that the assessment provided a clear and thorough presentation of Dyke Marsh’s
archeological potential. They agreed that the proposed restoration should consider the preservation of the
intact portions of the historic dikes located in the southeastern section of the marsh and that consideration
should be given to avoidance of archeologically sensitive areas in planning the restoration. If avoidance is
194

Agency Consultation

not possible, they stated that further identification efforts would be necessary to locate and evaluate any
archeological sites that may be affected by the proposed restoration activities. The draft plan/EIS was
provided to the Virginia SHPO to solicit comment and continue the consultation process.
A copy of the draft plan/EIS was sent to the Virginia SHPO. The response, dated March 11, 2014,
confirmed that there was agreement in 2009 that the entire fastland portion of the project area would be
considered sensitive for the presence of Native American sites dating from the past 5,000 years, and noted
that if construction is proposed in archeologically sensitive areas, further identification efforts and
continued consultation continue to be necessary.
The letter also discussed two Runway Safety Area Enhancement projects at the Ronald Reagan
Washington National Airport, which required mitigation for wetlands impacts. Part of the mitigation is
providing funding for the construction of the breakwater at Dyke Marsh, and therefore the SHPO
requested additional consultation, given the link between the two projects. Discussion of the consultation
with Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority and Federal Aviation Administration is included in the
following section. Partial funding for the first phase of the marsh restoration and construction of the
breakwater has been provided for through mitigation approved in the USACE Section 404 permit for the
Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport expansion, and the consultation process for that project has
taken place separately.
The NPS sent a response to Virginia Department of Historic Resources stating that the intention of the
NPS is to continue consultation if construction should be proposed in an archeologically sensitive area as
part of its responsibilities under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. The response also
committed to incorporating information about consultation on the runways project in the final EIS.

METROPOLITAN WASHINGTON AIRPORTS AUTHORITY
The NPS engaged in consultation with the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority and the Federal
Aviation Administration regarding wetlands mitigation requirements for a separate project under their
Runway 4-22 and Runway 13-33 Runway Safety Area Enhancements in 2013. That project included the
transfer of jurisdiction of 2.4 acres of the Potomac River bed from the NPS to the Federal Aviation
Administration. The Section 106 and Section 7 consultation and permitting for the Runway 4-22 and
Runway 13-33 Runway safety Area Enhancements were undertaken between Metropolitan Washington
Airports Authority and the Virginia Department of Historic Resources in 2010. The NPS completed their
Section 106 consultation with the District of Columbia Historic Preservation Office for the transfer of
jurisdiction of the 2.4 acres of Potomac River bed on April 29, 2013. As part of the NPS Finding of No
Significant Impact and wetlands mitigation for the transfer of jurisdiction between the NPS and Federal
Aviation Administration for the 2.4 acres, Dyke Marsh was identified as the mitigation site for
Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority. The Section 106 consultation responsibility for the NPS for
the overall Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration project, which includes this mitigation effort, is part of this
EIS process.

VIRGINIA DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION AND RECREATION
A letter dated June 27, 2013, from George Washington Memorial Parkway was sent to the Section 7
coordinator for the Department about the presence of state rare, threatened, or endangered species in or
near the parks. No response was received. The draft plan/EIS was provided to Virginia Department of
Conservation and Recreation (VA DCR) for their review and comment.

195

Chapter 5: Consultation, Coordination, and Regulatory Compliance

VIRGINIA DEPARTMENT OF GAME AND INLAND FISHERIES
The VDGIF submitted a letter to the NPS on May 22, 2008, recommending further consultation with the
agency concerning bald eagle habitat, anadromous fish habitat, and stating general support for the project.
The draft plan/EIS was provided to VDGIF for their review and comment.

REGULATORY COMPLIANCE: PERMITS AND MITIGATION
MEASURES
PROPOSED STRATEGY FOR REGULATORY PERMITTING
This section explains the proposed strategy for regulatory permitting over the duration of project
implementation. The project would require coordinated permits multiple permits and approvals from
federal, state, and county agencies. These approvals would need to encompass the project’s several year
implementation period and allow for flexibility if project needs extend beyond this time frame.
Restoration activities would proceed in an incremental and phased approach that would be guided by, and
adjusted in response to, the adaptive management plan.

VIRGINIA’S JOINT PERMITTING PROCESS
The Virginia Department of Environmental Quality administers the Virginia Water Protection Permit
Program and associated compliance, which includes permits for activities such as dredging, filling, and
excavating in open water, streams, and wetlands in Commonwealth waters. All permits are coordinated
through the Joint Permit Application process, and submitted to the Department of Environmental Quality,
which distributes them to appropriate agencies, including the USACE. The joint permit process allows for
concurrent federal and state project review, and also includes compliance with Section 404 of the Clean
Water Act, Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbor Act, and water quality certification under Section 401 of
the Clean Water Act. It also includes approval for sediment and erosion control planning, and other
aspects of the construction process. The Fairfax County Wetlands Board, and Virginia Marine Resources
Commission will also be notified of the permit application. The county board and the commission have
review and approval authority (VA DEQ 2012c).
A consistency determination to ensure federal projects are consistent with enforceable policies under
Virginia’s Coastal Zone Management Program (CZMP), as mandated by the Coastal Zone Management
Act of 1972 (CZMA), is also necessary. Applicable enforceable policies address fisheries management,
subaqueous land management, tidal wetlands management, nonpoint and point source pollution control,
air pollution control, and coastal lands management. Policies addressing shoreline sanitation and dunes
management would not be applicable. Findings of consistency (either no effects or consistency
determinations) are submitted to the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (VA DEQ 2013).
No permitting would be required from the state of Maryland, but there would be consultation with the
state of Maryland and they would be informed of the action and permit process. Actions in Virginia
waters could affect water quality in Maryland waters.
It is expected that the permits would require application of pollution prevention principles, spill
prevention measures, standard practices related to air quality, and implementation of appropriate sediment
and erosion control practices. The permits would also likely dictate construction timing to prevent adverse
effects on fish spawning and wildlife reproduction seasons. Coordination with other agencies, as
necessary, would occur through the permitting process to determine necessary permit requirements and
restrictions.

GLOSSARY
adventitious roots—roots that develop in an unusual place, such as the trunk.
benthic sediment—Bethnic sediment is sediment found on the river bottom.
coir biologs—tubes or logs made of coir or coconut fiber bound by high strength twisted coir netting that
provide attenuation of wave energy in shallow places; over time, the logs will degrade.
containment cells—a containment cell is an structure placed in the open water that allows for fill to be
placed inside to raise the elevation of the river bed.
fastland—fastland is land near water that is high and dry.
geotextile tubes—geotextile tubes are large tubes made from high strength fabric filled with sand slurry;
they can be several hundred feet in length, and several feet in diameter.
hydroperiod—length of time the marsh surface is inundated.
obligate wetland indicator plants—Obligate wetland indicator plants are those plants that almost always
occur in wetlands.
refugia— refugia are areas in which a population of organisms can survive through a period of
unfavorable conditions.
thalweg— Thalweg is the line defining the lowest points along the length of a river bed or valley.
tidal guts—tidal guts are stream-like features found in tidal marshes formed by advancing and receding
tides.

APPENDIX A: ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT
DRAFT DYKE MARSH MONITORING PLAN TO SUPPORT ADAPTIVE
MANAGEMENT APPROACH TO ASSESSING THE SUCCESS OF
MARSH RESTORATION
PROJECT PURPOSE
The purpose of this project is to restore a destabilized, eroding marsh. The National Park Service (NPS)
and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have congressional mandates to restore the historic marsh. Using the
steps outlined above, this section describes the elements to be included in the development of the adaptive
management plan.

SAMPLING DESIGN
Monitoring will determine factors contributing to the success or failure of the restoration, justify adaptive
management actions, and allow for the better understanding of factors contributing to marsh loss
throughout Dyke Marsh. Key processes shaping the marsh include hydrodynamic forces, vegetation, and
sediment accretion and erosion (Darke and Megonigal 2003). Marsh surface elevation, vegetation, and
hydrology are closely linked. Monitoring of hydrology, elevation and accretion, and vegetation at the
treatment and reference marshes will be conducted prior to restoration and will continue for at least 10
years after restoration. The monitoring program is managed and implemented by NPS. In a successful
restoration, vegetation in the newly created marsh should be approximately the same as what is currently
in the existing marsh, invasive nonnative species would be removed upon discovery, and the breakwater
would work according to the hydrologic models and would allow for low energy areas in the marsh that
would encourage accretion (NPS 2013).
This monitoring plan focuses on key indicators of success rather than on individual species, and employs
a Before, After, Control, Impact sampling design (Stewart-Oaten et al. 1986; Stewart-Oaten et al. 1992;
Underwood 1992; Smith et al. 1993; Stewart-Oaten 2003; Rafferty et al. 2011; Turner et al. 2013a). The
Before, After, Control, Impact design examines the before (pre-construction baseline) and after (postconstruction) condition of the restoration site and compares a control (reference site) with the impact site
(restoration site) (Turner et al. 2013a). Before and after sampling will determine how the restoration
process changed the site through time from its historical condition (Turner et al. 2013a). Baseline
elevation data are currently available for sediment erosion tables Sediment Elevation Table (SET) and
LIDAR. Vegetation data at Dyke Marsh has been gathered by several investigators from 1991 to the
present (Xu 1991; Hopfensperger and Engelhardt 2008). Numerous surveys of vegetation exist, as well as
bathymetric studies and complete elevation surveys of the marsh.
The placement of dredge material and any planting is the “impact” and a nearby reference marsh that has
not been recently disturbed is the “control.” The control marsh is representative of the target condition.
Control and impact sampling differentiate effects of restoration actions from natural variability, stochastic
events, and underlying regional trends such as sea level rise increasing water levels. A control site with
identical conditions to the restoration site is not typically available. Therefore, the term reference site is
used to describe areas near the restoration but not part of the area directly affected by the restoration
project. The restoration and reference sites are typically monitored with similar intensity to allow for
direct comparison of the different monitoring samples (Turner et al. 2013a).

Appendix A: Adaptive Management

Cells will be filled to elevations designated in the design plan. Knowledge of the sediment dynamics will
be incorporated in restoration design. The elevations of the marsh will be dynamic. Physical gradients and
marsh vegetation influence the maintenance of marsh elevation. This is where climate change impacts
occur and need to be monitored. Sea level rise will obliterate the marsh if elevations are not dynamic; the
system must be accreting more than the water level is rising. Lateral erosion is intrinsic to marshes and
part of their dynamic processes (Temmerman et al. 2003). Within this category there are a number of
marsh features that can be measured, such as accretion rates, elevation change, and elevation of channels
(NPS 2013).
An ideal reference marsh would be (1) located in the same region so that they shared broad scale
environmental factors; (2) managed by the NPS so that decisions, relations, and processes would be
similar and relevant to establishing feasibility; and (3) tidal wetland systems similar to the ecosystem. It
was determined that the marshes of Piscataway Park are the best for control and reference monitoring
since they meet the three criteria and are also within the same tidal area of the Potomac River. The
marshes at Piscataway Park were selected because they are on the Potomac River and are freshwater tidal
marshes with similar vegetation. They contain hydrologic conditions similar to what were found at Dyke
Marsh historically. The park is also part of the national park system.

Reference Marsh
The park will confer with National Capital Parks – East before establishing the marsh as a reference for
the restoration of Dyke Marsh. There are 50 vegetation plot Global Positioning System (GPS) points in
Piscataway Park. LIDAR was flown in 2008. SETs will need to be added to the marsh and sampling
design established.

Study Area
Dyke Marsh, George Washington Memorial Parkway, Virginia and Piscataway Marsh, National Capital
Parks – East, Maryland

Sampling Frequency and Replication
Final temporal and spatial design of sampling will depend on the restoration design and process.
Monitoring of marsh restorations to direct adaptive management should continue for at least 10 years
following completion of the restoration, and preferably for decades (Mitsch and Wilson 1996). There
should be a timeframe component to the success criteria because marsh characteristics will change over
time, especially during the first few years. It can take a number of years for channels and elevations to
stabilize (NPS 2013).

SAMPLING METHODS
Hydrology (Water Level)
Hydrology and duration of flooding are important indicators to be monitored, because the data collected
may reveal the causes behind changes in vegetation over time and will allow the restoration team to
determine how to adjust the restored system. For example, if soils become too anaerobic and that
corresponds to frequent flooding, then the team may take steps to change the flooding regime. The
duration or percent of time that the marsh is flooded (frequency), and not the depth of the flooding, is the
best indicator of the vegetation that will become established (NPS 2013).

A continuous water level recorder consisting of a data logger and pressure transducer is present at the
Belle Haven Marina. Additional continuous water level loggers may be installed along each transect and
at the existing SET locations. All loggers could be set to record at the same time every hour, providing an
hourly inundation map of the marsh.

Geomorphology (Elevation and Erosion/Accretion)
Monitoring geomorphology includes measurements of accretion, elevation change, channel development,
and topography. Measuring elevation and accretion can be used to determine if the marsh is keeping up
with sea level rise. For elevation, there can be a range of elevations, and presumably there will be a
gradient of elevations in the restored marsh. The differences in elevation will dictate plant community and
diversity, which will determine the quality of habitat for marsh wildlife. It is also important to establish
heterogeneity in elevation. A way to monitor elevation is to get photo-documentation of shrubs from
shallow to deep water. The design plan will include a view of the different elevation zones that the
restoration team will try to create, and monitoring of elevation and hydrology should follow that plan.
Monitoring will occur with repeated elevation measurements (NPS 2013). It is also important to look at
channel development to ensure it is not eroding. In terms of topography, horizontal accretion may also be
monitored. A topographic map will be generated for Dyke Marsh, and it was suggested that a tide gauge
be placed in the vicinity of the marsh (NPS 2013).

Accretion
Sediment accretion is measured using marker horizons and either cryogenic corers or the “marsh plug”
method. Both these techniques are described in detail at the USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center
SET web site http://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/resshow/cahoon/. Start time of SET installation and sampling
will depend on settlement of the dredge slurry material. Initially the SET and accretion may be sampled
four times per year, which may be reduced to twice per year as the marsh develops. For robust statistical
analysis of the SET, readings across a full 20-year tidal pattern are necessary.

Elevation
Marsh sediment elevation change is measured using SETs (Cahoon et al. 2000; Cahoon et al. 2002a;
Cahoon et al. 2002b; Cahoon and Lynch 2010). A millimeter scale may be required to measure the
marsh’s response to sea level rise which SETs provide.
Existing 9 SETs in Dyke Marsh were installed following standard peer-reviewed methods as described by
Cahoon and others (Cahoon et al. 2000; Cahoon et al. 2002 a; Cahoon et al. 2002b; Cahoon and Lynch
2010). The tables are currently read twice a year, following standard methods (Cahoon et al. 2000;
Cahoon et al. 2002a; Cahoon et al. 2002b; Cahoon and Lynch 2010). Data are maintained by National
Capital Region Inventory and Monitoring Network and Northeast Coastal and Barrier Inventory and
Monitoring Network. Analyses and reports are forthcoming. SET already exist in the marsh and will
continue to be monitored National Capital Region Inventory and Monitoring Network, and Northeast
Coastal and Barrier Inventory and Monitoring Network. The park will be given the data annually.
Currently, Dyke Marsh has baseline elevation mapping and hypsography.

Appendix A: Adaptive Management

Soils
The dredge material characteristics will be evaluated by U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, including toxin
levels, particle size analysis, and consolidation rates before restoring the site. There is a danger of
contaminated fill, depending on where dredging occurs.

Salinity
Some tidal freshwater wetlands are seasonally pulsed with salinity (during dry summer months), which
can have effects on vegetation. Currently, the salt wedge is 36 miles (58 km) south of Dyke Marsh. The
upstream movement of the salt wedge in the Potomac River is a strong possibility with sea level rise and
climate change. Continuous logging conductivity meters are already deployed at Piscataway Park on the
Potomac River in Maryland and Fort Hunt on the Potomac River in Virginia downstream of Dyke Marsh.
It may be useful to install an additional logger in Dyke Marsh.

Vegetation
Sampling design in Dyke Marsh would consist of a series of transects from upland to the water’s edge.
Transects would be extended out to water’s edge as the marsh is expanded during the phased restoration.
Sampling will occur at the current nine SET locations and along with additional transects beginning in the
upland area and extending towards the river inserted as needed. Traditionally, marsh sampling runs from
the water to the upland, but due to the phased construction of the marsh, it is better to extend the transects
at the water’s edge as cells are added. Additional transects will be added as marsh restoration proceeds.
Effective sample size can be determined through a combination of consideration of power analysis for
change detection and consideration of the scale of the restoration, the amount of variability across the site
and practical limits of cost and labor (Turner et al. 2013b).
The locations of each transect and of plots along each transect will be established by a random-systematic
design. To monitor plant community changes over time baseline latitude, longitude and elevation
measurements will be made using survey grade GPS to achieve cm scale accuracy. Data points are taken
from the marsh until there is a shift in the primary or secondary species present. GPS will be used to mark
the location and elevation of plant community changes along transects. Using the data from previous
years, each transect will be revisited in subsequent years and major changes in plant communities will be
documented (Kreeger et al. 2012).
Suggested variables to measure for the plant community assemblage are species present, invasive species,
percent cover by species, and stem height for the first 25 stems and light intensity at the sediment surface
was recorded. When present, the extent of invasive nonnative species and state rare river bulrush will be
GPS mapped.
Observations of submerged aquatic vegetation will be made as opportunities arise, given tidal stage and
location of transects, but will not be part of structured monitoring program.

DATA MANAGEMENT, ANALYSIS, AND REPORTING
There needs to be a plan for long-term data management for all areas monitored. One searchable database
for all the monitoring data is needed for George Washington Memorial Parkway. Data collection,
management, analysis and reporting will follow the National Capital Region Inventory and Monitoring
Network data management plan where applicable (geographic information system (GIS), GPS, metadata,
NPS reporting standards, upload of databases and documents to Integrated Resource Management

Monitoring the restoration and reference sites with the same methods, intensity, and frequency allow for
paired comparison of the trajectories of the restored and reference site. However, the lack of replicates for
either site can be problematic (Turner et al. 2013b). Conquest (2000) provides some guidance on how to
deal with this statistically.

Hydrology (Water Level)
Management Action
This is not monitored at many restoration sites, although it is a major marsh feature.
Action Thresholds
Inundation at key vegetation community interfaces does not support desired species.
Management Responses
Adjust marsh elevation or remove obstacles to flow.

Geomorphology (Elevation and Erosion/Accretion)
Management Action
All of the projects that involved dredge material placement conducted studies on some dredge material
characteristics including toxin levels, particle size analysis, and consolidation rates before restoring the
site. After restoration, Poplar Island did not study the dredge material consolidation rates, which would
have been helpful. Elevations at Kenilworth Marsh restoration were higher than desired, which may have
enhanced the spread of invasive nonnative species. Measured components of soils may include organic
matter content and metal content (NPS 2013).
Action Thresholds
Are marsh elevations maintained over time?
Can sediment accretion rates maintain the biodiversity of the marsh?
Management Responses
Use adaptive management to gain management experience regarding the elevation of the new marsh.
Adaptive adjustments to monitoring metrics and management responses will be made based on
information gained through surveillance and the effects of management actions on marsh biodiversity.

Salinity
Management Action
Follow marsh restoration design plan. Conductivity and salinity are mathematically related. Measuring
conductivity serves as a surrogate for salinity.

Final Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and Long-term Management Plan / EIS

229

Appendix A: Adaptive Management

Action Thresholds
Conductivity above--uS/cm indicates salinity that would impact vegetation community.
Management Responses
Adjust expectations for community composition of Dyke Marsh. It will not resemble the historic marsh in
species composition.

Vegetation
Management Actions
Measurements include species composition, species richness, cover, and invasive nonnative species
abundance. The list of perennial species should be similar to those of reference sites, but there may be
differences in relative abundance. For example, there may be more cattail in the restored area of Dyke
Marsh when compared to the existing marsh. It is also important to have annual species as part of the
vegetation index. Plant cover is a good index of production and of ecosystem function. The NPS should
use the existing marsh as reference for invasive nonnative species because a restored wetland may not
remain free of nonnative species, and the nonnative species content may never fall below that of the
existing marsh (NPS 2013).
Storm surge (wind-induced waves) can start erosion in the marsh and create abrupt edges or cleared
mudflats unprotected by vegetation. Further vegetation-sediment destabilization feedback can occur by
excessive herbivory by geese, for example. Fenced exclosures will be used in Dyke Marsh to prevent
herbivory by geese, for example, in low elevation areas, especially mudflats.
The colonization of newly created wetlands will occur within the first growing season of substrate
creation. Following restoration plan design, available cells will be planted if funding allows as soon as
elevation goals are reached and slurry has consolidated. If funds are not available, it is anticipated that
plants will start growing during the first growing season from seedbank and other propagules. Many
plants use vegetative reproduction, e.g., rhizomes, once they are established. This will promote a
heterogeneous restored wetland and reduce the likelihood of invasive nonnative species establishing.
Tidal creeks and guts are major sources of plant propagules.
Action Thresholds
What is the change in vegetation over time? Will species richness of the newly created marsh match the
older established marsh?
Management Response
The species mix should remain approximately 98 percent native. Restoring the tidal freshwater marsh and
associated habitats may take a long time, possibly as much as 30 years. If species that are dominant in the
old marsh are missing, George Washington Memorial Parkway may want to plant those species into the
restoration area and find out whether propagules are present. Species richness should be similar to the
reference site.
Action Threshold
Will problem areas with no or low plant establishment be vulnerable to nonnative invasive species?

230

George Washington Memorial Parkway

Appendix A: Adaptive Management

Management Response
When invasive nonnative species are present, they must be a high priority for removal. Replanting the
area after control treatments of exotics may be necessary. Implement design and management measures to
manage the spread of nonnative invasive plants. Treat invasive nonnative species three times per year,
especially when invasive exotic plants are vulnerable or before fruiting. Assess and monitor the
effectiveness of treatment within each treated area and retreat as needed. Replant as needed. Protect from
herbivores.
Action Threshold
Does the distribution of state rare plants expand into new areas of the marsh?
Management Response
Assisting the recovery of special status and other species through the restoration of ecosystem function
and associated habitats. State imperiled river bulrush (Bolboschoenus fluviatilis, G5, S2) may move to
newly created habitat, depending on marsh elevation. It is distributed within the existing Dyke Marsh and
is likely to propagate downstream into newly created marsh.

APPENDIX D: PUBLIC COMMENT ANALYSIS REPORT
Introduction
Pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), its implementing regulations, and National
Park Service (NPS) guidance on meeting NEPA obligations, Dyke Marsh Wildlife Preserve and George
Washington Memorial Parkway must consider comments submitted on the Draft Long-term Management
Plan and Environmental Impact Statement (draft plan/EIS), and provide responses to concerns raised in
these comments. This report describes how the NPS considered public comments and provides responses
to substantive comments that were received.
On January 15, 2014, the NPS published a Notice of Availability (NOA) in the Federal Register for the
draft plan/EIS. The 60-day public comment period was open through March 18, 2014. The public
comment period was announced on the project website, posted on the park website, and announced
through a press release. The draft plan/EIS was available on the Planning, Environment, and Public
Comment (PEPC) website and via hard copy upon request from the park.
Hard copies of the draft plan/EIS were mailed to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and state
review agencies, and a newsletter announcing the release of the draft plan/EIS was sent to interested
parties, elected officials, and other appropriate local and state agencies. A limited number of hard copies
were made available at Martha Washington Library and Sherwood Hall Regional Library in Fairfax
County. Members of the public were able to submit their comments on the project through the PEPC
website and by mailing comments to the park.

Public Meetings
During the review period, a public meeting was held at the Washington Sailing Marina on February 26,
2014. During the meeting, information on the draft plan/EIS was provided and community feedback was
solicited.
A total of 100 individuals attended the meeting. The meeting began with an open house, followed by a
welcome from the superintendent and a presentation by the NPS EIS project manager. NPS staff was on
hand to visit with meeting attendees and to answer questions. Comment cards were distributed as well as
a newsletter describing key elements of the draft plan/EIS.

Methodology
During the comment period, 313 letters (pieces of correspondence) were received. All letters that were
submitted outside of the PEPC system were entered into PEPC. All comments, regardless of their topic,
were carefully read and analyzed and specific comments within each correspondence were identified. A
total of 621 comments were derived from the correspondences received.

Final Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and Long-term Management Plan / EIS

261

Appendix D: Public Comment Analysis Report

A coding structure was developed to help sort comments into logical groups by topics and issues. During
coding, comments were classified as substantive or non-substantive. A substantive comment is defined in
the NPS Director’s Order 12 Handbook as one that does one or more of the following (Director’s Order
12 Handbook, Section 4.6A):


Questions, with reasonable basis, the accuracy of information presented in the EIS;



Questions, with reasonable basis, the adequacy of the environmental analysis;



Presents reasonable alternatives other than those presented in the EIS; and/or



Causes changes or revisions in the proposal.

As further stated in the Director’s Order 12 Handbook, substantive comments “raise, debate, or question a
point of fact or policy. Comments in favor of or against the proposed action or alternatives, or comments
that only agree or disagree with NPS policy are not considered substantive.” Although all comments were
read, considered, and used to help create the final plan/EIS, only those determined to be substantive were
analyzed for creation of concern statements for response from the NPS, as described below.
Forty-eight codes were used to categorize all the comments received on the draft plan/EIS. An example of
a code developed for this project is AL11000: Alternatives: Elements Common to All Action Alternatives Construction Approach for Containment Cells. In some cases, the same comment may be categorized
under more than one code because the comment may contain more than one issue or idea. Under each
code, all substantive comments were grouped by similar themes, and those groups were summarized with
a concern statement. For example, under the code AE6100: Affected Environment: Vegetation, one
concern statement was “Commenters suggested that more detailed information about existing vegetation
in the project area be disclosed in the plan/EIS, including information on existing invasive species, and
submerged aquatic vegetation.” This one concern statement captured several comments. Following each
concern statement are one or more “representative quotes,” which are comments taken from the
correspondences to illustrate the issue, concern, or idea expressed by the comments grouped under that
concern statement.
Primary terms used in this document are defined below.
Correspondence: A correspondence is the entire document received from a commenter. It can be in the
form of a letter, email, written comment form, note card, or PEPC entry. Each piece of correspondence is
assigned a unique identification number in the PEPC system.
Comment: A comment is a portion of the text within a correspondence that addresses a single subject. It
should include information such as an expression of support or opposition to the use of a potential
management tool, additional data regarding an existing condition, or an opinion debating the adequacy of
the analysis.
Code: A grouping centered on a common subject. The codes were developed during the scoping process
and are used to track major subjects throughout the EIS process.
Concern Statement: Concern statements are a written summary of all comments received under a
particular code. Some codes were further separated into several concern statements to provide a better
focus on the content of the comment.

Appendix D: Public Comment Analysis Report

Guide to this Document
This report is organized as follows.
Content Analysis Report: This is the basic report produced from PEPC, which provides information on
the numbers and types of comments received, organized by code and by various demographics. The first
section is a summary of the number of comments in each code or topic, and the percentage of comments
in each code. Note that those coded XX1000 – Duplicate Correspondence/Comment represent comments
that were entered into the system twice; these are not additional comments.
Data show the number of correspondences received by organization type, and by state.
Concern Response Report: This report summarizes the substantive comments received during the draft
plan/EIS public review comment process. These comments are organized by codes and further
consolidated into concern statements. Representative quotes are then provided for each concern statement.
A response is provided for each concern statement.
Copies of Correspondence from all Agencies, Organizations, and Businesses: This appendix contains
copies of correspondences that were received during the comment period from all entities (government,
organizations, businesses, etc.) excluding those received from individual commenters (unaffiliated
individuals).

Representative Quote: The NPS cannot support a construct where the
outer edge is maintained/retained by sheet piling or other berm structure
consistent with partial restoration. The only long term viable configuration
that meets a natural steady state is a gradual tapering from the current edge
ALL THE WAY to the non-dredged Potomac River bottom. This may/will
likely mean that the COE should/MUST be encouraged as part of the
restoration to receive permission from the State of Maryland to perform
minor filling OUTSIDE the NPS boundary. Marsh restoration cannot stop
at the NPS boundary because that would leave an unstable perched status.
Yes, NPS planning cannot deal with this directly since not NPS lands, but
the COE can and should. The COE needs to be an active 'GIVING'/
contributing component of the restoration, not just taking ($$).

Representative Quote: The DEIS excludes consideration of incorporating
intertidal habitat that lies immediately outside of the NPS Dyke Marsh
boundary to the north (and which potentially could be brought under NPS
protection). This exclusion disregards the potential benefits of taking
advantage of natural wetland development that is
(1) already occurring as a consequence of the irreversibly altered
hydrologic and hydrodynamic regimes, and
(2) substantially reduces the quantities of suitable sediment that would be
needed to establish marsh habitat at less cost to the taxpayers. The DEIS
should seriously assess incorporating the emerging wetlands to the north
with stabilizing and restoring existing marsh and uplands, retention of
existing open water areas and physical structure, and arrangements with the
marina concessionaire that would enable long-term investment in that
facility and its launching ramp and access channel. This concept has
potential to fully achieve 4 restoration objectives while minimizing
restoration project impacts to fisheries habitat within the overall NPS
jurisdictional area, and to recreational boating, fishing, and duck hunting
users of the Dyke Marsh area.

Final Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and Long-term Management Plan / EIS

267

Appendix D: Public Comment Analysis Report

RESPONSE:

In chapter 2, (page 44 of the plan/EIS), the section “Natural Edges on the
Outermost Extent of the Containment Cells” describes the proposed
conceptual design for the edge of the marsh leading up to the NPS
jurisdictional boundary. The marsh will not end in a perched condition, but
will grade gradually underwater toward the edge of the boundary. The
exception is the places where dredging created noticeably deeper water
within and at the edge of NPS boundaries, and there may be the need for a
sill, or possibly a hardened toe at the edge of the 20:1 slope to maximize
restored areas. These edges would still be underwater, and not visible, and
the toe of the steeper slope may be hardened with riprap or other similar
materials. Maximizing the area under the 20:1 slope would allow as much
submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) to colonize as possible. Clarifying text
has been added to pages 44 and 45 of chapter 2 in the plan/EIS. It is
expected that low marsh vegetation will colonize the shallow edge and
SAV will become established in deeper water leading into the river channel.
The NPS cannot construct outside of its jurisdictional boundary, and the
focus of the proposed marsh restoration is on the acres of wetland that were
lost within the area owned and managed by the NPS. However, it is
expected that the ecological benefits provided by the marsh, once
established, will extend beyond NPS boundaries.
Marsh and wetland habitat to the north of Dyke Marsh is outside the project
area and outside NPS jurisdiction, and it is therefore not included for
restoration consideration in this plan/EIS.

Representative Quote: My main concern with the DEIS is that it excludes
a section of the Dyke Marsh Preserve that is managed by NPS and located
adjacent to River Towers. That section wasn't included in the alternatives
and it was cut out of the maps provided at the public meeting. This
exclusion prevents the DEIS from providing a detailed and thorough
analysis of alternatives for the restoration and long-term management of the
marsh and other associated wetland habitats lost or impacted in Dyke
Marsh Preserve. Thus, DEIS the does not meet the National Environmental

Policy Act's requirement to provide a full range of alternatives. At the very
least, the DEIS should have provided an explanation as to why it excluded
an alternative that would have addressed the long-term management of that
part of the marsh.
RESPONSE:

The area adjacent to River Towers is not part of the area that was lost or
impacted by past dredging, therefore it was not considered as part of the
marsh that needed to be restored and is not part of the purpose, need, or
scope of the plan. Proposed downstream restoration of hydrology at the
mouth of Hog Island Gut would serve to protect the habitats of the marsh
west of the parkway by River Towers.
The mudflats by Hunting Creek and Cameron Run are outside the
jurisdiction of the NPS, and are not within the scope of the plan.

Representative Quote: additional information should be provided about
the reference marsh in Piscataway Park and why it is appropriate to use for
this project.
RESPONSE:

Piscataway Park marsh was selected as a reference marsh for several
reasons, including the following:


It is located on the same river and shares similar environmental
conditions, including salinity, water quality, and vegetation; it is the
closest freshwater tidal marsh to Dyke Marsh along the Potomac
River.
 It is managed by the NPS, therefore, decisions relating to marsh
management would be similar, and research can be readily
conducted and overseen by the NPS.
 Its freshwater tidal vegetation is very similar to that of Dyke Marsh.
The marsh is dominated by a similar narrowleaf cattail community
and contains the state-imperiled river bulrush.
The text has been modified in chapter 2 (on page 47 of the plan/EIS) and
appendix A (page 224 of the plan/EIS) to elaborate on the reasons that
Piscataway Park was proposed as the reference marsh.

Bay.
RESPONSE:

270

The Dyke Marsh area is part of the Chesapeake Bay watershed, and
restoration of this area would support goals of Executive Order 13508,
“Chesapeake Bay Protection and Restoration.” Executive Order 13508 was
established in 2009 and calls on the federal government to lead an effort to
restore and protect the nation’s largest estuary and its watershed. The NPS
would coordinate with state and federal agencies that are involved in
Chesapeake Bay initiatives, as described in the consultation section of
chapter 5. As described on page 29 in chapter 1 of the plan/EIS, Executive
Order 13508 directs federal agencies to lead the effort in restoring and
protecting the bay and to share leadership, planning, and accountability
while restoring bay water quality and protecting the bay as climate changes.
The NPS, in proposing restoration of Dyke Marsh and working in
consultation with many agencies during the preparation of the EIS (which
will continue into the permitting process), is taking the lead in an effort to
restore and protect the bay and sharing planning responsibilities with other
agencies. The habitat improvements that will occur as part of the restoration
will contribute to fulfilling the intent of the executive order. The discussion
of Executive Order 13508 in chapter 1 (page 30 of the plan/EIS) notes that
the acres to be restored will contribute to the goal of restoring 4,000 acres
of wetlands per year.

Representative Quote: 1 0) A comprehensive approach to anticipating
conditions encountered during construction and implementing appropriate,
effective controls to minimize adverse impacts should be included.
RESPONSE:

It would be preferable to install the containment cells prior to storm or
hurricane season (from June through November), although storms tend to
occur most frequently in August and September. However, timing of the
containment cell construction will be determined during the permitting
process, and restrictions will be dictated largely by avoidance of
disturbance to wildlife and fisheries, and permits would include
requirements for prevention and clean-up of spills that could occur during
storms or normal operations. The anadromous fish spawning season is
typically from mid-April through June. The spawning season for the
shortnose sturgeon is February 15 to June 30. Other anadromous fish
species that spawn during this period need to be considered. Text about
shortnose and Atlantic sturgeon spawning season has been added to
chapter 4 (page 158 of the plan/EIS). In addition, various bird species have
nesting seasons in the spring.
Schedules for implementing construction cannot be determined at this time,
but will be completed as the design and construction processes proceed.
Installation of the breakwater and completion of phase 1 of alternative C
would proceed as standalone projects. However, factors such as the
availability of funds and materials would affect the overall implementation
schedule.

to create some narrow channels to create waterfront within these stands of
cattail. The purpose for these features is to provide favorable conditions for
nesting marsh wren territories, a species that historically nested here in the
100s. Marsh wren males of the historic Potomac River population defend
territories that are at least .25 acres, contain dense stands of narrow-leaved
cattail, front on a protected tidal water source (such as tidal guts, channels,
rivulets), and are well away from uplands containing tall tree or forest to
avoid land based predators.
RESPONSE:

As discussed in chapter 2 (page 44 of the plan/EIS), narrowleaf cattail
(Typha angustifolia) is one of the primary high marsh plant species that will
be planted. Due to the relatively long and narrow shapes of the restoration
cells (meant to augment existing marsh), new channels or guts would not be
cut under alternative B, but would be cut under alternative C, where the
cells would be much larger.

Representative Quote: 3. The document does state that as SAV habitat is
filled by contained marsh creation cells, additional SAV habitat will result.
But it is not specified how shallow water habitat can be successfully created
or stabilized outside of the marsh cells, or how directly this will be actively
managed versus targeted through passive management only. It is also not
specified how shallow open water habitat is accounted for if maximum
marsh creation is achieved (i.e. will there still be significant SAV habitat
remaining, and is there any assurance that a significant and stable
transitional zone between cell containment structures and deeper water can
be achieved).
RESPONSE:

Chapter 2 (pages 41–46 of the plan/EIS) describes the revegetation
approach that will be used to restore Dyke Marsh, including construction of
the containment cells. Although revegetation of submerged aquatic
vegetation (SAV) beds is not the primary goal of this project, it is assumed
that SAV would become established in the outer edges of the containment
cells based on the engineering design. These areas would not be actively
managed under the current adaptive management protocols, but would be
observed during monitoring. Text was added to pages 45 and 47 to clarify
these points. (See also response to concern 50678.)

sediment during construction and storm events. While we understand that
BMPs will be followed, explanation of activities should be expanded.
RESPONSE:

Although restoration of the hydrological connections behind the Haul Road
is important, the open marsh areas are currently much less stable than that
area, and there are places where breaches could occur between the outer
edge of the marsh and the walls of Hog Island Gut (refer to the discussion
on page 47 in chapter 2 of the plan/EIS). Therefore, the priority for marsh
restoration is to first stabilize the open marsh areas by constructing the
breakwater and augmenting emergent marsh adjacent to the existing marsh.
Current funding will be directed toward these priorities.
The number of breaks in the Haul Road will be determined at a later stage
of the design. Breaks will be designed to most effectively reestablish the
hydrologic connections. Currently, it is expected that there will be two to
three breaks in the road, although final design will determine the exact
number. Page 47 of the plan/EIS has been revised to reflect this estimate.
Best management practices will be followed to ensure that the release of
sediment during construction is avoided.

 The NPS might also be required to mitigate unavoidable impacts to
submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) as a result of the permitting
process for the project, although it is expected that the SAV would
recolonize itself in areas with appropriate conditions (appropriate
water depth, clarity, etc.). Under alternative C, current SAV would be

first if funds were available. This is similar to alternative B where actions
would be dictated by availability of funding. Filling the deep scars would
also be factored into the priority process. In general, as stated in the

by constructing the breakwater and creating additional cells adjacent to
existing marsh, as illustrated most clearly in figure 2-8 (in chapter 2, page
53 of the plan/EIS). Pending available funding, the breakwater would be
constructed first because it would provide protection to the marsh by
reorienting flows. The second priority would be to stabilize the marsh
where the walls of Hog Island Gut are becoming narrower and are in danger

Representative Quote: The proposed plan looks good, but it needs more
explicit language to maintain boating viability and water access to and from
the main channel and river for the marina, docks, boat ramp, and mooring
areas at the northern end of Dyke Marsh. If sediments continue to build up
under the prefered plan, they could impinge on depths around these boating
areas. This is unacceptable. If necessary, there should be dredging of these
boating areas to maintain their activities. Or even go further to build a
barrier, such as a breakwater, to protect water depths for these activities.

Representative Quote: Porto Vecchio Condominium (PVC) requests to be
included in the scope of work for the Dyke Marsh Restoration Plan. Options
B and C both include the use of acceptable dredged materials to fill in and
restore the marsh. Pending core sampling and acceptable analytical sample
characteristics of its waterfront area, PVC requests to be included among the
dredging sites considered suitable for contributing dredged materials to the
restoration.
The Porto Vecchio waterfront is adjacent to Dyke Marsh and provides a costeffective transfer of dredged material to the restoration.
PVC is a residential waterfront property located at the mouth of Hunting
Creek, about one mile north of Dyke Marsh. Before PVC was built, the
property had a marina (Hunting Towers Marina) with riparian rights that
transferred through the deed to PVC. The area where the marina was located
is now the waterfront for PVC. This area has been greatly impacted by "The
outfall of Hunting Creek and Cameron Run into the Potomac River [which]
has been altered by the development of the George Washington Memorial
Parkway, urbanization within the watershed, the development of a golf
course along the creek and parkway, and upstream channelization. The
sediment load from Hunting Creek, which was once carried toward the marsh
and helped maintain a depositional environment, is now deposited mostly
north of the marsh at the creek's confluence with the Potomac River, where
mudflats and emergent wetlands are beginning to develop" (draft Plan/EIS,
pp. ii-iii).

An added benefit of including PVC and its dredged material in the
restoration work could be to address the flooding issues upstream in the
Huntington Community that may be mitigated if the sediment build-up at the

Representative Quote: 2) According to the proposal, the outer edge of the
proposed restoration cells will be protected, initially with either geotubes
and/ or vinyl sheet pile. Then removed or drive down after the marsh has
been established. This will leave the new marsh edge vulnerable to wind
driven wave especially during storms even if it is well established.
Freshwater marsh, especially low marsh, has a weak ability to bind the soil
from my experience relative to a salt marsh. Once the (sand) fill is exposed to
wave action it will reside on a much lesser slope say a 10:1 not the 3:1
proposed. I would recommend leaving portions of the vinyl sheet pile at
varying (and higher) levels, to accommodate the wave forces (i.e. headlands
and pocket beaches). Keep in mind floating woody debris is still and issue

Representative Quote: The consideration of Concept B with additional
adjustments to the wetland creation aspects during continued planning, but
designed to still result in far less open water fill than Concept C, could be
considered as a "hybrid" approach. This approach would replenish and
stabilize the shoreline, thereby preventing wetland loss, and would include
construction of the promontory structure. This hybrid option should prevent
wetland loss due to winds and storms and supports wetland creation,
resulting in increased available habitat for marsh birds, vegetation, and
insects while minimizing habitat loss to aquatic life and maintains boat
access via Belle Haven Marina. Potential post restoration benefits for Dyke
Marsh also include increased primary production, nutrient cycling and
improved water quality.
RESPONSE:

New alternative elements suggested during the public review of the draft
plan/EIS have been considered as follows:




280

Preserving the ability to operate small non-powered sailing
vessels: There will be no change to the plan/EIS, because the planned
restoration includes retaining open water in various locations. There
will continue to be open water around the marina, and small sailing
vessels and other nonmotorized craft will still be able to operate in the
open water off the marsh edges. No changes have been made to the
plan/EIS.

considered suitable for contributing dredged materials to the
restoration: The NPS is maintaining a list of potential sources for
future dredge spoil material. However, determining the sources for
such material will depend on timing for implementation of the project.
Sources for dredge spoil are therefore not included in the plan/EIS.
Leaving vinyl sheet piling in place: This will not be considered
further. It would not create a natural looking marsh, and could create a
navigation hazard. The intent is to create a dynamic marsh without
permanent hard edges.
A “hybrid” approach, that would replenish and stabilize the shoreline,
and would include construction of the promontory and augmentation
of the marsh along the lines of alternative B: The NPS considered a
range of approaches to restoration, and the hybrid approach suggested
appears to be an approach that the NPS considered and dismissed as a
standalone alternative (see item 5 on page 72 in chapter 2 of the
plan/EIS). This approach is similar to alternative B. The proposed
deep channel (open water) fill is needed to create the promontory. No
change was made to the plan/EIS.
Addressing the removal of large chunks of concrete and rebar
waste that have been dumped in the marsh: Removing large pieces
of concrete from the marsh would not further or better accomplish
restoration goals, and their presence would not interfere with the
restoration or be sources of contamination. Therefore, actions to
address the removal of the concrete and rebar waste have not been
included in the plan/EIS.
Maintaining boating viability and water access to and from the main
channel and river for the marina, docks, boat ramp, and mooring areas
at the northern end of Dyke Marsh: The restoration would not impede
access to the marina or preclude any dredging of the access channel to
the marina. Dredging in the marina is not within the scope of this
plan/EIS. The concessioner for the marina would be responsible for
the costs of dredging.
Providing launch sites for kayaks, canoes, and small sailboats in
the area: No access points for small craft would be removed as a
result of implementing this plan/EIS. No additional access points
would be added because providing additional launch sites for small
craft is not within the scope of this plan/EIS.

The NPS is not only the leaseholder to the concessionaire (in this case Belle
Haven Marina) but also sets the lease requirements, insurance minimums,
and defines what is or is not economic viability. This appears to be a major
conflict of interest since it would provide the NPS the sole authority to
determine whether or not the marina was economically viable. With that
authority, the concessionaire could be denied renewal of the lease at any
time based on the desires of the NPS, regardless of the true 'economic

Restoration and Long Term Management Plan and in particular language
contained in Alternative C, the Preferred Alternative presented by the
National Park Service (NPS). Preserving and maintaining Belle Haven
Marina is a top community concern and implementation of Alternative C
does not clearly state the continued operation of this business.
Dyke Marsh and Belle Haven Marina are both popular recreation
destinations and a critical launching and mooring field for boaters in the
Washington area. The two destinations are from a geographical sense,
bound to each other. The marina provides a boat ramp, slips, sailboat rental,
paddle craft rental and launch, and a sailing school. Area residents launch
boats and paddle craft to fish, bird-watch and enjoy the wildlife fostered by

the Chesapeake Bay Foundations Potomac River Program which teaches
youth conservation and preservation.
The vitality of both Dyke Marsh and Belle Haven Marina rely on a
balanced management plan that fosters the sustainability of the marsh and
the economic viability of the marina. However, current language contained
in Alternative C could curtail or eliminate marina operations. This language
should be removed from Alternative C:
This alternative contains an optional 20-acre restoration cell in the area
currently serving as mooring for the marina. Such an option would only be

Representative Quote: Given this valuation of diverse, varied habitat, as
well as transitional zones of shallow and deeper water, we observe that
Alternative B, or a hybrid Alternative between B and C that does not
maximize the placement of wetland cells and provides for ample shallow
water and deep water trough habitat, better suits the adaptive management
approaches and overall project goal. While it might be argued that
Alternative C promotes the adaptive management approach and phasing, it
is strongly implied throughout the document that maximum marsh creation
provides the greatest project value, which would make it more difficult to
end at a marsh, shallow water, and deep water habitat balance that is short
of full restoration under Alternative C. We recommend that Alternative C
could be qualified to allow for more monitoring and analysis of all habitat
types in the study area, and defined future decision points, to determine
final extent of the marsh creation, to include potentially ending at an interim
phase, if ecologically warranted.
RESPONSE:

Adaptive management is incorporated into the plan/EIS and would be
implemented under either alternative B or C. The monitoring that would
occur under the adaptive management plan is currently proposed to include
water level, marsh elevation and erosion/accretion, and vegetation. These
parameters will serve as surrogates for monitoring all habitat types and will
guide the continued restoration of the marsh. The intent of alternative C is
to restore the marsh to its historic extent as much as possible, and to replace
the wetland functions and processes lost through sand and gravel mining

the results of the monitoring and the success in establishing the first cells.
As noted in table 2-5 in chapter 2 (page 57 of the plan/EIS), the additional

Representative Quote: We are concerned that by indicating Alternative C
as the Preferred Alternative so definitively at this time, a pre-determination
of the ultimate target for this area is set in stone, before more detailed
analysis is presented or completed. The very short direct justification of
Alternative C as the Preferred Alternative (page 74 of the DEIS), far oversimplifies the difficult resource management challenges of optimizing the
success of restoration practices and balancing restoration with conservation
of existing natural resources.
2. Given that we support marsh restoration activities and its associated
benefits, we want to follow our comments above with specific examples. As
we commented in 2012, the complex of existing aquatic habitat in the area
includes shallow open waters (habitat for SAV and fish spawning for
certain species) and nearby deeper troughs (refugia and routes of fish
movement) that are off the main river channel. Being adjacent to existing
marsh habitat and tidal guts, this provides a highly diverse and valuable
habitat complex. The document makes an excellent case for a certain degree
of marsh restoration, likely on a yet to be determined scale. The marsh is at
risk until stabilized and protected, and expansion of the marsh and related
structures will help to provide this protection. But at maximum restoration
potential under Alternative C, it is still unclear whether adequate SAV
habitat will remain or be created, and whether the loss of off-channel deep
water habitat will have a permanent negative effect on fisheries.

associated with Alternative C to be conceptual in nature; much of what is
envisioned to occur under this alternative is dependent upon success of
projects implemented under Alternative 8, and integration of new
restoration practices developed through time. Although DGIF understands
the lack of project details and generally supports this marsh restoration
initiative, DGIF is unable to fully evaluate or render a determination of
consistency for Alternative C without significant additional information and
details regarding the proposed restoration activities. In particular, DGIF has
unresolved concerns regarding the potential loss of deepwater habitats and
recreational boating access that may be inherent in Alternative C.

Alternative B, which include construction of a breakwater to re-direct the
flow of Hog Island Gut northward to encourage accretion upstream,
reconnecting hydrology to bottom land forest through the creation of breaks
in Haul Road, and efforts to stabilize stream and wetland systems within the
marsh. Alternative C, the Preferred Alternative, includes all of the activities
in Alternative B plus considerable additional wetland restoration to historic
extents. We would like to provide support for such efforts, but do not
believe we have enough detail about the placement and management of
structures, the source of fill materials, success criteria, monitoring, and
long-term management to do so at this time. In order for us to fully consider
the impacts and benefits to wildlife resources and wildlife-based recreation,

establishing an outer barrier approximately along the historic boundary of
Dyke Marsh and converting offshore open water area to marsh is a
fundamental and substantial issue with respect to resource management and
exercise of jurisdictional authorities. Therefore, without full disclosure and
assessment of the jurisdictional changes, the selection of the preferred
alternative is tainted because it greatly favors NPS jurisdictional issues
which were obviously used as a governing factor rather than environmental
functions as the primary consideration. The issue is that the preferred
alternative would provide the NPS with full jurisdiction over the river
bottom area which it owns by converting to marsh those open water areas
where jurisdiction is currently shared with others including, but not limited

Additionally, I believe that the dredging of Belle Haven Marina and the use

be obtained at the time the restoration is done. Belle Haven Marina may be
a possible source depending on the timing of the project and any dredging
planned for that area.

Representative Quote: 2. Funding. While the DEIS does not mention it,
the National Park Service has received $24.9 million in funding for
restoration of Dyke Marsh. While this is not enough to cover the full cost of
Alternative C, it is far more than the costs of the partial restoration
Alternative B would provide. These funds should carry out the initial phase
of Alternative C and more, although it is not clear how much more. This
should be addressed, as it would indicate how much of Alternative C is
currently feasible from a funding standpoint.
RESPONSE:

The alternatives for the plan/EIS are based on a 10 percent conceptual
design in order to understand and assess potential impacts, and costs were
roughly estimated based on this level of design. Costs will be variable, but
will be refined as design of the selected alternative proceeds. Initial funds
received will help fund both design and initial implementation of the
restoration.

now extant at Broad Creek across the river. So part of the promentory
(composed of deposited sands/gravel) was already gone prior to dredging.
Efforts should be made to make promentory restoration as natural looking

Representative Quote: Given the fragility of the marsh, the Park Service
should first restore the promontory by building the breakwater and then fill
the deep dredging scars along the western shore.
RESPONSE:

Restoration of the promontory to original conditions would require a
prohibitive amount of fill, and as the commenter noted, restoration of the
promontory could be achieved as effectively through the restoration of
emergent marsh with the construction of the breakwater instead. The NPS
evaluated several approaches for constructing the breakwater considering
appearance and how it would affect both the natural and historic features of
the marsh. Construction of the breakwater is a high-priority action and
would occur early in the process. The description of alternative C in chapter
2 (page 48 of the plan/EIS) has been clarified to reflect this. Similar to
alternative B, actions would be dictated by availability of funding.

RESPONSE:

The adaptive management plan outlined in the plan/EIS will remain flexible
as the project moves forward and will be modified to meet project needs
based on data collected during monitoring. Initial monitoring will focus on
vegetation, which serves as an indicator of overall ecosystem function and
restoration success. The adaptive management plan must focus on the key
indicators of success as opposed to individual species, since impacts to
species can change depending on the circumstances of the restoration,
climate change, and sea level rise, etc. The vegetation that will be
monitored will provide information about how well ecological function has
been restored.
Clarification that the adaptive management plan focuses on these key
indicators of success has been added to chapter 2 (page 47) and appendix A

reference the NISMP aside from acknowledging that the NPS is mandated
to follow the plan. The DEIS should include language reflecting how the
Park will fulfill main components of the NISMP, specifically Prevention,
Early Detection & Rapid Response, Control & Management, Restoration,

enable the NPS and the public to better assess the feasibility of invasive
species management.
RESPONSE:

Executive Order 13112 established the National Invasive Species Council
(NISC), which is responsible for establishing guidelines to ensure projects
undertaken or funded by federal agencies minimize the spread of invasive
species. The NISC publishes the National Invasive Species Management
Plan (NISMP) (NISC 2008), which provides federal agencies with guidance
on how to prevent, detect, respond to, and control the spread of invasive
species. Additionally, the NISMP provides guidance for restoring areas
inundated by invasive species.
As a federal agency, the NPS is required to adhere to Executive Order
13112 to the extent practicable. Chapter 4 of the plan/EIS states that the
NPS will continue to monitor for the presence of nonnative invasive species
and work to remove them from Dyke Marsh. Although no direct reference
is made to the NISMP, it is assumed that the NPS will use the methods
described in the NISMP. Text has been added to table 2-1 on page 38, and
on page 45 (chapter 2 of the plan/EIS) to state that the NPS will monitor for
and remove invasive species according to the methods described in the
NISMP (NISC 2008). Discussion of Executive Order 13112, “Invasive

The DEIS contains a simple map showing a few general plant communities

Representative Quote: We recommend a quantitative analysis of the
submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) distribution in the project area and
quantification of any unavoidable SAV impacts.
RESPONSE:

Chapter 3 (pages 85–89 of the plan/EIS) describes the different habitats in
Dyke Marsh. Although a comprehensive list of all the species identified in
Dyke Marsh is not presented, table 3.2 lists the dominant species of
vegetation for each type of vegetation community identified. Furthermore, in
most instances, table 3.2 states whether the dominant species are or are not
mostly nonnative species. In table 3.2, reed grass tidal marsh is identified as
a nonnative species. Providing specific acreage for all of the areas dominated
by nonnative species, as well as comprehensive lists of nonnative species by
vegetation community, would not alter the impact analysis findings of each
of the alternative actions described in chapter 4. Each of the action
alternatives strive to restore Dyke Marsh using native species and
minimizing the spread of nonnative species.
Chapter 3 (page 88 of the plan/EIS) discusses changes in vegetation and
notes that between the 1930s and 1980s, submerged aquatic vegetation
(SAV) suffered a significant decline, with no reported SAV in the 1977 Dyke
Marsh Environmental Assessment. Current levels of SAV coverage in the
marsh have reached 70 to 100 percent but the dominant species consist of
nonnative plants such as hydrilla (Hydrilla verticillata), waternymph (Najas
minor), and common hornwort (Ceratophyllum demersum). Although the
text does not state that the presence of these nonnative SAV species is
detrimental to the environment, it may be inferred by the reader that
nonnative SAV species do not offer any benefits to animals that use SAV
beds as habitat. Therefore, the text in chapter 3 (page 88 of the plan/EIS) has
been revised to address this issue.
Chapter 2 (starting on page 41 of the plan/EIS) describes potential
revegetation approaches the NPS and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will
use to restore Dyke Marsh, including construction of the containment cells.
Although revegetation of SAV beds is not the primary goal of this project, it
is assumed that SAV would become established in the outer edges of the
containment cells because of the engineering design. Chapter 2 provides a
description of the design concept, noting that natural edges will be
engineered with appropriate slopes to allow successful establishment of high
marsh, low marsh, and SAV habitat. Appendix A of the plan/EIS presents the
adaptive management plan, which will be used to monitor the progress of the
action alternatives, once implemented.

Representative Quote: The deep water channels within Dyke Marsh may
also be important migratory corridors for some species, such as Atlantic and
shortnose sturgeon. The deep-water habitat within Dyke Marsh offers fish
and other biota a refuge from high river flows. We would recommend a
spatial analysis of deep-water habitat adjacent to the main channel be
performed to further assess the regional importance of the habitat elements
in Dyke Marsh within the tidal Potomac River area.
The Potomac River supports numerous fish species that prefer structure for
feeding, refugia and/or spawning. One aspect that we could not find
addressed in the Plan information to date is an evaluation of the aquatic
resources within Dyke Marsh. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS)
fisheries data collected by from 2001-2004 within Dyke Marsh focused on
rare, threatened or endangered (RTE) fish species such as Atlantic and
shortnose sturgeon and they concluded that their surveys did not collect
RTE fish species during those years. We recommend that the Federal
agencies continuing work on these two species (National Marine Fisheries
Service and USFWS) be asked for written comments for the project study,
updated to 2012, and made available for other review agencies to consider.
Specifically, it would be important to know whether more recent survey
results exist, and also to what degree potential habitat for these species
factors into Federal review at this site. In other parts of the Bay and its
tributaries, potential habitat has played a significant role in project review
for large projects.
RESPONSE:

In a 2004 study, Mangold and others provided a comprehensive inventory
of fish species within Dyke Marsh. This report, prepared by the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service (USFWS), included three years of field sampling
across seasons and used a variety of gear types. Referenced in the
preparation of the plan/EIS, the report constitutes a detailed overview of
aquatic resources including species and habitats found within the project
area. It is possible that Atlantic and shortnose sturgeon may pass through
the area on the way to and from spawning up river (Kynard et al. 2007). In a
2007 study of sturgeon on the Potomac, two tagged sturgeon were shown to
spend their time several miles downstream of Dyke Marsh. There are no
data showing that they use the marsh (Kynard et al. 2007). Although not
specifically targeted in the study, the fish species inventory conducted by
the USFWS did not capture any sturgeon during the three-year study and
the report was unable to confirm the presence of shortnose sturgeon within
Dyke Marsh (Mangold et al. 2004). They were not found in Dyke Marsh in

Monitoring proposed under the adaptive management part of this plan is
focused on those factors that are considered critical for assessing success in
achieving functioning wetland habitat. This habitat can support and benefit
a wide variety of species, including frogs. It is not feasible to monitor all

No official surveys for the marsh wren are currently planned. However, the
NPS would plan construction so that timing would minimize disturbance to
sensitive fish and wildlife species, and the marsh wren would benefit from
this timing, although it is not specifically noted as a listed species of concern
in the plan/EIS. The NPS will consider several factors when determining
vegetation methods, as discussed in chapter 2 (page 44 of the plan/EIS).
Although not stated as a specific objective, creating additional acreage of
similar marsh plant composition is a desired outcome of the restoration,
including both narrowleaf cattail and river bulrush, which are used by
nesting marsh wren populations.

RESPONSE:

Chapter 3 of the plan/EIS describes the degree to which plant and vegetation
community surveys have been conducted within the upland and wetland
communities in Dyke Marsh. Vegetation community surveys initiated in
2001 identified 12 plant communities at Dyke Marsh. Additionally, more
than 370 plant species have been identified in the marsh communities,
where sensitive joint-vetch (Aeschynomene virginica) would occur. Of these
species observed in the marsh communities, sensitive joint-vetch was not
among them. Rare plant surveys performed in the vicinity of Dyke Marsh
identified rare species, but did not identify sensitive joint-vetch. Finally, an
online review of the Virginia Department of Conservation Resources
Natural Heritage database did not reveal any known locations for sensitive
joint-vetch in Fairfax County. Based upon the large amount of data the NPS
has for Dyke Marsh, it is unlikely that an inventory for sensitive joint-vetch
would yield any new information and is not being proposed as part of this

specific actions underway to accomplish invasive species management, but
does not clearly state time and amount of effort used. According to Table 2-

Final Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and Long-term Management Plan / EIS

301

Appendix D: Public Comment Analysis Report

1 (p. 38), NPS personnel have three major roles in Dyke Marsh: to apply
herbicide to control nonnative invasive species, to supervise volunteer
groups who are helping with manual invasive species removal, and to
remove invasive plants and debris from Haul Road area. The tasks are clear,
but total time or effort used to execute these tasks is unclear and prevents a
full understanding of planning and management needs. Three permanent
Natural Resources Management (NRM) staff members devote about 20
percent of their time per week at Dyke Marsh (p. 101), which equates to 8
hours spent in Dyke Marsh per person per week. It is difficult to believe
that the staff spend all 8 hours/week on invasive species management given
that they have many other tasks. To better understand time allotment, it
would be helpful to see an itemized summary of NRM hours per week or
month.
RESPONSE:

The plan/EIS accurately characterizes the level of park operational effort
under all the alternatives. Detailed accounting of specific staff hours needed
to accomplish each task is not needed to assess the effects of the
alternatives on park management and operations and has not been added to
the final plan/EIS.

although the EIS makes clear that truck usage of the parkway would be
minimal, I was curious when the construction work would be taking place. The
George Washington Parkway is a heavily used commuting road in and out of

"The outfall of Hunting Creek and Cameron Run into the Potomac River has
been altered by the development of the George Washington Memorial Parkway,
urbanization within the watershed, the development of a golf course along the
creek and parkway, and upstream channelization. The sediment load from
Hunting Creek, which was once carried toward the marsh and helped maintain a
depositional environment, is now deposited mostly north of the marsh at the

We request a substantive addition to the analysis in the final plan/EIS that
addresses NPS's intentions in regard to removing and/or minimizing this
unwanted siltation and devising a means for the outfall of Hunting Creek to
once again be carried south toward the marsh and help feed it with ongoing
sedimentation to counteract the inevitable erosion of Dyke Marsh over time,
even with a promontory in place.
Third, we are unclear as to how or whether the promontory proposed for the
south end of Dyke Marsh will impact the siltation problems in the area where
Hunting Creek enters the Potomac River. Since this area is directly adjacent to

When construction or demolition projects are planned, a search of DEQ's waste
databases (federal and state) is important to identify possible waste sites on or
near the project sites in order to avoid impacting such sites or having the sites
impact the work on the project sites. The following database links should be

Traffic on the parkway: Traffic on the parkway is dismissed in
chapter 1 (page 23 of the plan/EIS under “Transportation”). Little
additional traffic is expected on the parkway because the work will be
carried out from the water and materials will be transported by barge.
Impacts to the pipeline: The NPS contacted Washington Gas during the
planning process and discussed how to avoid impacts on the pipeline
during construction. No impacts to the pipeline are expected after
construction. Discussion of the pipeline is provided in chapter 2 (page 46
of the plan/EIS), and anticipated impacts are discussed in the section
“Impacts of the Alternatives on Adjacent Property Owners and the
Marina” (starting on page 181 of the plan/EIS).
Climate change and sea level rise: Restoration of the marsh will have
negligible effects on climate change and sea level rise, and is therefore
not considered in the impact analysis. However, both climate change and
sea level rise could affect the success of the restoration, and parameters
affected by climate change, such as water level and salinity, will be
monitored as part of the adaptive management planning process. More
detailed considerations of sea level rise related to factors such as
elevation for fill in containment cells, and of Haul Road bridges/culverts,

will be made during the construction design and implementation process.
 Solid and hazardous waste: The project does not propose any activities
that would generate waste, and the NPS is unaware of any hazardous or
solid waste issues within the project area. Due diligence screening of
government databases will be performed to the extent required by law
prior to construction.
 Siltation issues at the confluence of Cameron Run / Hunting Creek with
the river, and how promontory would affect sedimentation at that
confluence: Addressing siltation at the confluence of Cameron Run /
Hunting Creek is outside the project area and scope of analysis. The
addition of the breakwater would result in localized changes to
hydrology and would not affect siltation upstream in the Cameron Run
area.
Text about sea level rise and elevation for the containment cells has been added

determine to what extent the restoration may affect their resiliency. Discuss
how future changes (e.g., additional hardening, urban development, and
increased stormwater runoff) in Hunting Creek and Cameron Run watersheds
could affect marsh restoration.
RESPONSE:

The Belle View and New Alexandria neighborhoods immediately west of Dyke
Marsh contain land in the 100-year floodplain, and have experienced flooding
in the past. As discussed in the “Floodplains” section in chapter 4, beginning
on page 141 of the plan/EIS, restoration of Dyke Marsh would add marsh
wetlands that would act as a buffer between upland areas and the open water of
the river, and would therefore add some resilience against flooding. Restoration
would not make flooding worse in those areas. In addition, as described in the
plan/EIS, modeling was used to estimate the impacts on floodplain elevation by
each alternative.
Discussion of additional development in Hunting Creek and Cameron Run is
too speculative to reasonably predict and is far enough removed from the
project area that it was not considered as a cumulative action for any resource.

optimize in a balanced manner the wetland values and stability of the area, as
well as to establish tidal guts. However, the placement of fill in the deep water
areas within Dyke Marsh should be avoided to maintain an important habitat
feature and minimize potential fisheries impacts.
RESPONSE:

The restoration of marsh habitat will require the filling of previous manmade
channels. While this will result in the loss of some deep water habitat, impacts
are not expected to extend beyond those outlined in the plan/EIS. The deep
holes and trenches near Dyke Marsh are generally used only as cold refugia in
the summer and are not known to be spawning grounds for any species within
the project area. The most abundant fish species in the project area are banded
killifish, bluegill, and pumpkinseed (Kynard et al. 2007). None of these species
depends on deep water habitats and all will benefit from increased marsh
habitat. No federally or state-listed species are known to use deep water
habitats. While it is possible that Atlantic and shortnose sturgeon may pass
through the area, it is not expected that they would be present for more than a
few weeks. Furthermore, a three-year fish species inventory conducted by the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service was unable to confirm the presence of shortnose
sturgeon within Dyke Marsh, although shortnose sturgeon have been
documented elsewhere in the Potomac River (Mangold et al. 2004). Overall,
the long-term benefits of added nursery habitat will outweigh the necessary
loss of deep water habitats for fish.
Activities associated with the action alternatives include the construction of a
breakwater and filling of manmade channels. While the filling of channels
would result in the loss of deep water habitat, benefits to fish would occur due
to the creation of marsh habitat that serves as a nursery and refuge for small
and juvenile fishes. Species that may occasionally use the deeper waters in the
park would still be able to use other deep water habitats in the Potomac as
described in chapter 4. These activities would not significantly impact sturgeon
migration.
Also, some SAV habitat may be lost, but in other areas SAV is expected to
become established at the marsh edges. Any required mitigation or monitoring
related to impacts on SAV would be addressed at the time of permitting.
Chapter 5 of the plan/EIS explains the permit process and the agency review
that would occur at that time.
Discussion of the presence of sturgeon in Dyke Marsh has been added to page

Specific questions which are not addressed in enough detail include:
(1) What are the impacts of cuts made through the Haul Road in terms of
access on foot to the marsh? How will these cuts be made? Will the road/trail
itself be continued over the area where the cuts are made?
(2) How long will the project take to complete, given the cost differentials
among options? Are we looking at 1, 5, or 10 years or longer?
(3) During construction, can foot access continue? Water access from the
marina?
Dyke Marsh provides a valuable range of recreational amenities, both on land
and on the water, and these have been given short shrift in the analysis
provided.

Text has been added to page 46 (chapter 2 of the plan/EIS) to clarify that the
Haul Road would continue to serve as a trail to the marsh after construction is
complete. Timing for the construction along Haul Road cannot be predicted at

that mudflats and emergent wetlands are beginning to develop at the mount of
Hunting Creek, greatly reducing the sediment and nutrients supplied to Dyke
Marsh by Hunting Creek. While a detriment to Dyke Marsh, the mudflats are
prime bird area, with many species of waterfowl, waders, shorebirds, and
raptors visible from the Hunting Creek bridge and elsewhere on the shoreline.
Would the implementation of Alternatives B or C have any impact on where
these sediments and nutrients go?
RESPONSE:

Because the Dyke Marsh restoration project area is downstream of the mouth
of Hunting Creek/Cameron Run, there would be little effect of the restoration
on that area. The breakwater would serve to capture local sediments and
redirect hydrology within the marsh, but would not affect accumulation of
sediments being discharged from Cameron Run.

regarding AGENCIES CONSULTED, that USFWS staff familiar with the
marsh and surrounding area were informally consulted about whether or not
there were federally listed species identified; none were. (p.189). The EIS also
states that a letter was later sent from GWMP "to reconfirm that information
and to initiate informal consultation with the USFWS about the presence of
federally listed rare, threatened, or endangered species in or near the parks. No
response was received." Bald Eagles are currently nesting in the Dyke Marsh
(between the Haul Road and the Gut). It would now seem that additional
follow up is warranted. For instance as planning continues, the timeline
alternatives for the "construction" phases of the project may need to be take
Bald Eagle nesting season into consideration as advised, or not, by Endangered
Species Specialist(s) with the USFWS.

Representative Quote: Although we do not currently document bald eagle
nesting locations, bald eagle concentration zones, or bald eagle roost sites from
Dyke Marsh, the area serves as an important foraging area for bald eagles and
numerous other migratory avian species. We recommend that all restoration
and management at Dyke Marsh be performed in a manner protective of bald
eagles and consistent with state and federal guidelines for protection of bald
eagles; and that the NPS coordinate as indicated with us or with the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service regarding possible impacts upon bald eagles or the need
for a federal bald eagle take permit.
RESPONSE:

The plan/EIS already recognizes that the marsh serves as an important foraging
area for bald eagles on page 92 (chapter 3 of the plan/EIS). However, the park
has confirmed that there is now a bald eagle nest in the park between the Haul
Road and the Hog Island Gut, as indicated by one commenter. Therefore, the
text regarding “Species of Special Concern” on page 92 in chapter 3 of the
plan/EIS has been changed to state: “In addition, the marsh is used as foraging
habitat by the bald eagle, (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), a recently delisted
species; one bald eagle nest has recently been confirmed in the marsh between
the Haul Road and the Hog Island Gut (Steury, pers. comm. 2014).” Potential
impacts to the bald eagle from construction activities have also been addressed
and added to chapter 4 on page 164 in chapter 4 of the plan/EIS. The nest is
more than 330 feet away from any of the construction activities planned for

construction of the cells in that area, which is consistent with state and federal
guidelines for protection of bald eagles, and as specifically recommended by
VDGIF guidance in “Management of Bald Eagle Nests, Concentration Areas,
and Communal Roosts in Virginia: A Guide for Landowners” (2012). In
addition, during the permitting process, the joint application will be subject to
review by both Virginia agencies and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, at
which time any remaining concerns regarding potential impacts to nesting
eagles can be incorporated into the permit conditions.

Dear Friends,
Please accept this comment on behalf of American Bird Conservancy, which works to conserve native
birds and their habitats throughout the Americas.
Dyke Marsh will be gone by 2035 if it is not stabilized.
This is a rare opportunity to restore what has diminished to a remnant of the extensive wetlands that once
lined the Potomac River. These wetlands provide essential habitat for resident and migratory birds.
Funds are available to implement most of Alternative C, the full restoration plan.
Public support is broad, including support from numerous elected officials. Restoration will protect the
marsh, stabilize erosion and encourage more accretion by trapping more sediments.
A larger, restored marsh can be a natural defense that helps buffer against storms and reduce the
likelihood of flooding, thus reducing costs of responding to damage from severe storms.
Restoration can discourage the establishment of non-native, invasive plants.
Restoration will mean - o
o
o

cleaner water, as wetlands are natural filters of pollutants;
more habitat for native fish, shellfish, birds and other wildlife;
more educational and recreational opportunities for all ages;

Congress added Dyke Marsh to the National Park Service system in 1959 "so that fish and wildlife
development and their preservation as wetland wildlife habitat shall be paramount."
Dyke Marsh was severely altered and undermined by people, when around half of the marsh was dredged
and hauled away. People should repair that harm.
Thank you for considering these comments.

Comments of the Audubon Society of Northern Virginia on the draft final Dyke Marsh Restoration and
Long-Term Management Plan Environmental Impact Statement
February 2014
The Dyke Marsh Wildlife Preserve is a valuable local, state and national resource, a rare freshwater, tidal,
climax, narrow-leaf cattail wetland, providing habitat for 300 known species of plants, 6,000 arthropods,
38 fish, 16 reptiles, 14 amphibians and over 230 birds. It is long past time to restore the harm of the past over 50 years of excavation, dumping, filling, invasive species, poaching, hunting, river traffic, runoff,
pollution, noise, off-leash dogs, trash and erosion.
The Audubon Society of Northern Virginia supports full restoration of Dyke Marsh, the preferred option
in the NPS final draft restoration plan/environmental impact statement. The preferred option would
restore the marsh to its historic boundaries. We support maintaining the Belle Haven Marina in its current
footprint, as the marina offers a way for visitors to experience the marsh and its wildlife.
A restored Dyke Marsh can strengthen ecological services and offer more opportunities for scientific
research, public education, nature study and enjoyment. It can be an even better outdoor classroom for
students of all ages and for researchers.
Like many others, we are very concerned about the dramatic decline and precarious state of the marsh
wren and the least bittern in Dyke Marsh. We believe that a restored Dyke Marsh can provide more
habitat for these birds and thus help sustain the local population. Our surveys show a decline in many bird
species in Northern Virginia. A restored Dyke Marsh can help reverse that decline.
We urge that the plan include sea level rise in planning all phases of the project and include planting only
native plants and strong controls on invasive species. We urge NPS to establish seasonal restrictions on
construction to protect species during the breeding and nesting season.

McLean, VA 22101
RE: Draft Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and Long-term Management Plan/
Environmental Impact Statement
Dear Superintendent Romero:
I am writing on behalf of the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA), to comment on the Dyke
Marsh Wetland Restoration Plan/EIS. NPCA is a nonprofit advocacy organization that is dedicated to
protecting and enhancing America's national parks for our children and grandchildren to enjoy. NPCA
has more than 800,000 members and supporters.
NPCA strongly endorses the National Park Service's Preferred Alternative, Alternative C - Hydrologic
Restoration and Fullest Possible Extent of Wetland Restoration. Alternative C will put Dyke Marsh on the
path to full restoration while providing critical habitat to wildlife, improving water quality, and providing
flood protection for the surrounding community.
Dyke Marsh is one of the last large freshwater tidal marshes along the Potomac River shoreline in the
Washington, D.C. region. It is the largest freshwater, tidal, narrow-leaf cattail marsh in the National Park
Service system. Dyke Marsh is known for its rich biodiversity hosting 300 known plant species, 6,000
arthropods, 38 species of fish, 16 reptiles species, 14 amphibian species, and over 230 different birds. The
Marsh supports heavy visitation by birders and other outdoor recreationists. It is easily accessible from
the Mount Vernon Bicycle Trail and visited by trail users.

Final Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and Long-term Management Plan / EIS

389

Appendix D: Public Comment Analysis Report

Before the NPS began managing Dyke Marsh in 1972, large segments of the marsh were dredged for
gravel and sand, resulting in the loss of almost 270 acres of marshland. Summer and winter storms
continue to contribute to shoreline erosion. Removal of a promontory in the past has deepened erosion
and removed natural wave protection. Erosion rates are estimated to be 1.5 to 2 acres per year and erosion
is causing habitat loss. Exotic plant species are also damaging Dyke Marsh by crowding out native plant
life.
Full restoration of Dyke Marsh will not only provide ecological benefits, it will provide economic benefits
to the community. A restored marsh will provide increased buffering for the region from storms and
flooding. It will reduce the restoration and management costs caused by loss of wetlands. And it will
provide enhanced water filtering that will increase the health of the Potomac River and the Chesapeake
Bay.
Restoring Dyke Marsh aligns with many of the goals of the National Park Service's agenda in the Call to
Action by connecting youth to parks; increasing park access to urbanites; and creating a new generation of
citizen scientists and stewards, among other goals. Because of its location in the Washington DC
metropolitan area, Dyke Marsh is an ideal outdoor classroom for American youth. A myriad of
opportunities exist to study a wide range of animals and plants; to learn about water flow and water
quality; and to participate in restoration activities. City dwellers are able to find respite at a Dyke Marsh
bird walk by jumping on a bus or a bicycle. The effects of climate change, new insights into the impacts of
dredging, and how to combat invasive plants can all be studied at Dyke Marsh.
As you know, President Obama issued Executive Order 13508 in 2009 recognizing the Chesapeake Bay as
a national treasure and calling for increased access for the public. NPCA strongly supports this goal and
actively works with partner groups to expand access to the Bay at national park sites throughout the
region. Dyke Marsh currently hosts the Belle Haven Marina and a public access boat ramp. These
amenities are very popular and heavily used by citizens in the area. Alternative C includes an option to
replace the mooring of the marina with a 20-acre restoration cell should the marina concession no longer
be economically viable. NPCA strongly urges the National Park Service to ensure that any restoration plan
retain public access to fulfill President Obama's Executive Order and to enhance the visitor experience at
Dyke Marsh.
A project of this magnitude will be quite costly so it is fortunate that Hurricane Sandy restoration dollars
have been allocated for Dyke Marsh. We urge the National Park Service to proceed without delay to
capitalize on this funding source. We suggest that the NPS prioritize implementing the restored Hog
Island promontory and breakwater; filling the deep dredging scars along the western shore; then building
the high-priority fill cells. Restoration could then continue as long as funding was available.
After careful examination of each alternative concept, NPCA strongly endorses the full restoration of
Alternative C. Innovative work at Poplar Island has shown the many benefits of a full restoration process
to our environment. Dyke Marsh is a unique treasure in the Washington area that deserves full
restoration. The ecological values it holds, the economic benefits it will add, and the ability to contribute
to the goals of the National Park Service's Call to Action all support the full restoration outlined in
Alternative C. Finally, we urge the National Park Service to ensure that sufficient financial resources are
available to accomplish the goals outlined in Alternative C. This critical funding will ensure that Dyke
Marsh is properly restored and protected for the continued enjoyment of everyone.

Restoration Overall/Implement Alternative C
The Friends of Dyke Marsh (FODM) endorse the preferred option, Alternative C or full restoration of
Dyke Marsh. As partners with the U.S. National Park Service, we have advocated for restoration since
FODM's founding in 1976 and are very pleased to see the restoration plan nearing completion.
We strongly urge no further delay in restoration. The USGS study that documented the destabilization of
Dyke Marsh and the USGS update (http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2010/1269/
http://fodm.org/2013Wetlands.pdf) conclude that Dyke Marsh is eroding at 1.5 to 2 acres per year and
could be completely gone by 2035. At least $27.4 million is available for restoration. Restoration is
feasible, appropriate, necessary and long overdue. Since people caused the fundamental destabilization of
the marsh, people should repair it.
As the draft final EIS makes clear, a restored Dyke Marsh can strengthen ecological services, enhance the
historic landscape for the George Washington Memorial Parkway and offer more opportunities for
scientific research, education, nature study and recreation. Restored, Dyke Marsh can better provide
more flood control, storm buffering, wave attenuation, shoreline stabilization, water quality
enhancement, wildlife habitat, fish nursery and aesthetic enjoyment. It is and can be an even better
outdoor classroom for hundreds of students of all ages and a natural laboratory for scientists others.
Of all alternatives, alternative C offers the most ecological services. For reasons stated in the EIS, for
example, on pages 141 and 178, alternative C would provide "a greater buffer from flooding to the
parkway" and "a larger flood storage capacity than other alternatives. Overall Option C would increase
marsh wetland and habitat by as much as 245 acres, with Option B contributing only 70 acres, increasing
the diversity and populations of species over the long term.
We concur with the comments of Fairfax County officials to NPS that restoration will stem the persistent
degradation of what remains of the wetland caused by damaging storms and will recreate "a functional
wetland buffer … deliver … ecosystem services of flood and storm surge protection, as well as expanded
habitat for diverse plant and animal species."
The Schedule
In view of the rapid deterioration and accelerating erosion of Dyke Marsh, time is of the essence. NPS
should start restoration as soon as the EIS process is completed to protect the remaining existing marsh
and ensure completion of the restoration project by the deadlines imposed by the funding.

Appendix D: Public Comment Analysis Report

The U.S. National Park Service (NPS) has received $2.5 million from the Metropolitan Washington
Airports Authority (MWAA) as wetlands compensatory mitigation for 1.94 acres of impacts of building an
airport landing safety area required to meet Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) safety standards.
FODM strongly supported MWAA's proposal.
The Statement of Findings (SOF)
(http://parkplanning.nps.gov/document.cfm?parkID=186&projectID=45963&documentID=51719) sets
deadlines as follows:
"The funds in this escrow account will be made available to NPS for construction of the 1st phase of the
Dyke Marsh restoration project upon execution of a contract for the construction of all or a portion of
the 1st phase of the Dyke Marsh restoration project, which contract will include a provision that the
construction must be complete no later than December 31, 2016 or 12 months after execution of contract,
whichever is earlier. In the event that the NPS is unable to execute a contract for construction of the 1st
phase of the Dyke Marsh restoration project by December 31, 2015 the $2.50 million shall be made
available for use by the Airports Authority for the completion of an alternate compensatory mitigation
project as mutually agreed upon by the COE, NPS and the Airports Authority."
FODM strongly urges that NPS meet these deadlines and not put these funds at risk.
The George Washington Memorial Parkway unit of NPS has received a grant of $24.7 million in
"Hurricane Sandy" funds. We strongly urge NPS to meet the deadlines currently included in this grant.
Restoration Areas
Given the fragility of the marsh, the Park Service should first restore the promontory by building the
breakwater and then fill the deep dredging scars along the western shore.
We support the construction sequence that makes the breakwater and containment cells immediately
adjacent to the existing terminus of Hog Island Gut a high priority, receiving action early in the schedule.
We recommend that the containments cells be made of a material that has minimal impact on water
quality. We urge that the outer walls be kept in place until the marsh is clearly established.
We support creating breaks under the Haul Road to restore tidal flow and urge increased attention and
priority to the area to better control the rampant non-native, invasive plants. We urge NPS to seek funds
and elevate in priority construction of the tidal connections and restoring the area west of the Haul Road.
Restoring the tidal connections and hence the floodplain forest would add a valuable wetland habitat to
the overall preserve and attract more animals and plants.
We applaud NPS's efforts to control invasive plants and urge NPS to use herbicides carefully and
selectively.
Restoration Construction Work
We urge that NPS - o

conduct the bulk of the restoration from the water, in the river, in a way that has minimal impact on
existing resources (page 181);
use only clean and appropriate fill, tested for contaminants;
conduct all construction activity at times that respect sensitive times, for example, when birds and
other animals are breeding in the wetland, especially the marsh wren and least bittern, birds whose
populations are declining here (page 186);
give public notice if public access or the Haul Road will be affected by construction;
post signs explaining why the Haul Road is temporarily closed, if it is (page 181);
provide informational displays to explain to the public why construction work is occur-ring with
representations of the desired results;
hire and/or contract to provide sufficient staff to supervise and monitor construction and its
impacts and restoration success; and
hold periodic public meetings to explain the purpose, progress and status of restoration to the
public.

Plan Design and Monitoring
FODM urges that in the restoration plan design, NPS –
o

o

o
o

o
o

strive to make the restored marsh a self-sustaining natural system to a close approximation of its
historic potential and restore its ecological integrity and functions in a way that require minimal
human maintenance;
take into account the impact of climate change and rising sea levels on the Potomac River, as
recommended by Dr. Katharina Engelhardt in her 2007 report, "Research Sup-porting Evaluation
and Restoration of Dyke Marsh." Based on the Governor's Commission on Climate Change,
Fairfax County officials have estimated a .56 foot rise could occur in Washington, D.C., by 2050 and
1.10 feet by 2100. Scientists at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science, concluded that the
Chesapeake Bay will experience up to five feet of sea level rise by 2100.
allow for an extension of the existing boardwalk partly into the restored marsh;
use living shoreline (see www.vims.edu/livingshorelines/ ) approaches to stabilize tidal shorelines,
where appropriate. Living shorelines, as opposed to hardened structures, in capitalize on natural
functions, create habitat and can both help restore a wetland and stem erosion.
plant only native plants, preferably in the spring to give plants the entire growing sea-son to get
established. FODM looks forward to helping NPS put in and monitor plants.
protect plantings against herbivory.

Belle Haven Marina
FODM supports the recreational river access provided by the Belle Haven Marina in its current footprint,
including the mooring area.
FODM also recognizes that many of the people who use the marina are interested in the preservation and
restoration of Dyke Marsh. We believe there need be no conflict between restoring the marsh as much as
possible, while not affecting the current footprint of the Belle Haven Marina. We agree with the NPS
statement on page 182: "… it is anticipated that the marina would continue its normal operations and that
this option [filling the mooring area] would not be exercised."
Furthermore, the Belle Haven Marina serves as a staging area, specifically a launch point for waterborne
visitor tours, cleanups and breeding bird and other surveys (The breeding bird survey has been conducted
by the Friends of Dyke Marsh for at least 21 years.)
We recommend that the proposed restoration be done in a manner that does nothing to constrain Belle
Haven Marina operations. One of the plan objectives, Visitor Experience, is to "enhance accessibility for
diverse audiences." The marina provides canoe and kayak equipment, access and training that fully
support this objective. It also is one of a limited number of points in this area for recreational and
educational river access which is a broader objective. The marsh can be fully stabilized and substantially
restored without impinging on the marina's current operations.
Large Debris
During the restoration, we urge NPS to remove all of the large construction debris, concrete chunks,
rebar, metal and other debris left from dredging or other human activities and other large non-natural
objects, assuming they are not historic resources.

FODM urges NPS to consult with wetlands scientists, such as experts at the Virginia Institute of Marine
Science (VIMS), for technical and scientific support and analysis. They, for example, have expertise in
establishing appropriate elevations to support wetland plants, types of structural protections that are
effective on the basis of a river's fetch and design of appropriate slopes in the intertidal area and
monitoring protocols.
Western Part of Dyke Marsh (west of the parkway)

Final Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and Long-term Management Plan / EIS

393

Appendix D: Public Comment Analysis Report

FODM has received anecdotal reports of sediment and stormwater runoff that flow into the western part
of Dyke Marsh increasing in recent months.
We recommend that NPS - o
o
o

evaluate the water quality and impacts of stormwater runoff from the west into Dyke Marsh and
identify steps to restore this part of the marsh;
develop measures to provide for the inland migration of the wetland, given predicted sea level rise
and its impact on the tidal Potomac River; and
monitor how restoration impacts the area.

Monitoring and Assessment
We appreciate the inclusion of Appendix A and the details on adaptive management, especially
monitoring. We are disturbed about the omission of monitoring of birds, fish and other animals. Wetlands
are fish nurseries and monitoring fish, bird and other animal populations and diversity are useful in
determining restoration success. We urge their inclusion.
Monitoring should measure restoration success, guide completion of restoration and protect the physical,
chemical and biological integrity of the marsh. We urge monitoring of the following, in accordance with
guidelines of the Virginia Marine Resources Commission.
We urge NPS to - o
o

make publicly available the performance standards for the restoration;
establish a vigorous monitoring and assessment program to, at regular intervals and at least
annually, collect systematic data and measure progress toward performance standards.

Include in the plan, monitoring of the following:
o
o
o

o

birds and other animals typically found in, over and around the wetland;
native and non-native plants, especially plants with a demonstrated history of success in the area;
long-term depositional patterns (accretion and erosion of sediments) to ensure that deposition is at
a sufficient level to maintain appropriate wetland plant and animal diversity and to ensure that
sediment accretion in the marsh will keep pace with sea level rise; and
water quality and hydrology.

We welcome the language on page 218 recognizing the need for long-term monitoring of at least 10 years.
We urge NPS to monitor the restoration for at least 10 years to determine success and whether the
restoration is meeting the project's goals. Some wetland scientists maintain that it takes 10 to 20 years for
sediment to reach equivalent levels of organic levels found in natural marshes.
If monitoring indicates changes are needed, we urge NPS to make changes to assure success. We urge
NPS to seek funds to monitor for 10 years, if funds are not available.
Data Collection
We appreciate this language on page 220: "There needs to be a plan for long-term data management for all
areas monitored. One searchable database for all the monitoring data is needed for George Washington
Memorial Parkway."
We urge NPS to develop the plan and implement it, to collect data on the wetland's status throughout the
entire restoration and periodically evaluate results to guide the project. We urge NPS to develop the
database as described.
We applaud the National Park Service for preparing this plan and for its commitment to the conservation
and restoration of our natural resources.

Comments of BoatU.S. regarding EIS No. 20140006
Draft EIS, NPS, VA, Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and Long-term Management Plan
March 14, 2014
BoatU.S. is the largest organization of recreational boat owners in the United States, with more than
500,000 members nationwide and over 51,000 members in Virginia, Maryland and the District of
Columbia. On behalf of our members we would like to register our concerns with the implementation of
the Dyke Marsh Restoration and Long Term Management Plan and in particular language contained in
Alternative C, the alternative preferred by the National Park Service (NPS).
Dyke Marsh and Belle Haven Marina are both a popular boating destination and a critical launching and
mooring field for boaters in the Washington area. The two destinations are from a geographical sense,
bound to each other. The marina provides a boat ramp, slips, sailboat rental, paddle craft rental and
launch, and a sailing school. Area residents launch boats and paddle craft to fish, bird-watch and enjoy the
wildlife fostered by Dyke Marsh. The marina serves education programs such as the Chesapeake Bay
Foundations Potomac River Program which teaches conservation and preservation.
It is our strong belief that the vitality of both Dyke Marsh and Belle Haven Marina rely on a balanced
management plan that fosters the sustainability of the marsh and the economic viability of the marina.
Currently language contained in Alternative C could very easily inhibit or possibly end the prosperity of
the marina. We propose that the following language be removed from Alternative C:
This alternative contains an optional 20-acre restoration cell in the area currently serving as mooring for
the marina. Such an option would only be implemented should the marina concession no longer be
economically viable for the current concessioner, and no other concessioner expresses interest in taking
over the business, eliminating the need for the mooring field.
Since the NPS is not only the leaseholder to the concessionaire (in this case Belle Haven Marina) but also
sets the lease requirements, insurance minimums, and defines what is or is not economic viability, we
believe that the concessionaire could be denied renewal of the lease at any time. Just over the last 3 years,

Final Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and Long-term Management Plan / EIS

395

Appendix D: Public Comment Analysis Report

the insurance required by NPS has increased from $1,000,000 to $5,000,000. Even in the face of such
drastic increases, Belle Haven Marina is and has been consistently at 100% sp occupancy with over 400
families on the waiting list for slips. This is important testimony towards the need to maintain the 20 acres
of current mooring field. The marina and sailing school also contribute heavily to the local economy by
providing 45-50 jobs.
Should this marina be closed there would be no public boat launch for over 20 miles of the Potomac River
even though the nations taxpayers, through the National Park System, pay for a good stretch of
maintaining that river shore. Placing the access this marina provides to the urban and suburban
population in such jeopardy also directly conflicts with President Obamas Americas Great Outdoors
Initiative (AGO) to remove obstacles to park access. A key recommendation to come out of the Presidents
AGO initiative is the following (emphasis added):
Recommendation 2.1 - Support outdoor recreation access and opportunities on public lands by
establishing a Federal Interagency Committee on Outdoor Recreation
It is important to recognize the importance of maintaining the connection to the water that facilities such
as Belle Haven Marina provide, particularly in an urban area such as Washington. For disadvantaged
youth, on the water experiences are only made possible by having this kind of recreational facility
supported. All of the alternative management proposals limit access for the public and the recreational
boater, a management philosophy that directly contradicts the intent of the AGO initiative.
President Obama followed through on the AGO recommendation on June 13, 2011, when he created the
Federal Interagency Council on Outdoor Recreation headed by former Secretary Salazar. As a
stakeholder organization that is actively engaged in the AGO process, we note several tasks charged to the
new Council that are of particular significance in our review of the Dyke Marsh Restoration Plan:
Task: Coordinate recreation management, access and policies across multiple agencies to improve public
enjoyment and recreational use of federal lands.
Task: Improve engagement of young people and their families in outdoor recreation through healthy,
active lifestyles.
Task: Identify ways to improve access to and benefits from our parks, refuges, and other public lands,
waters, and shores for persons with disabilities.
Task: Target underserved and disadvantaged communities for both access and engagement in the benefits
of and opportunities for outdoor recreation.
We urge the Park Service to revisit its plans for Dyke Marsh with an eye towards meeting the national
recommendations contained in the AGO initiative.
The aforementioned language in Alternative C, could strongly jeopardize the attainability of these goals.
We appreciate the delicate balance the NPS must strike in fulfilling its mission of providing access to Dyke
Marsh and the Potomac River while preserving the very elements that make these natural areas such
attractive destinations. With their close proximity to metropolitan Washington, preserving public access
to the marsh and river via support and enhancement of the Belle Haven Marina must be a primary goal of
any new management plan.
Additionally, we believe that the dredging of Belle Haven Marina and the use of such dredge material to
rebuild eroded areas of Dyke Marsh would be a win-win strategy in moving forward and supporting both
entities. Creating deeper slips and mooring areas will help to solidify the area for generations to come,
while the use of native soils as fill to restore Dyke Marsh will cut down in refurbishment costs.
As this process moves to the final stages, BoatU.S. strongly believes that a resolution can be reached that
both maintains public access to the water while preserving the very outdoors experience our members
pursue.

The following are the comments on the "Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and Long-term Management
Plan/Environmental Impact Statement" submitted on behalf of the Friends of Fort Hunt Park, Inc.
(FFHPI), the official friends' group of the National Park Service (NPS) for Fort Hunt Park, another unit of
the George Washington Memorial Parkway. FFHPI wholeheartedly supports Alternative C, the full
restoration alternative, and recommends that it be implemented at the earliest possible time.
Dyke Marsh is the last major remnant of formerly extensive tidal marshes along the Potomac River. It is a
local and regional treasure based upon its natural, recreational and educational resources.
Prior to its becoming a unit within the George Washington Memorial Parkway in 1973, Dyke March was
dredged for sand and gravel. Between the years 1940-1972 over 250 acres of the marsh were lost as a result
of these activities. Only 60 acres of marshland remain, and 1.5-2.0 additional acres are being lost each
year. Without stabilization, this unique place will no longer exist by or before 2050. With full restoration,
it can be returned to its status before human activities severely harmed this ecosystem.
Moreover, funds are already available to implement most of Alternative C, the full restoration plan. And
support from the public and elected officials is widespread.
Restoration will protect the marsh, halt erosion and encourage its expansion by trapping more river
sediments. A larger, restored marsh can serve as a natural defense against storms and reduce the
likelihood of flooding, thus decreasing the human and financial costs from severe storms. It will also
increase the amount and quality of the wildlife habitat and increase the aesthetic appeal of the marsh. It
will lead to cleaner water and greater educational and recreational opportunities for persons of all ages, a
goal of the Healthy Parks Healthy People Program.
Implementing Alternative C will be a Win-Win action for the marsh, the surrounding community, the
human visitors to the marsh from all locations, the wildlife that inhabits the marsh and the George
Washington Memorial Parkway. Time is of the essence!

Mr. Alexcy Romero, Superintendent
George Washington Memorial Parkway
National Park Service
700 George Washington Parkway
Turkey Run Park Headquarters
McLean, Virginia 22101
Attn: Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration Plan/EIS
Dear Mr. Romero:
Porto Vecchio Condominium (PVC), which is adjacent to the northern border of Dyke Marsh on the
Potomac River, wishes to convey several comments about the Draft Plan/EIS.
First, we strongly support Alternative C: Hydrologic Restoration and Fullest Possible Extent of Wetland
Restoration (Preferred Alternative). The educational, scientific, and recreational benefits of restored
wetlands along our Potomac shoreline will accrue to the people who live here now and to future
generations. The benefits to native plants and wildlife of our region will be immeasurable, as is the sheer
beauty that is the Dyke Marsh Wetland now and even more so after it is fully restored. It is a rare oasis and
refuge in our urban area.
Further, a larger, restored marsh can be a natural defense that helps buffer against storms and reduces the
likelihood of flooding in our region, thus reducing costs of responding to damage from severe storms. We
support efforts to repair environmental damages from the various large-scale construction projects in this
region and to protect this scenic refuge from further damages.
Second, we have serious concerns about the siltation at the mouth of the Hunting Creek. As you state in
the draft Plan/EIS:
"The outfall of Hunting Creek and Cameron Run into the Potomac River has been altered by the
development of the George Washington Memorial Parkway, urbanization within the watershed, the

398

George Washington Memorial Parkway

Appendix D: Public Comment Analysis Report

development of a golf course along the creek and parkway, and upstream channelization. The sediment
load from Hunting Creek, which was once carried toward the marsh and helped maintain a depositional
environment, is now deposited mostly north of the marsh at the creek's confluence with the Potomac
River, where mudflats and emergent wetlands are beginning to develop" (draft Plan/EIS, Exec. Summary,
pp. ii-iii and see Cumulative Impacts, pp. 121, 123-124).
We request a substantive addition to the analysis in the final plan/EIS that addresses NPS's intentions in
regard to removing and/or minimizing this unwanted siltation and devising a means for the outfall of
Hunting Creek to once again be carried south toward the marsh and help feed it with ongoing
sedimentation to counteract the inevitable erosion of Dyke Marsh over time, even with a promontory in
place.
Third, we are unclear as to how or whether the promontory proposed for the south end of Dyke Marsh
will impact the siltation problems in the area where Hunting Creek enters the Potomac River. Since this
area is directly adjacent to and in front of our condominium, we urge that this question also be addressed
in your analysis and in your response to public comments.
Last, PVC urges NPS not to execute the option of filling in the vicinity of the Belle Haven Marina, which is
a public asset that provides much needed recreational opportunities for area residents.
The residents of PVC are looking forward to the initiation and completion of the restoration project and
wish you the best in your efforts.
Sincerely,
Kay Frances Dolan,
President

The West Potomac High School crew team joins the boaters of Belle Haven Marina who are in favor of
using fill from dredging the marina to restore the Dyke Marsh wetlands area. This would allow continued
use of the marina, which the crew team hopes to one day have access to, while keeping the treasures of the
natural habitat thriving through restoration.
West Potomac Crew wants to be a good neighbor to Dyke Marsh. We currently have 76 rowers on the
team and have to cross the river to row out of National Harbor in Prince George's County. While we are
very grateful to the property managers of National Harbor for allowing the team access to the river at that
site, we know that this may not always be the arrangement in the future should they development that part
of their property. West Potomac Crew hopes that the option to launch and row from our neighborhood
marina that is jogging distance from the school may become a reality someday and we seek to work in
partnership with Friends of Dyke Marsh to keep the wetlands healthy.

Restoration of Dyke Marsh is an effort that I support for all of the reasons stated in your analysis. As an
active boater on the Potomac River and Commodore of Mount vernon Yacht club I (and the boating
community) do not want to lose one of the few access points for recreation along the Virginia side of the
Potomac River.
The Marina and boat ramps at Bell Haven is one of two public access points in Virginia north of Pohick.
This facility supports sailing, fishing, and pleasure boating for most of Fairfax and Alexandria; maintaining
access to the River should be equally important to the NPS as restoration of the historic wetlands.
Please support Option #2.

I write you as the President of Stratford Landing Citizens Association (SLCA). The SLCA represents 760
households adjacent to the Potomac River and Little Hunting Creek. We oppose the suggestion in
proposal C that Belle Haven Marina might not be economically feasible into the future. This appears to be
a veiled threat given the nature of the relationship between the Park Service as Landlord and the
concessionaire running the marina.
The first words spoken by the Park Service representative at the open house were: "Belle Haven Marina
will not be closed". It was further referenced as a historic landmark. If US Park Service genuinely believes
this, it will remove the language in the proposal C about the filling of the mooring field which, in
conjunction with its responsibility as the Landlord, is part and partial to the health of Belle Haven Marina.
In fact, the Park Service could go further and commit to use dredge material from the dredging of the
approach channel to Belle Haven Marina as one source of its fill for the marsh. This would go far to
solidify its questioned commitment to Belle Haven Marina as a viable resource which this proposal notes
is far more often accessed than the marsh itself!
I've always felt that access to the river from Belle Haven Marina has been the best means of reinforcing
the need to maintain the marsh. Their futures are well tied together. It has been my great pleasure to
introduce many of our local youth (via cub scouts) and their families, as well as many friends who know &
use the GW PKWY regularly to the "other side of the coin". All have enjoyed the beautiful vistas from the
road and many have traveled the bike path. But they all marvel at the view looking back on the marsh from
the river. Working towards the marina's demise, as some suspect, negates this great value.
With our children constantly stimulated by electronic games and the like, we need something to rival that
artificial stimulation and it exists at Belle Haven Marina. Water sports work to this end and provide the
additional opportunity of exposure to a resource they will need to maintain in the future (a goal we all
share!)

Comments of Mount Vernon-Lee Chamber of Commerce
Regarding EIS No. 20140006 Draft EIS, NPS, VA,
Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and Long-term Management Plan
March 17, 2014
Mount Vernon-Lee Chamber of Commerce is the premier business organization for the south Fairfax
area with more than 350 members. On behalf of our members we would like to register our concerns with
the implementation of the Dyke Marsh Restoration and Long Term Management Plan and in particular
language contained in Alternative C, the Preferred Alternative presented by the National Park Service
(NPS). Preserving and maintaining Belle Haven Marina is a top community concern and implementation
of Alternative C does not clearly state the continued operation of this business.
Dyke Marsh and Belle Haven Marina are both popular recreation destinations and a critical launching
and mooring field for boaters in the Washington area. The two destinations are from a geographical sense,
bound to each other. The marina provides a boat ramp, slips, sailboat rental, paddle craft rental and
launch, and a sailing school. Area residents launch boats and paddle craft to fish, bird-watch and enjoy the
wildlife fostered by Dyke Marsh. The marina also serves important education programs such as the
Chesapeake Bay Foundations Potomac River Program which teaches youth conservation and
preservation.
The vitality of both Dyke Marsh and Belle Haven Marina rely on a balanced management plan that fosters
the sustainability of the marsh and the economic viability of the marina. However, current language
contained in Alternative C could curtail or eliminate marina operations. This language should be removed
from Alternative C:
This alternative contains an optional 20-acre restoration cell in the area currently serving as mooring for
the marina. Such an option would only be implemented should the marina concession no longer be
economically viable for the current concessioner, and no other concessioner expresses interest in taking
over the business, eliminating the need for the mooring field. Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and
Long-term Management Plan / EIS, page 37.

Appendix D: Public Comment Analysis Report

The National Park Service is the leaseholder to the concessionaire (in this case Belle Haven Marina) and
sets the lease requirements, insurance minimums, and defines what is or is not economic viability.
Language in the Draft ESI leads to the conclusion that the concessionaire could be denied renewal of the
lease at any time. A consistent and fair approach to Belle Haven Marina will keep this business open to
serve the community. Belle Haven Marina is and has been consistently at 100% sip occupancy with more
than 400 families on the waiting list for slips. This is important testimony towards the need to maintain the
20 acres of current mooring field. The marina and sailing school also contribute heavily to the local
economy by providing 45-50 jobs and support nearby retail and restaurants.

Closing Belle Haven Marina would mean no public boat launch for more than 20 miles of the Potomac
River even though the nations taxpayers, through the National Park System, pay for a good stretch of
maintaining that river shore. Placing the access this marina provides to the urban and suburban
population in such jeopardy also directly conflicts with National Park Service initiatives to remove
obstacles to park access.
It is important to recognize the importance of maintaining the connection to the water that facilities such
as Belle Haven Marina provide, particularly in an urban area such as Washington. For disadvantaged
youth, on the water experiences are only made possible by supporting recreational facilities like the
marina.
We strongly urge the National Park Service to eliminate language in the Preferred Alternative that puts in
jeopardy the continued operation of Belle Haven Marina. The goal of continued operation of Belle Haven
Marina should be clearly stated in the EIS. There is a balance to be found in providing access to Dyke
Marsh and the Potomac River while preserving the very elements that make these natural areas such
attractive destinations. Preserving public access to the marsh and river via support and enhancement of
the Belle Haven Marina must be a primary goal of any new management plan.
Additionally, dredging of Belle Haven Marina and the use of such dredge material to rebuild eroded areas
of Dyke Marsh would be a win-win strategy in moving forward and supporting both entities. Creating
deeper slips and mooring areas will help to solidify the area for generations to come, while the use of
native soils as fill to restore Dyke Marsh will cut down in refurbishment costs.
In conclusion, Mount Vernon-Lee Chamber of Commerce strongly urges the National Park Service to 1)
eliminate the referenced language in the DRAFT EIS, 2) add language that guarantees the continued
operation of Belle Haven Marina, and 3) dredge Belle Haven Marina and use this material as fill as part of
the restoration process. Preserving both Belle Haven Marina and Dyke Marsh and the recreational and
educational opportunities they provide are important community goals and can be accomplished during
this process.

Alex Romero, Superintendent
Attn: Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration Plan/EIS
George Washington Memorial Parkway
700 George Washington Memorial Parkway
Turkey Run Park Headquarters
McLean, VA 22101
Dear Superintendent Romero,
Thank you for the opportunity to review and comment on the Draft Plan/EIS for Dyke Marsh
Restoration. Chesapeake Bay Foundation represents over 200,000 members throughout the 64,000 square
mile Chesapeake watershed. CBF supports restoration of historically important habitats throughout the
watershed, especially those that would have a potential positive water quality benefit going forward.
Upon review of the Plan/EIS, CBF has some questions about the project's assumed source of fill material
for containment cells in the preferred scenario. For example, it is unclear whether the project would
conduct its own dredging for fill material in the containment cells and deep channel or whether NPS
considered economies of scale that could be enjoyed if ongoing and proposed commercial dredging
activities in the vicinity were that source of material. Choosing the latter would minimize the negative
environmental effects of river dredging and provide a reasonable alternative to upland or offsite disposal
for those projects.
In particular, CBF has just reviewed plans to dredge an 84.5 acre area of open water around National
Harbor under Corps of Engineers Public Notice PN 14-05 which indicate the fate of that dredged
material is to be barged to Port Tobacco and then transported by watertight trucks to the Weanack
placement site in Charles City, VA. Notwithstanding a need to confine any of that material because of
concerns for contamination of the river, would it not be more cost-effective for both projects to
collaborate on dredging and placement within the confines of the tidal upper Potomac River? The
National Harbor Project exhibits a large potential to cause harm to the aquatic environment through such
an extensive area of dredging, specifically negating the potential for expanding beds of submerged aquatic
vegetation to occupy an area of improving water quality. The negative impacts on the vicinity of Dyke

Final Dyke Marsh Wetland Restoration and Long-term Management Plan / EIS

405

Appendix D: Public Comment Analysis Report

Marsh from the National Harbor development and increased ferry traffic are well documented in the EIS.
Heretofore, no mitigation plans for the proposed future impacts of dredging and overwater structures at
National Harbor have been offered. CBF requested a public hearing on the National Harbor proposal on
February 15, 2014 from the Corps of Engineers and requested special attention to the project through
Maryland's Coastal Zone Program federal consistency review. We are uncertain as to whether National
Harbor and Dyke Marsh are served by two different Corps of Engineers districts, and as such, whether it
the Corps and other review agencies have internally communicated the potential relatedness of the two
proposals. We are coordinating this response with our Virginia Office to see if there are additional federal
consistency processes that should be initiated in Virginia.
It was apparent the National Park Service considered past natural processes leading to the formation of
the marsh and anthropogenic disturbances that disrupted those natural processes leading to the current
degraded condition of Dyke Marsh. The restoration plan appears to address the structural
reconfiguration of the marsh by providing the placid water environment for suspended sediments to
accrete, but does not reveal any quantified model outputs that would suggest the sediment budget exists
for that accretion to actually occur. If historic bed load sediments from upland sources remain
constrained by Haul Road or George Washington Memorial Parkway, they may not reach the marsh and
further subsidence is likely. Moreover, the plan seems to fail to acknowledge ongoing processes that will
act on the restored structure in the future. In the sediment transport model, for example, did the NPS
ascertain that the completed marsh restoration project will have enough suspended sediment supply to
keep pace with projected sea level rise in the freshwater tidal Potomac? If not, the investment in the
structural marsh restoration could be short-lived. Raising this issue puts a finer point on the potential for
linking cell construction phases with proposed and ongoing maintenance dredging activities at National
Harbor as the need to dredge and the need to augment sediment in the marsh could be planned together
in the future.
The Plan/EIS alternative C also mentions the potential for restoration of submerged aquatic vegetation,
but does not describe construction elements or future process conditions such as better light penetration
or proximity to extant beds for seed source which will be necessary for re-establishment of SAV.
Ongoing invasive species control programs may have the potential to perpetuate a regime of disturbance
that would prevent a more stable platform for native species reintroductions. Has a risk analysis been
performed to compare bioengineering, carbon sequestration and water quality benefits of certain invasive
species such as Phragmites that can trap sediments and add marsh elevation over time, with the potential
loss of biodiversity of native marsh stands as a result of Phragmites presence? Invasive species control
programs may need to be nuanced to protect rare freshwater tidal vegetation stands while still taking
advantage of the bioengineering capabilities of certain invasive species.
In conclusion, CBF is in full support of Dyke Marsh restoration and appreciates the thorough evaluation
and planning process represented by the EIS. With attention to ongoing activities and an elevated federal
agency collaboration process, the project can be greatly improved to serve good government and a
healthy Chesapeake Bay.
Sincerely,

As the nation’s principal conservation agency, the Department of the Interior has responsibility for most
of our nationally owned public lands and natural resources. This includes fostering wise use of our land
and water resources, protecting our fish and wildlife, preserving the environmental and cultural values of
our national parks and historic places, and providing for the enjoyment of life through outdoor recreation.
The department assesses our energy and mineral resources and works to ensure that their development is
in the best interests of all our people. The department also promotes the goals of the Take Pride in
America campaign by encouraging stewardship and citizen responsibility for the public lands and
promoting citizen participation in their care. The department also has a major responsibility for American
Indian reservation communities and for people who live in island territories under U.S. administration.
