DOE’s proposed action would provide approximately $1 billion of funding (primarily under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act) to support construction and operation of the FutureGen 2.0 Project. The funding would be used for project design and development, procurement of capital equipment, construction, and to support a 56-month demonstration period for a coal-fueled electric generation plantintegrated with carbon capture and storage. For the FutureGen 2.0 Project, the Alliance would construct and operate a 168-megawatt electrical (MWe) gross output coal-fueled electric generation plant using advanced oxy-combustion technology. The plant would use existing infrastructure, including the existing steam turbine generator (Unit 4), at Ameren Energy Resources’ Meredosia Energy Center on the Illinois River just south of Meredosia, Illinois. The proposed project would include facilities designedtocapture at least 90 percent of the carbon dioxide (CO2) that would otherwise be emitted to the atmosphere during steady-state operation, equivalent to approximately 1.2 million tons (1.1 million metric tons) of CO2 captured per year. The captured CO2 would be compressed and transported via a new underground pipeline, approximately 30 miles long and nominally 10 to 12 inches in diameter, to a geologic storage area in eastern Morgan County, where it would be injected and stored in the Mt. Simon Formation (a saline aquifer) approximately 4,000 feet below the ground surface. The project would also employ systems for the monitoring, verification, and accounting of the CO2 being geologically stored. Visitor, research, and training facilities would be sited in the vicinity of Jacksonville, Illinois. The proposed project would provide performance and emissions data, as well as establish operating and maintenance experience, that would facilitate future large-scale commercial deployment of oxy-combustion technology and geologic CO2 storage. DOE is the lead federal agencyresponsible for preparation of this EIS. DOE prepared the EIS pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and in compliance with the Council on Environmental Quality(CEQ) implementing regulations for NEPA (40 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] 1500 through 1508) and DOE NEPA implementing procedures (10 CFR 1021). The EIS evaluates the potential environmental impacts of the FutureGen 2.0 Project as part of DOE’s decision-making process to determine whether to provide financial assistance. The EIS also analyzes the no action alternative, under which DOE would not providefinancialassistance forthe FutureGen 2.0 Project. Public Participation: DOE encourages public participation in the NEPA process. The Notice of Availability of the Draft EIS appeared in the Federal Register on May 3, 2013, which invited comments on the Draft EIS through the end of the comment period on June 17, 2013. DOE conducted a public hearing for the Draft EIS in Jacksonville, Illinois, on May 21, 2013, which included an informational session for one hour prior to the formal hearing. During the hearing, the public was encouraged to provide oral comments and to submit written comments to DOE through the close of the comment period. DOE also considered late comments. A summary of the public hearing is included in new Appendix I alongwithall agency and public commentsontheDraft EISandDOEresponses. Changes fromthe Draft EIS: In this Final EIS, bold text and vertical lines in the margin indicate where the Draft EIS has been revised or supplemented (as exemplified by this paragraph). Deletions are not demarcated.

DOE’s proposed action would provide financial assistance to the FutureGen Industrial Alliance (the Alliance) for the FutureGen 2.0 Project. DOE is the federal agency responsible for preparation of this EIS, which was prepared pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and in compliance with the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) implementing regulations (40 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] 1500-1508) and DOE NEPA implementing procedures (10 CFR 1021). To date, DOE has authorized the expenditure of funds for the purpose of project definition, cost estimating, and preliminary and front-end engineering design activities, and to facilitate environmental review. Such activities do not have an adverse impact on the environment or limit the choice of reasonable alternatives. This EIS will inform DOE’s decision of whether to authorize the expenditure of additional funds for final design, construction, and initial operation of the FutureGen 2.0 Project. FutureGen 2.0 is a public-private partnership with the purpose of developing the world’s first large-scale oxy-combustion electric generation project integrated with carbon capture and storage. The FutureGen 2.0 Project replaces the original FutureGen Project (DOE/EIS-0394) as explained in Section 1.2. The FutureGen 2.0 Project consists of two major components: the Oxy-Combustion Large Scale Test and the Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Pipeline and Storage Reservoir (see Figure S-1). To date, DOE has authorized the expenditure of cost-shared funding to support project definition and planning efforts under Phase I and Phase II. DOE proposes to provide approximately $1 billion of financial assistance to the Alliance that would support preliminary and final design (completion of Phase II), construction and commissioning (Phase III), and operations (Phase IV). FutureGen 2.0 Project Features Oxy-Combustion Large Scale Test – Construction and operation of an integrated oxy-combustion coal boiler with CO2 capture, purification, and compression. Oxy-combustion is the combustion of coal with a mixture of manufactured oxygen and recycled flue gas (instead of air), resulting in a gas by-product that is primarily CO2. CO2 Pipeline – Construction and operation of approximately 30 miles of pipeline to transport CO2 from the Meredosia Energy Center to a storage reservoir in Morgan County. Storage Reservoir – Construction and operation of surface facilities and injection and permanent storage of captured CO2 into a deep geologic formation. (Ameren), would upgrade one unit in a power plant currently owned by Ameren near Meredosia, Illinois (see Figure S-2). The repowered unit would include oxy-combustion and carbon capture technologies provided by the Babcock & Wilcox Power Generation Group, Inc. and Air Liquide Process and Construction, Inc. The unit would capture at least 90 percent of its CO2 emissions during steady-state operation and reduce other emissions to near zero. The captured CO2 would be transported through a 30-mile pipeline to injection wells where it would be injected deep into a geologic saline formation for permanent storage. The project would be designed to capture, transport, and inject approximately 1.2 million tons (1.1 million metric tons) of CO2 annually, up to a total of 24 million tons (22 million metric tons) over approximately 20 years. The Alliance would also construct and operate a visitor and research center in addition to training facilities related to carbon capture and storage in the vicinity of Jacksonville, Illinois. The DOE-funded demonstration period would last for 56 months from the start of operations (approximately 2017) through 2022. Figure S-2. Project Location Map The Alliance is a non-profit membership organization created to benefit the public interest and the interests of science through research, development, and demonstration of near-zero emissions coal technology. It was formed to partner with DOE on the FutureGen Initiative, announced by President George W. Bush on February 27, 2003. Members of the Alliance include some of the largest coal producers, coal users, and coal equipment suppliers in the world. The Alliance’s current members are: Alpha Natural Resources, Inc.; Anglo American, SA; Joy Global, Inc.; Peabody Energy Corporation; and Xstrata PLC. The active role of industry in this FutureGen Initiative ensures that the public and private sector share the cost and risk of developing the advanced technologies necessary to commercialize the FutureGen concept.  DOEPURPOSE AND NEED DOE considers the advancement of carbon capture and storage technology critically important to addressing CO2 emissions and global climate change concerns associated with coal-fueled energy. The purpose of DOE’s proposed action is to demonstrate the commercial feasibility of an advanced coal-based energy technology (oxycombustion) that can serve as a cost-effective approach to implementing carbon capture at new and existing coal-fueled energy facilities. The proposed project would also demonstrate utility-scale integration of transport and permanent storage of captured CO2 in a deep geologic formation. Implementation of the FutureGen 2.0 Project supports the objectives of the FutureGen Initiative to establish the feasibility and viability of producing electricity from coal with at least 90 percent CO2 capture during steady-state operation and near-zero emissions of air pollutants. One of DOE's primary strategic goals is to protect our national and economic security by promoting a diverse supply and delivery of reliable, affordable, and environmentally sound energy. DOE’s action is needed to further this strategic goal with the recognition that coal serves an important role in the nation’s energy supply, and that there is growing need to upgrade or replace the nation’s aging energy infrastructure. The development of carbon capture and storage technologies through the FutureGen 2.0 Project would demonstrate a viable path forward for the ongoing and future use of the nation’s abundant coal reserves in a manner that addresses both aging infrastructure and environmental challenges. Federal financial support is needed to help reduce the risks inherent in these first-of-a-kind projects, which without financial assistance would be unlikely to occur. DOEPROPOSED ACTION DOE proposes to provide approximately $1 billion of financial assistance to the Alliance for the FutureGen 2.0 Project. The financial assistance would support final design (Phase II), construction and commissioning (Phase III), and operations (Phase IV). The FutureGen 2.0 Project consists of two major components: the Oxy-Combustion Large Scale Test and the CO2 Pipeline and Storage Reservoir (see Figure S-1). The proposed action would support the FutureGen 2.0 Project components as summarized in the Description of the FutureGen 2.0 Project, below, and described in detail in Chapter 2, Proposed Action and Alternatives (see Sections 2.1, 2.4, and 2.5). ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED BY DOE Section 102(2)(C) of NEPA (42 United States Code 4332(2)(C)) requires that agencies discuss alternatives to the proposed action in an EIS. The purpose and need for a federal action determines the reasonable alternatives to be analyzed in the NEPA process. Thus, any reasonable alternative to the continued funding of the FutureGen 2.0 Project must be capable of satisfying the underlying purpose and need of the FutureGen Initiative. DOE developed the range of reasonable alternatives for the FutureGen 2.0 Project based on:  Evaluation of various clean coal technologies through the Clean Coal Power Initiative (CCPI) Program;  Analysis of the original FutureGen Project in terms of technology, costs, and suitability for geologic storage;  Data obtained and reviewed through variousfunding opportunity announcements; and  Interest of industry to participate in projects to support FutureGen 2.0. No Action Alternative Under the no action alternative, DOE would not continue to fund the FutureGen 2.0 Project into the final design, construction, and operation phases. Without DOE funding, it is unlikely that the Alliance, or industry in general, would undertake the utility-scale integration of CO2 capture and geologic storage with a coal-fueled power plant using oxy-combustion. Therefore, the no action alternative also represents a “no-build” alternative. Without DOE's investment in a utility-scale facility, the development of oxycombustion repowered plants integrated with CO2 capture and geologic storage would also occur more slowly or notat all. Alternatives Dismissed from Further Evaluation Alternative Fuel Sources Because the FutureGen Initiative was conceived for the purpose of encouraging commercial development of advanced coal-based carbon capture and storage technologies, other technologies that cannot serve to carry out that goal are not reasonable alternatives. Nuclear power, renewable energy sources (e.g., wind and solar power), and energy conservation improvements do not address the specific goal of reducing CO2 emissions from coal-fueled energy production and, therefore, are not considered to be reasonable alternatives to FutureGen 2.0. These fuel sources and many others are addressed by other programs and projects in DOE’s diverse portfolio of energy research, development, and demonstration efforts. Alternative Advanced Coal-Based Electric Generating Technologies Technologies for carbon capture at advanced coal-based electric generating facilities fall into two general categories, pre-combustion and post-combustion. Pre-combustion capture technologies remove carbon from the process stream (fuel gas) after the solid coal feed has been converted (i.e., gasified). Post-combustion capture technologies remove carbon from the process stream (flue gas) after it has been combusted in the boiler. As explained in Section 1.2, the original FutureGen Project considered the demonstration of integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) technology for the generation of electricity with pre-combustion capture and storage of CO2 that would otherwise be emitted. Rising costs for the original project delayed DOE’s decision and during the intervening time a number of commercial IGCC projects were proposed, many of which would employ pre-combustion carbon capture technology similar to that which was to be proven by the original FutureGen Project. At the time of award of the FutureGen 2.0 Project, DOE had already awarded funding for four other large-scale projects intended to demonstrate the underlying IGCC concept of the original FutureGen Project. Due to the now-commercial status of IGCC, along with multiple pre-combustion carbon capture projects within DOE’s demonstration portfolio, DOE identified the need for a utility-scale demonstration of post-combustion carbon capture technologies. Accordingly, the agency does not consider pre-combustion technologies to be reasonable alternatives for the FutureGen 2.0 Project. Alternative Retrofitting Technologies Through review and consideration of the data and analysis associated with the original FutureGen Project, DOE identified the repowering of an existing power plant with oxy-combustion technology as the approach that would best meet cost and technology advancement objectives of the FutureGen Initiative. Instead of funding the construction and operation of a new IGCC plant, DOE considered two options for retrofitting an existing power plant to facilitate carbon capture and storage: repowering with oxycombustion technology or post-combustion scrubbing (removal from flue gas). DOE determined that the selection of the oxy-combustion technology for testing and evaluation would complement its CCPI portfolio by providing the opportunity to address a technology option that otherwise would be absent from DOE’s slate of projects. Therefore, DOE chose to consider retrofitting an existing power plant with oxy-combustion technology as a lower-cost replacement for the IGCC process originally proposed in the FutureGen Project. Because DOE is already assessing the merits of post-combustion scrubbing in other projects, the agency does not consider that technology to be a reasonable alternative for the FutureGen 2.0 Project. Alternative Sites for the Oxy-Combustion Large Scale Test After determining that construction and operation of a new power plant was not reasonable and building upon the findings in the original FutureGen Final EIS, DOE considered potential power plants in the vicinity of the originally proposed Mattoon CO2 power plant and storage site as practicable candidates for the FutureGen 2.0 Project. DOE determined that the Meredosia Energy Center had the only available and appropriately sized electrical generating unit that would be suitable for the FutureGen 2.0 Project. Ameren was willing to make its Meredosia Energy Center Unit No. 4 available for the FutureGen Initiative in part because the aging unit was not a baseload power generator and operated only sporadically to provide peaking power. Therefore, repowering efforts at the Meredosia Energy Center would not pose unacceptable disruptions of power generation or affect existing power purchase agreements. It is difficult for owners of existing power plants to accept the financial and operational risks associated with repowering existing equipment and adding untested CO2 capture and storage to their plants. With no other power plant owners willing to undertake the inherent financial and operational risks, DOE considers the Meredosia Energy Center to be the only viable location for the Oxy-Combustion Large Scale Test component of FutureGen 2.0. DOE does not consider other power plants that are unavailable to the FutureGen 2.0 Project to be reasonable alternatives. Alternative CO2 Pipeline and Storage Reservoir Locations After DOE identified the Meredosia Energy Center for the evolving FutureGen Initiative, the Mattoon site proponents withdrew their site from further consideration based on a determination that use of the site strictly for CO2 storage was not in the community’s best interest. In response to the Mattoon site being withdrawn as a storage site, DOE asked the Alliance to identify alternate storage sites to which it would be economically viable to transport the CO2 captured at the Meredosia Energy Center for injection and permanent storage in the same geologic formation as proposed for the Mattoon site (the Mt. Simon Formation). The Alliance then undertook a siting process, similar to the original process used to select the Mattoon site, to identify possible locations. The Alliance’s siting process included screening sites using specific qualifying criteria related to geologic conditions as well as a variety of other factors, including land use and environmental considerations (see Section 2.5.2.1). This process culminated in the selection of a site in Morgan County as the Alliance’s preferred site, with two sites (in Christian County and Douglas County) identified as potential alternate sites. The Alliance conducted a detailed geological stratigraphic analysis at the preferred Morgan County site to characterize and verify the viability of the proposed CO2 storage reservoir. The Alliance also conducted pipeline routing studies for the three sites under consideration, as well as desktop and targeted field studies to evaluate sensitive environmental resources that could be adversely affected by the project. Based on the findings of the geological analysis and environmental studies, combined with a cost analysis of the pipelines to the alternate sites, the Alliance confirmed that the proposed Morgan County site remained its preferred site. Through these analyses, the Alliance also determined that the costs of siting, constructing, and operating a CO2 pipeline to either the Christian County or Douglas County sites would be cost-prohibitive. The Alliance estimated that an additional $50 million to $100 million would be required to construct a pipeline that would be approximately 50 miles (Christian County) or 100 miles (Douglas County) longer than a pipeline required for the Morgan County site. On July 17, 2012, the Alliance Board of Directors affirmed that the proposed Morgan County site remained its preferred location and voted to direct the Alliance to no longer pursue the sites in Christian County and Douglas County as alternate sites due to cost considerations. The Alliance notified DOE and the proponents of Christian County and Douglas County that their locations were no longer being considered as alternate sites and that the Alliance would not construct or operate a CO2 storage reservoir at either site. As a result, the site proponents were released to find other uses for their proposed sites. Because of the Alliance’s decision to no longer consider the Christian County and Douglas County sites, DOE has determined that these sites are not reasonable alternatives as CO2 storage reservoirs for FutureGen 2.0. Therefore, these sites have been eliminated fromfurther consideration in this EIS. EISSCOPING PROCESS On May 23, 2011, DOE published a Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare EIS Scoping an EIS in the Federal Register (FR) under Docket ID No. FR Doc. 2010–12632 (76 FR 29728). The NOI initially identified potential EIS scoping is the process by which issues and areas of impact that would be addressed in the EIS. After the scope of issues and alternatives to issuing the NOI, DOE conducted three public scoping meetings and be examined in the EIS is determined. The process includes soliciting input consulted with various interested governmental agencies and from the public and consulting with stakeholders. During the public scoping period, DOE solicited public interested governmental agencies and input to ensure that: (1) significant issues were identified early; stakeholders, to identify public and (2) issues of minimal significance would not consume excessive time agency concerns and significant issues. and effort; and (3) the EIS would be thorough and balanced, in accordance with applicable regulations and guidance. DOE held public scoping meetings on the dates indicated at the following locations:  June 7, 2011, at Taylorville High School, Taylorville, Illinois  June 8, 2011, at Ironhorse Golf Club, Tuscola, Illinois  June 9, 2011, at the Elks Lodge, Jacksonville, Illinois The public scoping period ended on June 22, 2011, after a 30-day comment period. During the comment period, DOE accepted comments by telephone, facsimile, U.S. mail, and email. In general, respondents expressed concerns regarding potential impacts to farmers and farmland (e.g., loss of farmland or impacts to soil). Other concerns included: issues with the experimental nature of the project; a lack of confidence that economic benefits would occur; concerns about the use of public funds for a private endeavor; belief that DOE funding should go toward renewable and alternative energy technologies from sources other than coal; and concerns about potential increased electricity costs for consumers. The majority of issues strictly related to natural resources tended to be general in nature (e.g., potential impacts to surface waters should be addressed). Additionally, two petitions in opposition to the project, signed by a total of approximately 340 residents and landowners in Morgan County, and one petition signed by 55 residents and landowners in Douglas County, were submitted to DOE. Of the commentors that responded favorably for the project, many commented positively primarily due to economic and job creation benefits for the community, as well as benefits in terms of self-sufficient national energy production. Following the intent of NEPA, DOE uses the scoping process to focus the analysis of issues and impacts in the EIS. Rather than providing responses to specific comments received during scoping, DOE endeavors to ensure that the EIS addresses and analyzes issues and potential environmental impacts appropriately based on commentor concerns. Chapter 1 (see Table 1-1) provides a summary of the scoping comments received, organized by comment category or applicable resource area, and it identifies the appropriate sections in the EIS where the respective issues are addressed. The subjects and issues raised in specific comments are summarized in more detail in Table 3 of Appendix A, Public Scoping. DOE also contacted federal and state agencies and Native American tribes during the scoping process to initiate interagency and intergovernmental coordination requirements under various laws. Consultation with the Illinois State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) resulted in the development of a Programmatic Agreement signed by DOE, the Alliance, the SHPO, and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation that outlines steps to address potential discoveries protected by the National Historic Preservation Act (see Appendix B, Cultural Resources Consultation [B3]). Consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Illinois Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) resulted in the identification of species protected by the Endangered Species Act and by state law to be addressed in the EIS. DOE contacted the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to discuss the potential need for wetland permitting under Sections 10 and 404 of the Clean Water Act, and contacted the U.S. and Illinois Departments of Agriculture (IDOA) to ensure conformance with the Federal Farmland Protection Policy Act. In compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act, DOE contacted the 18 federally-recognized Native American tribal organizations that could have a cultural or historic affiliation with the area to be affected by the proposed project, based on the National Park Service’s listing of tribes to be contacted in conformance with the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act. COMMENTS RECEIVED ON THE DRAFT EIS DOE produced the FutureGen 2.0 Draft EIS in April 2013 and published a Notice of Availability (NOA) in the Federal Register on May 3, 2013 (78 FR 26004), which is included in Appendix I, Public Comments on the Draft EIS. On the same date, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) published its NOA for the Draft EIS (78 FR 26027), which initiated the 45-day public comment period (from May 3 to June 17, 2013). On May 21, 2013, DOE held a public hearing on the Draft EIS for the FutureGen 2.0 Project at Jacksonville High School, Jacksonville, Illinois. An informational session was held from 5:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m., followed by the formal presentations and comment period from 6:00 p.m. to approximately 8:00 p.m. Appendix I, Public Comments on the Draft EIS, provides a summary of the public hearing and commenting period. In addition to the notice of the hearing in the NOA, DOE posted notices in three area newspapers (Jacksonville Journal-Courier, Springfield State Journal-Register, and Illinois Farm Week) during the three weeks prior to the public hearing that announced the hearing date, time, location, and purpose. DOE also distributed notifications for the public hearing on April 26, 2013, including 147 letters each with a hardcopy of the Draft EIS, 164 notification letters alone, and 180 notifications by email. A total of 46people signed attendance sheets for the public hearing, and seven individuals signed up to give oral comments. During the informational session, the public was invited to view various displays about the NEPA process and the FutureGen 2.0 Project and to talk with DOE and Alliance representatives. During the formal hearing, presentations were made by the DOE Document Manager and the Alliance’s Chief Executive, and the floor was opened for public comments. A court reporter recorded the formal presentations and oral comments as documented in the transcript included in Appendix I, Public Comments on the Draft EIS. DOE received comments from two federal agencies, two state agencies, one local elected official, four non-governmental or public-private organizations, and seven members of the public during the official 45-day comment period, including the oral comments at the hearing. The comments are catalogued according to the specific comments by each respective commentor in Appendix I, Public Comments on the Draft EIS, along with DOE’s response to each comment. In aggregate, a total of 116 comments were received in 19 separate submissions from 16 individuals (1 member of the public spoke at the hearing and also submitted 3 sets of written comments). In preparing the Final EIS, DOE fully considered all comments both individually and cumulatively, including comments received after the closing date. The largest proportion of comments related to the adequacy of information provided about the project and potential impacts. The majority of resource-specific comments focused on socioeconomic issues, geology, and climate and greenhouse gas emissions. Another substantial group of comments was distributed relatively evenly among concerns about health and safety, biological resources, NEPA requirements, and air quality. The remaining group of comments was distributed among other subject areas: alternatives, land use, purpose and need, cumulative impacts, environmental justice, regulatory issues, surface water, wetlands, groundwater, physiography and soils, and utilities. Comments about the adequacy of information in the Draft EIS expressed dissatisfaction with the level of detail provided about the project and engineering features, alleged that the Alliance withheld or provided inconsistent information, questioned the Alliance’s qualifications to complete the project, claimed that the Draft EIS did not provide adequate information about financial assurances and monitoring for the geologic CO2 storage component, or alleged other deficiencies in project information. Several comments on socioeconomic issues expressed support for the project based on the potential for economic stimulus and other benefits. Other socioeconomic comments expressed concerns about potential cost overruns and the adverse impacts on taxpayers and ratepayers. Additional comments questioned whether the project would be justified by a full cost-benefit analysis, expressed concerns about economic risks, or questioned whether economic benefits would be realized. Geology-related comments expressed concerns about whether selection of the CO2 storage area was justified, whether the geologic storage formation could adequately support the project, whether the caprock formation could withstand the chemical effects of CO2 injection, and similar issues. Comments on climate and greenhouse gases included some that questioned whether the project would in fact reduce greenhouse gas emissions, questioned the validity of climate change, or expressed concerns about other greenhouse gas issues. Other comments expressed support for the project based on potential reductions in emissions from fossil fuel combustion. The balance of comments addressed other subjects, including potential health and safety risks associated with leakage from the CO2 storage formation or the pipeline, mitigation for potential biological resource impacts, concerns about DOE’s implementation of NEPA, claims that the purpose and need or consideration of alternatives were not adequately addressed, or concerns about potential impacts on other resources. PRINCIPAL CHANGES BETWEEN THE DRAFT AND FINAL EIS The Draft EIS primarily analyzed the Alliance's initial design for the FutureGen 2.0 Project. Throughout DOE's NEPA process, the Alliance continued to develop its conceptual and preliminary designs for the oxy-combustion facility, CO2 pipeline, injection wells and associated surface facilities for permanent geologic CO2 storage, and educational facilities. The Final EIS reflects the changes made as more information became available, including: (a) project design changes, (b) studies not completed in time to be included in the Draft EIS, and (c) recent regulatory developments. DOE also revised and updated the Final EIS as appropriate in response to comments received on the Draft EIS as discussed above. Table S-1 (new in the Final EIS) summarizes the principal changes in the project between the Draft and Final EIS and explains how these changes affected respective sections in the Final EIS.

After extensive field work and coordination with landowners and federal and state agencies (i.e., Illinois SHPO, the IDNR, and the USACE), the Alliance further defined the most likely pipeline route. The route was selected based on coordination with landowners and consideration of constructability, access to existing ROWs, and the desire to avoid, to the extent possible, sensitive environmental resources such as wetlands, cultural resources, forest land, and threatened or endangered species and their habitats.  Since publication of the Draft EIS, the Alliance selected a location for the injection well site and submitted UIC Class VI permit applications to the USEPA for the injection wells. The construction of injection wells cannot begin until the UIC permits are issued. In the Draft EIS, DOE analyzed hypothetical injection well sites and pipeline spurs to represent a range of potential impacts in the Draft EIS. In the Final EIS, DOE analyzes impacts related to the recently proposed injection well site location.  Since publication of the Draft EIS, the Alliance has been working with local landowners to acquire additional pore space rights to ensure that the CO2 plume would not affect subsurface rights of nonparticipating landowners. As a result of these efforts, the size of the CO2 storage study area has been expanded to 6,800 acres with the additional 1,500 acres  DOE/EIS-0460 FUTUREGEN 2.0 PROJECT FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT SUMMARY DOE/EIS-0460 FUTUREGEN 2.0 PROJECT FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT SUMMARY CO2 = carbon dioxide; DOE = U.S. Department of Energy; EIS = Environmental Impact Statement; IDNR = Illinois Department of Natural Resources; IEPA = Illinois Environmental Protection Agency; MWe = megawatt electrical; NEPA = National Environmental Policy Act; ROW = right-of-way; SHPO = State Historic Preservation Office; UIC = Underground Injection Control; USACE = U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; USDOI = United States Department of the Interior; USEPA = United States Environmental Protection Agency; USFWS = United States Fish and Wildlife Service DOE/EIS-0460 FUTUREGEN 2.0 PROJECT FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT SUMMARY DESCRIPTION OF THE FUTUREGEN 2.0PROJECT For the FutureGen 2.0 Project, the Alliance would purchase from Ameren the assets of the Meredosia Energy Center that would be needed for the Oxy-Combustion Large Scale Test component of the proposed project. Ameren suspended plant operations at the end of 2011 but has retained the permits associated with the facility and will maintain the facilities to be available for the FutureGen 2.0 Project. All equipment remains in operable condition, which would enable Ameren to operate the generating facilities if the resumption of operations were to fit Ameren’s requirements. If the FutureGen 2.0 Project is implemented, Ameren would permanently terminate operations of the existing boilers and related power generation infrastructure. With support from Babcock & Wilcox and Air Liquide, the Alliance would design, construct, and operate an advanced oxy-combustion power generation plant. The oxy-combustion project has a proposed design capacity of 168 megawatt electrical (MWe) (gross) and would be integrated into the Meredosia Energy Center in order to make use of existing facilities and infrastructure. The facility would operate continuously to generate baseload electric power. The project would repower the existing Unit 4 steam turbine generator and capture and compress approximately 1.2 million tons (1.1 million metric tons) of CO2 per year for subsequent transport and geologic storage. The project would be designed to meet DOE’s CO2 capture target of at least 90 percent (the project may achieve a 98 percent capture efficiency) during steady-state operation while reducing emissions levels of sulfur oxides, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury, acid gases, and particulate matter during normal operations. The Meredosia Energy Center The Meredosia Energy Center, shown in Figure S-3, is located adjacent to the east side of the Illinois River, south of the village of Meredosia, Illinois. The 5,300-foot western boundary of the 263-acre energy center fronts the Illinois River, where the station's oil and coal barge unloading facilities are located (see Figure S-4). The energy center includes the infrastructure necessary to support the operation of a power generation plant including material and fuel handling and delivery facilities, process water sources, intake structures and treatment systems, stormwater and wastewater systems, cooling systems, and interconnects to high voltage transmission lines. The Meredosia Energy Center includes four electric generating units (see Figure S-5). An electric generating unit refers to the combination, or unit, of equipment used to generate electricity including the boilers that create heat energy through combustion, steam cycle equipment that uses the heat to generate steam, steam turbines that convert the steam to mechanical energy, and electric generators that convert the mechanical energy to electricity. These units also include supporting equipment and facilities. Units 1 and 2 consist of four coal-fired boilers (Boilers 1, 2, 3, and 4), with each unit having a nominal rated generating capacity (i.e., capacity) of 60 MWe. Unit 3 consists of one coal-fired boiler (Boiler 5) and has a capacity of 229 MWe.  Unit 4 consists of one oil-fired boiler (Boiler 6) with a capacity of 200 MWe. Unit 4 was placed in service as an interim measure in 1975 to meet anticipated load growth until new generating facilities came online in 1977. During the 1980s and early 1990s, Unit 4 was operated as a peaking unit, accumulating approximately 20,000 hours of operation, with 900 starts. Peaking units are electric generating units that are only used during periods of high electricity demand. cy = cubic yard; kV = kilovolt; NPDES = National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System The downtown area of the village of Meredosia is approximately 0.25 mile north of the energy center. Meredosia has a population of approximately 1,000 (USCB 2010a) and is approximately 18 miles west of Jacksonville, Illinois. Land use immediately east of the energy center consists of roadways, roadway rights-of-way (ROWs), rail access, and an unused railroad ROW. Beyond these immediate areas, land use is primarily residential to the north and northeast, scattered residential and agricultural to the east, and industrial to the south. Across the river, approximately 700 feet west, are forested lands, a small portion of a levee, and a transmission line ROW. Oxy-Combustion Large Scale Test The Oxy-Combustion Large Scale Test component of the FutureGen 2.0 Project would include the design, construction, and operation of an oxy-combustion power generation facility. The project would repower the existing Unit 4 using a new oxy-combustion coal boiler (in place of the existing oil-fired boiler) with equipment to capture, purify, and compress CO2 for use in the CO2 pipeline and storage reservoir component of the project. The oxy-combustion facility would be integrated into the existing infrastructure of the Meredosia Energy Center and would utilize the existing coal handling systems (delivery, storage, and conveyance), water supply systems (intake structures and wells), wastewater discharge outfalls, the main cooling tower (to be rebuilt from the existing Unit 4 cooling tower), substation equipment, the Unit 4 steam turbine, the Unit 4 electric generator, and other common plant infrastructure such as roadways (see Figures S-4 and S-5). The proposed oxy-combustion facility is based on using the Babcock & Wilcox–Air Liquide cool recycle oxy-combustion process. A simplified diagram of this oxy-combustion system is provided in Figure S-6, with a conceptual layout of how the oxy-combustion system would be configured at the energy center presented in Figure S-7. Major components of the system (new and existing), and an overview of their key features, are provided in Table S-2. The repowered unit would be designed to generate approximately 168 MWe gross. The oxy-combustion system would use a mix of high-sulfur bituminous coal from Illinois and low-sulfur Powder River Basin (Wyoming) coal.  Source: Babcock & Wilcox 2010 ASU = air separation unit; CO2 = carbon dioxide; CPU = compression and purification unit; H2O = water; N2 = nitrogen; NCGs = noncondensable gases;O2 = oxygen; SO2 = sulfurdioxide To accommodate the proposed plant at the Meredosia Energy Center, several existing warehouses, a deaerator, and one of the condensate storage tanks would be relocated. Three existing groundwater supply wells (Wells 3, 4, and 5) would beremoved and one new well would be installed. The main cooling tower would be reconstructed and two additional cooling towers would be constructed, one for the direct contact cooler polishing system and one for both the air separation unit and the compression and purification unit. During construction at the Meredosia Energy Center, the Alliance plans to use the area between the existing boat ramps to the north of the energy center (in Figure S-4 labeled ‘Public Boat Ramp Area’) to unload a number of large equipment modules for the oxy-combustion facility. The modules would be constructed offsite and sent by barge on the Illinois River. The boat ramp area is owned by the village of Meredosia. Only one of the two existing boat ramps would be needed to offload the modules. There are two exits from the boat ramp area to the village, only one of which would be obstructed during barge unloading. Additional phases of project engineering and coordination with the village of Meredosia would be required to determine further accessibility arrangements, but the Alliance expects to ensure that at least one of the boat ramps remains open for public access during project construction. It is anticipated that impacts to the boat ramp area would be short term, lasting between 1 to 3 months during each of several construction unloading timeframes. It is expected that barge unloading activities related to construction of the oxy-combustion facility would begin in 2015 and conclude by 2017. The construction phase for the oxy-combustion facility, including initial demolition, is estimated to occur over a period of approximately 42 months beginning in 2014 and extending through 2017. However, construction would be substantially completed within 30 months, and the last 12 months of construction would overlap with a 1-year commissioning and startup effort. The number of construction and craft workers onsite would range from 100 to 200 for the first 7 months, 300 to 400 for the next 8 months, and 450 to 500 at peak for the next 8 months. Beginning with the 24th month, the onsite construction staff would reduce to approximately 300 for 8 months, then decline to between 50 and 200 for the final 11 months. CO2 Pipeline The CO2 captured by the oxy-combustion facility would be processed for removal of contaminants, and compressed to 2,100 pounds per square inch pressure. The compressed gas would then be delivered to a new nominal 12-inch or 10-inch diameter pipeline for transport to the injection wells located in Morgan County, Illinois. The CO2 wouldbe at least 97 percent pure and transported in a liquid-like dense phase, which is the method of choice adopted by all major CO2 pipeline companies. In this dense phase, the CO2 is non-corrosive and is safe to transport in a pipeline. The Alliance proposes to site, design, construct, and operate a CO2 pipeline approximately 30 miles in length from the Meredosia Energy Center to the injection wells within the CO2 storage study area. The Alliance designated a 4-mile wide corridor to the CO2 storage study area through which the pipeline route would pass. Because the exact pipeline alignment was not known during the analysis for the Draft EIS, DOE used the corridor to set the boundaries and general existing conditions of where the pipeline would be located. Two possible pipeline routes within thiscorridor, the southern route and northern route, were identified by the Alliance (see Figure S-8). In the early stages of the FutureGen 2.0 Project, the Alliance identified the northern route for initial cost-estimating purposes. Based on subsequent discussions with the SHPO, IDNR, and USACE, as well as related investigations and field work, the Alliance identified the southern route as the preferable and proposed pipeline route. The southern pipeline route would utilize existing highway ROWs and further avoid sensitive environmental resources such as wetlands, cultural resources, forest land, and threatened or endangered species and their habitats to the fullest extent possible. Although the northern pipeline route is included in this Final EIS for comparison purposes, the Alliance is no longer considering the northern route for the FutureGen 2.0 Project. ASU = air separation unit; CPU = compression and purification unit; DCCPS = direct contact cooler polishing system; DW = deep well; kV = kilovolt Table S-2. Overview of Oxy-Combustion Facility Components and Features Power Block Generates thermal energy through combustion, converts the thermal energy to steam, and uses steam to create mechanical energy to drive the electric generator that produces electricity. Boiler (new) Combusts pulverized coal with a mixture of oxygen and recycled flue gas. Uses heat generated in the combustion process to generate steam. Gas Quality Control Treats flue gas generated during the combustion process to remove pollutants and System (new) impurities. Directs treated gas to the CPU and also back to the boiler. Includes the following: - CDS to remove sulfur compounds (e.g., sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide); - Pulse jet fabric filter to remove particulates; and - DCCPS for reduction of moisture and additional removal of pollutants to meet CPU purity requirements. Steam Turbines Converts thermal energy captured in steam to mechanical energy through the (existing) spinning of the turbines. Electric Generators Uses mechanical energy (spinning) from turbines to drive electric generators that (existing) produce electricity. Electrical Control Transfers electricity from generators to the transmission grid. System (existing and new) Purifies and compresses treated flue gas for delivery to CO2 pipeline. Additional Equipment Additional equipment is needed to supply process water, provide cooling to plant and Systems processes, supply and handle fuel (coal), and treat waste streams. Cooling Towers The cooling towers include two new cooling towers and reconstruction of the (existing & new) existing Unit 4 cooling tower. Cooling towers are used to provide cool water for the condensation of steam in the steam condenser and to remove excess heat from other system processes (e.g., ASU and CPU). Process Water Includes use of existing water intake structures and wells (one new well) to supply Systems water to the plant and new water treatment systems to remove water impurities. (existing & new) Wastewater Treatment Includes three new wastewater treatment systems that would remove pollutants Systems (new) from wastewater generated in the CPU, the DCCPS, and areas where stormwater could be contaminated by industrial activities. Coal Storage and Includes delivery, storage, and conveyance systems. Handling (existing) Exhaust Stack (new) A new exhaust stack (chimney) would be approximately 450 feet tall and contain two exhaust vents, one for the oxy-combustion boiler during air firing operations and a second for the CPU. The exhaust stack would discharge treated flue gas during normal operations, discharge monitored volumes of flue gas during unit startup and the transition to oxygen-fired status, and discharge flue gas and CO2 during normal shutdown. Auxiliary Boiler (new) A new auxiliary boiler would be used to provide steam to the plant that is needed during the startup process. This would most likely be an oil-fired boiler. ASU = air separation unit; CDS = circulating dry scrubber; CO2 = carbon dioxide; CPU = compression and purification unit; DCCPS = direct contact coolerpolishing system The CO2 pipeline would comply with all applicable pipeline requirements under the U.S. Department of Transportation’s regulation entitled “Transportation of Hazardous Liquids in Pipelines” (49 CFR 195) and provide safeguards to mitigate risks associated with CO2 safety hazards. These safeguards would include mainline block valves to isolate pipeline sections, a leak detection system to alert the operator, and a supervisory control and data acquisition telecommunication system to communicate information and data about pipeline performance. In addition, pipeline monitoring and surveillance procedures would be implemented in the field on a daily basis. The CO2 pipeline would have an operational ROW of 50 feet wide with a construction ROW of 80 feet wide (100 feet in limited circumstances as dictated by terrain). The CO2 pipeline would be constructed over a 4 to 5 month period and in a manner to minimize potential impacts. The number of construction workers for the pipeline would range from 150 to 300. The pipeline would be buried at least 4 feet underground, which is more stringent than required by 49 CFR 195, with additional depth of cover for crossings, drainage ditches, and irrigation tiles. For agricultural land, the pipeline would be buried at least 5 feet deep in accordance with IDOA pipeline construction standards and policies. Topsoil would be removed first and stored separately along the pipeline trench segregated from other subsoil (see Figure S-9). The Alliance signed an Agricultural Impact Mitigation Agreement with the IDOA (see Appendix H, Agricultural Mitigation) that identifies additional mitigation measures during construction related to activities in the ROW (e.g., tree clearing and management of debris). Figure S-9. Recommended Construction Right-of-Way Cross Section Access to the construction ROW would be provided (as much as possible) from existing roads near the pipeline route. Horizontal directional drilling would be used for major waterbody crossings (i.e., waterbodies more than 100 feet wide) to avoid disturbing streambeds. Jack and bore tunneling would be used for smaller surface water features and wetland areas for the same purpose. It is also possible that trenching would be used for crossings of dry stream channels. Existing pipelines would be under-crossed unless over-crossing is specifically permitted by the pipeline owner. All road and railroad crossings would be bored under the road or railroad (i.e., without casings) using heavy wall pipe with abrasion resistant coating. Pipeline operations would be managed and monitored on a continuous basis from a central control room located in the site control and maintenance building at the CO2 injection well site. The central control room would send command and control signals remotely using the supervisory control and data acquisition network to all pump and metering stations and the launcher and receivers in the system. Operation of the pipeline would be performed in full compliance with applicable U.S. Department of Transportation rules and regulations and would require regular visual and in-line inspections to ensure safety and integrity. Pipeline patrolling would be by road, by foot, and potentially by helicopter, contracted to specialist companies. These visual surveys would be conducted every two weeks and would look for signs of leaks (e.g., discolored vegetation, disturbed soil) and potential infrastructure concerns (e.g., exposed pipe at stream crossings). Post-construction monitoring would be conducted (potentially for several years) to ensure that restoration of wetlands and agricultural lands would be undertaken in accordance with all permit and Agricultural Impact Mitigation Agreement requirements. CO2 Storage Study Area The CO2 injection well site(s) would be located within the CO2 storage study area identified in Figure S2. The storage study area would encompass all of the surface facilities required for the injection and monitoring of the CO2 as well as the underground CO2 plume and all properties that hold subsurface rights within the predicted extent of the underground CO2 plume area. Since the Draft EIS was published, the Alliance has been working with local landowners to acquire additional rights to subsurface pore space to maximize flexibility for CO2 injection and to ensure that the CO2 plume would not affect subsurface rights of non-participating landowners. (Non-participating landowners are those who have declined the Alliance’s offer to purchase options for subsurface rights needed for CO2 storage.) As a result of these efforts, the size of the CO2 storage study area has been expanded to 6,800 acres of surface lands. Since publication of the Draft EIS, the Alliance identified a proposed property for the injection well site based on the results of data gathered from a stratigraphic well that was drilled in the CO2 storage study area, other characterization activities, and the results of modeling of reservoir and seal performance. The injection well facilities would be constructed within a site to be acquired by the Alliance consisting of approximately 9.5 acres as shown in Figure S-10. The Alliance would lease an additional 5.5 acres of adjoining property to the north for staging and laydown during the construction phase. The construction would be undertaken in a manner that would avoid areas of jurisdictional wetlands along the western edge of the properties, and the Alliance intends to leave as many trees intact on the properties as practicable. The Alliance cannot construct or operate the injection wells until Underground Injection Control (UIC) permits are issued by the USEPA. The Alliance evaluated several injection well configurations using both vertical and horizontal injection wells at one or two sites. After consideration of site-specific data from the stratigraphic well, the Alliance is currently proposing to construct and operate four horizontal injection wells at one injection well site (the single-site scenario) and is no longer considering the option of two sites with vertical injection wells (the dual-site scenario). Although the Alliance plans to move forward with the single-site configuration, the impact analysis in the Final EIS considers both the single-site scenario and dual-site scenario for comparative purposes. The single-site scenario would involve a single injection well site containing four horizontal wells. The conceptual layout for the injection well site, as depicted in Figure S-11, includes a gravel well pad, a parking lot, and the site control and maintenance building, which would house the well annulus maintenance and monitoring system. The single-site scenario would result in a smaller overall land area requirement for surface facilities compared to the dual-site scenario, because the CO2 injection wells, building, supporting facilities, and access roads would occupy less than 14 acres.  Figure S-11. Single-Site Scenario - Injection Well Site Surface Features Conceptual Layout   The dual-site scenario, as analyzed in the Draft EIS and presented in the Final EIS for comparative purposes, would involve two separate injection well locations, would require the most land area for surface facilities, and would occupy up to 25 acres within the CO2 storage study area. Approximately 10 acres would be needed for the permanent operational footprint of the injection and monitoring wells and associated infrastructure and buildings, while up to 15 acres would be used for access roads to the well sites. As depicted in Figure S-12, the primary injection well location would include the injection well, booster pump building (if required), well maintenance and monitoring building, site control building (including the central control room), and other supporting infrastructure (e.g., parking lots, access roads, etc.). The secondary injection well site (see Figure S-13) would be approximately 200 feet by 200 feet and would be limited to the injection well, well maintenance and monitoring building, and an access road. Both locations would have security fences with controlled access. Additional acreage would be needed during well drilling and construction. Well drilling would require approximately 14 construction workers over 100 to 120 days per well. Construction of the single-site scenario would require approximately 10 to 21 employees over a 25-week period. Construction of the surface facilities for the dual-site scenario would require approximately 10 to 36 construction workers over a 38-week period. The total land area disturbance during construction of the buildings, structures, associated facilities, and access roads, including construction staging areas, would collectively affect approximately 42 acres for the single-site scenario and 91 acres for the dual-site scenario. Pursuant to an Illinois Commerce Commission ruling on the FutureGen 2.0 Project, the Alliance is proposing a 20-year injection period. The injection wells would be designed to collectively inject 1.2 million tons (1.1 million metric tons) of CO2 per year over 20 Safe Drinking Water Act Underground years for a total of up to 24 million tons (22 million metric tons) into Injection Control Program the target formation. The target formation is the Mt.

The Class VI rule The injection wells would be designed, permitted, and constructed as would apply to the FutureGen 2.0 injection wells. Class VI wells in compliance with the Safe Drinking Water Act, UIC Program regulations (40 CFR 146). These regulations include strict standards related to the siting, construction, and monitoring of Class VI wells. The Alliance considered injection well configurations with both vertical and horizontal wells at one or two injection well sites. Figures S-14 and S-15 show the conceptual designs for a horizontal and vertical injection well, respectively. The figures also present the geological stratigraphic column for the CO2 storage study area, showing the depth and thickness of the Mt. Simon Formation. The injection wells would extend into the Mt. Simon Formation. The Alliance filed UIC permit applications (one permit application for each injection well) with the USEPA in March 2013 (revised May 2013). The UIC permit applications proposed an injection well configuration with four horizontal injection wells that originate from one injection well site and operate independently of each other. Ongoing efforts to characterize the geology at the CO2 storage study area, including drilling of a stratigraphic well, have been used to provide an improved geologic understanding of the site. The Figure S-13. Dual-Site Scenario - Secondary Injection Well Site Surface Features Conceptual Layout Alliance conducted computer modeling using data from these efforts to simulate the currently proposed configuration of four horizontal injection wells, which indicates that the underground CO2 plume would expand to encompass an area of approximately 4,000 acres over the 20-year injection period, as shown in Figure S-16. Figure S-16 depicts the predicted CO2 injection plumes after 5, 10, 20, 22, and 70 years. The 22-year plume is the predicted maximum extent of the plume. The impact analysis in this EIS conservatively estimates that the plume would be approximately 4,000 acres in size and contained within the 6,800-acre CO2 storage study area.  The Alliance would implement a monitoring, verification, and accounting (MVA) program to monitor the injection and storage of CO2 within the geologic formations to verify that it stays within the target formation. The MVA program would meet injection control permitting and any additional requirements that DOE may impose. The MVA program would consist of the following components: (1) injection system monitoring; (2) containment monitoring (via monitoring wells, mechanical integrity testing, and other means); (3) CO2 plume tracking via multiple techniques; (4) CO2 injection simulation modeling; and (5) perhaps new experimental techniques not yet in practice. The Alliance anticipates constructing approximately 12 monitoring wells as part of the MVA program. The conceptual monitoring network design is shown in Figure S-16 based on the single-site scenario with four injection wells. The Alliance characterized the injection and confining zones and designed the injection wells to minimize the potential for a CO2 release. If, however, an adverse event were to occur during construction or operation, the Alliance would deploy a variety of emergency or remedial responses, depending on the characteristics of the event (e.g., the location, type, and volume of a release). The individual procedures, based on the event, are described in the MVA plan, which has been included with the UIC Class VI permit applications. In the unlikely event that monitoring indicates that the plume has the potential to migrate outside the study area, the Alliance could make adjustments to the injection rate or the duration of the injection period to prevent this from happening. The DOE-funded demonstration period, with active injection and monitoring, would begin in 2017 and end in 2022; however, commercial operations could continue beyond the DOE-funded period of the project. The CO2 injection would operate for a total of 20 years. The monitoring and verification processes would proceed throughout the planned injection period and continue for another 50 years or until such time during that 50-year post-injection period when the UIC permitting authority is satisfied that the plume is stable, not moving, and no further monitoring is required. In addition to the onsite staff managing and monitoring pipeline operations, the Alliance expects that two of the staff personnel (3 shifts per day, 7 days per week) would be onsite to continually monitor injection operations. Alternatively, the Alliance could acquire the services of a vendor that would remotely and continuously monitor the injection operations. Prior to commencement of CO2 injection, the UIC Class VI regulations require the Alliance to develop a Post-Injection Site Care and Site Closure Plan. The plan ensures that the well owner/operator obtains approval from the UIC Program Director for the procedures to be followed after injection operations cease. The Post-Injection Site Care and Site Closure Plan would also help identify the appropriate types and amounts of data needed to determine that the CO2 plume and pressure front do not endanger drinking water, and it would support a determination of whether conditions warrant site closure and, therefore, an end to Post-Injection Site Care (i.e., there is no longer a risk of endangerment to drinking water). The plan would identify the types and duration of monitoring that would occur; the minimum Post-Injection Site Care duration is 50 years unless otherwise approved by the UIC Program Director. Under subpart RR of the UIC Class VI rule, facilities conducting geologic sequestration are required to report the amount of CO2 received, develop and implement a USEPA-approved monitoring, reporting, and verification plan, and report the amount of CO2 sequestered using a mass balance approach. USEPA provides exemptions on subpart RR to geologic sequestration research and development projects, in CO2 = carbon dioxide; ft = feet; in = inch; KCl = potassium chloride; MD = measured depth; TVD = true vertical depth; UIC = Underground Injection Control; USDW = underground source of drinking water CO2 = carbon dioxide; ft = feet; in = inch; UIC = Underground Injection Control; USDW = underground source of drinking water ACZ = above confining zone; CO2 = carbon dioxide; MS = microseismic; USDW = underground source of drinking water; VSP= vertical seismic profile; yr = year Figure S-16. Predicted Areal Extent of CO2 Plume and Monitoring Well Network for Single-Site Scenario with Four Horizontal Wells which case those projects need to report basic information under subpart UU on the CO2 received for injection. The UIC regulations also require the Alliance to develop a Construction Operations Plan, Testing and Monitoring Plan, Injection Well Plugging Plan, Emergency and Remedial Response Plan, and Financial Responsibility Plan. Educational Facilities The Alliance would construct and operate visitor, research, and training facilities (also referred to as the educational facilities) at suitable locations in the Jacksonville area to support public outreach and communication, and to provide training and research opportunities associated with near-zero emissions power generation and CO2 capture and storage technologies. These facilities would:  Familiarize visitors (including national and international researchers) with the inner workings of the oxy-combustion power generation plant, the CO2 pipeline, and the CO2 storage project area, as well as other local points of interest;  Provide research opportunities focused on monitoring processes and results, including improvements to monitoring system designs; and  Educate and train trade workers, technicians, engineers, and scientists to manage and monitor CO2 sequestration operations and implement near-zero emissions power generation technologies. The Alliance originally assumed that one building would house the visitor center and research functions and that a second building (possibly at a separate location) would house the training function. Since publication of the Draft EIS, the Alliance modified its plans such that the current conceptual design assumes that the visitor, research, and training facilities would be housed in a single building, rather than two separate buildings. The intended general location for the educational facilities is the vicinity of Jacksonville, Illinois, which is the largest community in Morgan County and the analysis of impacts in the Final EIS remains generally focused on the Jacksonville vicinity. The Alliance has been working with local stakeholders to identify the location or locations that would be advantageous to the FutureGen 2.0 Project and to the local community. Discussions between the Alliance and Jacksonville authorities have recently focused on the prospect of locating the educational facilities within a 5-acre parcel in the northeast portion of Jacksonville Community Park. The location is adjacent to West Morton Avenue and South Main Street on the south side of the Jacksonville downtown area, and it is currently occupied by offices of the Jacksonville Area Chamber of Commerce, which would be demolished if the site were used. Construction of the educational facilities would disturb a maximum of 3.5 acres but would not affect the existing Ferris wheel near the corner of West Morton Avenue and South Main Street. The Community Park is a landscaped urban park that includes public structures, the Jacksonville Area Senior Center, playgrounds, soccer fields, internal roadways, and parking areas. South Main Street and Morton Avenue both provide access to Jacksonville from Interstate 72, and the parcel is adjacent to all necessary utility infrastructure. No decision has been reached with respect to the use of this potential location. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT The affected environment, also referred to as the region of influence (ROI), for the project was defined for 19 different environmental resource areas. The size of the ROI varies depending upon the extent of potential impacts on respective resources resulting from the construction and operation of the FutureGen 2.0 Project. In general, the EIS considered the environmental setting in Morgan County and applicable portions of neighboring counties in Illinois. Table S-3 summarizes the affected environment for each of the 19 resource areas. The affected environment for each of these resources is described in greater detail in Chapter 3 of the EIS. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS DOE evaluated the potential impacts of the no action alternative and the proposed project in relation to the baseline conditions described in Chapter 3 and summarized in Table S-3, above. A detailed discussion of potential impacts is provided in Chapter 3. Table S-4 summarizes the criteria considered when analyzing potential impacts, and summarizes the potential impacts for each of the 19 resource areas for the no action alternative and for the proposed project. The EIS uses the following descriptors to qualitatively characterize impacts on respective resources:  Beneficial – Impacts would benefit the resource.  Negligible – No apparent or measurable impacts are expected; may also be described as “none” if appropriate.  Minor – The action would have a barely noticeable or measurable adverse impact on the resource.  Moderate – The action would have a noticeable or measurable adverse impact on the resource. This category could include potentially significant impacts that would be reduced to a lesser degree by the implementation of mitigation measures.  Substantial – The action would have obvious and extensive adverse effects that could result in potentially significant impacts on a resource despite mitigation measures. MITIGATION The NEPA regulations of the President’s Council on Environmental Quality direct the lead agency for an EIS to “include appropriate mitigation measures not already included in the proposed action or alternatives” (40 CFR 1502.14(f)). Per established protocols, procedures, and requirements, the Alliance would comply with all applicable federal, state, or municipal regulations and ordinances, as well as associated permitting processes, through the implementation of standard operating procedures and best management practices. These are generally required by environmental regulatory mandates applicable to the design, construction, and operation of the project. The Alliance also incorporated other mitigation measures in its preliminary design for the project as outlined in Section 4.2, Measures to Mitigate Adverse Impacts. Therefore, as the lead agency for this EIS, DOE considers that these measures are “already included in the proposed action or alternatives” consistent with 40 CFR 1502.14(f). The impacts summarized in Table S-4 are based on the expectation that these measures would be implemented by the Alliance. DOE has also explored the range of reasonable mitigation measures, beyond those included in the proposed action, which have been outlined in Section 4.2 of the EIS. Where additional measures would be necessary and appropriate to reduce impacts that would otherwise be considered substantial, or to reduce impacts noticeably from anticipated moderate levels, the measures are identified in Table S-4 along with the anticipated effect in reducing impacts. For potential impacts that are identified as minor or negligible in Table S-4, DOE does not consider additional mitigation measures to be necessary or appropriate, because the effects of mitigation on the environment would generally not be measurable or noticeable. If DOE decides to proceed with the proposed action, the Record of Decision (ROD) will “state whether all practicable means to avoid or minimize environmental harm from the alternative selected have been adopted, and if not, why they were not,” in conformance with the CEQ NEPA regulations (40 CFR 1505.2(c)). For those additional mitigation measures deemed appropriate in its ROD, DOE will adopt and describe a monitoring and enforcement program to ensure that the measures would be implemented (40 CFR 1505.2(c)). Table S-3. Affected Environment of the FutureGen 2.0 Project Resource Air Quality Climate and Greenhouse Gases The bedrock in the ROI is sedimentary rock sequences formed within the Illinois Basin, which stretches from northwest Illinois to Kentucky and Tennessee. Glacial and modern alluvial deposits are draped over the bedrock formations, and create the topographic relief while providing the source material for soils. A stratigraphic well drilled in the CO2 storage study area reached the Mt. Simon Formation, a thick layer of sandstone, at 3,904 feet below ground surface (bgs) with a thickness of 499 feet. The Mt. Simon Formation and a small sandstone member of the Eau Claire (Elmhurst) Formation comprise the injection zone. CO2 injection would occur within a horizon of the Mt. Simon Formation. The primary confining zone consists of two members of the Eau Claire Formation (Proviso and Lombard), 413 feet of dolomite and shale layers, which are present at 3,425 feet bgs. Above the Eau Claire is the secondary confining zone, which consists of the Franconia dolomite, found at 3,072 feet bgs. The St. Geology Peter Formation is the deepest underground source of drinking water (USDW), as defined by the USEPA, and is located at 1,740 feet bgs. Deep seismic surveys did not identify any faults or cross-cutting structures present in the CO2 storage study area. There have been no earthquakes within 30 miles of the CO2 storage study area since the U.S. Geological Survey has tracked seismicity; however two earthquakes were reported in the early 20th century. In November 1923, a 3.3 magnitude (estimated) earthquake occurred near Petersburg, Illinois, approximately 15 miles northwest of the CO2 storage study area. In July 1909, a 4.5 magnitude (estimated) earthquake occurred approximately 26 miles north of the CO2 storage study area. There are three historical oil and gas fields in Morgan County. The Waverly field is now used for natural gas storage, the Jacksonville field has three active wells, and the Prentice field currently has no producing wells. Table S-3. Affected Environment of the FutureGen 2.0 Project Resource Groundwater Surface Water Table S-3. Affected Environment of the FutureGen 2.0 Project Resource Existing Conditions Land Use The proposed project would be constructed within Morgan County, which is primarily agricultural and rural with small areas of developed land. The oxy-combustion facility would be constructed on Meredosia Energy Center property, which is a heavily developed industrial site with areas of fields and open space (e.g., trees and grassy areas). The pipeline would traverse northern Morgan County to the CO2 storage study area. Agricultural land is the most abundant land use type found within the pipeline corridor and CO2 storage study area. A portion of the southern route option for the pipeline would align with existing highway ROWs. The energy center, pipeline, and CO2 storage study area are not subject to existing zoning ordinances or comprehensive plans. The educational facilities would likely be located in the city of Jacksonville, which has a zoning ordinance and comprehensive plan. Table S-3. Affected Environment of the FutureGen 2.0 Project Resource Existing Conditions Materials and Waste Management The Meredosia Energy Center historically used coal from within Illinois and from the Powder River Basin in Wyoming, and the proposed project would continue to source coal from these locations. Suppliers exist within the region surrounding the energy center for construction and operational materials that would be needed for the project. Over 175 million cubic yards of landfill capacity exists within the surrounding counties. There are 18 hazardous waste treatment, storage, disposal, and recycling facilities in the state of Illinois, and 45 additional facilities in neighboring states. There are no known areas of historical or current contamination within the proposed project’s study area. Existing dominant noise sources in the vicinity of the Meredosia Energy Center mainly consist of noise associated with the nearby grain elevator operations at the Cargill, Inc. facility located to the north of the energy center site; vehicular traffic on Old Naples Road, South Washington Street, and IL-104; rail traffic on the Norfolk Southern rail line providing access to the industrial sites to the south of the Meredosia Energy Center; and prior to the end of 2011, equipment and vehicle noise related to the operations of the energy center. After 2011, the Meredosia Energy Center no longer contributes to the ambient noise in the area. Noise sources along the pipeline corridor and within the CO2 storage study area primarily consist of vehicular traffic from nearby roadways within a predominantly rural environment. Areas in the vicinity of the city of Jacksonville, Illinois, have typical urban noise levels from vehicular traffic. Noise Utilities Table S-3. Affected Environment of the FutureGen 2.0 Project Resource Existing Conditions Community Services Morgan County is served by the Morgan County Sheriff’s Office, District 9 of the Illinois State Police, and 6 additional police departments located throughout the county. There are 10 police departments, 4 sheriff’s offices, and Districts 9 and 20 of the Illinois State Police that serve Brown, Cass, Pike, and Scott counties. There are 8 fire departments in Morgan County and a total of 25 fire stations in Brown, Cass, Pike, and Scott counties. The Illinois Emergency Management Agency and Mutual Aid Box Alarm System are responsible for statewide disaster planning and local emergency medical services mobilization, respectively. A volunteer ambulance service provides emergency response in Meredosia, and 2 ambulance providers operate in the city of Jacksonville, as well as paramedic services that operate from Passavant Area Hospital. The ROI is served by 2 hospitals. There are 21 public schools and 5 private schools in Morgan County. The adjacent counties of Brown, Cass, Pike, and Scott have a total of 32 public schools and 3 private schools. Socioeconomics Collectively, Morgan County and the four adjacent counties (Brown, Cass, Pike, and Scott) have a population of approximately 77,911. Morgan County had a total population of 35,547 in 2010 with a rate of decline higher than the overall regional rate since 2000. The five counties include approximately 34,223 housing units of which approximately 3,897 units were vacant and 19.1 percent vacancy rate within the ROI. The median household income in the ROI ranged from $39,191 to $49,450. In 2010, the average unemployment rates were 9.0 percent for the ROI and 9.4 percent for Morgan County, compared to an unemployment rate of 8.9 percent in both the United States and Illinois. bgs = below ground surface; CO2 = carbon dioxide; GHG = greenhouse gas; ILCS = Illinois Compiled Statutes; LIRB = Lower Illinois River Basin; ROI = region of influence; ROW = right-of-way; SHPO = State Historic Preservation Office; USDW = underground sourceof drinking water; USEPA = U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Criteria Considered No Action Proposed Project No Impacts. Baseline conditions would not change. No Direct Impacts. Indirect Adverse Impacts related to not furthering commercial-scale advanced oxycombustion coal-based power generation technologies with CO2 capture and sequestration. Further, without the project, regional electricity needs would likely be met by conventional coal- or natural gas-based electric power generation.

Project would increase the potential for soil erosion and compaction, increase the amount of impermeable surfaces, and withdraw some prime farmland soils from agricultural production. Overall construction for the proposed project would disturb up to a maximum of 364 acres of soil classified as prime farmland. However, with the identification of the proposed injection well site as addressed in this Final EIS, the permanent loss of prime farmland would be approximately 14 acres (4 percent) for all associated facilities, as compared to less than 25 acres (7 percent) based on the original concept for the injection well facilities. All other prime farmland in the pipeline route could be restored to preconstruction use. Based on the revised site plan, construction at the Meredosia Energy Center would disturb up to a maximum of 95 acres of soils classified as farmland of statewide importance (of which 54 acres would be permanently converted for project use), as compared to 146 acres reported in the Draft EIS (79 acres permanently converted). However, these soils at the energy center are not currently used for agricultural purposes and likely are no longer suitable for agricultural use. Also, construction would affect 16 acres of Urban soils and 2 acres of hydric soils at the  energy center.  Operations: Minor Adverse Impacts: Based on the revised site layout, approximately 54 acres of soils classified as farmland of statewide importance would be permanently converted to uses for the Meredosia Energy Center (compared to 79 acres for the original layout). Also, approximately 14 acres of  prime farmland soils would be permanently converted to project uses at the proposed injection well site (compared to less than 25 acres for the original injection well concept). DOE anticipates that the property above the CO2 pipeline  would be returned to agricultural use after the construction period ends.  Impacts were assessed based on whether the  No Impacts.

Construction: Minor Adverse Impacts: Construction of the oxy-combustion facility and  Baseline conditions would not change.  barge unloading facility has the potential to increase sedimentation in the Illinois River and increase the potential for surface water contamination from material spills. Although the Alliance’s current plans for unloading equipment would avoid potential impacts to the bank or bottom of the Illinois River, the EIS maintains the options evaluated in the Draft EIS as representing appropriate upper bounds for the barge unloading operations during construction of the oxy-combustion facility. If the Alliance undertakes activities related to the barge unloading facility that would disturb the river bottom, then water quality could be reduced by increased  turbidity and sedimentation during streambed disturbance. While all perennial streams and the majority of intermittent streams would be avoided using trenchless technologies for pipeline construction, trenching could occur during pipeline construction at certain ephemeral and intermittent streams that are seasonally-dry at the time of construction. However, these features would be restored to pre-construction conditions after construction activities were completed. Construction of the injection well site(s) could increase the potential for contamination from material spills.  Operations: Minor Adverse Impacts: Based on refinements in design since publication of the Draft EIS, the project would withdraw an estimated 13.6 mgd from the Illinois River for oxy-combustion facility operations and discharge 10.6 mgd of treated effluents (representing increases from the estimated 11.4 mgd withdrawal and 9 mgd discharge analyzed in the Draft EIS for the original design). However, the surface water withdrawals and discharges for operations would be approximately 94 percent less than the average 217 mgd withdrawal and 189 mgd discharge during historical operations at the energy center. There would be no operational impacts associated with the barge area, as this area would be returned to pre-existing conditions after construction activities at the Meredosia Energy Center were completed. The proposed project would increase the potential for stormwater  runoff due to increased impervious area at the proposed oxy-combustion facility site  and would increase the potential for contamination from material spills. Operation of the  pipeline and injection well site(s) would not affect surface water, other than increasing  the potential of material spills during maintenance.  DOE/EIS-0460 FUTUREGEN 2.0 PROJECT FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT SUMMARY Table S-4. Summary of Environmental Impacts by Alternative for the FutureGen 2.0 Project Criteria Considered  No Action  Proposed Project  Impacts were assessed based on whether the proposed project would:  Cause filling of wetlands or otherwise alter drainage patterns that would affect wetlands;  Cause wetland type or classification conversions due to alterations of land cover attributes;  No Impacts. Baseline conditions would not change.  Construction: Negligible to Minor Adverse Impacts: No impacts to wetlands would occur at the Meredosia Energy Center as a result of the proposed project. Although the Alliance’s current plans for unloading equipment would avoid potential impacts to the bank or bottom of the Illinois River, the EIS maintains the options evaluated in the Draft EIS as representing appropriate upper bounds for the barge unloading operations during construction of the oxy-combustion facility. If the Alliance undertakes activities related to the proposed barge unloading facility that would disturb the river bottom, then temporary impacts would occur resulting in potential increased sedimentation of the Illinois River.   Alter a floodway or floodplain or otherwise impede or redirect flows such that human health, the environment, or personal property could be affected;  For the CO2 pipeline, the southern route operational ROW contains no NWI-mapped wetlands, but may contain up to 0.5 acre of freshwater wetlands based on a wetland delineation performed by the Alliance in spring 2013; the northern route, which is no longer being considered by the Alliance, contains 0.2 acre of NWI-mapped open water wetlands.

Construction of the pipeline at these locations, which although dry may still be considered USACE-jurisdictional features, would cause temporary disturbance of the dry stream channel bed and would be restored after construction activities were completed. In addition to the above, the wetland delineation conducted by the Alliance also identified a 0.03 acre area of hydric soils located in an active agricultural field within the southern pipeline route that would be crossed using traditional trenching. Although this feature possesses the characteristics of a wetland, it is not expected to be considered jurisdictional by the USACE. No impacts to wetlands are anticipated at the CO2  injection well site(s).  Construction within the 100-year floodplain would primarily occur only in areas that are  currently developed at the Meredosia Energy Center; therefore, additional impacts are  not expected. If the Alliance undertakes activities related to the proposed barge  unloading facility as analyzed in the Draft EIS, temporary placement of facilities within  the 100-year floodplain would occur during construction, and the area would be  returned to pre-construction conditions after construction activities are completed.  Construction of the CO2 pipeline would cross 100-year floodplains and may result in  small ancillary structures being placed in the 100-year floodplain, resulting in minor  impacts. Construction at the CO2 injection well site(s) is not anticipated to impact  floodplains; as per the siting criteria, these areas would be avoided.  Operations: Negligible to Minor Adverse Impacts: There would be no operational  impacts to wetlands as maintenance of the ROW (e.g., mowing or vegetation clearing)  would not occur within wetland areas. Mainline block valves would be placed on either  side of streams and other wetland features, as needed.  DOE/EIS-0460 FUTUREGEN 2.0 PROJECT FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT SUMMARY Table S-4.

Baseline conditions would not change.  Construction: Minor to Moderate Adverse Impacts: The Alliance originally anticipated the need to clear approximately 33 acres of forested area at the energy center and 8 acres for the southern pipeline route. However, through ongoing refinements in the site plan at the energy center and the use of trenchless boring techniques during pipeline construction, the Alliance expects to reduce the amount of forested area cleared to a maximum of 9 acres at the  or plants;  energy center and 6 acres for construction of the southern pipeline route.   Cause a decline in native wildlife populations;  Although the Alliance’s current plans for unloading equipment at the energy center would avoid potential impacts to the bank or bottom of the Illinois River,   Interfere with the movement of native resident or migratory wildlife species;  Conflict with applicable management plans for terrestrial, avian, and aquatic species and their habitat;  the Final EIS maintains the options evaluated in the Draft EIS as representing appropriate upper bounds for the barge unloading operations during construction of the oxy-combustion facility. If the Alliance undertakes the barge unloading activities analyzed in the Draft EIS, there could be a disturbance to riverbed sediments and a release of buried contaminants, including polychlorinated biphenyls and mercury. This release could have an adverse impact on local and   Cause the introduction of noxious or  downstream aquatic resources, including protected species.  invasive plant species;  Diminish the value of habitat for fish species (including altering drainage patterns causing displacement of fish species or interfering with movement of native resident fish species);  Cause a decline in native fish populations;  Adversely affect endangered, threatened, or other special status species; or  Cause adverse modification to designated critical habitat of a federally-listed species.  DOE is preparing a Biological Assessment addressing the three federally-listed species for which suitable habitat occurs in the project area: the Indiana bat, decurrent false aster, and eastern prairie fringed orchid. Indiana bat habitat surveys were completed at the energy center and southern pipeline route in the spring and summer of 2013. Decurrent false aster surveys were conducted during flowering in late summer 2013 where potential habitat was identified in the project area. Initial surveys for the eastern prairie fringed orchid determined that the soil types are unsuitable and no individuals were found. Based on the progress of the Biological Assessment, DOE believes that the proposed action is not likely to adversely affect any of the listed species. The Biological Assessment, when submitted to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, will provide DOE’s final determination and will identify measures as appropriate to minimize impacts on federally-listed species. Forested areas along the pipeline and at the energy center would be cleared between September and February to avoid disturbing the Indiana bat and migratory birds. Operations: Minor Adverse Impacts: During operation, the 50-foot wide CO2 pipeline  operational ROW would be kept free of woody vegetation to permit access for  inspection and maintenance activities. This would leave the vegetation in the  operational ROW in a persistent herbaceous state, creating a permanent habitat  conversion in areas that were previously forested. Clearing of forested areas would  cause a small degree of habitat fragmentation. In total, the proposed southern route as  refined after release of the Draft EIS would result in the loss of up to 6 acres of forested lands (compared to 8 acres in the original layout). The northern CO2  pipeline route, which is no longer being considered by the Alliance, would result in  DOE/EIS-0460 FUTUREGEN 2.0 PROJECT FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT SUMMARY Table S-4. Summary of Environmental Impacts by Alternative for the FutureGen 2.0 Project Criteria Considered Biological Resources (continued)  No Action  Proposed Project  the loss of up to 22 acres of forested lands. Due to the comparatively small areas of forest to be permanently converted, these potential fragmentation effects would be minor.  Cultural Resources  DOE/EIS-0460 FUTUREGEN 2.0 PROJECT FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT SUMMARY Impacts were assessed based on whether the proposed project would cause the loss, isolation, or alteration of: • Archaeological resources listed or eligible for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) listing; • Historic sites or structures listed or eligible for NRHP listing, either directly or by introducing visual, audible, or atmospheric elements that would adversely affect the historic resource; • Native American resources, including graves, remains, and funerary objects, either directly or by introducing visual, audible, or atmospheric elements that would adversely affect the resource’s use; • Paleontological resources listed or eligible for listing as a National Natural Landmark; or • Cemeteries. No Impacts. Baseline conditions would not change. Construction: Negligible Adverse Impacts: DOE has not identified any cultural resources that would be impacted by the project. However, any potential impacts to cultural resources would be avoided or mitigated in accordance with the Programmatic Agreement between the DOE, the Alliance, and the SHPO (see Appendix B, Cultural Resources Consultation [B3]). The proposed injection well site identified after publication of the Draft EIS would require demolition of a single, abandoned dwelling that was constructed between 1959 and 1963. This structure is not unique in the region and appears to lack the necessary degree of architectural merit or historical relevance to be considered as potentially eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. In addition, other historic resources within the applicable area of potential effects would not be expected to incur any apparent or measurable impacts as the project would not be expected to alter the setting or other aspects of integrity of these resources. The project would not introduce visual, atmospheric, or audible elements that diminish the integrity of the resource’s significant historic features. Operations: No Impacts: Operation of the proposed project would not be expected to have an adverse impact on cultural resources. Land Use Impacts were assessed based on whether the proposed project would: • Be incompatible with land use adjacent to the Meredosia Energy Center and within and adjacent to the CO2 pipeline corridor, CO2 storage study area, and associated components and facilities; • Result in land use restrictions on adjacent properties; or No Impacts. Baseline conditions would not change. Construction: Minor Adverse Impacts: Since there are no applicable zoning and land use plans in unincorporated Morgan County, construction of the proposed project would not conflict with any designated county zoning plans. The educational facilities in the city of Jacksonville would be designed to abide by the existing zoning and comprehensive plan. The Meredosia Energy Center property offers sufficient infrastructure to support most of the construction activities required for the oxy-combustion facility. Additional land area outside of the energy center would be used for construction staging and equipment laydown, but that land area would only be temporarily impacted as it would revert back to its original condition after construction.

As a result of the cumulative impacts analysis, DOE concluded that the FutureGen 2.0 Project, in combination with other reasonably foreseeable future actions, may result in cumulative impacts on the resource areas listed in Table S-5. In no case would the incremental effects of the FutureGen 2.0 Project on any resource, when added to the effects of other reasonably foreseeable actions, result in cumulative impacts that would be substantially greater than the impacts of the FutureGen 2.0 Project or other actions individually. Table S-5.

DOE’s proposed action would provide approximately $1 billion of funding (primarily under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act) to support construction and operation of the FutureGen 2.0 Project. The funding would be used for project design and development, procurement of capital equipment, construction, and to support a 56-month demonstration period for a coal-fueled electric generation plantintegrated with carbon capture and storage. For the FutureGen 2.0 Project, the Alliance would construct and operate a 168-megawatt electrical (MWe) gross output coal-fueled electric generation plant using advanced oxy-combustion technology. The plant would use existing infrastructure, including the existing steam turbine generator (Unit 4), at Ameren Energy Resources’ Meredosia Energy Center on the Illinois River just south of Meredosia, Illinois. The proposed project would include facilities designedtocapture at least 90 percent of the carbon dioxide (CO2) that would otherwise be emitted to the atmosphere during steady-state operation, equivalent to approximately 1.2 million tons (1.1 million metric tons) of CO2 captured per year. The captured CO2 would be compressed and transported via a new underground pipeline, approximately 30 miles long and nominally 10 to 12 inches in diameter, to a geologic storage area in eastern Morgan County, where it would be injected and stored in the Mt. Simon Formation (a saline aquifer) approximately 4,000 feet below the ground surface. The project would also employ systems for the monitoring, verification, and accounting of the CO2 being geologically stored. Visitor, research, and training facilities would be sited in the vicinity of Jacksonville, Illinois. The proposed project would provide performance and emissions data, as well as establish operating and maintenance experience, that would facilitate future large-scale commercial deployment of oxy-combustion technology and geologic CO2 storage. DOE is the lead federal agencyresponsible for preparation of this EIS. DOE prepared the EIS pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and in compliance with the Council on Environmental Quality(CEQ) implementing regulations for NEPA (40 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] 1500 through 1508) and DOE NEPA implementing procedures (10 CFR 1021). The EIS evaluates the potential environmental impacts of the FutureGen 2.0 Project as part of DOE’s decision-making process to determine whether to provide financial assistance. The EIS also analyzes the no action alternative, under which DOE would not providefinancialassistance forthe FutureGen 2.0 Project. Public Participation: DOE encourages public participation in the NEPA process. The Notice of Availability of the Draft EIS appeared in the Federal Register on May 3, 2013, which invited comments on the Draft EIS through the end of the comment period on June 17, 2013. DOE conducted a public hearing for the Draft EIS in Jacksonville, Illinois, on May 21, 2013, which included an informational session for one hour prior to the formal hearing. During the hearing, the public was encouraged to provide oral comments and to submit written comments to DOE through the close of the comment period. DOE also considered late comments. A summary of the public hearing is included in new Appendix I alongwithall agency and public commentsontheDraft EISandDOEresponses. Changes fromthe Draft EIS: In this Final EIS, bold text and vertical lines in the margin indicate where the Draft EIS has been revised or supplemented (as exemplified by this paragraph). Deletions are not demarcated. Additions to the appendices in Volume II are indicated on the appendix cover sheets with vertical lines in themargin and bold text. TABLE OF CONTENTS – VOLUME I 1 PURPOSEAND

PURPOSE AND NEED  1  PURPOSE AND NEED  1.1 INTRODUCTION This chapter introduces the proposed FutureGen 2.0 Project and describes the purpose and need for agency action and the scope of this Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). This chapter also summarizes the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 process, project history and objectives, and the public involvement process undertaken forthis EIS. In 2010, the United States (U.S.) Department of Energy (DOE) proposed to fund the final design, construction, and initial operation of the FutureGen 2.0 Project, subject to the requirements of NEPA. To assess the potential environmental impacts of the project, DOE has prepared this EIS in accordance with NEPA (42 United States Code [USC] 4321 et seq.) and in compliance with the Council on Environmental Quality(CEQ) implementing regulations for NEPA (40 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] 1500 through 1508) and DOE’s NEPA implementing procedures (10 CFR 1021). To date, DOE has authorized the expenditure of funds for the purpose of project definition, cost estimating, and preliminary and front-end engineering design activities, and to facilitate environmental review. Such activities do not have an adverse impact on the environment or limit the choice of reasonable alternatives. This EIS will inform DOE’s decision of whether to authorize the expenditure of additional funds for final design, construction, and initial operation of the FutureGen 2.0 Project. FutureGen 2.0 is a public-private partnership formed for the purpose of developing the first large-scale oxy-combustion repowering project in the world that would use carbon capture and storage technology. The FutureGen 2.0 Project consists of two components: the Oxy-Combustion Large Scale Test and the Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Pipeline and Storage Reservoir. Additionally, visitor, research, and training facilities (also referred to as the educational facilities) would be provided at a suitable location to support public outreach and communication, and to provide training and research opportunities associated with near-zero emissions powergeneration and CO2 capture and storage technologies. DOE has entered into a cooperative agreement with the Oxy-Combustion Technology FutureGen Industrial Alliance (Alliance) under which the Alliance, cooperating with Ameren Energy Resources (Ameren), Oxy-combustion is the combustion of coal with a mixture of oxygen and recycled flue would upgrade an energy center currently owned by Ameren near gas (instead of air), resulting in a gas by-Meredosia, Illinois, with oxy-combustion and carbon capture product that is primarily CO2. This facilitates technology provided by the Babcock & Wilcox Power Generation the capture of CO2, which, in the case of the Group (Babcock & Wilcox) and Air Liquide Process and FutureGen 2.0 Project, would be permanently stored underground rather than released to Construction, Inc. (Air Liquide). The plant would capture at least the atmosphere. 90 percent of its CO2 emissions during steady-state operation and reduce other emissions to near zero. The captured CO2 would be transported through a 30-mile pipeline to injection wells that would be used to inject the CO2 approximately 4,000 feet below the earth’s surface into a geologic formation for permanent storage. The project would be designed to capture, transport, and inject approximately 1.2 million tons (1.1 million metric tons) of CO2 annually, up to a total of 24 million tons (22 million metric tons) over approximately 20 years. The Alliance would construct and operate a visitor center and research and training facilities related to carbon capture and storage inthelocal area. The Alliance is a non-profit membership organization created to benefit the public interest and the interests of science through research, development, and demonstration of near-zero emissions coal technology. It was formed to partner with DOE on the FutureGen Initiative. Members of the Alliance include some of the largest coal producers, coal users, and coal equipment suppliers in the world. The Alliance’s current members are: Alpha Natural Resources, Inc.; Anglo American, SA; Joy Global Inc.; Peabody Energy Corporation; and Xstrata, PLC. The active role of industry in this FutureGen Initiative ensures that the public and private sector share the cost and risk of developing the advanced technologies necessaryto commercializethe FutureGenconcept. The Alliance has an open membership policy to encourage the addition of other coal producers, coal users, and coal equipment suppliers, both domestic and international. Consistent with the FutureGen Initiative, DOE encourages participation from international organizations to maximize the global applicability and acceptance of FutureGen 2.0’s results, helping to support an international consensus on the role of coal and geologic CO2 storage in addressing global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energysecurity. 1.2 PROJECT BACKGROUND For more than 25 years, DOE has been co-funding large-scale demonstrations of clean coal technologies to hasten their adoption into the commercial marketplace. Developing this technology is critical for reducing conventional air pollutants and CO2 emissions, maintaining the ability to continue to use abundant domestic coal reserves, and keeping the nation’s electricity supplies secure and affordable. Federal financial support is needed to help reduce the risks inherent in these first-of-a-kind projects. One of DOE’s clean coal demonstration efforts, the FutureGen Initiative, is designed to demonstrate the commercial feasibility of coal-fueled energy generation with carbon capture and storage at a commercial scale. This sectiondescribes the original FutureGenProject andthe current FutureGen 2.0 Project. 1.2.1 Original FutureGen Project On February 27, 2003, President George W. Bush announced the FutureGen Initiative, a $1 billion, 10year demonstration project to create the world’s first coal-based, zero emissions electricity and hydrogen power plant. The President’s announcement emphasized the need for the FutureGen Initiative to support other federal initiatives, including the National Climate Change Technology Initiative (June11, 2001) and the Hydrogen Fuel Initiative (January 28, 2003). These initiatives aimed to reduce the nation’s output of GHG emissions to improve the global environment and provide advanced technologies to meet the world’s energyneeds. In response to the President’s FutureGen Initiative, DOE developed plans for the FutureGen Project, which was intended to establish the technical and economic feasibility of producing electricity and hydrogen from coal, while capturing and geologically storing the CO2 generated in the process. On April 21, 2003, DOE issued a Request for Information seeking expressions of interest from prospective consortia of industries most heavily impacted by potential future limitations on carbon emissions. DOE outlined a plan to enter into a cooperative agreement with a consortium led by the coal-fueled electric powerindustry and thecoal production industry. A consortium of coal-fueled utilities, coal production companies, and coal production equipment suppliers formed the Alliance, and responded to DOE’s request. On December 2, 2005, DOE and the Alliance signed a limited-scope cooperative agreement to initiate the FutureGen Project with a project definition phase that yielded a conceptual design report and project plans. This phase led to the signing of a full-scope cooperative agreement on March 23, 2007, that wasintended to establish the remainder of the project. DOE and the Alliance were to share the costs of the development, construction, and operation of the FutureGen Project. The FutureGen Project was to provide a platform to test advanced technologies for producing both electricity and hydrogen from coal, based on the design concept known as integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC). This technology has the potential for increasing energy conversion efficiency while reducing air pollution emissions rates. Geologic storage of CO2 was to be a unique component of the project. The CO2 wasto be captured and stored in a deep underground salineformation. In accordance with the cooperative agreement, the Alliance implemented a competitive siting process to identify the IGCC power plant and CO2 storage site that could best meet the goals of the FutureGen Project. This process began with the Alliance’s issuance of a Request for Proposals on March 7, 2006, in which it sought proposals from potential site hosts. The Alliance rigorously evaluated the 12 proposals received and identified four candidate sites for full consideration by the Alliance and DOE. The candidate sites, announced by the Alliance on July 21, 2006, were located in Mattoon, Illinois; Tuscola, Illinois; Jewett, Texas; and Odessa,Texas. On July 28, 2006, and in accordance with NEPA, DOE published a Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare an EIS to consider whether to provide financial assistance for the FutureGen Project and to evaluate the potential environmental impacts of constructing and operating the FutureGen Project at each of the four candidate sites (71 Federal Register [FR] 42840). Subsequently, DOE prepared a Draft and a Final EIS documenting its environmental analyses. In the Final EIS, issued on November 17, 2007, DOE stated its preferred alternative was to provide financial assistance to the FutureGen project and tentatively found all foursites acceptable. On December 18, 2007, the Alliance announced that, after extensive review and evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of the four candidate sites, both individually and in comparison to one another, it had selected the site in Mattoon, Illinois, as the host site for the FutureGen Project, pending the outcome of DOE’s Record of Decision (ROD) (Alliance 2007). However, on January 29, 2008, DOE announced that it would terminate its funding for the FutureGen Project, primarily due to higher than expected costs. Instead, DOE stated its intention to implement a new strategy for the FutureGen Initiative that would promote equipping multiple new clean coal power plants with advanced carbon capture and storage technology, instead of one single research-oriented power plant. Despite the Alliance’s efforts to modify the design and the proposed cost-share structure of the original FutureGen Project, in June 2008, DOE notified the Alliance that it had decided to withdraw from the FutureGen Project and that it would not renew its cooperative agreement. The Alliance, believing in the merits of the project, continued its development using private sector funds and grant funding provided by the state of Illinois. In 2009, DOE reassessed its earlier decision and reached an agreement with the Alliance to complete a preliminary design, a revised cost estimate, and a funding plan pursuant to a new limited-scope cooperative agreement. On July 14, 2009, DOE issued a ROD that stated its intention to implement the FutureGen Initiative by proceeding with financial assistance for the FutureGen Project at any one of the four alternative sites analyzed in the EIS. DOE also stated that it anticipated committing $1billion in American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds, with remaining funds to come from the Alliance, revenues fromthe sale ofelectricity, and other fundingsources. 1.2.2 FutureGen 2.0 Project As the estimated capital costs of the original FutureGen Project escalated and came to exceed $2 billion, DOE decided in 2010 that the project as then envisioned was too expensive in a budget-constrained environment. Seeking a fiscally responsible approach to achieving the important technical objectives of advanced clean coal technologies and carbon capture and storage as described in President George W. Bush’s FutureGen Initiative, and recognizing that a number of projects involving IGCC technology and the coal-to-hydrogen concept had been announced, DOE elected to shift from the construction and operation of a new IGCC power plant to repoweringan existingcoal-fueled power plant. Retrofitting opportunities that would allow for the capture of CO2 consisted of oxy-combustion projects and post-combustion scrubbing projects. Oxy-combustion burns coal with a mixture of oxygen and CO2 instead of ambient air to produce a concentrated CO2 stream, which facilitates CO2 injection and permanent storage underground. Because DOE already had post-combustion scrubbing projects in its research and demonstration portfolio, it decided to pursue an oxy-combustion retrofitting project with CO2 storage at the Mattoon, Illinois, site that had been selected for the original FutureGen Project. FutureGen 2.0 would still meet the objective of the FutureGen Initiative to establish the feasibility and viability of producing electricity from coal with at least 90 percent CO2 capture during steady-state operation and near-zero emissions. On August 5, 2010, DOE announced the award of $1 billion in American RecoveryandReinvestment Act funding to the Alliance, Ameren, Babcock & Wilcox, and Air Liquide to build FutureGen 2.0, an oxycombustion repowering and CO2 storage project. DOE stated that the project partners would repower Unit 4 at Ameren’s Meredosia, Illinois energy center with oxy-combustion technology and would construct a 150-mile pipeline from Meredosia to Mattoon that would transport more than 1.1 million tons (1 million metric tons) of captured CO2 per year. The Mattoon site would also be used to conduct research pertaining to site characterization, injection and storage, and monitoring and measurement. The Mattoon sequestration site proponent, however, decided that the pursuit of FutureGen 2.0 was not in its best interest, stating that the restructured project did not provide the highest and best use of the Mattoon site. With Mattoon no longer available as the CO2 storage site, the Alliance developed and implemented another competitive process to identifya CO2 storage site inIllinois. Under the terms of a cooperative agreement signed in 2010 with DOE, the Alliance undertook a siting process as described in Chapter 2, Proposed Action and Alternatives (Section 2.5.2.1). Following the issuance of Guidance to Prospective Offerors on October 6, 2010, the Alliance prepared and released a Request for Proposals on October 25, 2010. The Request for Proposal described the surface and subsurface qualifying, scoring, and best value criteria that the Alliance would use to site the FutureGen 2.0 CO2 injection wells and the data that site offerors needed to provide. On November 15, 2010, six bidderssubmitted proposals. After careful review of the proposals and other available data, including data from the Illinois State Geologic Survey, on February 28, 2011, the Alliance announced its selection of Morgan County as the preferred location for the FutureGen 2.0 CO2 injection wells, visitor center, and research and training facilities. At that time, the Alliance identified sites in Christian County and Douglas County as alternate locations should concerns arise around the technical, legal, or public acceptability of the preferred Morgan County site. Throughout 2011 and 2012, the Alliance conducted a detailed geological stratigraphic analysis at the Morgan County storage location to characterize and verify the viability of the proposed CO2 storage reservoir. The geological findings have proved the location to be favorably suited for CO2 injection and sequestration as part of the FutureGen 2.0 Project. As a result of this geological analysis combined with a cost analysis of the pipelines to the alternative sites, on June 19, 2012, the Alliance Board of Directors confirmed that the proposed Morgan County site remained its preferred site and voted to direct the Alliance to no longer pursue the sites in Christian County and Douglas County as alternate sites. The Alliance notified the proponents of those sites that the Alliance would no longer be considering them as alternate sites and would not be constructing or operating a CO2 storage reservoir at those sites, releasing the site proponents to find other reasonable usesfortheirproposedsites. Since the initial announcement of the FutureGen 2.0 Project in 2010, Ameren decided, for economic reasons, to suspend operations at the Meredosia Energy Center at the end of 2011 (see Section 2.4.1.5) and to reduce its role in FutureGen 2.0. With DOE’s concurrence, the Alliance agreed to acquire those portions and components of the Meredosia Energy Center that are needed for FutureGen 2.0 and to undertake the repowering of Unit 4 with oxy-combustion technology by Babcock & Wilcox and Air Liquide. Thus, the Alliance would be responsible for both the Oxy-Combustion Large Scale Test and the CO2 Pipeline and Storage Reservoir components of the FutureGen 2.0 Project. Ameren has continued to assist withenvironmental permittingandmaintaining the energycenterto be in a retrofit-ready condition. 1.3 PROPOSED ACTION DOE proposes to fund the final design, construction, and initial operation of the FutureGen 2.0 Project to implement the 2003 FutureGen Initiative. DOE announced $1 billion in funding under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law No. 111-5) for the project through four cost-share phases: • Phase I: Project Definition • Phase II: NEPA, Permitting, and Preliminary/Final Design • Phase III: Construction and Commissioning • Phase IV: Operations Although not part of DOE’s proposed action, after completion of DOE’s participation, there is expected to be twocommercial phases: • Phase C-1: Commercial Operations • Phase C-2: Post-Operations Monitoring DOE has authorized the expenditure of funds for Phase I (project definition) and much of Phase II (through front-end engineering design), with cost-sharing by the private partners. DOE proposes to fund the remainder of Phase II (final design) and Phases III (construction and commissioning) and IV (operations) of the FutureGen 2.0 Project through cooperative agreements with the Alliance to support the implementation of project components that, if successful, would advance the goals of the FutureGen Initiative. This EIS addresses the environmental impacts of continuing to fund FutureGen 2.0, also cost-shared by the private partners, and the impacts of continuing commercial operations and post-operations monitoring after DOE’s participation ends. The project components, consisting of the Oxy-Combustion Large Scale Test and the CO2 Pipeline and Storage Reservoir, would provide critical performance and emissions data, as well as establish operating, permitting, maintenance, and other experience needed for future commercialdeployment of these technologies. Objectives of FutureGen 2.0 Phases Phase I: Project Definition – Select a site for the CO2 storage facility, obtain site purchase options, complete a conceptual design and cost estimate for the project, initiate the NEPA process, and execute a Cooperation and Technology Agreement between FutureGen Industrial Alliance and Ameren Energy Resources. Phase II: NEPA, Permitting, and Preliminary/Final Design – Complete environmental permitting and the NEPA process; obtain commitments on properties needed for the pipeline and injection well site(s); complete front-end engineering and design and final design and cost estimates; prepare a monitoring, verification, and accounting plan; and execute the power purchase agreement and other appropriate agreements for facilities operation. Phase III: Construction and Commissioning – Construct the pipeline, the surface and subsurface facilities at the injection well site(s), and the visitor, research, and training facilities, and commission the system. Phase IV: Operations – Commence operation of the pipeline and storage facility systems to transport and store CO2, and to test technologies and protocols for CO2 monitoring necessary to establish the permanence of storage and provide a full accounting for all captured CO2. For the Oxy-Combustion Large Scale Test, the Alliance would acquire portions of the Meredosia Energy Center (formerly named the Meredosia Power Station) in west central Illinois from Ameren and incorporate advanced oxy-combustion technology into the reconstruction of Unit 4 at the existing plant. Ameren originally entered into a cooperative agreement with DOE to implement the Oxy-Combustion Large Scale Test, but the company discontinued operations at the Meredosia Energy Center at the end of 2011 and informed DOE that it would not continue with its cooperative agreement. Subsequently, DOE authorized the Alliance to assume responsibility for Ameren’s cooperative agreement. The scope of the Oxy-Combustion Large Scale Test consists of final design, procurement, manufacture, installation, startup, testing and operation of an integrated oxy-combustion coal boiler with CO2 capture, purification, and compression. The plant would be designed to generate approximately 168 megawatts electrical (MWe) gross, and it would operate continuously to generate baseload electric power. The CO2 would be cleaned, compressed for transport, and delivered to a pipelinefor transport to the CO2 injectionwells. For the CO2 Pipeline and Storage Reservoir, the Alliance would design, construct, and operate a CO2 transmission pipeline and a geologic injection and storage facility. The pipeline would transport CO2 from the Meredosia Energy Center to the injection wells in Morgan County where it would be injected through deep wells into the Mt. Simon Formation, which is the major deep saline formation in the Illinois Basin. The injection wells would be located approximately 30 miles east ofthe Meredosia Energy Center. The pipeline and storage reservoir would be designed to store up to 24 million tons (22 million metric tons) over an approximately 20-year operating period. Research would include site characterization, injection and storage, and CO2 monitoring and measurement. The FutureGen 2.0 Project would begin final design in 2013 after completion of the NEPA process. Construction would begin in 2014, with commissioning in 2017. Operations and monitoring would continue until 2022 (56 months after commissioning) with DOE funding. Performance and economic test results would be shared among all participants, industry, non-governmental organizations, and the public. After DOE’s involvement ceases, the FutureGen 2.0 Project would be expected to continue commercial operations, including carbon capture and storage, for approximately 20 years, and the Alliance (or its successor) would be financially responsible for post-injection monitoring of the underground CO2 for up to 50 years. 1.4 PURPOSE AND NEED FOR AGENCY ACTION According to the Energy Information Administration, coal is an abundant and indigenous energy resource and in 2010 supplied 45 percent of electric power in the U.S. Electricity is vital to the nation’s economy and global competitiveness with demand for electricity projected to increase by 22 percent from 2010 to 2035. Based on its analyses, the Energy Information Administration concludes that this power increase can onlybe achieved if coal use is also increased (EIA 2012). In addition, nearly half of the nation’s electric power generating infrastructure is more than 30 years old, with a significant portion of this infrastructure having been in service for 60 years or more (EIA 2009). These aging facilities are(or soon will be) in need ofsubstantial refurbishment or replacement. Additional capacity must also be put in-service to keep pace with the nation’s ever-growing demand for electricity. Therefore, nearly 40 percent of the nation’s electricity needs will continue to be served by coal for at least the nextseveral decades (EIA 2012). However, there is also a need to address the associated environmental and climate change challenges related to the continued use of coal. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has concluded that global atmospheric concentrations of CO2 have increased 39 percent since the pre-industrial period, and that the primary source of the increase results from the consumption of fossil fuels (IPCC 2007; IPCC 2011). In addition, in 2009 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) found that GHGs endanger both the public health and welfare through their contribution to climate change. Subsequently, on September 20, 2013, the USEPA announced a proposed rule that would set CO2 emissions limits on new fossil fuel-fired generating units. Such rulemaking would significantly affect the future development of coal-based power generation systems unless methods to reduce CO2 emissions, like the approach included in the proposed action, are successfully demonstrated and adopted. Given the heightened awareness of environmental stewardship, while at the same time meeting the demand for a reliable and cost-effective electric power supply, it is in the public interest for the nation’s energy infrastructure to be upgraded with the latest and most advanced commercially viable technologies to achieve improved efficiencies, environmental performance, and cost-competitiveness. To realize acceptance and replication of these advanced technologies into the electric power generation sector, the technologies need to be demonstrated first (i.e., designed and constructed to industrial standards and operated atsignificant scale underindustrial conditions). Thus, agency action is needed to demonstrate advanced technologies to meet the nation’s energy needs with an abundant natural resource and reduce the nation’s output of GHG emissions to improve the global environment. Implementation of FutureGen 2.0 would support the objectives of the FutureGen Initiative to establish the feasibility and viability of producing electricity from coal with at least 90 percent CO2 capture duringsteady-state operation and near-zero emissionsof other pollutants. One of DOE's primary strategic goals is to protect our national and economic security by promoting a diverse supply and delivery of reliable, affordable, and environmentally sound energy. DOE’s proposed action contributes to this strategic goal through cutting-edge research and development focused on clean energy production and use of the nation's domestic fossil energy resources. The principal need addressed by DOE’s proposed action includes the collection and evaluation of data only available from the experience of actually designing, permitting, operating, and maintaining an industrial-scale oxycombustion repowering project with CO2 capture, transport, and geologic storage. Studies by DOE's National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) have identified oxy-combustion technologyas a potentiallycost-effective approach to implementingcarboncapture at existing coal-fueled facilities, including a large cross-section of the world's existing pulverized coal plants (NETL 2008, NETL 2013a, Farzan 2011). It also has the potential for use in new power plants. Because oxycombustion technology is inherently scalable, it is possible to demonstrate the technology at a relatively small commercial-scale such as the project proposed for the Meredosia Energy Center (168 MWe), and then replicate it at larger-scale (e.g., 500+ MWe) power plants. The ability to demonstrate the technology at a smaller butcommercially-relevant scale has substantial cost-saving benefits. A successful project would generate technical, environmental, and financial data from the design, construction, and operation of the integrated electric generation, pipeline, and injection facilities to confirm that oxy-combustion technology with CO2 capture and permanent underground storage can be implemented at a commercial scale. The cost-shared financial assistance fromDOE would reduce the risk to the Alliance in demonstrating the technology at the level of maturity needed for decisions on commercialization. 1.5 NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT 1.5.1 DOE Responsibilities NEPA requires all federal agencies to include, in every recommendation or report on proposals for major federal actions that may significantly affect the quality of the human environment, a detailed statement describing: (1) the potential environmental impacts of the proposed project; (2) any adverse environmental effects that cannot be avoided should the proposal be implemented; (3) alternatives to the proposed project, including the alternative of taking no action; (4) the relationship between local short-term uses of the environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity; and (5) any irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources that would be involved in the proposed project should it be implemented. NEPA also requires consultations with agencies that have jurisdiction or special expertise with respect to any environmental impact involved, and that the detailed statement along with the comments and views of consulted governmental agencies be made available to the public (42 USC 4332). In compliance with NEPA, DOE prepared this EIS for FutureGen 2.0 to inform its decisions regarding whether to provide financial assistance for project activities beyond preliminary design (including detailed design, construction, and operation of the proposed facilities). DOE’s policy is to comply fully with the letter and spirit of NEPA, giving early consideration to environmental values and factors in federal planning and decision-making. This EIS evaluates the environmental impacts of alternatives and facilitates public participation. DOE’s actions with regard to any proposal, including financial awards, are limited prior to completion of the NEPA process (i.e., in accordance with 40 CFR 1506.1(a)). DOE will not provide funds for project activities that could either have an adverse impact on the environment or limit the choice ofreasonable alternatives before the NEPA process is completed. DOE determined that providing financial assistance to FutureGen 2.0 would constitute a major federal action that may significantly affect the quality of the human environment. Therefore, DOE has prepared this EIS to assess the potential impacts on the human environment of the proposed project and reasonable alternatives. DOE has used information provided by the Alliance and Ameren, as well as information provided by state and federal agencies, subject matter experts, and others. This EIS has been prepared in accordance with Section 102(2)(C) of NEPA, as implemented under regulations promulgated by CEQ (40 CFR 1500 through 1508) and as provided in DOE regulations for compliance with NEPA (10 CFR 1021). Figure 1-1 illustrates the steps involved in the EIS process. To formally initiate the NEPA process for FutureGen 2.0, DOE published an NOI to prepare an EIS in the FR on May 23, 2011, under Docket ID No. FR Doc. 2010–12632 (76 FR 29728). After issuing the NOI, DOE conducted a thorough scoping process that included three public scoping meetings and consultation with various interested governmental agencies and stakeholders. Information related to the public scoping meetings is described below in this section and Section 1.6 and included in Appendix A, Public Scoping, and consultation-related correspondence is provided in Appendix B, Consultation Letters. DOE used the results of the scoping efforts to define the scope andareas of emphasis (orfocus)ofthis EIS. EIS = Environmental Impact Statement Figure 1-1. Steps in the NEPA Process 1.5.2 NEPA Scoping Process DOE determined the scope of this EIS based on internal planning and analysis, consultation with federal and state agencies, and involvement of the public. During the public scoping period, DOE solicited public input to ensure that: (1) significant issues were identified early and properly analyzed; (2) issues of minimal significance would not consume excessive time and effort; and (3) the EIS would be in accordance with applicable regulations and guidance. DOE held public scoping meetings on the datesindicated at thefollowing locations: • June 7, 2011 at TaylorvilleHigh School, Taylorville, Illinois • June 8, 2011 at Ironhorse Golf Club, Tuscola, Illinois • June 9, 2011 at Elks Lodge, Jacksonville, Illinois The meeting locations were selected to provide appropriate geographic coverage and reasonable accessibility for stakeholders affected by actions associated with the Meredosia Energy Center site, potential pipelines, and the initial alternative CO2 injection and geologic storage areas. DOE announced the meeting locations and times in its NOI published in the FR on May 23, 2011, and also published announcements in the followinglocal newspapers onthe dates indicated: • Journal-Courier;Jacksonville; May 22, 29;June1, 5 • State Journal-Register; Springfield;May 22;June5 • Breeze-Courier; Taylorville; May 23;June 3, 5 • Herald & Review; Decatur; June 1, 5 • Daily Union; Shelbyville; May31; June 4 • News-Progress; Sullivan;May 25;June 1 • Tri-County Journal; Tuscola; May26;June 2 • Tuscola Journal; Tuscola; May25; June 1 • Record-Herald; Arcola; May 26; June 2 • Journal-Gazette / Times-Courier; Mattoon / Charleston; June 1, 4 Each scoping meeting began with an informal open house from 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. During this time, attendees were able to view project-related posters, handouts, and a video; and to ask questions of DOE, Alliance, and Ameren representatives. The formal scoping meeting at each location began at 7:00 p.m. and included presentations by DOE, the Alliance, and Ameren, followed by an opportunity for public comments.The presentations andcomments were transcribed bya court reporterat each meetinglocation. The public scoping period ended on June 22, 2011, after a 30-day comment period. During the comment period, DOE accepted comments by telephone, facsimile, U.S. mail, and email. DOE announced in the NOI that it would consider late comments to the extent practicable. Appendix A, Public Scoping, provides additional information on the NEPA public scoping processfor this project. 1.6 SCOPE OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT 1.6.1 Issues Identified Prior to the Scoping Process DOE initially identified the environmental resource areas and issues listed below for consideration in the EIS. These resource areas were identified in early planning efforts and listed in the NOI. This list was neither intended to be all-inclusive, nor a predetermined set of resources to be assessed for potential environmental impacts. Resourceareas andissues initiallyidentified byDOE include: • Air quality – potential impacts from emissions during construction and operation of FutureGen 2.0 on local orregionalairquality; • Climate change – potential impacts fromemissions of CO2 and other GHG emissions; • Geology – potential impacts from the injection and storage of CO2 on underground resources such as groundwater supplies, mineral resources, and fossil fuel resources, and the fate and stabilityof CO2 being stored; • Water resources – potential impacts from water utilization, consumption, and wastewater discharges, as well as potential impacts during construction, including stream crossings for linear features; • Floodplains and wetlands – potential wetland and floodplain impacts from construction and operation of projectfacilities; • Biological resources – potential impacts to vegetation, wildlife, threatened or endangered species, and ecologicallysensitive habitats; • Historic and cultural resources – potential impacts related to site development and the associated linearfacilities (e.g.,pipelines); • Infrastructure and land use – potential impacts associated with delivery of feed materials and distribution of products (e.g., access roads, pipelines),andcompatibilitywith adjacent land uses; • Visual resources – potential impacts to the viewshed, scenic views (e.g., impacts from the injection wells, pipeline, and support facilities for the injection wells and pipeline), and perception of the community or locality; • Solid wastes – pollution prevention and waste management issues (e.g., generation, treatment, transport, storage, disposal or reuse), including potential impacts from the generation, treatment, storage,andmanagement of hazardous materials and othersolid wastes; • Traffic – potential impacts from the construction and operation of the facilities, including changes in local traffic patterns, deterioration of roads, traffic hazards, and traffic controls; • Noiseandlight – potential disturbance impacts from construction, transportation of materials, and facilityoperations; • Health and safety issues – potential impacts associated with use, transport, and storage of hazardous chemicals, as well as CO2 capture and transport to the injection wells and risks of leakage; • Socioeconomics – potential impacts to schools, housing, public services, and local revenues, including the creation ofjobs; • Environmental justice – potential for disproportionately high and adverse impacts on minority or low-income populations; • Connected actions – potential impacts from the integrated operations of the oxy-combustion project and sequestration project, as well as potential development of support facilities or supporting infrastructure; • Cumulative effects that could result from the incremental impacts of the proposed project when added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions; and • Regulatory and environmental permitting requirements and environmental monitoring plans associated with the carbon capture facility and CO2 geologic storage activities. 1.6.2 Comments Received and Issues Identified During the Scoping Process Scoping comments were received with respect to specific natural and human environmental resources. Comments were expressed orally by individuals attending the scoping meeting; others were received on comment forms providedatthe meeting,as well as byletter or email. In general, the majority of respondents expressed various concerns, with a primary emphasis on potential impacts to farmers and farmland (e.g., loss of farmland or impacts to soil). Other concerns not directly related to a specific environmental resource included: issues with the experimental nature of the project; a lack of confidence that economic benefits would occur; concerns about the use of public funds for a private endeavor; belief that DOE funding should go toward renewable and alternative energy technologies aside from coal; and concerns about potential increased electricity costs for consumers. In terms of environmental resource-specific concerns, the majority of comments were related to socioeconomics and carbon capture and storage, with a general belief that this technology ultimately contaminates the land instead of the air. The majority of natural resource topics were addressed in terms of impacts to farmlands; issues strictly related to natural resources tended to be general in nature (e.g., potential impacts to surface waters should be addressed). Additionally, two petitions in opposition to the project, signed by a total of about 340 residents and landowners in Morgan County, and one petition signed by 55 residents and landownersin Douglas County, were submitted to DOE. Of the commentors that responded favorably for the project, many commented positively primarily due to economic and job creation benefits for the community, as well as benefits in terms of self-sufficient national energy production. Following the intent of NEPA, DOE uses the scoping process to focus the analysis of issues and impacts in the EIS. Rather than providing responses to specific comments received during scoping, DOE endeavors to ensure that the EIS addresses and analyzes issues and potential environmental impacts appropriately based on commentor concerns. Table 1-1 provides a summary of the scoping comments received, organized by comment category or applicable resource area, and it identifies the appropriate sections in the EIS where the respective issues are addressed. The subjects and issues raised in specific comments are summarized in more detail in Table 3 of Appendix A, Public Scoping. DOE has addressed all substantive scoping comments in this EIS. However, some comments received are outside the scope of this EIS. For example, several respondents indicated that the EIS should include alternatives such as the utilization of renewable energy resources (e.g., wind and solar power). Because the particular goal of the FutureGen Initiative is to demonstrate an advanced power generation facility based on fossil fuels, specifically coal, technologies that would not be based on coal use are not within the scope of this EIS. However, DOE oversees numerous programs that are investigating and supporting a wide variety of energy generation technologies, including many based on renewable sources, as well as programs that promote energy conservation. Several comments were received relating to the environmental and safety impacts of coal mining. Coal is a commercial fuel produced by a regulated industry. The FutureGen 2.0 Project would obtain coal as a commodity fuel source from existing mines. No specific mine has been identified as a source of coal, and no new mines would be developed specifically to support the project. Furthermore, the FutureGen 2.0 Project does not aim to change mining techniques, and DOE has no decisions that would affect coal mining techniques for the proposed project. It is assumed that the coal intended for the project would be used as a feedstock for another facility in the event that the FutureGen 2.0 Project were not constructed, because coal is an abundant fuel source in the United States. The FutureGen 2.0 Project would not change nationwide coal production and, therefore, would not change the environmental impacts of mining, which are generally well known and well described. Hence, DOE considers the environmental impacts of coal mining policiesand operations to be outsidethescopeof this EIS. A few commentors requested detailed cost information about the project, including a life-cycle cost analysis. Among the purposes for DOE’s involvement in the FutureGen 2.0 Project are the demonstration of the technologies involved, the identification of potential efficiencies, and the development of a reference base for the costs associated with oxy-combustion facilities and CO2 capture and storage. Thus, the life cycle cost of the project relative to other technologies is not currently known with certainty, but it is not relevant inDOE's decision-makingprocess for the proposed action. Table 1-1.

On the same date, the USEPA published its NOA for the Draft EIS (78 FR 26027), which initiated the 45-day public comment period(fromMay 3 to June17, 2013). On May 21, 2013, DOE held a public hearing on the Draft EIS for the FutureGen 2.0 Project at the Jacksonville High School, 1211 N. Diamond Street, Jacksonville, Illinois. An informational session was held from 5:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m., followed by the formal presentations and comment period from 6:00 p.m. to approximately 8:00 p.m. Appendix I, Public Comments on the Draft EIS, provides a summaryof the public hearingand commenting period. DOE posted notices in three area newspapers (Jacksonville Journal-Courier, Springfield State Journal-Register, and Illinois Farm Week) during the three weeks prior to the public hearing that announced the hearing date, time, location, and purpose. The same information was also provided in notification letters sent on April 26, 2013, to interested parties, elected officials, federal and state agencies, and non-governmental organizations using the distribution list in Chapter 8 of the Draft EIS. DOE distributed notifications including 147 letters each with a hardcopy of the Draft EIS, 164 notification letters alone, and 180 notifications by email. A total of 46 people signed the attendance sheets for the public hearing, and seven individuals signed up to give oral comments. During the informational session, the public was invited to view various displays about the NEPA process and the FutureGen 2.0 Project and to talk with DOE and Alliance representatives. During the formal hearing, presentations were made by the DOE NEPA Document Manager and the Alliance’s Chief Executive, and the floor was opened for public comments. A court reporter recorded the formal presentations and oral comments as documented in thetranscript included in AppendixI, PublicComments on the Draft EIS. DOE received comments from two federal agencies, two state agencies, one local elected official, four non-governmental or public-private organizations, and seven members of the public during the official 45-day comment period, including the oral comments at the hearing. The comments are catalogued in Appendix I, Public Comments on the Draft EIS, according to the specific comments by each respective commentor along with DOE’s response to each comment. In aggregate, a total of 116 comments were received in 19 separate submissions from 16 individuals (1 member of the public spoke at the hearing and also submitted 3 sets of writtencomments). 1.6.3.2 Summary of Comments on the Draft EIS The largest proportion of comments related to the adequacy of information provided about the project and potential impacts. The majority of resource-specific comments focused on socioeconomic issues, geology, and climate and GHG emissions. Another substantial group of comments was distributed relatively evenly among concerns about health and safety, biological resources, NEPA requirements, and air quality. The remaining group of comments was distributed among other subject areas: alternatives, land use, purpose and need, cumulative impacts, environmental justice, regulatory issues, surface water, wetlands, groundwater, physiography and soils, and utilities. The categories and principal issues expressed in the comments are summarized below based on the full text of all comments included in Appendix I, Public Comments on the Draft EIS. Comments about the adequacy of information in the Draft EIS expressed dissatisfaction with the level of detail provided about the project and engineering features, alleged that the Alliance withheld or provided inconsistent information, questioned the Alliance’s qualifications to complete the project, claimed that the Draft EIS did not provide adequate information about financial assurances and monitoring for the geologic CO2 storage component, or alleged other deficiencies in project information. Several comments on socioeconomic issues expressed support for the project based on the potential for economic stimulus andother benefits. Other socioeconomic comments expressedconcerns about potential cost overruns and the adverse impacts on taxpayers and ratepayers. Additional comments questionedwhether the project would be justifiedby a full cost-benefit analysis, expressedconcerns about economicrisks, or questionedwhethereconomicbenefits would be realized. Geology-related comments expressed concerns about whether selection of the CO2 storage area was justified, whether the geologic storage formation could adequately support the project, whether the caprockformationcouldwithstand the chemical effects of CO2 injection, and similar issues. Comments on climate and GHGs included some that questioned whether the project would in fact reduce GHG emissions, questioned the validity of climate change, or expressed concerns about other GHG issues. Other comments expressed support for the project based on potential reductions in emissions from fossil fuel combustion.  The balance of comments addressed other subjects, including potential health and safety risks associated with leakage from the CO2 storage formation or the pipeline, mitigation for potential biological resource impacts, concerns about DOE’s implementation of NEPA, claims that the purpose and need or consideration of alternatives were not adequately addressed, or concerns about potential impacts on other resources. In preparing the Final EIS, DOE fully considered all comments bothindividually and cumulatively, including comments received after the closing date. DOE also updated the EIS to reflect: (a) project design changes, (b) studies not yet completed in time to be included in the Draft EIS, and (c) recent regulatory developments. 1.6.4 Decision to be Made by DOE This EIS identifies and analyzes the potential impacts of the FutureGen 2.0 Project at the Meredosia Energy Center, the proposed CO2 pipeline, the injection wells, and the educational facilities in Morgan County. Evaluations of potential impacts included in this EIS are intended to support the federal decision whether to provide cost-shared funding to the Alliance for final design, construction, and operation of the Oxy-Combustion Large Scale Test and for the CO2 Pipeline and Storage Reservoir. If DOE decides to fund these subsequent phases of the FutureGen 2.0 Project, DOE would specify measures to mitigate potential adverse impacts. The Alliance would be required to implement the measures identified through the NEPA process in order to continue receiving DOE funds. In the absence of DOE cost-shared funding (the no action alternative), it is unlikely that the FutureGen 2.0 Project would proceed. Thus, for purposes of analysisin this EIS, theno actionalternative is definedas a “no-build” scenario. No sooner than 30 days after the USEPA publication of a NOA of the Final EIS in the FR, DOE will announce in a ROD the selection of either the proposed action or the no action alternative. Should the proposed action be selected in the ROD, the Alliance would make the additional engineering design decisions to ensure compliance with any required conditions contained in the ROD. 1.7 ORGANIZATION AND CONTENTSOFTHE EIS The balance ofthis EISis organized into thefollowingchapters with associated contents: Chapter 2 describes the DOE proposed action and no action alternative, and alternatives that DOE considered but determined not to be reasonable. The chapter also describes the activities, including measures to mitigate potential adverse impacts, to be undertaken by the Alliance for the Oxy-Combustion Large Scale Test and the CO2 Pipeline and Storage Reservoir. The chapter provides information on the locations of proposed project components; the technologies involved; and resource requirements, process outputs, and construction and operation plans. Chapter 3, Affected Environment and Impacts, describes the baseline conditions in the region and the potential impacts of the DOE proposed action and the no action alternative for 19subjects that encompass the full range of resources in the physical, natural, and human environment. Each section describes the region of influence (ROI) of project activities, the method of analysis, and the potential impacts of project construction and operation. Also, as appropriate for each resource, the chapter describes means of reducing impacts. Chapter 4, Summary of Environmental Consequences, summarizes the potential adverse impacts of the FutureGen 2.0 Project and provides additional information about environmental effects, including measures to mitigate adverse impacts, potential cumulative impacts, and other subjects required by NEPA and CEQ regulations. The final chapters provide the regulatory and permit requirements (Chapter 5), technical references (Chapter 6), consultations undertaken (Chapter 7), the distribution list for the Final EIS (Chapter 8), a list of EISpreparers(Chapter 9), and a glossary (Chapter 10). INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK 2 PROPOSEDACTIONANDALTERNATIVES This chapter describes DOE’s proposed action and other alternatives considered by the agency. Section 2.1 provides an overview of DOE’s proposed action with details of the FutureGen 2.0 Project components being presented in Sections 2.4 and 2.5. These sections describe the resource requirements; process outputs; and construction, operation, and decommissioning plans associated with the FutureGen 2.0 Project. Section 2.2 describestheno action alternative as required byNEPA and applicable CEQ and DOE regulations. A comparison of potential environmental impacts for each alternative is presented in the Summary (Table S-4) and in Chapter 4, Summary of Environmental Consequences (Table 4.1-1). Section 2.3 discusses other alternatives that were considered but dismissed from further evaluationandthe reasons for their dismissal. DOE developedthe range of reasonable alternatives forthe FutureGen 2.0 Project based on the following: • Evaluation of various clean coal technologies reviewed through the Clean Coal Power Initiative (CCPI) Program; • Data obtained and reviewed through variousfunding opportunity announcements; • Analysis of the original FutureGen Project in terms of technology, costs, and suitability for geologic storage; and • Interest of industriesto participate inprojectsto support FutureGen 2.0. 2.1 DOE PROPOSED ACTION DOE proposes to provide approximately $1 billion of financial assistance to the Alliance for the FutureGen 2.0 Project. The financial assistance would support final design (Phase II), construction and commissioning (Phase III), and operations (Phase IV). The FutureGen 2.0 Project consists of two major components: the Oxy-Combustion Large Scale Test and the CO2 Pipeline and Storage Reservoir (seeFigure 2-1). These components are summarized in this section and described in detail in Sections 2.4 and 2.5 respectively. For the Oxy-Combustion Large Scale Test, the Alliance would acquire portions of the Meredosia Energy Center in west central Illinois from Ameren and incorporate advanced oxy-combustion technology into the reconstruction of an idle electric generating unit (Unit 4). Through the use of the existing Meredosia Energy Center, the oxy-combustion component of the FutureGen 2.0 Project would be constructed on a brownfield site (i.e., a previously developed site), which would enable the project to move forward with less expense and fewer environmental impacts than would occur if the project were to be constructed on a greenfield site (i.e., an undeveloped site). The scope of the Oxy-Combustion Large Scale Test consists of final design, procurement, manufacture, installation, startup, testing, and operation of the proposed integrated oxy-combustion coalboiler. A coal boileris a vessel that is used to generate heat through the combustion of coal in order to produce steam that can then be put to productive use (i.e.,the generation of electricity). The term “oxy-combustion”refers to the use of manufactured oxygen in the coal combustion process. The proposed oxy-combustion technology would include CO2 capture, purification, and compression equipment. The reconstructed electric generating unit would be designed to generate approximately 168 MWe (gross output). The CO2 captured from the oxy-combustion facility would be cleaned, compressed for transport, and delivered to a pipelinefortransport to the CO2 Storage Reservoir. FutureGen 2.0 Project Features Oxy-Combustion Large Scale Test – Construction and operation of an integrated oxy-combustion coal boiler with CO2 capture, purification, and compression. CO2 Pipeline – Construction and operation of approximately 30 miles of pipeline to transport CO2 from the Meredosia Energy Center to a storage reservoir in Morgan County. Storage Reservoir – Construction and operation of surface facilities, and injection and permanent storage of captured CO2 into a deep geologic formation. Evolving Project Design It is important to recognize that the FutureGen 2.0 Project has evolved since it was initially developed in 2011 and will continue to evolve as the Alliance works with local landowners and identifies cost-saving opportunities. However, the preliminary design described in this chapter and analyzed in this EIS is expected to reflect conservative, bounding parameters for critical features, which would not change substantially such that the impacts described in this EIS would be exceeded. Figure 2-1. The FutureGen 2.0 Project For the CO2 Pipeline and Storage Reservoir, the Alliance would design, construct, and operate a CO2 transmission pipelineand a geologic injection and storage facility. Thepipelinewould transport CO2 from the Meredosia Energy Center (Meredosia, Morgan County, Illinois) to the CO2 storage study area in Morgan County approximately 30 miles east of the Meredosia Energy Center (see Figure 2-2). Deep injection wells would be installed at the CO2 storage study area and used to inject CO2 into the storage reservoir (i.e., the Mt. Simon Formation) at a depth of approximately 4,000 feet below ground surface (bgs). The Mt. Simon Formation is the major deep saline formation in the Illinois Basin. The pipeline and storage reservoir would be designed to respectively transport and store up to 24 million tons (22 million metric tons) of CO2 over a 20-year operating period. In addition, the Alliance would construct and operate facilities for research, training, andvisitors near Jacksonville, Morgan County,Illinois. The FutureGen 2.0 Project would begin final design in 2013 after completion of the NEPA process. Construction would begin in 2014, with commissioning in 2017. Operations and monitoring would continue with DOE funding until 2022 (56 months after commissioning). Performance and economic test results would be shared among all participants, industry, non-governmental organizations, and the public. After DOE’s involvement ceases, the FutureGen 2.0 Project would be expected to continue commercial operations, including CO2 capture and storage, for 20 years. After commercial operations cease, post-injection monitoring of theunderground CO2 would continuefor up to 50 years. 2.2 NO ACTION ALTERNATIVE Under the no action alternative, DOE would not continue to fund the FutureGen 2.0 Project into the final design, construction, and operation phases. Without DOE funding, it is unlikely that the Alliance, or industry in general, would undertake the utility-scale integration of CO2 capture and geologic storage with a coal-fueled power plant using oxy-combustion. Therefore, the no action alternative also represents a “no-build” alternative. Without DOE's investment in a utility-scale facility, the development of oxycombustion repowered plants integrated with CO2 capture and geologic storage would occur more slowly or not at all. 2.3 ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED BUT DISMISSED FROM FURTHER EVALUATION This section discusses other alternatives that were considered but dismissed from further evaluation and the reasons for their dismissal. Chapter 1 of this EIS, Purpose and Need, describes the background and history of the FutureGen Initiative culminating in the FutureGen 2.0 Project (see Section 1.2), which explains the alternative technologies considered in the evolving project. DOE’s primary objective to advance the programmatic goal of CO2 capture and storage through the FutureGen Initiative was addressed in the Final EIS for the original FutureGen Project (DOE 2007a) and associated ROD (74 FR 35174 [2009]). CO2 = carbon dioxide Figure 2-2. Project Location Map 2.3.1 Alternative Fuel Sources Because the FutureGen Initiative was conceived for the purpose of encouraging commercial development of advanced coal-based carbon capture and storage technologies, other technologies that cannot serve to carry out that goal are not reasonable alternatives. Nuclear power, renewable energy sources (e.g., wind and solar power), and energy conservation improvements do not address the specific goal of capturing and storing CO2 emissions from coal-fueled energy production and therefore are not considered to be reasonable alternatives for the FutureGen 2.0 Project. These fuel sources, as well as many others, are addressed by other programs and projects in DOE’s diverse portfolio of energy research, development, and demonstration efforts. 2.3.2 Alternative Advanced Coal-based Electric Generating Technologies Technologies for carbon capture at advanced coal-based electric generating facilities fall into two general categories, pre-combustion and post-combustion. Pre-combustion capture technologies remove carbon from the process stream (fuel gas) after the solid coal feed has been converted (i.e., gasified). Postcombustion capture technologies remove carbon from the process stream (flue gas) after it has been combusted in the boiler. As explained in Section 1.2, the original FutureGen Project considered the demonstration of IGCC technology for the generation of electricity with pre-combustion capture and storage of CO2 that would otherwise be emitted. Rising costs for the original project delayed DOE’s decision and during the intervening time a number of commercial IGCC projects were proposed, many of which would employ pre-combustion carbon capture technology similar to that which was to be proven by the original FutureGen Project. At the time of award of the FutureGen 2.0 Project, DOE had already awarded funding for four other large-scale projects intended to demonstrate the underlying IGCC concept of the original FutureGen Project. Due to the now-commercial status of IGCC, along with multiple pre-combustion carbon capture projects within DOE’s demonstration portfolio, DOE identified the need for a utility-scale demonstration of post-combustion carbon capture technologies. Accordingly, the agency does not consider pre-combustion technologies tobe reasonable alternatives for the FutureGen 2.0 Project. 2.3.3 Alternative Retrofitting Technologies Through review and consideration of the data and analysis associated with the original FutureGen Project, DOE identified the repowering of an existing power plant with oxy-combustion technology as the approach that would best meet cost and technology advancement objectives of the FutureGen Initiative. Instead of funding the construction and operation of a new IGCC plant, DOE considered two options for retrofitting an existing power plant to facilitate carbon capture and storage: repowering with oxycombustion technology or post-combustion scrubbing. DOE determined that the selection of the oxycombustion technology for testing and evaluation would complement its CCPI portfolio by providing the opportunity to address a technology option that otherwise would be absent from DOE’s slate of projects. Therefore, DOE chose to consider retrofitting an existing power plant with oxy-combustion technology as a lower-cost replacement for the IGCC process originally proposed in the FutureGen Project. Because DOE is already assessing the merits of post-combustion scrubbing in other projects, the agency does not considerthat technologytobe a reasonable alternative forthe FutureGen 2.0 Project. 2.3.4 Alternative Sites for the Oxy-Combustion Large Scale Test After concluding that there were insufficient funds available for a new IGCC power plant at the site that had been selected by the Alliance for the original FutureGen Project in Mattoon, Illinois, DOE identified the Meredosia Energy Center as an existing power plant that could be repowered with oxy-combustion technology. The Meredosia Energy Center is close enough to the Mattoon site that CO2 could be readily transported by pipeline to the Mattoon site for injection and permanent storage in the Mt. Simon Formation. An idle electrical generating unit (Unit 4) at the Meredosia Energy Center would provide a reconstructable turbine generator at a scalable size for the commercial demonstration of oxy-combustion repowering technology. The facility would also provide for the capture of CO2 at a sufficient operating capacitytodemonstratethetransportand geologic storage of CO2 at a commercial scale. DOE did notidentify any otherexisting, appropriately sized power plants from which captured CO2 could be transported economically to the Mattoon site for injection and permanent storage. It is difficult for owners of existing power plants to accept the financial and operational risks associated with repowering existing equipment and adding untested CO2 capture and storage to their plants. Further, commercial ventures generally cannot accept the intensive testing and interruptions of power generation that would be associated with repowering and the startup and testing of carbon capture and storage. Commercial operators are bound by power purchase agreements that are unforgiving of delivery failures, and the power market does not offer much flexibilityinnegotiatingthe terms and conditions inthese agreements. Ameren was willing to make the Meredosia Energy Center’s Unit 4 available for the FutureGen Initiative in part because the aging unit was not a baseload power generator and operated only sporadically to provide peaking power. Therefore, Unit 4 repowering efforts at Meredosia Energy Center would not pose unacceptable disruptions of power generation or affect existing power purchase agreements. With no other power plant owners willing to undertake the inherent financial and operational risks, DOE considers the Meredosia Energy Center to be the only viable location for the Oxy-Combustion Large Scale Test component of FutureGen 2.0. DOE does not consider other power plants that are not available to the FutureGen 2.0 Project tobereasonable alternatives. 2.3.5 Alternative CO2 Pipeline and Storage Reservoir Locations After DOE and the Alliance identified the Meredosia Energy Center for the FutureGen Initiative, the Mattoon site proponents withdrew their site from further consideration based on a determination that use of the site strictly for CO2 storage was not in the community’s best interest. In response to the Mattoon site being withdrawn as a storage site, DOE asked the Alliance to identify alternative storage sites from which it would be economically viable to transport the CO2 captured at the Meredosia Energy Center for injection and permanent storage in the same formation as proposed for that Mattoon site (the Mt. Simon Formation). The Alliance then undertook a siting process, similar to the process originally used to select the Mattoon site, to identify possible locations. The Alliance’s siting process included screening sites against specific qualifying criteria related to geologic conditions as well as a variety of other factors including land use and environmental considerations (see Section 2.5.2.1). DOE proactively reviewed the qualifying and selectioncriteria before release to the public and prospective bidders. After proposals were received and scored by the Alliance, the Alliance briefed DOE on the outcome and prepared a summary report, which was submitted to DOE in March 2011. This process culminated in the selection of a site in Morgan County as the Alliance’s preferred site, with sites in Christian County and Douglas County being identified as potential alternate sites. DOE reviewed the Alliance’s report on the selection process for fairness, technical accuracy, and compliance and determined that the Alliance’s preferred site and alternatesites were appropriate for detailedanalysis. Throughout 2011 and 2012, the Alliance conducted a detailed geological analysis at the preferredMorgan County site (i.e., the CO2 storage study area) to characterize and verify the viability of the proposed CO2 storage reservoir. The Alliance also conducted pipeline routing studies for the three sites under consideration, as well as desktop and targeted field studies to confirm the absence of any sensitive environmental resources that could be adversely affected by the project. Through these analyses, the Alliance also determined that the costs of siting, constructing, and operating a CO2 pipeline to either the Christian County or Douglas County sites would be cost-prohibitive. The Alliance estimated that an additional $50 million to $100 million would be required to construct pipelines that would be approximately 50 miles (Christian County) and 100 miles (Douglas County) longer than pipelines required for the Morgan County site. Due to the findings of the geological analysis and environmental studies, combined with a cost analysis of the pipelines to the alternate sites, the Alliance confirmed that the proposedMorgan Countysiteremainedits preferred site. On July 17, 2012, the Alliance Board of Directors confirmed that the proposed Morgan County site remained its preferred location and voted to direct the Alliance to no longer pursue the sites in Christian County and Douglas County as alternate sites due to cost considerations. The Alliance notified DOE and the proponents of Christian County and Douglas County that their locations were no longer being considered as alternate sites and that the Alliance would not construct or operate a CO2 storage reservoir at eithersite. As a result,the site proponents were released to find other reasonable usesfortheirproposed sites. Because of the Alliance’s decision to no longer consider the Christian County and Douglas County sites, DOE has determined that these sites are not reasonable alternatives as CO2 storage reservoirs for FutureGen 2.0. Therefore, thesesites have been eliminated from further consideration in this EIS. 2.4 FUTUREGEN 2.0 OXY-COMBUSTION LARGE SCALE TEST For the FutureGen 2.0 Project, the Alliance would purchase from Ameren portions of the Meredosia Energy Center as described in Section 2.4.1. With support from Babcock & Wilcox and Air Liquide, the Alliance would design, construct, and operate an advanced oxy-combustion power generation plant. The oxy-combustion facility has a proposed design capacity of 168 MWe (gross) and would be integrated into the Meredosia Energy Center in order to make use of existing facilities and infrastructure. The facility would operate continuously to generate baseload electric power. The project would repower the existing Unit 4 steam turbine generator, and capture and compress approximately 1.2 million tons (1.1 million metric tons) of CO2 per year for subsequent transport and geologic storage. The project would be designed to meet DOE’s CO2 capture target of at least 90 percent during steady-state operations (the project may achieve a 98 percent capture efficiency), while reducing emissions levels of sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, mercury, acid gases, and particulate matter during normal operations. 2.4.1 The Meredosia Energy Center In October 2011, Ameren announced that the Meredosia Energy Center would suspend operations at the end of 2011 (see Section 2.4.1.5 for further discussion). The facility is currently not operating, but Ameren is complying with applicable permits and associated requirements and will maintain the facilities to be available for the FutureGen 2.0 Project. All equipment remains in operable condition, which would enable Ameren to operate the generating facilities if the resumption of operations were to fit Ameren’s requirements. This possibility would remain until final decisions for the FutureGen 2.0 Project would be made and the project implemented. This section describes features and operating conditions at the energy center as they existed during 2011 and in recent history. The Meredosia Energy Center, shown in Figure 2-3, is located adjacent to the east side of the Illinois River,southof the villageofMeredosia, Illinois. Meredosia has a population of approximately 1,044 (USCB 2010a) and is approximately 18 miles west of Jacksonville, Illinois. The 5,300-foot western boundary of the 263-acre Meredosia Energy Center fronts the Illinois River, where the station's oil and coal barge unloading facilities are located. Land use immediately east of the energy center consists of roadways, roadway rights-of-way (ROWs), rail access, and an unused railroad ROW. Beyond these immediate areas, land use is primarily residential to the north and northeast, scattered residential and agricultural to the east, and industrial to the south. Across the river, approximately 700 feet west, are forested lands, a small portion of a levee, and a transmission line ROW. The Meredosia Energy Center is a thermal plant designed to produce electricity. In a thermal plant, energy from fuel (e.g., coal) is used to heat water and create steam. The generated steam converts the heat energy captured in the steam into mechanical energy by spinning turbines that in turn spin electric generators that produce electricity. The two main features of a thermal plant are the boiler that generates heat through the combustion of coal or other fuels, and the turbine-generator system that includes the steam turbine and electric generator. Other plant components support these systems. Major boiler support systems are the coal handling and fuel systems, steam and watersystems for the boiler and turbine, air andflue gas system, and waste management systems. Figure 2-4 provides an overall aerial view of the existing Meredosia Energy Center property and surrounding areas. Figures 2-5 and 2-6 show close-up aerial views of the existing coal handling facilities and the main plantarea,respectively. The Meredosia Energy Center includes four electric generating units. An electric generating unit refers to the combination, or unit, of equipment that is used to generate electricity including the boilers that create heat energy through combustion, steam cycle equipment that uses the heat to generate steam, steam turbines that convert the steam to mechanical energy, and electric generators that convert the mechanical energy to electricity. These units also include supporting equipment and facilities. Units 1 and 2 were driven by steam from four coal-fired boilers (Boilers 1, 2, 3, and 4), with each unit having a nominal rated generating capacity (i.e., capacity) of 60 MWe. Unit 3 received steam from one coal-fired boiler (Boiler 5) and has a capacity of 229 MWe. Units 1 and 2 were placed in service in 1948 and 1949, respectively. Unit 3 was placed in servicein 1960. Unit 4 consists of one oil-fired boiler (Boiler 6) and has a capacity of 200 MWe. Unit 4 was placed in service as an interimmeasure in 1975 to meet anticipatedloadgrowthuntil newgeneratingfacilitiescame online in 1977. During the 1980s and early 1990s, Unit 4 was operated as a peaking unit and has accumulated approximately 20,000 hours of operation, with 900 starts. Peaking units are electric generating units that are only used during periods of high electricity demand. Under the FutureGen 2.0 Project, Unit 4 would be repowered using a new oxy-combustion coal-fired boiler in place of the existing oil-fired boiler. The main facilities include a building that houses Boilers 1 through 5 as well as the steam turbine generators for Units 1, 2, 3, and 4. Additional structures include the coal breaker building, tractor shed, and several warehouses. Exclusive of the chimneys (stacks), which are the tallest structures at the facility (the tallest stack, at Unit 1, is 526 feet in height), components of the main buildings range in height from 24 to 209 feet. The energycenter property covers approximately 263 acres. The Meredosia Energy Center currently has two main fuel systems: coal for Units 1, 2, and 3 (Boilers 1 through 5) and fuel oil for Unit 4 (Boiler 6). Secondary fuel systems include distillate fuel oil as auxiliary fuel for startup of Boilers 1 through 6 and flame stabilization for Boilers 1 through 5, plus natural gas for the main burner ignition on Boiler 6. The existing coal handling system at the Meredosia Energy Center serves Units 1 and 2, which typically burned bituminous coal from Illinois sources, and Unit 3, which typically burned 100 percent Powder River Basin sub-bituminous coal from Wyoming. However, Unit 3 has burned both Illinois coal and a blend of Illinois and Powder River Basin coals. During operations, the bituminous coal was delivered by truck, while the Powder River Basin coal was delivered by barge (from St. Louis, Missouri, where it was delivered from Wyoming via rail). Powder River Basin coal was unloaded from the barge via a clamshell bucket into the barge unloading hopper. From there, the coal was transferred via various conveyors and other mechanisms to storage and boiler-usage locations. Particulate emissions associated with the coal handling and storage were controlled by various dust suppression measures, including a water spray, enclosures, and covers. Before 2012, the coal handling system was running about 5 to 6 hours per day, 7 days per week, to supply coalfrom the barges directly to the Boiler 5 coal bunkers. Unit 4’s Boiler 6 was designed to be run on fuel oil. Fuel oil was delivered by tanker barge and unloaded at the fuel oil unloading facility downstream of the coal barge unloading facility, or by truck near the fuel oil tanks. The fuel oil was piped from the tanker barges to two fuel oil storage tanks located east of the coal storage area, each with a 4.6 million-gallon capacity and located inside bermed areas (see Figure 2-4). ASU = airseparationunit; cy = cubicyard; kV =kilovolt; NPDES = NationalPollutantDischargeElimination System Figure 2-6. Meredosia Energy Center Features – Coal and Fuel Handling Systems The fuel oil was also used to power onsite mobile equipment (scraper, dozers, etc.) and some stationary equipment. Eight 14,000-gallon distillate fuel oil tanks and a 14,000-gallon diesel tank are located south of the coal breaker house (see Figure 2-5). Boiler 6 also used natural gas for main burner ignition and eitherdistillate fuel oil ornatural gas as anauxiliaryfuel duringstartup. 2.4.1.1 Boiler and Turbine Steam and Water Systems Makeup water for the boiler and turbine steam system was supplied by onsite groundwater production wells shared in common by all units. Wells 5, 6, and 7 were installed in 1974, 1978, and 1994, respectively. Each well has a capacity of 400 to 500 gallons per minute (gpm). Only Wells 5, 6, and 7 are in operation; Wells 3 and 4 are older and no longer used. Well locations are shown in Figure 2-6. All wells are screened near the bottom of the Cahokia formation at a little over 100 feet in depth. Raw well water was treated in a resin demineralizer for use as demineralized water, and also used for other plant functions such as potable water, dust suppression for the coal handling facilities, and freeze protection of the bottom ash pond. The deep well water storagetank islocated west of the water treatment building. The main use of cooling water in a thermal plant is to condense the steam in the steam cycle. Boilers 1 through 5 were designed for once-through cooling, and Boiler 6 has a closed recirculating system with a cooling tower (located at the north end of the energy center, bordering the river). The Illinois River supplied the main condenser and auxiliary cooling water for Units 1 through 3, makeup cooling water for Unit 4 cooling tower, and miscellaneous Unit 4 auxiliary cooling needs. River water was withdrawn through screens in the intake structure shown in Figure 2-4. The intake structure design capacity is approximately 272,000 gpm (or 392 million gallons per day [mgd]). Currently, there is no permit limitationonthe amount ofriver water thatcanbe withdrawn. The public water supply for the energy center was provided by the Meredosia water distribution system and was used for fire protection water and some maintenance activities. The existing fire protection water storage tankcapacity is 325,000 gallons. 2.4.1.2 Air and Flue Gas System The energy center includes three chimneys that vent flue gas from boiler combustion. The chimney for Boilers 1 through 4 is 32 feet in diameter at the base and 526 feet tall. Boiler 5’s chimney is 301 feet tall and Boiler 6’s chimney is 184 feettall. The Meredosia Energy Center holds several air operating permits, including those for the operation of Units 1 through 4. Reported emissions at the energy center in tons per year for 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010 are summarized in Table 2-1. 2.4.1.3 Waste Management Systems Coal Combustion Residual (Ash) Fly ash (fine particles generated during the combustion of coal that were collected by the electrostatic precipitators prior to discharge to the atmosphere) and bottom ash (coarse particles generated during the combustion of coal that fall by gravity to the bottom of the boiler) were sluiced to separate ponds as shown in Figure 2-4. The bottom ash pond capacity is 300,000 cubic yards (8,100,000 cubic feet) and the fly ash pond capacity is 1,000,000 cubic yards (27,000,000 cubic feet). Prior to 2012, the ash ponds served Units 1, 2, and 3. These ash ponds would not be used for the FutureGen 2.0 Project. See Section2.4.4.2 for a description of how bottom ash and fly ash would be handled in the proposed project. See Section 2.4.1.5 for a discussionregardingthe management of the existingash ponds. Table 2-1. Reported Air Emissions at the Meredosia Energy Center a. Filterableparticulatesonly.

The majority of onsite runoff from the developed areas of the property currently drains into the fly ash and bottom ash ponds. The energy center did not operate a wastewater treatment system. The sanitary wastewater was collected and routed to a single pointof discharge to the village of Meredosia’ssewer system. 2.4.1.4 Transportation Resources Illinois Highway (IL-) 104 is the main regional route into Meredosia and to the energy center site. The closest interstate is Interstate (I-) 72, which is about 10 miles south of Meredosia. From IL-104, Washington Street and Old Naples Road provide direct access to Cips Drive, the main entrance roadway into the energy center site.Truck traffic accessing the site transported fuel oil and coal. These trucks used a bypass road fromIL-104 to avoid traveling through the village of Meredosia, accessing the site fromthe south. An old gravel road that cuts through a patch of wooded area within the northern property provides access into the energy center from an existing boat ramp site, but is not typically used. Another gravel road exists in the southern portion of the property, which provides access into the site, but is also not typically used. The energy center site originally had a rail spur for coal delivery; however, this has been removed. As noted earlier, barge unloading facilities are located on the Illinois River along the northwestern border ofthesite for Powder River Basincoalandfuel oil deliveries. 2.4.1.5 Suspension of Energy Center Operations At the end of 2011, Ameren suspended operations at the Meredosia Energy Center due mainly to the expected costs of complying with recently implemented air regulations, specifically the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule issued in July 2011 by the USEPA. The Cross-State Air Pollution Rule was subsequently vacated and remanded by the U.S. Court of Appeals on August 21, 2012. Since Ameren suspended operations at the end of 2011, only security personnel work at the energy center, with a few Ameren employees onsite fromtime to time to performperiodic inspections of the facility to comply with ongoing environmental monitoring requirements and to maintain facility integrity for the FutureGen 2.0 Project. Suspension of operations means that the energy center currently is not operating, but Ameren is complying with applicable permits and their associated requirements. All equipment remains in operable condition, which would allow Ameren to reactivate the facilities in the future if those operations fit into Ameren's requirements. If the FutureGen 2.0 Project were to be implemented, the energy center’s boiler operations and auxiliary operations not associated with the FutureGen 2.0 Project would be terminated. Ameren has no current plans to resume operation of the power generation infrastructure at the energy center. Closure of the ash ponds could occur during the FutureGen 2.0 Project depending upon timing of the submittal and Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) approval of the ash pond closure plan and the time required to complete the closure. Ameren and the Alliance have agreed that the ash ponds would not be part of the asset transfer associated with the FutureGen 2.0 Project. Environmental liability associated with the existing ash ponds and compliance with current or future regulations remain with Ameren until such time as the property and environmental liability may be transferred to a third party. The management of the ash ponds (past, current, and future) is the responsibility of Ameren and would not affect the implementation, construction, or operation of the FutureGen 2.0 Project. Therefore, any potential environmental impacts resulting from the ash ponds are not relevant to the evaluation of potential impactsfrom theconstruction and operationof the FutureGen 2.0 Project. Ameren has not undertaken environmental decommissioning activities, as they have been deemed premature at this time. Ameren conducted an asbestos survey at the energy center and labeled thermal piping as either containing or not containing asbestos. Ameren has also conducted evaluations for polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-containing equipment. There is minimal electrical equipment containing PCBs, and such equipment is properly labeled. There has been no evaluation of lead-based paint within the energycenter;norhas there beena Phase 1 Environmental Site Assessment conducted atthe site. Ameren formally notified the U.S. Coast Guard that operations of the fuel oil unloading river facility and the associated fuel oil storage facility have been suspended. As a result, the security requirements for these facilities under Maritime Security have been suspended. Air and water permits will remain active to maintaincurrent water discharge outfalls andair emissions sources. In conjunction with the suspension of operations, Ameren shut down equipment associated with Units 1, 2, and 3 in place along with Boiler 6. Ameren retained the availability of the Unit 4 turbine generator and its balance of plant equipment for use by FutureGen 2.0. Project common systems, such as intake structures, service water, well water, demineralizer, condensate storage, fire protection, coal handling, auxiliary power, service and instrument air, and other systems required to support the FutureGen 2.0 Project were alsoretained. Ameren would remove chemicals, oils, and fuel not required for FutureGen 2.0 from the site and either use these materials at other Ameren facilities, recycle them where practical, or characterize and properly dispose of them in accordance with applicable regulations. Ameren will oversee periodic monitoring of the facility to ensure its integrity for use by FutureGen 2.0. In addition, the ash ponds will be monitored with respect to dam safety and NPDES requirements. Ameren will maintain other inspection, monitoring and reporting requirements in accordance with active environmental permits. Site restoration activities would depend upon Ameren’sfuture decisions with respect to the property. 2.4.2 Oxy-Combustion Large Scale Test The Oxy-Combustion Large Scale Test component of the FutureGen 2.0 Project would include the design, construction, and operation of an oxy-combustion power generation plant (Alliance 2012). A simplified diagram of an oxy-combustion facility is provided in Figure 2-7. This facility would be integrated into the existing infrastructure of the Meredosia Energy Center and would include the addition of a new oxy-combustion coal boiler with equipment to capture, purify, and compress CO2 for use in the CO2 Pipeline and Storage Reservoir component of the project (see Section 2.5 for details on pipeline and storage). Source: Babcock &Wilcox 2010 ASU = air separation unit; CO2 = carbon dioxide; CPU = compression and purification unit; H2O =water; N2 = nitrogen; NCGs = non-condensable gases; O2 = oxygen; SO2 = sulfurdioxide Figure 2-7. Simplified Diagram of Oxy-Combustion Facility Major components of the proposed oxy-combustion facility (new and existing) and an overview of their key features are provided in Table 2-2. Existing infrastructure that would be used by the project includes coal handling systems (delivery, storage, and conveyance), water supply systems (intake structures and wells), wastewater discharge outfalls, the main cooling tower (to be rebuilt from the existing Unit 4 cooling tower), substation equipment, the Unit 4 steam generator, the Unit 4 electric generator, and other common plant infrastructure such as roadways. A conceptual layout of the facility that depicts the location of new and existing equipment is presented in Figure 2-8. Details of the oxy-combustion facility and process features are providedinSection 2.4.2.1. To accommodate the proposed oxy-combustion facility at the Meredosia Energy Center, several existing warehouses, a deaerator, and one of the condensate storage tanks would be relocated. Three existing groundwater supply wells (Wells 3, 4, and 5) would be decommissioned and a new replacement well would be installed. The main cooling tower would be reconstructed and two additional cooling towers would be constructed, one for the direct contact cooler polishing system and one for both the air separation unit and compression and purificationunit. The capacity and configuration of the proposed facility is based on using the Babcock & Wilcox–Air Liquide cool recycle oxy-combustion process and would fire a mix of high-sulfur bituminous coal and Table 2-2.

Cooling towers are used to provide cool water for the condensation of steam in the steam condenser and to remove excess heat from other system processes (e.g., ASU and CPU). Process Water Systems Includes use of existing water intake structures and wells (one new well) to supply (existing & new) water to the plant and new water treatment systems to remove water impurities. Wastewater Treatment Includes three new wastewater treatment systems that would remove pollutants from Systems (new) wastewater generated in the CPU, the DCCPS, and areas where stormwater could be contaminated byindustrial activities. Coal Storage and Includes delivery, storage, and conveyance systems. Handling (existing) Exhaust Stack(new) A new exhaust stack (chimney) would be approximately 450 feet tall and contain two exhaust vents, one for the oxy-combustion boiler during air firing operations and a second for the CPU. The exhaust stack would discharge treated flue gas during normal operations, discharge monitored volumes of flue gas during unit startup and the transition to oxygen-fired status, and discharge flue gas and CO2 during normal shutdown. Auxiliary Boiler (new) A new auxiliary boiler would be used to provide steam to the plant that is needed during the startup process.

This new boiler would repower the existing Unit 4 steam turbine. Oxy-combustion is essentially conventional coal combustion using a mixture of manufactured oxygen and recycled flue gas instead of ambient air in the combustion process. This technology effectively removes nitrogen from the combustion process, which significantly reduces the flue gas mass flow and facilitates the capture of high purity CO2 flue gas. There are three major components in the oxycombustion facility including the air separation unit, power block and balance of plant, and compression and purification unit. Air Separation Unit The main function of the air separation unit is to generate oxygen from ambient air for use in the boiler combustion process. The first step in the air separation unit is to compress, purify, and dry ambient air by removing water and other minor impurities (see Figure 2-9). Dry (water-free) air consists of approximately 78 percent nitrogen and 21 percent oxygen. Oxygen and nitrogen in the dry air would be separated in the “cold box” through compression and cryogenic (very cold) distillation. Oxygen generated in the air separation unit would then be directed to the boiler for the combustion process, and the nitrogen would be vented to the atmosphere. Cooling water for the air separation unit would be supplied by a new cooling towerthat would also servicethe compression and purification unit. Power Block and Balance of Plant The oxy-combustion facility associated with the FutureGen 2.0 Project is shown schematically in Figure 2-10. The combustion process employs the Babcock & Wilcox-Air Liquide cool recycle process, firing a mixture of high sulfur bituminous coal and low sulfur sub-bituminous coal. Because removing the nitrogen from the combustion process significantly reduces flue gas mass flow, the Babcock & Wilcox-Air Liquide cool recycle process recycles treated flue gas back to the boiler to make up for the reduced mass and more closely mimics the heat transfer properties of a conventional air-fired boiler. The entire system would be integrated into the Meredosia Energy Center to maximize heat optimization given the existing steam cycle and equipment. Heat from the air separation unit would be incorporated into the condensate cycle, while heat from the steam cycle would be used for flue gas reheating and other process heat loads. ASU = airseparation unit; O2 =oxygen Figure 2-9. Basic Air Separation Process ASU = air separation unit; CDS = circulating dry scrubber; CPU = compression and purification unit; DCCPS = direct contact cooler polishing system; Htr = heater; ID = induction draft; PJFF = pulse jet fabric filter Figure 2-10. Oxy-Combustion Cool Recycle Process Schematic In the cool recycle process, hot gas leaves the boiler and passes through a regenerative advanced quad-sector secondary and primary recycle heater (similar to a conventional air heater). This recycle heater would be internally arranged to prevent any leakageof the oxygen fed fromthe air separation unit into the flue gas exiting the boiler. Following the recycle heater, the flue gas would pass through a circulating dry scrubber1 where much of the sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide would be removed, and then into the pulse jet fabric filter, where particulate matter would be removed. From the pulse jet fabric filter, the flue gas pressure would be boosted by the induced draft fan and the flue gas flow would be split into three streams. A continuous recirculation stream of flue gas would be sent back to the inlet of the circulating dry scrubber to ensure a minimum allowable gas velocity through the absorber for all boiler loads. A second stream from this split would be boosted by the secondary recycle fan and then passed through a gas reheater to avoid downstream moisture condensation at low loads. Oxygen would be introduced into the secondary recycle flow before the secondary recycle fan before re-entering the recycle heater for heating prior to the boiler windbox. The secondary recycle fan would control the secondary flow to the boiler. The remaining flue gas stream exiting the pulse jet fabric filter would pass through the direct contact cooler polishing systemwhere moisture would bereduced. The saturated gas leaving the direct contact cooler polishing system would be reheated to avoid downstream moisture condensation and again split with one stream flowing to the compression and purification unit, and the other supplying the primary recycle fan. The primary recycle fan would provide the flow required to dry and convey the pulverized coal to the burners. Oxygen from the air separation unit would be introduced into the primary recycle flow after the recycle heater. The oxygen concentration in this stream would be controlled to mitigate risk of combustion in the pulverizers or coal pipes. Oxygen would also be injected directly into the burners to control combustion and the remaining oxygen mixed into the secondary recycle as previously described. The new exhaust stack (chimney) would be comprised of two separate exhaust vents, one for the oxy-combustion boiler during air firing operations and a second for the compression and purification unit. The first vent (air-firing) in the new exhaust stack would be designed to discharge monitored volumes of flue gas during unit startup when the boiler is air firing. The second vent (compression and purification unit) would be designed to discharge flue gas during the transition to oxygen-fired status, and to discharge flue gas during normal shutdown when the boiler is in oxycombustion mode. In addition, the second vent would discharge non-condensable gases during normal operation and non-condensable gases and CO2 during times when the produced CO2 does not meet quality standards or when the pipeline or injectionwells arenot available for storage operations. The steam cycle and balance of plant includes the steam turbines, condensers, and cooling towers. The major components of the existing Unit 4 steam cycle and portions of the balance of plant would be incorporated into the project. The steam cycle and balance of plant look much like those found in a conventional air-fired plant, where steam is used to drive the turbines to generate electricity. Main steam from the new boiler would flow through the existing steam-turbine generator. The existing condensate and feedwater systems would be integrated with the gas quality control system, air separation unit, and compression and purification unit islands to provide heating and cooling requirements for those islands. Condensate and feedwater would be deaerated, and cooling water would be used to condense the steam. The proposed system would have three separate cooling water loops and associated cooling towers: the main cooling tower, the cooling tower for the air separation unit and compression and purification unit, and the directcontact cooler polishing system cooling tower. Any coal-fired power plant takes some time to start, and the startup sequence for the air separation and compression and purification units increases that time. For cold starts, a new auxiliary boiler would operate to provide steam needed for startup until the main boiler can supply the steam. The auxiliary boiler would most likely be oil-fired. The auxiliary boiler would generate steam for the main boiler 1 Circulating dry scrubber – flue gas desulfurization technology that uses hydrated lime (dry calcium hydroxide) as the absorbent to remove sulfur dioxide, sulfur trioxide, hydrochloric acid, and hydrofluoric acid. condensate system, balance of plant, and air separation unit functions. Once the oxy-combustion boiler is started, enough steamwould be available within afewhoursto allow shutdown of the auxiliary boiler. The project would reuse the Unit 3 electrical service in the existing 138 kilovolt (kV) substation to supply electricity to the new Unit 4 transformer. Potential modifications may be required within the existing substation to make the connection for the oxy-combustion facility, but no expansion of the substation would be required for the FutureGen 2.0 Project. Therefore, any substation modifications and the new aboveground feed to the Unit 4 transformer would occur entirely within the existing developed areas of the energy center and are addressed as part of the overall construction activities for the FutureGen 2.0 Project. Compression and Purification Unit In the compression and purification unit, the flue gas (mostly CO2) from the boiler would be compressed, additional contaminants removed, and the compressed and liquefied CO2 pumped to the pipeline. The pipeline would transport liquefied CO2 to the underground CO2 storage area. As shown in Figure 2-11, remaining gases that are not easily condensed (i.e., “noncondensibles”) would be vented through the stack;this streamwould consist primarily of argon, CO2, nitrogen, and oxygen. At certaintimes,such as during startup of the compression and purification unit or as a result of unavailability of the pipeline or injection well operations, the CO2 stream exiting the compression and purification unit could bypass the CO2 pipeline and ventto the ambient air throughthe exhaust stack, along withthe noncondensible gases(see further discussion in Section 2.4.4.2). Ar = argon; CO2 = carbon dioxide; CPU = compression and purification unit; N = nitrogen; O2 = oxygen Figure 2-11. Basic Compression and Purification Process 2.4.2.2 Additional Equipment and Systems Access Roads The project would require new access roads and improvements to existing roads to the energy center site, as shown in Figure 2-12. The existing access road from the barge unloading area would be improved and widened. Roads within the energy center property currently not within a roadbed would be paved with asphalt. The remaining roads on the outer perimeter of the property would be gravel-based. The roads would bedesigned to handle maximum loads during construction and operation. Figure 2-12. Proposed Access Roads Cooling Tower Systems The FutureGen 2.0 Project would have three separate cooling water loops and associated cooling towers: the main cooling tower, the cooling tower for the air separation unit and compression and purification unit, and the direct contactcooler polishingsystem cooling tower. Cooling towers are devicesthat remove heat captured by the cooling water by transferring the heat from the water to the atmosphere through evaporation. The main circulating water system would provide a continuous supply of cooling water from the main steam condenser and the closed cooling water system. Water chemistry within the circulating water system would be maintained through chemical injection and system blowdown rates. Blowdown is water that is removed from the cooling water loop to prevent excessive concentration of minerals or other pollutants in the water. The main cooling tower would reject cycle heat from the main condenser and closed cooling water system to the atmosphere; main tower blowdown would bedirectly discharged to the Illinois River. The existing main cooling tower would be replaced with a new superstructure constructed on theexisting Unit 4 cooling tower basin. The cooling tower for the air separation unit and compression and purification unit would reject cycle heat from the air separation unit and compression and purification unit island closed cooling water systems to the atmosphere. Blowdown from thiscooling tower would be directly discharged to the Illinois River, and would be dechlorinated when necessary using sodium bisulfate when necessary to meet the NPDES permit limits for chlorine residual. This cooling tower would be built over a new concrete cold-water basin, with a pump pit and pumps. Water chemistrywithinthe circulatingwater systemwould be maintained through chemical injection and system blowdown rates. The direct contact cooler polishing system’s cooling tower would reject cycle heat to the atmosphere. Blowdown from this tower would be directed to the new onsite wastewater treatment system for the direct contact cooler polishing system. This cooling tower would be built over acommon concretecoldwater basin, with a pump pit and pumps. Water chemistry within the circulating water system would primarily be a function of the direct contact cooler polishing system and the circulating dry scrubber operating conditions, but could be controlled when necessary through additional chemical injection and blowdown. Groundwater Wells Groundwater would be used for steam cycle demineralizer influent, coal-handling dust suppression, fire protection (in addition to the public water supply), and potable water. Wells 3, 4, and 5 would be removed and one new well would be constructed. Figure 2-8 shows three possible locations forthe newwell. There would bethree wells operating during the project: existing Wells 6 and 7 and the newwell. Process Water Treatment System The Illinois River would be the primary source of makeup water for the proposed project. Depending upon the final use of the makeup water, water withdrawn from the river would be screened and passed through strainers to remove debris, and could be further treated through new process water treatment systems thatemployclarification,ultrafiltration,andreverse osmosis. In the clarification process, solids would be removed from the water through chemical treatment and physical settling of particles in a series of tanks. Clarification equipment would include a reaction tank, solids contact clarifier, and filter presses for sludge dewatering. Ferric chloride and polymer would be used for the purposes of coagulating and flocculating solids in order to facilitate settling in the clarifier. By-products of the clarification process would include sludge, which would be processed into filter cake (a chemically fixed sludge that is approximately 50 percent solids). It is expected that the filter cake sludge would be non-hazardous (i.e., pass the USEPA’s toxicity characteristics leaching procedure test) and disposed of in a commercial landfill. Ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis could be employed to treat certain water streams. These technologies are able to provide high quality finish water through the removal of solids and ions that can cause undesirable effects. Chemical reagents may also be used in these processes including sodium hydroxide, acid, caustic, antiscalant, sodium bisulfite, and detergents. By-products would include wastewater from backwashing filters, reverse osmosis rejection water (i.e., raw water that does not pass through the treatment unit), and rinses from periodic chemical cleaning of reverse osmosis units. It is anticipated that waste from chemical cleaning of these units would be collected and processed at offsite commercial facilities. Process Wastewater Treatment Systems The proposed project would include three separate wastewater treatment systems. The first wastewater treatment plant would treat condensate from the compression and purification unit, which would be neutralized using sodium hydroxide or another caustic agent for pH adjustment. A portion of the neutralized effluent would be used to condition fly ash, which would be disposed of offsite. The remaining effluent would be pumped to the wastewater system for the direct contact cooler polishingsystem effluentwhere itwould receive further treatment. The second wastewater treatment system would treat cooling tower blowdown from the direct contact cooler polishing system and effluent from the compression and purification unit wastewater treatment plant. This treatment system would use physical and chemical treatment to remove suspended solids and metals and would use biological treatment to remove mercury, selenium, and nitrates from the wastewater. Metal precipitationwould be accomplished using a two-stage process, using hydroxide precipitation and then sulfide precipitation. The precipitated solids would be removed from the wastewater in a clarification process followed by filtration. The solids contained in the clarifier blowdown would be thickened and dewatered for offsite disposal. The treated effluent would be discharged to the Illinois River at Outfall 002 (see Section 2.4.1.3) in compliance with an NPDES permit. The third treatment system would treat wastewater and stormwater runoff from the coal pile area including coal handling equipment wash-down water, coal handling dust suppression wastewater, and coal pile runoff. The coal handling and contact runoff treatment system would also treat stormwater potentially impacted by industrial activities in other areas of the energy center. The treatment system would consist of three components: a lined detention basin, a clarifier, and a neutralization tank. Themain purposeof the detention basin would be to store wastewater so thatit could be pumped at a metered rate to the clarifier. Chemical reagents including flocculants and polymers may be used inthe clarifier to increase settling,while hydrated limewould be used for pH adjustment in the neutralization tank. Solids from the clarifier would be combined with solids recovered from the wastewater treatment system for the direct contact cooler polishing system, dewatered, and disposed at a licensed commercial waste facility. Effluent from the coal handling andcontactrunoff treatment systemwould be dischargedto the Illinois River at Outfall 002. Stormwater Management Stormwater from the energy center would be directed to either the coal handling and contact runoff treatment system or an existing stormwater detention area, depending upon where the stormwater originates. Runoff would be conveyed to each of these facilities using surface drainage; however, it is likelythat some newly constructed stormwaterinlets and underground storm sewers would be required. Stormwater runoff exposed to coal storage (including coal pile runoff, coal handling dust suppression water, coal handling equipment wash-down water, and stormwater from the coal yard) and stormwater potentially exposed to industrial activities would be diverted to the coal handling and contact runoff treatment system. The treated effluent would be discharged from the wastewater treatment system to the Illinois River. The detention basin for the coal handling and contact runoff treatment system has not yet been designed, so the required size, depth, and retention time have not yet been determined for this feature. The Alliance designated the area where the detention basin is expected to be sited. The basin would be constructed on a portion of this site and would not encompass the entire area.The site where the detentionbasinwouldbe constructed and the location ofthe existing stormwaterdetention area are shown on Figure 2-13. Stormwater runoff not exposed to industrial pollutants would be directed to the existing stormwater detention area that would be managed by Ameren. This detention area would store noncontact, nonindustrial stormwater runoff (i.e., stormwater runoff not exposed to industrial pollutants). The collected water would naturally evaporate and infiltrate into the groundwater system. The location of the existing stormwater detention areais depicted onFigure 2-13. 2.4.3 Oxy-Combustion Large Scale Test Construction Phase Construction activities at the Meredosia Energy Center property would begin in 2014 and conclude in 2017 when the project would become operational. Proposed site preparation and construction activities would implement conventional construction methods, and would utilize best management practices (BMPs) to mitigate potential environmental impacts. Construction-related environmental concerns would be typical of thoseassociated with alarge industrial construction project and would primarily be related to air emissions, construction traffic, fugitive dust emissions from site disturbance, and stormwater runoff from construction areas. The Alliance would obtain all necessary permits and comply with all regulatory requirements during construction, which are intended to minimize potential concerns about health, safety, and environmental protection. Figure 2-14 shows temporary and permanent impact areas at the Meredosia Energy Center property, as well as the potential impact area for a barge unloading facility as presented in the Draft EIS. Temporary impact areas refer to those areas that would be restored to their original state with some potential modifications (e.g., planted trees instead of mature trees) at the end of the construction phase, which could be years after the areas are initially impacted. Permanent impact areas are those that would be changed permanently from their prior uses. Existing habitat in permanent impact areas would be lost, and replantingas practicable would beconsistent with the permanent uses designatedfor those areas. Up to 68 acres ofland would betemporarily disturbed duringproject construction (whichincludes the barge impact area) and up to 96 acres of land would be permanently altered, much of which has already been disturbed by prior activities at the energy center. As described in the Draft EIS, the original siting plans andlayouts would have required the clearingof approximately 33 acres of forestedland. Through ongoing refinements in siting plans by the Alliance, and in response to concerns of the U.S. Department of Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), about the loss of forested acreage (see Comment USDOI-02 in Appendix I, Public Comments on the Draft EIS [I2]), the Alliance took steps to reduce the amount of forested land that would be cleared for the project. Based on current plans, it is estimated that impacts could range from less than 1 acre to as many as 9 acres of forested lands depending on the availability of construction areas at the Meredosia Energy Center. Figure 2-15 illustrates the revisions to the temporary and permanent impact areas at the Meredosia Energy Center property that would result given the Alliance’s refined plans. If future design modifications would cause additional impacts to forested land beyond those presented in Figure 215, DOE and the Alliance would consult further with the USFWS. In any case, the acreage of impactedforest land would not exceedthat analyzed in the Draft EIS and presented in Figure 2-14. The designated barge impact area is the area that would potentially be disturbed during offloading of heavy and large equipment from barges during the construction phase. The existing boat ramp area just north of the property boundary would be used to facilitate the movement of large equipment that would be shipped to the project area. The use of this boat ramp area may require the construction of a temporary barge unloading facility on the Illinois River as discussed in Section 2.4.3.2. For the purposes of this EIS, it has been assumed that a temporary barge unloading facility would be constructed. An existing gravel Figure 2-15. Revised Temporary and Permanent Impact Areas at Energy Center, Reflecting Current Plans road that connects the boat ramp area to the main facilities at the energy center would be improved to handle the transport of heavy and large equipment or modules for the project. There may be two or more scheduled timeframes of barge unloading events, each resulting in short-term impacts lasting for approximately 1 to 3 months. Aftertheconstruction phase, thearea would be restored to its original state. Electricity needs during construction would be provided by the public electrical grid to be spot-supplemented by portable generators. Construction water needs would be met by the existing Meredosia Energy Center water supply. During the construction phase, the Alliance would provide potable water, portable toilets, and hand-wash stations for construction workers. 2.4.3.1 Oxy-Combustion Facility Construction Initial site preparation activities at the energy center site before construction would include demolition activities, such as the demolition of Boiler 6, groundwater wells, and some warehouses. Additionally, the superstructure of the main cooling tower would be replaced. Following the demolition activities, the Alliance would conduct site clearing, grading, and excavation, and prepare foundation work for erecting the new structures. New roads would be constructed to handle the transport of materials and waste (see Figure 2-12). The newstructuralfeatures atthe energycentersite are shown in Figure 2-8. The following list summarizes the majorconstruction components of the proposed project: Oxy-Combustion Facility • Relocate several existing warehouses, a deaerator, and one of the condensate storage tanks, to make room for new oxy-combustion facility components. • Demolish the existing Unit4 boiler(Boiler 6). • Construct a new oxy-combustion boiler (Boiler 7). The height of the new oxy-combustion boiler building, which would be built at the general location of the existing Boiler 6, would be approximately 180 feet. It would be 29 feet shorter than the height of the existing adjacent building. • Construct the air separation unit. The tallest structure in the air separation unit, the cold box, would beapproximately 120 feet tall. • Construct the compression and purification unit. • Construct a new approximately 450-foot tall concrete exhaust stack. The stack would have an outer reinforced concrete shell with a fiberglass reinforced plastic inner shell liner. The stack would have aviation lighting, including two levels of three medium intensity strobe lights. Coal Handling System • Construct an extension of existing unloading system to discharge coal to the drag chain conveyor, whichdischarges coal intothe boiler’s coal silos. Electrical and Control Systems • The project would require a number of existing overhead transmission and distribution lines to be re-routed to free up space for the new project equipment. New electrical equipment and connections would be installed to provide power to the various components of the new oxycombustion facility. • Demolish existing onsite transmission towers and construct new towers to re-route existing lines. The new towers would be comparablein size and height tothe existingtowers. Access Roads   Construct new access roads to the energy center property, and improve and widen the existing barge unloading roadway. Figure 2-12 shows these new roadways and indicates where they would tie into existing roadways. All roads would typically be 20 feet wide, except for the barge unloading road, which would be 40 feet wide. None of the areas for roadway construction would require major vegetation removal. Roads within the energy center property would be paved with asphalt, and roads on the outer perimeter would be gravel. Roads would be designed to handle maximum loads. Water and Wastewater Systems  Decommission three existing water supply wells (Wells 3, 4, and 5) and install a new replacement well for groundwater supply to the project. The potential locations of the new replacement well are shown in Figure 2-8.  Replace existing main cooling tower with a new tower at the same location. The new tower would be constructed on the existing cooling tower basin.   Construct two additional cooling towers, one for the direct contact cooler polishing system, and one for the air separation unit and compression and purification unit. Each tower would be built over a concrete cold-water basin, with a pump pit and pumps provided on one side. The direct contact cooler polishing system cooling tower would be approximately 30 feet high, while the cooling tower for the air separation unit and compression and purification unit would be approximately 32 feet.  Construct new process water and wastewater treatment systems. 2.4.3.2 Temporary Barge Unloading Facility The Alliance plans to use the area between the existing boat ramp area to the north of the energy center (see Figure 2-4 labeled ‘Public Boat Ramp Area,’ and Figures 2-14 and 2-15 labeled ‘Barge Impact Area’) to unload a number of large equipment modules for the oxy-combustion facility. These modules would be constructed offsite and sent by barge on the Illinois River. The boat ramp area is owned by the village of Meredosia and has two boat ramps. Only one of the boat ramps would be needed to offload the modules. There are two exits from the boat ramp area to the village, only one of which would be obstructed during barge unloading. Additional phases of project engineering and coordination with the village of Meredosia would be required to determine further accessibility arrangements, but the Alliance expects to ensure that at least one of the boat ramps remains open for public access during project construction. There is a possibility that the movement of equipment from the boat ramp to the energy center would take place the day after delivery, but the parking lot associated with the boat ramp area is large enough to enable temporary staging of equipment overnight without affecting public use of the boat ramp area. A former campground near the boat ramp area is no longer in use. There are no plans to stage or place construction material, debris, or waste at or near the boat ramp area from any FutureGen 2.0 Project construction activity. It is anticipated that impacts to the boat ramp area would be short term, lasting between 1 to 3 months during each of several construction unloading timeframes. It is expected that unloading activities related to construction of the oxy-combustion facility would begin in 2015 and conclude by 2017.  The Draft EIS evaluated two options for the barge unloading operations: (1) using mooring dolphins (freestanding structures above the water line used to secure vessels with ropes) to temporarily anchor the barge or (2) grounding the barge on the river bottom. Both of these options would involve some level of disturbance to the river bottom; however, no dredging activities are expected for either option. The first option would require the installation of three to five mooring dolphins in the river channel. The mooring dolphins would be placed at regular intervals such that the group would extend 100 feet out into the river. These dolphins might include individual timber pilings or metal pilings driven into the river bottom. It is expected that these pilings would be less than 48 inches in diameter, but the piling size, and therefore the pile driving hammer size, is unknown at thistime.  The second option would require that areas of the river bottom where the barge would be grounded be preparedbyremovinganylarge objects that maypuncture the barge. If necessary, rip-rap or other suitable material would be placed on the river bottom to provide a foundation for the barge and prevent damage and continuing streambed impacts. If the Alliance elects to implement one of these two options, they would beinstalledbythefirstquarter of 2014 and removed afterthelast moduleis unloaded. The Alliance is also evaluating options for unloading equipment that would avoid potential impacts by using a combination of on-shore equipment, tugs, and temporary ramps so that there would be no disturbance to the bank or bottom of the Illinois River. However, these plans are still under development and being reviewed for their feasibility. Under this scenario, a portion of the temporary ramp may extend into the river to form a usable platform between the edge of the barge and the existing boat ramp. This temporary ramp might extend 20 feetfrom the shoreline although it has not yet been defined. Because the Alliance has not thoroughly determined the feasibility of this alternative scenario or developed a preliminary design, the Final EIS considers the impacts presented in the Draft EIS as representing appropriate, upper bounds for the barge unloading operations during construction of the oxycombustionfacility. Although the actual dimensions of the barge have not been finalized, it is estimated that the barge would be 255 feet long and 72 feet wide with a 4-foot draft. Once the barge is moored, the module would be unloaded using a roll-off heavy hauler and a series of dollies. The dollies would move the modules to temporary cribbing and then to the boat ramp itself via a temporary ramp. The heavy hauler would then proceed south to the energy center via the barge unloading access road,an existing gravel road that would require some improvements. Barges would not be moored for an extended period. It is anticipated that each module would take up to 24 hours to unload, though this is only an approximation as the barge unloading activities have not yet been planned indetail. 2.4.3.3 Construction Schedule and Workforce The construction phase for the oxy-combustion facility at the Meredosia Energy Center, including initial demolition, is estimated to occur over a period of approximately 42 months beginning in 2014 and extending through 2017. However, construction would be substantially completed within 30 months, and the last 12 months of construction would overlap with a 1-year commissioning and startup effort. The number of construction and craft workers onsite would range from 100 to 200 for the first 7 months, 300 to 400 for the next 8 months, and 450 to 500 at peak for the next 8 months. Beginning with the 24th month, the onsite construction staff would reduce to approximately 300 for 8 months, then decline to between 50 and 200 for the final 11 months. The numbers of additional construction workers associated with the pipeline, CO2 injectionwells, and educational facilitiesare discussedin Section 2.5. 2.4.3.4 Construction Materials and Waste Raw Materials and Delivery Box trucks would carry various equipment and consumables, including welding supplies, crane rigging, control valves, small pumps and instruments, and control cable. In addition, many other miscellaneous items would be transported to the site via box truck. Approximately 40 box truck deliveries would be required and would originate from numerous locations. Flat-bed trailers hauled by semi-tractors would transport major equipment and supplies, including the chemical feed systems, supplies for site preparation, pre-cast sewer sections, transformers, motor control centers, switchgear, large pumps and supports, duct bank sections, pre-fabricated tanks, air compressors, grating and handrails, miscellaneous support steel, cooling tower structural components and fans, and all cast iron and high density propylene piping sections. Additional equipment and supplies may also be delivered by flat-bed trailer. Approximately 270 flat-bed tractor-trailer deliveries would be required and would originatefrom numerouslocations. The Alliance anticipates that pre-mixed concrete would be delivered from a local source via concrete trucks; however, the use of an onsite batch plant would also be evaluated. The batch plant would be temporary and would be located in one of the laydown yards close to the energy center. In this case, concrete would be delivered via concrete mixer truck from the batch plant. Approximately 360 truckloads would berequired to deliver concreteto the site. Dump trucks would be required for the site preparation effort during the early construction phase. Fill material would be procured locally whenever possible. Approximately 600 dump truckloads may be required to import gravel, road base, and otherfill material to the site. Equipment for the boiler and gas quality control system would be delivered from a variety of sources. Babcock & Wilcox estimates that equipment delivery would require approximately 12 barges, 350 full truckloads, and 200 to 400 shipments ofless than afull truckload. Equipment for the air separation unit and compression and purification unit would be fabricated and preassembled offsite to reduce trucking requirements. Air Liquide estimates that modules would be transported by two river barges to Meredosia. Seven transporters would be required to move the modules from the barge unloading area to the construction site. Approximately 30 additional truck deliveries would be requiredto bringassociatedmaterials tothe Meredosia site. A summary of power consumption ranges for the construction and startup of the project is provided below. These estimates were developed based on previous projects or historical information provided by the project proponents: • Balance of plant: 2,555 to7,665 megawatt hours (MWh) • Boiler:5,291 to15,873 MWh • Gas qualitycontrolsystem: 3,108 to 9,323 MWh • Air separation unit: 5,705 to 17,115 MWh • Compression and purification unit:4,314 to 12,942 MWh • Total: 20,973 to 62,918 MWh Material Wastes and Wastewater Construction of the proposed project would generate typical construction wastes. The predominant waste streams would include industrial equipment and associated components from the demolition of Boiler 6; clearing vegetation, soils, and debris; used lube oils; surplus materials; and empty containers. Solid wastes (i.e., garbage and rubbish) would be collected for disposal in a licensed offsite solid waste facility (i.e., a public landfill). Scrap and surplus materials and used lube oils would be recycled or reused to the maximum practicable extent. Temporary sanitary facilities (i.e., portable toilets and hand-wash stations) would be placed in appropriate locations at the construction sites for use by construction workers. These self-contained portable units would be serviced regularly and the wastes would be collected and hauled to permitted sewage treatmentfacilitiesbylicensed wastetransporters. Stormwater in areas that currently drain to the bottom ash pond or fly ash pond at the Meredosia Energy Center would continue to be directed to these treatment basins, assuming that the NPDES operating permit authorizes such discharges. In areas where stormwater cannot be routed to the bottom ash pond or fly ash pond, the Alliance would obtain a general NPDES permit (ILR10) from the IEPA to authorize discharges of stormwater during construction. BMPs would be utilized to reduce sediment discharged via stormwater runoff. These BMPs would be described in a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) required by the general NPDES permit. These BMPs may include measures such as silt fencing, inlet drain protection, ditch checks, designated concrete washout areas, vegetated buffer strips, and other measures. The Alliance would ultimately be responsible for the proper handling and disposal of construction wastes. However, construction contractors and their employees would be responsible for minimizing the amount of waste produced by construction activities. These contractors would be expected to fully cooperate with project procedures and regulatory requirements for waste minimization and the proper handling, storage, and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Each construction contractor would be required to include waste management in their overall project health, safety, and environmental site plans. Typical construction waste management activities mayincludethefollowing: • Dedicated areas and a system for waste management and segregation of incompatible waste at time of generation; • A waste control plan detailing waste collection and removal from the site, as wellas identification of where waste of different categories would be collected in separate stockpiles, bins, or other containers; • Hazardous waste storage (separately from non-hazardous waste and other, non-compatible hazardous waste) in accordance with applicable regulations, project-specific requirements, and good waste management practices; • Periodic inspections to verify that wastes are properly stored and covered to prevent accidental spillsand to prevent wastefrom being dispersed by wind; • Appropriately labeled waste disposal containers; and • Good housekeeping procedures to ensure that work areas would be left in a clean and orderly condition at the end of each working day, with surplus materials and wastes transferred to the waste management area. 2.4.3.5 Construction Safety Policies and Programs Emergency services during construction would be coordinated with the local fire departments, police departments, paramedics, and hospitals. A first aid office would be provided onsite for minor incidents. Trained and certified health, safety, and environmental personnel would be onsite to respond to and coordinate emergencies. All temporary facilities would have fire extinguishers; fire protection would be provided in work areas where welding work would be performed. In addition, existing Ameren plans and policies applicable to the Meredosia Energy Center regarding environmental safety and health would be updated as necessarybytheAlliance toaccommodate the proposed project. 2.4.4 Oxy-Combustion Large Scale Test Operation Phase A variety of factors could affect the possible long-term operation of the oxy-combustion facility, including potential future GHG legislation and regulations, process performance, and economics. For purposes of this EIS, DOE assumed theproject would continueto operate for 20 years. 2.4.4.1 Resource Requirements and Inputs Operational Labor All operations at theMeredosia EnergyCenter were suspended in 2011. During its final year of operation, the energy center employed approximately 57 personnel. The proposed project would employ 87 to 115 people and operate 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, with employees working in shifts. Staff would include 25 operational personnel, 4 to 8 gas quality control system personnel, 4 to 16 air separation unit personnel, 4 to 16 compression and purification unit personnel, 7 coal handling personnel, 24 maintenance personnel, 11 administration and support personnel, and 8 laborers and store clerks. All new staff would be based at theMeredosia EnergyCenter. Process Inputs During operation of the project, process-related chemicals would be transported to the Meredosia Energy Center mainly by truck. The new boiler would be able to accommodate a coal blend of 60 percent Illinois coal and 40 percent Powder River Basin coal. Illinois coal would be transported to the energy center by truck and Powder River Basin coal would be transported by barge. The oxy-combustion facility would require the input of two reagents: trona and lime. Table 2-4 presents the estimated usage and delivery requirements for the process inputs to the oxy-combustion facility. These values have been updated to reflect the most current design, which involves slightly increased quantities of process-related materials. See additional discussion of a potential offsite coal blending and delivery option in the followingsubsection (Coal) as added to the Final EIS. Table 2-4. Estimated Process Material Requirements for the Oxy-Combustion Facility Sub-bituminous Coalb (Powder River Basin) 816 297,840 <1c 180 (40 percent) Trona 8.9 3,241 <1c 130 a. Estimated values inthis table have been updated to reflect project design changes since publication of the Draft EIS. b. All materials delivered by 40-ton truck (25-ton load) except sub-bituminous Powder River Basin coal, which would be delivered by barge (1,650-ton load). c. Trips would not be made daily. The major process chemicals that may be used for the new process water and wastewater treatment systems include ferric chloride, polymer, salt solution, sodium hydroxide, acid, caustic, antiscalant, sodium bisulfate, detergent, and sodium hydroxide. Process water would primarily be supplied by the Illinois River. The amounts of materials stored at the facility would be determined by the rates of consumption, customary delivery volumes available from suppliers, and the reliability of supply. In addition to regulatory requirements, the Alliance would follow the chemical suppliers’ recommendations and procedures in storing and handling all chemicals. Coal During operation of the project, Boiler 7 would burn a blend of 60 percent Illinois No. 6 bituminous coal and 40 percent Powder River Basin sub-bituminous coal. Coal mine sources that may provide bituminous coal for the proposed project include the Viper Mine, Crown 3 Mine, and Shay Minein Illinois, which are all located approximately 75 to 85 miles from Meredosia. Yard machines (dozers, scrapers) would form the bituminous coal into a pile and would also be used to transfer coal from this pile to the existing reclaim hopper, which would feed into existing Conveyor A (see Figure 2-5). Conveyor A would direct the reclaimed coaltothe breaker building for processing and sizing. Powder River Basin coal originates from the Powder River Basin in Wyoming and would be transported by rail to St. Louis, Missouri. The coal would be transported from St. Louis to the energy center via barge. The existing barge unloading system would be used for maintaining the Powder River Basin coal pile inventory for Unit 4. The coal would be unloaded from the barge via a clamshell bucket into the barge unloading hopper. After the coal is unloaded from the barge, it would be transported via Conveyor E to the coalbreaker buildingfor further processing. As a result of the ongoing refinements in the design for the FutureGen 2.0 Project, the Alliance is considering the option of having the Illinois No. 6 bituminous and the Powder River Basin sub-bituminous coal types blended (60 percent and 40 percent, respectively) by an existing commercial coal handling facility in St. Louis. This alternate approach could replace the plan for onsite blending of coal, as described in the Draft EIS. In the event that this approach is taken, the blended coal would be delivered by barge from St. Louis, like the Powder River Basin coal deliveries. In comparison to the estimated deliveries for coal summarized in Table 2-4, the delivery of blended coal by barge could result in an increase of approximately 451 annual deliveries; one or two barge deliveries per day. This approach would correspondingly reduce the number of daily truck deliveries for Illinois No. 6 bituminous coal to a potential minimum of no coal truck deliveries to the energy center. The Alliance has not yet identified a specific commercial coal handling facility to support this delivery option. Trona Trona is a naturally-occurring hydrated sodium carbonate mineral (sodium sesquicarbonate) that is used in the gas quality control system (injected upstream of the baghouse) to reduce sulfur trioxide concentrations in the flue gas. It is also used in the direct contact cooler polishing system to reduce sulfur dioxide. The proposed system would consume trona at rates shown in Table 2-4. Dry trona would be delivered to the site by trucks that would be equipped with blowers for offloading. The trona would be stored in a shop-fabricated, skirted-design storage silo that would be 14 feet nominal diameter by 77 feet overall height. Hydrated Lime Dry calcium hydroxide, also known as hydrated lime, would be used as the absorbent in the circulating dry scrubber for removal of acid gases (sulfur dioxide, sulfur trioxide, hydrogen fluoride, hydrochloric acid, etc.). The proposed system would consume hydrated limeat therates shownin Table 2-4.  Material Deliveries Table 2-4 summarizes the delivery requirements for all major process materials. With the exception of Powder River Basin coal, all materials would be delivered by 40-ton trucks with capacity to transport 25 tons of material. Each barge delivery would transport 1,650 tons of Powder River Basin coal. Truck deliveries would generally take the “south bypass road,” which is signed as the Meredosia Energy Center entrance on IL-104. Water Consumption Water sources for the project’s makeup water would include well water, public water supply, and the Illinois River. There would be three wells used during operations (existing Wells 6 and 7 and a new well). Well water would be used for steam cycle demineralizer influent, coal handling dust suppression, fire protection (in addition to the public water supply), and potable water. The public water supply would be used for fire protection makeup water and Unit 4 floor wash; the existing fire protection water storage tank capacity is 325,000 gallons and is not expected to increase for this project. The use of the public watersupplyas potable water maybe evaluatedinthe future. The Illinois River would be the primary source of makeup process water and would require additional treatment at the newprocess water treatment systemasdiscussed inSection 2.4.2.2, depending on itsfinal use. River water would provide forthe following uses: • Screen andstrainerbackwash; • Makeup waterforthe Unit4 main cooling tower; • Makeup waterforthedirect contact cooler polishingsystemcooling tower; • Makeupwaterfortheair separation unit and compression and purification unit cooling tower; • Gas qualitycontrolsystemmakeup water; • Process waterfor the air separationunit and the compression and purification unit; • Equipment cooling; and • Equipment washdown. Table 2-5 summarizes the water sources and uses for operation of the oxy-combustion facility. These values have been updated from the Draft EIS to reflect the most current design, which involves slight increases inwateruse fromthe Illinois River andthe public water supply. Table 2-5.

This includes auxiliary power for the boiler, gas quality control system, air separation unit, compression and purification unit, and balance of plant (new equipment, existing reused equipment, and auxiliarytransformer losses). 2.4.4.2 Process Wastes, Discharges, and By-Products Material Wastes and By-Products The operation of the project would generate various wastes. These would include fly ash, bottom ash, circulating dry scrubber wastes, process water and wastewater treatment solids, and waste petroleum-based lubricants. Fly ash and bottom ash would be the predominant wastes generated by the project. Waste generation rates for fly ash and bottom ash are provided in Table 2-6. These values have been updated to reflect the most current design, which involves slightly increased quantities of certain wastes. Water and wastewater treatment solids would be generated at a rate of approximately 0.28 tons per day (see Section 2.4.2.2 for identification of waste solids generated by the proposed process water treatment system and wastewater treatment system), and waste lubricants would be generated at a rate of approximately 1,000 gallons perday(gpd). These waste types would be transportedoffsite for disposal. Table 2-6.

Note that refinements in the oxy-combustion design since publication of the Draft EIS incorporate reuse of the fly ash in the system processes, therebyresulting in a reduction infly ashwaste from 538 (in the Draft EIS) to 480 tons per day, and an associated reduction in daily truck trips from 22 to 19. However, this Final EIS maintains the original fly ash productionquantity asan upper bound for impactanalysis. c. Estimated valuesfor bottomash have been updated to reflect project design changes since publication of the DraftEIS. Bottom Ash Bottom ash would be generated at rates shown in Table 2-6. The bottom ash removal system would consist of a transition chute, submerged chain conveyor with water recirculation pumps, sludge pumps, and heat exchangers. Bottom ash would be removed from the combustor and would be stored in the ash bunker until being transferred to trucks that would transport it to an offsite landfill (see below, Ash Disposal). Fly Ash The ashhandlingsystemtransfers the flyash collectedbythe pulse jet fabric filter(baghouse, located east of Boiler 7) to the waste ash storage silo for disposal. The fly ash would be generated at rates shown in Table 2-6. Flyash would be stored in the waste ash storage silo complete with bin vent and filter collector before transfer to trucks for transport to an offsite landfill (see below, Ash Disposal). The waste ash silo, which would beequippedwith abaghouse, hascapacity for 72 hours ofoperation atthe design condition. Ash Disposal Ash waste that could not be beneficially re-used would be trucked offsite and disposed of at an existing commercial facilitypermitted to receive coal combustion residuals. In June 2010, the USEPA proposed to regulate for the first time the coal combustion residuals, or coal ash, generated by electric utilities. Coal combustion residuals are currently considered exempt wastes under an amendment to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). Two possible options for the management of coal combustion residuals are being proposed under the new rule. Under the first option, USEPA would list these residuals as special wastes subject to regulation under subtitle C of RCRA, when destined for disposal in landfills or surface impoundments. Under the second option, the USEPA would regulate coal ash under subtitle D of RCRA, the section for non-hazardous wastes.2 As discussed in Section 2.4.1.5, the existing ash ponds at the energy center would not be part of the asset transfer for the FutureGen 2.0 Project. Environmental liability associated with the existing ash ponds and compliance with current or future regulations remain with Ameren until such time as the property and environmental liability may be transferred to a third party. General Solid Waste Routine maintenance of process components (e.g., pumps, valves, etc.) for the oxy-combustion facility is not expected to generate significant amounts of waste. The material removed and waste generated as part of this required maintenance is not expected to be hazardous. Any waste generated would be properly managed and disposed of ata suitable waste disposalfacility. In the event of a process malfunction, more significant maintenance may be required. These events could produce a waste product not considered in the maintenance scenarios above; such wastes may or may not be hazardous. These events would be rare, treated on a case-by-case basis, and not expected during normal operation. The wastes generated as a result of these activities would be handled according to applicable laws and regulations, plant operations and maintenance standards, risk management plans, material safety data sheets (MSDS) recommendations, and other industry or agency standards for proper handling and disposal. These types of emergency events would be addressed in a hazards and operability study prior to operations, such that potential problems and risks are identified, employee awareness is raised, mitigations ofrisks are implemented, andemergencyprocedures are effective. 2 The comment period for the proposed coal combustion residuals rule closed on November 14, 2011. The rule is still pending, and as such, the resulting regulations issued by USEPA could impact the Alliance’s decision on optionsfor itsashdisposal (75 FR 35128). Wastewater Generation Wastewater generated by the project would include sanitary wastewater, process wastewater, noncontact cooling water, backwash from the intake screen, and oily effluent from floor and equipment drains. Table 2-7 summarizes wastewater generation and disposal during operation of the oxy-combustion facility as described in Section 2.4.2.2.  The Meredosia Energy Center is currently covered under existingNPDES Permit IL0000116. This permit was renewed by Ameren in November 2011 and is currently valid until October 31, 2016. This existing permit would be modified as needed for the FutureGen 2.0 Project; however, no new outfalls would be proposed. Expected effluent pollutants and discharge standards are discussed in Section 3.6, Surface Water. As a result of changes that have occurred in the project design since the Draft EIS was published, a modified NPDES permit application was prepared and submitted by the Alliance to the IEPA on June 20, 2013. The modified permit application contained revised estimates regarding water withdrawal volumes from the Illinois River, water discharge volumes to the Illinois River, and constituent loads within discharges from several outfalls at the energy center. Table 2-7 has been updated toreflectthese refinements. All of the river water would continue to pass through the existing intake screens, which are backwashed using a portion of the inlet water. Backwash water would be discharged directly back to the Illinois River through Outfall 006 (see Figure 2-4). The backwash water source is the Illinois River. Under the NPDES permit, the outfall would continue to be monitored for residual chlorine when chlorine is utilized for biofouling control. Table 2-7.

Some Unit 4 discharges, such as the main cooling tower blowdown and the air separation unit and compression and purification unit cooling tower blowdown, would be directed without further treatment to the Illinois River. These discharges would consist primarily of river water that has been concentrated due to evaporation in the cooling towers, with some small amounts of various circulating water feed chemicals (e.g. antiscalant, biocide, sulfuric acid, etc.) present. The makeup water portion from the air separation unit and compression and purification unit cooling tower would also have been softened, thereby exchanging sodium forcalcium and magnesium ions. The other Unit 4 wastewater discharges would be treated at one of the new wastewater treatment systems prior to release to the river. The collection method, main equipment components, chemical reagents, and by-products for the wastewater treatment systems are described in Section 2.4.2.2; minor quantities of solid wastes would be collected and disposed of offsite. Although water quality data of the new effluent are not known at this time, it is conservatively estimated that the effluent levels would be at the current operating permit limits; however, it is expected that effluent concentrations for most regulated constituents would be significantly lower than permit limits. The discharge permit limits and impacts to water quality are discussed in Section 3.6, Surface Water. The wastewater streams that have the potential to be contaminated with oil would be routed to oil-water separators for processing. Such streams primarily include floor and equipment drains. Up to three new oil-water separators would be installed. The oil-water separators would likely be coalescing plate-type units installed above grade level. Clean water effluent from the separators would be pumped to Outfall 002 (see Figure 2-4) and discharged intothe Illinois River. Separated oil would be contained in the oil-water separators and would be periodically pumped out for offsite disposal. CO2 Stream The project would be designed to recover greater than 90 percent ofthe CO2 during steady-state operation that would otherwise be emitted from the combustion process. The compression and purification unit is expected to have a CO2 capture rate totaling 1.2 million tons per year (1.1 million metric tons per year). Although the exact composition of the CO2 stream that would be received from the proposed oxycombustion facility is not known at this time, the pipeline design requires that at a minimum it must meet the specifications discussed in Section 2.5.1.4. The gas would be vented through the stack in the event that the quality requirements could not be met. “Noncondensible” gases that consist primarily of argon, nitrogen, and oxygen would also be vented through the stack. The captured CO2 stream to be transported for geologic sequestration would include CO2, inert gases (argon and nitrogen), water vapor, and trace amounts of oxygen, sulfur, and mercury. Dense phase CO2 would be delivered from the oxy-combustion facility to a pipeline interface point located near the eastern boundary of the Meredosia Energy Center. An isolation valve would be installed downstream of the compression and purification unit to initiate or shutoff flow to the pipeline, as required. CO2 flow, pressure, temperature, and quality would be monitored at the compression and purification unit discharge, upstream of the pipeline isolation valve. Monitoring at the pipeline interface point, along with automated control of the isolation valve, would be developed during final design. Remote monitoring capability would also be implemented to allow the Alliance to directly monitor CO2 conditions atthe compression and purification unit discharge. During operation, if CO2 conditions do not meet the required specifications, the pipeline isolation valve would automatically close and flow to the pipeline would be stopped. During compression and purification unit startup, shutdown, or other operating condition, when the pipeline isolation valve is shut and no CO2 delivery to the pipeline is occurring, CO2 must be discharged elsewhere until pipeline deliveries can resume. While the startup stack and normal compression and purification unit vent would accommodate many such conditions, additional backup discharge points may be required to facilitate practical compression and purification unit operation during upsets. Details regarding such backup discharge points would be finalized when design details become available and could include onsite CO2 storage or additional CO2 venting capability downstream of the compression and purification unit. Venting of CO2 would only occur within theconstraints oftheair permit. Air Emissions During normal operations, the flue gas, upon exiting the boiler, would enter the gas quality control system, which comprises numerous steps designed to remove pollutants, recover heat, and prepare the flue gas before entering the compression and purification unit. The gas quality control system would incorporate state-of-the-art processes to reduce criteria pollutants to low levels. Table 2-8 presents estimated pollutant emissions during normal operating conditions based on expected annual operating conditions for the 168 MWe design and hourly emissions rates from the July 2013 air permit application. These emissions differ from those presented in the Draft EIS due to updates that have occurred to the design for the project, from the original 200 MWe design to the current 168 MWe design. Expected annual operating conditions assume that the compression and purification unit (processing flue gas from the oxy-combustion boiler) would operate for 7,446 hours per year; the oxy-combustion boiler would operate in air-fire mode without the compression and purification unit for 240 hours per year; and 240 hours in oxy-combustion transition. These estimates include emissions from the oxy-combustion boiler, the compression and purification unit, the auxiliary boiler, and the various material-handling units that support these operations. Emissions would be higher during startup, in the case of a compression and purification unit or pipeline shutdown, and during shutdown. However, these conditions are expected to be rare. Designers anticipate minimal hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) emissions during normal operations. See Section 3.1, Air Quality, and Section 3.2, Climate andGreenhouse Gases, for further discussion on air emissionsfrom the proposed project. Table 2-8.

CO = carbon monoxide; CO2 = carbon dioxide; CO2-eq = carbon dioxide equivalent; CPU = compression and purification unit; Hg = mercury; MWe = megawatt electrical; NOx = nitrogen oxides; PM2.5 = particulate matter of diameter 2.5 microns or less; PM = particulate matter; SO2 = sulfurdioxide; VOCs =volatile organic compounds 2.4.4.3 Health and Safety Policies and Programs Ameren’s existing Environmental Policy directs all persons and entities operating and maintaining company facilities on its behalf, including the Meredosia Energy Center, to act in a manner protective of human health, the environment, and property while complying with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. The Alliance intends to develop and implement a similar policy that would apply to the facilitiesandpersonnel associatedwiththe project. The storage and handling of toxic or flammable materials would be conducted in compliance with USEPA and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations and the National Fire Protection Association’s “Guide on Hazardous Materials” (NFPA 2010). The Alliance would develop and maintain a Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasures (SPCC) plan for the project in compliance with federal and state regulations. The worker safety programs developed and implemented by the Alliance and its partners would ensure that workers are aware and knowledgeable about spill containment procedures and related health and environmental protection policies. 2.4.4.4 Permit Requirements Chapter 5, Regulatory and Permit Requirements, includes Table 5-1 that summarizes the permits and activities that could be required for construction and operation of the proposed oxy-combustion facility, such as an Air Pollution Control Construction Permit, NPDES Construction Permit, and required modifications totheexistingNPDESOperatingPermit. 2.4.4.5 Power Purchase Agreement Information in this section has been updated since the Draft EIS was published. The Illinois Power Agency, in fulfillment of its duties under the Illinois Power Agency Act, facilitates procurement of electricity for the state's two regulated utilities (i.e., Commonwealth Edison and Ameren Illinois) and in some cases the Alternative Retail Electric Suppliers. Each year, as required by statute, the Illinois Power Agency submits an annual power procurement plan to the Illinois Commerce Commission for approval. In addition to ensuring the adequate procurement of electricity for Illinois’ ratepayers, the Illinois Power Agency is responsible for administering the state’s Renewable Portfolio Standard and Clean Coal Portfolio Standard. Under the “retrofit provision” of the Clean Coal Portfolio Standard, owners of coal-fired power plants that were previously owned by Illinois utilities that have been or will be converted to clean coal facilities are entitled to submit proposed power purchase agreements to the Illinois Power Agency and request that they be included in annual procurement plans. In accordance with the retrofit provision, during the spring of 2012, the Alliance submitted to the Illinois Power Agency a draft power purchase agreement for the electricity to be produced by the FutureGen 2.0 Project. Following its review, the Illinois Power Agency included the power purchase agreement in its annual electricity procurement plan for 2013. After a docketed regulatory proceeding, the Illinois Commerce Commission entered an order approving the procurement plan and power purchase agreement in December 2012. After a second-phase docketed regulatory proceeding designed to resolve implementation issues associated with the power purchase agreement, the Illinois Commerce Commission approved a revised, final version of the power purchase agreement for the FutureGen 2.0 Project in June 2013 and directed Commonwealth Edison and Ameren Illinois to sign the agreement within 60 days. The Illinois Commerce Commission also found that the costs associated with the power purchase agreement fall below statutory benchmarks. Moreover, the estimated rate impact on applicable Illinois electric customers would be less than the 2.015 percent statutory limit designed to protect the Illinois taxpayer and imposed by the Clean Coal Portfolio Standard. The FutureGen 2.0 Project would have no rate impact on electricity customers receivingpower fromrural electric cooperatives. 2.4.5 Decommissioning The planned life of the oxy-combustion facility at the Meredosia Energy Center is expected to be 20 years. However, if the energy center remains economically viable, it could be operated for additional years into the future. A closure plan would be developed prior to the time that the energy center would be permanently closed. The removal of the energy center fromservice, or decommissioning, may range from “mothballing” to the removal of all equipment and facilities, depending on conditions at the time. The closureplan would be provided to state and localauthorities asrequired. 2.5 FUTUREGEN 2.0PIPELINEAND CO2STORAGE RESERVOIR The Alliance would transport the captured CO2 from the Meredosia Energy Center in an underground pipeline to a permanent geologic storage reservoir in Morgan County (see Figure 2-16). At this site (i.e., the CO2 storage study area), the CO2 would be injected approximately 4,000 feet below the earth’s surface into the Mt. Simon Formation. The Mt. Simon Formation, a deep saline formation, would be used as the permanent storage reservoir for the CO2. This technology, including the capture of CO2 from the oxy-combustion facility, is known as CO2 capture and storage. Once the CO2 would be injected, it would be extensively and continuously monitored to ensure it is being safely and permanently stored. In addition, visitor, research, and training facilities (also referred to as the ‘educational facilities’) are planned for the Jacksonville area. The following sections describe the siting, design, construction, and operation of these activities(Alliance 2013a). CO2 = carbon dioxide; Fm. = Formation; ft = feet; Ss. = sandstone; USDW = underground source of drinking water Figure 2-16. Project Concept 2.5.1 CO2 Pipeline The Alliance plans to site, design, construct, and operate a CO2 pipeline from the Meredosia Energy Center to the CO2 storage study area. The CO2 would be received fromthe capture facilities at the energy center and transported through a new pipeline for injection and permanent storage in the Mt. Simon Formation. The CO2 pipeline from the Meredosia Energy Center to the CO2 injection well site would be approximately 30 mileslong. The CO2 streamfromthe Meredosia Energy Center would be at least 97 percent pure CO2.The remaining gas would include inert compounds, water vapor, and other trace constituents that meet regulatory standards. CO2 can exist in a gaseous, liquid, or solid state. At its critical point, which occurs at 1,070 pounds per square inch pressure (psig) and 87.8 degrees Fahrenheit (oF) temperature, CO2 gas goes into a liquid-like dense phase. CO2 transport in a dense phase is the method of choice adopted by all major CO2 pipeline companies. In this dense phase, the CO2 is non-corrosive and is safe to transport in the pipeline. The transport of CO2 gas in dense phase is regulated by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) regulation entitled “Transportation of Hazardous Liquids in Pipelines” (49 CFR 195). The regulation provides all pertinent design requirements including safe distance from other structures, depth of cover, separation from other lateral assets, construction material selection, design calculation factors, pressure testing, and pipeline safety, among many other requirements that ensure long-term safe operation of the pipeline. The Alliance’s design for the CO2 pipeline would meet or exceed all of the requirements in 49 CFR 195. CO2 gas is heavier than air. When released it stays close to the ground, and if released in sufficient volumes can fill up low lying areas causing a potential safety hazard. The pipeline design provides safeguards to mitigate such risk. These safeguards include mainline block valves to isolate pipeline sections, a leak detection system to alert the operator, and a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) telecommunication system to communicate information and data about pipeline performance. In addition, pipeline monitoring and surveillance procedures would be implemented in the field on a daily basis. 2.5.1.1 Pipeline Corridor and Routes Information in this subsection has been updated since FutureGen 2.0 Pipeline Siting publication of the Draft EIS to reflect the Alliance’s preference for the southern CO2 pipeline route as the proposed route to Pipeline Corridor -The 4-mile wide corridor the CO2 storage study area, and to incorporate updates to its initially identified by the Alliance as the area within which a CO2 pipeline would be sited. proposed alignment.

These are referred to as the southern route and northern route, as shown in Figure 2-18. Appendix C, Map Views of Pipeline, contains detailed aerial maps of thepotential routes. In the early stages of the FutureGen 2.0 Project, the Alliance identified the northern route for initial cost-estimating purposes. Based on subsequent investigations and field work, the Alliance identified the southern route as the preferable and proposed pipeline route, based on constructability, access to existing ROWs, and the desire to avoid, to the extent possible, sensitive environmental resources such as wetlands, cultural resources, forest land, and threatened or endangered species and their habitats. The southern route was developed in coordination with the Illinois State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO), the Illinois Department of Natural Resources (IDNR), and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The southern route is the subject of the Alliance’s application for a Certificate of Authority from the Illinois Commerce Commission to construct and operate the pipeline, filed in March 2013 (Illinois Commerce Commission 2013). The Alliance is working with affected landowners along the southern route regarding specific alignment and compensation for the required pipeline ROWs. Although the northern pipeline route is included in this Final EIS for comparison purposes, the Alliance is no longer consideringthe northern route for the FutureGen 2.0 Project. CO2 = carbon dioxide Figure 2-18. Southern and Northern CO2 Pipeline Route Options to CO2 Storage Study Area Preliminary route selections, as shown in Figure 2-18 were based on the following siting criteria, which represent good engineering practices generally accepted in the industry. In the event that the final pipeline route deviates from the route options specified in this EIS, the Alliance would similarly use these siting criteria: • Maintain a minimum safe distance from residential, commercial, and industrial buildings and structures in accordance with governing codes. Federal regulations (49 CFR 195) require a minimum distance of 50 feet from occupied dwellings; to the extent practicable, the Alliance committedtomaintaininga minimumdistanceof 150 feetto provide an additional buffer.3 • Co-locate with existingfeatures where acceptable. • Utilize existingtimberlandclearings where practical. • Cross roads, railroads, and waterbodies at a near right angle but no more than 10 degrees from right angle where possible for permitting approval. Exceptions would be reviewed on a case-bycasebasis. • Performconstructabilityreviews.Avoidor minimize side hill slopes as much as possible. Identify water source and disposal sites for pipeline pressure testing due to the large quantity of water required for pressure testing. • ReviewROW accessibilityand logisticsforconstruction materials and equipment. • Reviewenvironmental features and permittingrequirements. At the time of the initial DOE pipeline impact analysis for the Draft EIS, the Alliance had not yet identified potential routes for the last few miles of the pipeline within the CO2 storage study area (i.e., the end-of-pipeline spurs) because the location of injection wells had not yet been determined. Since then, the Alliance selected a location for the injection wells and a proposed route for the end-of-pipeline spur for the southern pipeline route. Since the Alliance selected the southern route as the proposed option, it has not identified routing for the end-of-pipeline spur for the northern pipeline route, which is no longer underconsideration. See Chapter3, and specifically Section 3.0, for information on how DOE assessed potential impacts related to the injection wells and pipeline routes, and Section 4.4, Incomplete and Unavailable Information, for additional discussion relating to incomplete and unavailable information. 2.5.1.2 Pipeline Design Information in this section has been updated since publication of the Draft EIS, particularly with respect to the minimum distance between mainline block valves along the CO2 pipeline. The CO2 pipeline would be constructed of carbon steel that conforms to the American Petroleum Institute Specification 5L, Specification for Line Pipe. It would consist of high-frequency electric resistance welded pipe that is coated with a three-layer fusion-bonded epoxy to an average thickness of 16 thousandths of an inch. An abrasion-resistant coating of a minimum of 40 thousandths of an inch would be used for bored road and rail crossings and for horizontal directional drills. The pipe would be subject to charpy v-notch impact testing (a standardized high strain rate test that determines the amount of energy absorbed by a material during fracture) and drop weight tear testing during the manufacturing process. The objective is to use a material that displays high strength atlow temperatures. All field welds would be radiographed. A nominal 12-inch diameter pipeline was originally selected based on hydraulic models, 3 Note: It is possible that a shorter distance would be deemed necessary in order to avoid a sensitive environmental resource or at the request of an affected landowner, but the distance would not be less than the 50 feet required by federal regulations. such that it would eliminate the need for an intermediate pump station and reduce associated capital and operating costs. The Alliance is also exploring the potential of using a nominal 10-inch diameter pipeline. A final determination for the size of the pipeline has not been made; therefore, the Final EIS evaluates impacts relatedto bothpipe sizes. Although the pipeline itself would be buried, aboveground features would include meter stations and launcher/receivers (start and end of the pipeline). Other visual features of the pipeline system would includethefollowing: • Pipeline markers atall crossings; • Mainline blockvalve shelters; • Cathodic protectionstationmarkers; and • Temporaryzinc anode site markers. The American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Standard B31.4 provides industry standards for the location and number of mainline block valves; however, the standard only provides specific distances for mainline block valves on piping systems that are used to transport liquefied petroleum gases or liquid anhydrous ammonia. For those types of pipelines, the standard requires that mainline block valves be installed at 7.5-mile maximum spacing in industrial, commercial, and residential areas (Section 434.15.2(e)). In addition, in accordance with ASME B31.4, as well as 49 CFR 195, mainline block valves must be placed on either side of major river crossings, at other waterbody crossings more than 100 feet wide and optionally at major road crossings. These criteria were originally referenced in the Alliance’s development of a conceptual design for the CO2 pipeline, which considered mainline block valve spacing of between 7.5 and 10 miles. As a result,the impact analysisin the Draft EIS evaluated both spacingintervals. The 7.5-mile maximum spacing standard is not directly applicable to the transportation of liquefied CO2. Moreover, there are no industrial, commercial, or residential areas along the proposed CO2 pipeline corridor, which is located in a rural area. Similarly, there are no major river crossings or other waterbody crossings more than 100 feet wide for the proposed CO2 pipeline route. As a result, the Alliance’s current conceptual design assumes that there would be one mainline block valve at the beginning of the pipeline, one at the end of the pipeline, and two in between (i.e., 10 miles apart). While the exact number and location of the mainline block valves would be determined after additional hydraulic analysis, the Alliance committed to a maximum distance of 10 miles between mainline block valves; therefore, the impact analysis in the Final EIS addresses the 10-mile maximum spacing. Mainline block valves would be equipped for remote operation. Based on electric power availability, valves would be operated by electric motor or gas-over-oil hydraulic actuators. The valves would also have a removable wheel to allow manual operation and would be specified with special trim suitable for CO2 dense phase service. Bypass arrangements would be provided at each valve such that vent piping could be installed in the unlikely event that a segment of pipeline needed to be slowly vented under controlled conditions to conduct pipeline repairs. The mainline block valves would be located on high ground, as practicable, to prevent hazard from valve leaks. Pressure safety (relief) valves would also be installed at the pipeline inlet (at the energy center) and between the block valves that could be used to vent CO2 in the event of an unanticipated upset condition. The valves could be routed to a central vent system at the injection site and would be routed to the blowdown system at the energycenter. The pipeline would be designed to assure passage of intelligent internal inspection devices (pigging operations) and have launch and receive facilities for the in-lineinspection tools locatedat the beginning (at the energy center) and end (at the CO2 injection site) of the pipeline, respectively. Crack arrestors would be provided on the pipeline at appropriate spacing. The pipeline would be cathodically protected by means ofimpressedcurrent system with deep anode ground beds. 2.5.1.3 Pipeline Construction All construction work would be executed in accordance with Agricultural Impact Mitigation Agreement the conditions and stipulations of applicable federal, state, and local permits, authorizations, and clearances. All The Alliance signed an Agricultural Impact necessary approvals would be obtained before the activity in Mitigation Agreement with the Illinois Department of Agriculture that sets forth question is undertaken. In addition, the Alliance signed an the activities the Alliance would undertake Agricultural Impact Mitigation Agreement with the Illinois to mitigate any adverse impacts to Department of Agriculture (IDOA) that sets forth the farmland associated with the construction activities the Alliance would undertake to mitigate any of the CO2 pipeline (see Appendix H, adverse impacts to farmland associated with the construction Agricultural Mitigation). of the CO2 pipeline (see Appendix H, Agricultural Mitigation). The Illinois Farm Bureau also participated in the development of the agreement by reviewing and providingcomments that were incorporatedinto the agreement. Construction techniques for the pipeline may include excavated trenching, boring, tunneling, and horizontal directional drilling. DOE would use one of three primary methods to construct crossings of sensitive resources, roads, and railroads. Table 2-9 shows the approximate number of major features that would be crossed by each pipeline route. The method used to construct pipeline crossings is primarily dependent upon the size of the feature being crossed. For stream crossings, the method used is also dependent upon the presence or absence of water within the feature (e.g., seasonally dry ephemeral and intermittent streamchannels). Table 2-9. Pipeline Crossings Description Southern Route Northern Route Railroads 3 3 Totalc 115d 124 a. The number of waterbody crossings is based solely on GIS data from the National Hydrologic Dataset. This provides a conservative estimation of the number of features crossedby each pipelineroute. b. The Alliance conducted a survey of waterbodies and wetlands along the southern pipeline route in spring 2013, which confirmed the presence of 2 perennial streams and 13 intermittent streams (significantly fewer than the number identified via GIS mapping), as well as many ephemeral streams, ditches, and swales. The Alliance also identified 14 wetland areas (total of approximately 0.5 acre) along the southern route. The Alliance plans to trench through 0.03 acre of wetland, as authorized by the USACE, and use pipe-boring techniques to avoid disturbance of all other wetlands along the route. See Section 3.7, Wetlands and Floodplains for further information. c. The number of crossings for the northern route is based on the initial northern route alignment from the Meredosia Energy Center to the western border of the storage studyarea, and the hypothetical end-of-pipeline routes (spurs)as presented in the DraftEIS. d. The Alliance intends to use pipe-boring techniques in 37 locations along the southern route (some borings cross multiple surface features). The three methods that would be used include horizontal directional drilling, jack and bore tunneling, and dry trenching. Horizontal directional drilling would be used to cross major waterbodies (i.e., crossings of perennial streams and ponds or lakes greater than 100 feet in width) and large roads (e.g., highways). Additional horizontal directional drilling may be required due to environmental, land, or constructability requirements. As necessary, geotechnical investigations would be performed prior to the construction of pipeline crossings using horizontal directional drilling to ensure that subsurface conditions can safely support drilling operations. Primary factors in selecting the pipeline crossing profile would include the type of soil and rock to be drilled and the depth of cover material. The minimum depth of cover for waterbodies requiring horizontal directional drilling would be 4 feet as required under 49 CFR 195.248(a). Contingency plans would be developed, as required, for completing waterbody crossings in the event ofan unsuccessful horizontal directional drilling. Jack and bore tunneling (also known as pipe ramming) would be used for crossings of railways, roadways, and perennial streams and wetlands, as well as intermittent and ephemeral streams that contained water at the time of construction. The jack and bore tunneling method involves the use of a horizontal bore machine or auger to drill a hole, and a hydraulic jack to push a casing through the hole under the crossing. As the bore proceeds, a steel casing pipe would be jacked into the hole; then the pipeline installed in the casing. The casing would be jacked using a large hydraulic jack in a pit located at one end ofthecrossing. Thejack pit would be excavated and shored. Dry trenching would only be employed for crossing narrow intermittent and ephemeral stream channels that were devoid of water at the time of construction, such as when a streamfeature is seasonally dry or is frozen to the bottom. A field assessment would be made prior to construction at each crossing to determine the presence of water, and weather forecasts would be monitored to evaluate the potential for precipitation events that could lead to temporary water flow within the stream channel. Dry trenching would consist of excavating a trench through the stream channel, laying the pipe down, then burying the pipe with the spoils removed during trench excavation. The pipeline crossing would be as nearly perpendicular to the stream channel as possible to minimize overall linear disturbance to the stream channel. After pipeline installation, the surface would be regraded to match pre-construction contours. The CO2 pipeline would be buried at least 4 feet underground, which is more than the minimum depth required by 49 CFR 195. Additional depth of cover would be provided for crossings, drainage ditches, and irrigation tiles. For agricultural land, the pipeline would be buried at least 5 feet deep in accordance with IDOA pipeline construction standards and policies and the Alliance’s Agricultural Impact Mitigation Agreement (see AppendixH, Agricultural Mitigation). Topsoil would be removed first and stored separatelyalongthe pipeline trench segregated fromother subsoil. Crossings of other types of pipelines and other underground utilities would require a minimum of 12 inches of separation. However, the minimum separation may be increased to 24 inches where considered prudent based on professional judgment. Existing pipelines would be under-crossed unless over-crossing is specifically permitted by the pipeline owner. All road and railroad crossings would be bored under the road or railroad (i.e., without casings) using heavy wall pipe with abrasion resistant coating. The construction ROW for the pipeline includes the area required to enable movement of construction equipment, staging of materials, and laydown of equipment during the construction period. Figure 2-19 shows recommended pipeline construction ROW cross sections. The construction ROW would be 80 feet wide, although a 100-foot construction ROW may be needed for special requirements such as pipe transportation in wooded hilly terrain or where side slope construction maybe unavoidable. Additionally, the wider construction ROW sections wouldbe necessary to support the maneuvering of equipment at locations where horizontal directional drilling or jack and bore tunneling would be performed (see Appendix C, Map Views of Pipeline). Access to the construction ROW would be provided (as much as possible) from existing roads crossing the pipeline route. The operational ROW is the area that would permanently be maintained throughout the life of the project, which would be 50 feet in width and centered over the pipeline. Figure 2-19. Recommended Construction Right-of-Way Cross Section Tree clearing for ROW preparation would generate cut trunks, limbs, and brush (the amount would depend on width of ROW and extent of wooded areas). As part of the Agricultural Impact Mitigation Agreement with the IDOA (see Appendix H, Agricultural Mitigation), the following mitigation measures related to land clearing would beimplemented during construction: • If trees are to be removed from the ROW, the Alliance would consult with the landowner to determine if thereare trees of commercial or other value tothe landowner. • If there are trees of commercial or other value to the landowner, the Alliance would allow the landowner the right to retain ownership of the trees with the disposition of the trees to be negotiated priorto the commencement of land clearing. • Unless otherwise restricted by federal, state, or local regulations, the Alliance would follow the landowner's desires regarding the removal and disposal of trees, brush, and stumps of no value to thelandowner by burial, etc., or completeremoval fromanyaffectedproperty. All construction-related debris and material that are not an integral part of the pipeline would be removed from the landowner's property. Such material to be removed would include litter generated by the construction crews. The estimated number of daily truckloads during construction for material and equipment deliveries, for waste removals, and for workers would bethefollowing: • MaterialandEquipment Deliveries - 40 to 50 tripsper day • Waste Disposal - 2 to 3 trips perday • Worker Traffic - 100 to 150 tripsperday The construction of the CO2 pipeline would require hydrostatic testing to certify the integrity of the pipeline before it can be put into operation. Hydrostatic testing would be performed in accordance with DOT pipeline safety regulations. Hydrostatic testing would be conducted continuously for a minimum of 8 hours, and include a leak test. Fabricated assemblies would be pre-tested for a minimum of 4 hours. These would be included in the overall pipeline hydrostatic test. If water is used, the pipeline would be filled with water and pressurized to check for any pressure loss that may indicate a leak. Approximately 31,000 gallons of water would be needed for each mile of the nominal 12-inch diameter pipe; water may be reused for multiple pipeline sections. Specific water sources for hydrostatic testing have not yet been selected, but the Alliance assumes that adequate sources are available regionally. Hydrostatic testing water would be discharged to local waterways in accordance with an NPDES permit obtained from the IEPA. The NPDES permit from IEPA would be applied for and received prior to the start of construction activities. The tested line would be dried using dry air to a dew point of -50oF, which would prevent any residual water in thepipelinefrominitiating localized corrosion inthe pipe. An environmental compliance plan would be developed prior to construction, identifying on a mile-bymile and feature-by-feature basis how all applicable permits and their requirements would be implemented. Environmental inspectors would be deployed on a spread-by-spread basis to ensure adherence to all permit conditions by identifying and rectifying any non-compliance or potential noncompliance concerns as soon as they materialize. The Alliance estimates that construction of a pipeline from the Meredosia Energy Center to the CO2 injection site would take approximately 4 to 5 months with 1 to 2 months of peak activity. The Alliance estimates that 150 to 300 workers would be needed for the duration of pipeline construction, working 10 hours per day, 6 days per week. Pipeline contractors would hire from local county labor pools for services and maximize the use of local providers of materials as practicable. 2.5.1.4 Pipeline Operations The CO2 pipeline would transport dense phase CO2 from the Meredosia Energy Center to the injection wells for permanent geologic storage in the Mt. Simon Sandstone. Although the exact composition of CO2 that would be received from the energy center is not completely defined at this time, the Alliance is designing the pipeline to meet the CO2 specifications that are standard in the commercial CO2 pipeline transport industry. The Alliance’s minimum CO2 pipeline acceptance specifications provided in Table 2-10. The Alliance would oversee the operation of the oxy-combustion and CO2 capture processes to ensure that these specifications would be met on a consistent basis other than during startup and shutdown conditions for maintenance. As previously mentioned in Section 2.4.4.2, if CO2 conditions do not meet the required specifications, the Alliance would determine whether the process upset can be accommodated or whether flow to the pipeline should be stopped. The gas would be vented through the stack in the event that the quality requirements could not be met. Venting of CO2 would only occur within the constraints of the air permit. The design flow rate would be 1.2 million tons (1.1 million metric tons) of CO2 per year (66.9 million standard cubic feet per day, assuming 85 percent energy center capacity). The CO2 would be processed for removal ofcontaminants and compressed at the Meredosia Energy Center before entering the pipeline. The pipelinedesign includesthe following assumptions: • The Meredosia Energy Center would supply 1.2 million tons (1.1 million metric tons) per year of CO2 (equivalentto 66.9 million standard cubic feet per day flow rate) for transport. • The CO2 would be compressed to 2,100 psig before entering the pipeline, although delivery pressure could be reduced to accommodate the final subsurface design. System controls would ensure that the pipeline pressure would not drop below the critical point pressure (1,070psig)at any pointalong the route to prevent multiphase flow in the pipeline. Table 2-10.

There would be one metering station at the energy center and one at each injection well. Meter station data would be transmitted to the site control and maintenance building through the SCADA network. Consistent with standard industry practice, the metering stations would be automated (not staffed). Two Coriolis flow meters would be provided in parallel at each metering station, one working and the other on stand-by. Meter testing would be conducted on a monthly basis to verify the accuracy and performance of each liquid meter. Meter stations would be designed for open air service with an overhead shelter for protection againstdirect exposure tothe elements. • The system would be designed in accordance with American National Standards Institute 900 for valves, flanges, and fittings. • A pipeline leak detection system conforming to American Petroleum Institute standards (API 1130) would beinstalled. • Entry temperature at the Meredosia Energy Center is assumed to be 90°F, and would be no higherthan 110°F. • Gas analysis would be conducted at the pipeline inlet using a moisture meter and gas chromatograph. Online analysis would beprovided for quality monitoring purposes. • A 6-hour uninterruptible power supply would be provided for critical instrumentation. Backup power generation would also beprovided in case of long duration outages. • A programmable logic controller, remote terminal units, analyzers, gas chromatograph, and other sensitive instrumentation would be housed in appropriately insulated climate-controlled structures, fencedandaccessible byall-weatherroads. • The booster pump building would be totally enclosed with overhead crane and appropriate detectors. • Redundancy would be providedforelectrical installations (suchas transformers, etc.). Pipeline operations would be monitored on a continuous basis. The control and monitoring of pipeline operations would occur from a central control roomlocated in the site control and maintenance building. The central control room would send command and control signals remotely using the SCADA network to all valves, metering stations, and the launcher/receivers in the system. It is assumed that all metering stations would beunmanned. If the CO2 analyses conducted at the energy center or receiving meter station indicate that the specifications shown in Table 2-10 have been or are about to be exceeded, the Alliance would cease pipeline operations until the CO2 stream can be brought back into specification. The system would include subsystems for CO2 gas detection, hazardous gas detection, fire detection, flame detection, and smoke detection. In the event ofdetectingemergencyconditions, the systemwould: • Initiateventilationsystemin thelocal control building, whereapplicable; • Shutdown running units; • Operate yardand unit valves as required bythe level ofthe emergency; • Activateaudible andvisual alarms in the pump and control buildings; and • Activatealarms in central control room usingthe SCADA system. A surveillance and security system would be provided for remote monitoring of the pipeline and the surface facilities fromthe central control room. The systemwould includethe following: • Proximityalarms installedat the mainvehicleentrancegate aswell asindividual buildingdoors; • Securitysurveillance cameras;and • Microwave intrusion link sensors. Pigging operations may be required to clean, inspect, or repair a pipeline from the inside of the pipe. Routine pigging of the pipeline is not planned because the CO2 stream would be clean and dry. However,if a piggingoperationwere to be needed(such as if there were a corrosionor damage concern), a small amount of CO2 may need to be vented under planned and carefully controlled conditions. At the energy center site, the pig launcher would be purged with CO2 to remove air from the launcher. Venting would be stopped when CO2 began to be released. The purged gas would be routed to the blowdown system at the energy center. Once the pig was received at the injection well site, it would be isolated in a receiving barrel that required venting before the door could be opened to remove the pig. This would require slowly venting the CO2 from the barrel. Although volume would be dependent on the final design of the system, the net volume of the CO2 venting at the energy center and injection well site combined would be equivalent to approximately 20 cubic feet of dense phase CO2. A pipeline puncture or rupture resulting in a leak is unlikely based on historic CO2 pipeline data from the DOT’s Office of Pipeline Safety. To minimizethis risk, the FutureGen 2.0 CO2 pipeline design includes a leak detection sensitivity system. If a leak is detected, the mainline block valves would shut automatically, isolating the damaged pipeline segment and preventing the flow of CO2 from the energy center and backflow from the injection wells. The maximum amount of CO2 that could escape before the leak could be stopped would be limited to the amount of CO2 contained within the pipeline between the valves. Based on the conceptual design, the maximum distance between mainline block valves would be 10 miles; a 10-mile pipeline segment would contain 18 million standard cubic feet of CO2. Depending on the leakscenario,the volume releasedcould be significantlylower. Pipeline operations would be managed from the site control and maintenance building (see Section 2.5.2.2). Operation of the pipeline would be performed in full compliance with applicable DOT rules and regulations and would require regular visual and in-line inspections to ensure safety and integrity. Pipeline patrolling would be by road, by foot, and potentially by helicopter, contracted to specialist companies. These visual surveys would be conducted every two weeks and would look for signs of leaks (e.g., discolored vegetation, disturbed soil) and potential infrastructure concerns (e.g., exposed pipe at stream crossings). Post-construction monitoring would be conducted (potentially for several years) to ensure that restoration of wetlands and agricultural lands would be undertaken in accordance with all permit and AgriculturalImpactMitigation Agreementrequirements. 2.5.2 CO2 Storage Study Area This section has been updated from the Draft EIS based on the Alliance’s proposed expansion of the land area included in the CO2 storage study area, as well as the identification of a proposed site for the injection well facilities within the storage study area. As noted previously, the Alliance identified a location in Morgan County as the proposed CO2 storage study area. The storage study area would encompass all of the surface facilities requiredfor the injectionandmonitoring of the CO2 as well as the underground CO2 plume. Since the Draft EIS was completed, the Alliance has been working with local landowners to acquire additional subsurface pore space rights to maximize flexibilityfor CO2 injection and to ensure that the CO2 plume would not affect subsurface rights of non-participating landowners. (Non-participating landowners are those who have declined the Alliance’s offer to purchase options for subsurface rights needed for CO2 storage.) As a result of these efforts, the size of the CO2 storage study area has been expanded to 6,800 acres. The additional 1,500 acres is located south and west of the original study area. While the location of the CO2 plume has shifted south slightly as a result of availability of additional pore space and the Alliance's plan to construct and operate four horizontal injection wells of varying lengths, the plume size itself remains as estimated inthe Draft EIS; approximately 4,000 acres. The Alliance evaluated several injection well configurations using both vertical and horizontal injection wells at one or two sites. After consideration of site-specific data from the stratigraphic well, the Alliance is currently proposing to construct and operate four horizontal injection wells at one injection well site for the annual injection of 1.2 milliontons(1.1 million metrictons) of CO2 over a 20-year period. The conceptual design of the CO2 injection wells is based on the results of data gathered from a stratigraphic well that was drilled at the CO2 storage study area, other characterization activities, and the results of modeling. The siting, design, construction, and operation of the injection wells and associated infrastructure are addressed below, along with the results of the CO2 plume modeling. Although the Alliance plans to move forward with a single injection well site consisting of four horizontal wells (the single-site scenario) and is no longer considering the option of two sites with vertical injection wells (the dual-site scenario), the impact analysis in the Final EIS considers both scenarios (as analyzed in the Draft EIS)forcomparative impact purposes. Since the completionof the Draft EIS,the Alliance progressed with the design of the injection wells and selected an injection well site; however, the Alliance cannot construct or operate the injection wells until Underground Injection Control (UIC) permits are issued by the USEPA. As a result, the Final EIS has been updated to incorporate the current design data, which has been compared with the bounding data already presented in the Draft EIS. 2.5.2.1 CO2 Storage Area Siting In its Request for Site Proposal issued on October 25, 2010 (amended November 10, 2010), the Alliance stated that offered sites must be able to meet several geologic storage criteria in order to be considered as a host for the CO2 injection wells (Alliance 2010). These qualifying criteria included the following: • The site must be located above the Mt. Simon Formation in Illinois with no foreseeable risk of subsurface migration of CO2 outsidethestateof Illinois. • Depth to the Mt. Simon Formation must be at least 3,500 feet belowthesurface. • There must be at least one primary seal (caprock) greater than 200 feet in thickness, and the primary seal must not be intersected by any known or seismically resolvable faults above the expected plume diameter from up to 43 million tons (39 millionmetrictons) of injected CO2.4 • The site must have the capacity to store up to 43 million tons (39 million metric tons) of CO2 injected over 30years. • There must be no natural gas storage facilities in the Mt. Simon Formation (or other injection formation) within 20 milesof the proposed site. The Alliance’s Request for Site Proposal also required that sites offered for the geologic storage location meet the followingcriteria: • Size – The surface area of the site must not be less than 25 contiguous acres based on the need to support one injection well and associated infrastructure, along with the area needed for the visitors,research, and trainingfacilities. • Control – The proposed surface site must be available for use bythe Alliance. • Seismic Stability – The proposedsurface site must have low riskfromsignificantseismic events. • Floodplains – The entire proposed surface site must be above the 500-year floodplain to ensure lowpotential forflooddamagetotheinjection well infrastructure. • Existing Site Hazards – The proposed surface site, whether a greenfield or brownfield site, must be free of hazardous or radioactive chemicals and materials and free of wastes requiring special handling, treatment, or disposal. • Zoning – The proposed surface site must be consistent with current zoning requirements or be capable of being rezonedtomeet suchrequirements in a timeframe consistent with the FutureGen 2.0 schedule. • Environmental Conditions – At least 25 contiguous acres of the proposed surface site must be free ofthefollowing: o Wetlands; o Structures that are listed on, or eligible for listing on, the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), and be free of known cultural or archeological resources, including Traditional Cultural Properties; and o Known federally-protected species and critical habitat for protected species (excluding migratory birds). • Proximity to Public Access Areas – The proposed surface site must be located outside of and not adjacent to the boundaries of any such area, unless the state or federal owner provides unequivocal permission forsuch use. • Proximity to Tribal Lands – A proposed surface site located on or adjacent to tribal lands must be supportedbythe affectedNative American tribe(s). • Access – The Alliance must have sufficient physical access to the land above the plume to implement a rigorous monitoring program. At least 60 percent of the land area above the 4 At the time of the Request for Proposal, the project design specified 43 million tons (39 million metric tons) of CO2; however, the current project design proposes injection of 24 million tons (22 million metric tons) over a 20year lifetime. anticipated CO2 plume must be physically accessible for installation and operation of surface and subsurface monitoring equipment. Access restrictions include, but are not limited to, lakes, rivers, or other bodies of water, public access areas, and infrastructure including roads, buildings, or other developed property. • Public Access Areas – The land area above the anticipated CO2 plume must not be on a public access area,unless thefederalor state owner providesunequivocal permission for such use. • Major Bodies of Water – The land area above the anticipated CO2 plume must not intersect major surface bodies of water. • Sensitive Features – The land area above the anticipated CO2 plume must not intersect any sensitive feature. In addition, the Request for Site Proposal described other characteristics that would improve the ability to meet or lower the cost of meeting the objectives of the FutureGen 2.0 Project and explained that sites that had these characteristics would receive higher scores in the site evaluation. These scoring criteria included characteristics relating to orientation, permeability, and capacity of the injection formation; hydrogeological conditions that would decrease the lateral CO2 plume size; ability to meet injectivity targets with the fewest injection wells; penetrations of the primary seals; availability of secondary seals; and subsurface access formonitoringwells. Using these qualifying and scoring criteria, and taking into account other criteria, such as availability of data, stakeholder support, and the results of additional seismic testing, the CO2 storage study area in Morgan County was selected as the preferred location for the CO2 injection wells and the visitor, research, and training facilities. The Alliance initiallyidentified sites in Christian and Douglas counties as alternative locations, though the confirmation of geologic suitability at the Morgan County CO2 storage study area based on stratigraphic well data made it impractical and cost-ineffective to continue to study the Christian County and Douglas County locations (see Section 2.3.5). The Alliance’s Request for Site Proposal and Siting Guidance to Prospective Offerors is provided on their website, which includes siting and scoring criteria(http://www.futuregenalliance.org/). In addition to meeting the qualifying criteria, the proposed CO2 storage study area in Morgan County was primarilyselected based on: geologic suitability, surface and subsurface access, pipeline distance fromthe CO2 source, and stakeholder support. Geologic suitability was determined after performing surface seismic surveys and examining the geology of the site based on existing data. Access was determined by identifying what land was available for the injection wells and where subsurface rights to inject CO2 could be obtained. Stakeholder support was evaluated through a series of stakeholder meetings sponsored and held by the site proponents and the Alliance. The Alliance is currently entering into agreements with property owners regarding the use of and appropriate compensation for surface land and subsurface pore space. Since publication of the Draft EIS, the Alliance identifieda proposed property for the injection well site based on the results of data obtained from the stratigraphic well, other characterization activities, and the results of modeling of reservoir and seal performance. Drilling of the stratigraphic well took place fromOctober 2011 to December 2011 at the site to characterize the geological profile and conditions, and to confirm the design parameters. Discussion of the stratigraphic well is provided in Section 2.5.2.5. The injection well facilities would be constructed within a site to be acquired by the Alliance consisting of approximately 9.5 acres as shown in Figure 2-20. The Alliance would lease an additional 5.5 acres of adjoining property to the north for staging and laydown during the Figure 2-20. Location of Injection Well Site Property for Single-Site Scenario construction phase. The construction would be undertaken in a manner that would avoid areas of jurisdictional wetlands along the western edge of the properties, and the Alliance intends to leave as manytrees intact onthe properties as practicable. 2.5.2.2 Surface Facilities The CO2 surface facilities are expected to be visited by scientists, engineers, tourists,and dignitaries from across the country and the world. The CO2 injection well site(s) would consist of surface facilities; the injection and monitoring wells;and monitoring, verification, and accounting (MVA) facilities. This section has been updated from the Draft EIS to present new design details of the currently proposed single-site scenario and to compare the planned single-site scenario to the dual-site scenario that was presented in the Draft EIS. As already stated, the Alliance is no longer considering the dual-site scenario. The primary difference between the two configurations is that only one building would be required under the single-site scenario, while the dual-site scenario would require as many as four buildings distributed between the two sites. In addition, the Alliance would be able to reduce the length of access roads for the single-site scenario by locating facilities withinclose proximity to existing roads. Similar to the dual-site configuration, the site control and maintenance building in the planned single-site configurationwould be one-story tall tominimizevisual impactsand, alongwith all other surface components, be designed to blend in with the rural surroundings. Green building design concepts would be incorporated into the site and building designs. The Alliance intends to seek Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification for the surface facilities, which DOE intends to support to the extent that the costs would be fair, reasonable, and within the scope of the Alliance-DOE Cooperative Agreement. The materials required for construction of the surface facilities are anticipated to be typical of building construction (i.e., concrete, rebar, steel, wood, dry wall, insulation, glass, and roofing material). Materials would be delivered by construction trucks, suchas concrete trucks,semi-trucks for steel and building materials,andtandemtrucks forasphalt. All structures would be built to withstand inclement weather conditions to assure worker and operational security. The entrance gate would be controlled though the use of a pass key system for employees and a site operator controller for guests. Cameras would identifyand record gate entries. Yard lighting would be provided by 158-watt light emitting diode (LED) fixtures equipped with motion sensors. Lighting would be mounted on 25-foot poles that would be hinged to permit the fixtures to be lowered for maintenance. Luminaries would be selected to minimize offsite glare and illumination. The yard lighting and building exterior lights would be turned on and off by photocell-controlled contactors. Safeguards would minimize theriskof CO2 accumulation fromsmall fugitive leaks (for example,at valve seals) and detect any levels of constituents that pose a risk to human health, safety, and welfare. For instance, all enclosed buildings at the CO2 injection well site(s) would be equipped with high CO2 concentration monitors, oxygen detectors, and fire detection and suppression systems, which can be automatically actuated by local programmable logic controllers or manually activated from a local or central location. In the following tables, the features of the planned single-site scenario are compared to the respective features of the dual-site scenario as it was described in the Draft EIS. Table 2-11 compares the construction and operational footprints for both scenarios. Table 2-12 compares the estimated labor needs anticipated for the design and construction of the surface facilities for both scenarios. The anticipated management and operational personnel requirements to support the injection well facilities are summarized in Table 2-13 for both the dual-site and single site scenarios for comparison purposes. These tables are referred to in the comparisons that follow for the respective injectionwellsite scenarios. Table 2-11.

These estimates are maintained throughout the analysisof the Final EIS. Table 2-12.

This building, known as the site control and maintenance building, would house the well annulus maintenance and monitoring system equipment. Other features of the surface facilities would include meters, surface piping, and piping-related equipment. Tables 2-11 and 2-12, above, summarize the site requirements and construction labor, respectively,for the single-site scenarioin comparison to the dual-site scenario. Table 2-13.

The single-site scenario would require aPipeline Engineer/Backup Safety Officer and a FieldEngineer. c. The operations staff for the dual-site scenario would require the following: Safety and Public Awareness Specialist, On Call Center Operators, On Call Pipeliner, Injection Pump Station Technician. Staff would be onsite 5 days per weekexcept the On Call Center Operatorswould be required 7 days per week. The conceptual layout for the injection well site, as shown in Figure 2-21, includes a gravel well pad, the site control and maintenance building and a parking lot connected to Beilschmidt Road by two access roads. As summarized in Table 2-11, the single-site scenario would have a permanent overall land area requirement of less than 14 acres. Construction of the injection wells, monitoring wells, associated surface facilities, and access roads for the single-site scenario would collectively disturb approximately 42 acres. The current design includes an entrance road and an exit road to accommodate construction activities safely. The roads would be designed to occasionally carry a heavy service truck of up to 80,000 pounds. After construction is complete, the entrance and exit roads would be upgraded to an asphalt surface. Site access to the injection wells would be restricted by a 6-foot high, security fence around the permanent well pad, enclosing 0.72 acre. In addition, there would be an architectural fence (similar to fences found in agricultural and rural areas) surrounding the site control and maintenance building, parking lot, and access roads, enclosing approximately 2 acres. Approximately five monitoring well sites would also be fenced, enclosing between 0.15 and 0.23 acre. The monitoring wells wouldbe covered. The site control and maintenance building would house the major operational components of the pipeline and injection well site. The current design assumes that the facility would be located in such a way as to allow for visitor observation of the injection wells. A maintenance area would be included to house the equipment neededfor routine maintenance of equipment, repair parts, and at  Figure 2-21. Single-Site Scenario - Injection Well Site Surface Features Conceptual Layout least one site and pipeline monitoring vehicle. The facility would also include a conference room, restrooms (handicapped accessible), and office areas for visiting scientists and Alliance or operations personnel. The total building footprint is expected to be approximately 5,000 square feet. Dual-Site Scenario Information about the dual-site scenario, as analyzed in the Draft EIS, is included in the following discussion for purposes of comparison with the single-site scenario; however, the dual-site scenario is nolonger underconsideration bythe Alliance. The dual-site scenario would require as many as four buildings, including three buildings at the primary injection well site and one at the secondary injection well site. Figures 2-22 and 2-23 present the original conceptual site plans for the injection well surface facilities. The layout shown in Figure 222 represents the primary injection well site, and Figure 2-23 represents the layout for a secondary injection well site. Tables 2-11 and 2-12 summarize the site requirements and construction labor, respectively,for the original dual-site scenario in comparisontothe plannedsingle-site scenario. As summarized in Table 2-11, the dual-site scenario would have a permanent overall land area requirement for surface facilities of less than 25 acres. Construction of the injection wells, monitoring wells, associated surface facilities, and access roads for the single-site scenario would collectively disturb approximately 91 acres. Aside from these structures, the area affected during construction of the surface facilities would involve the construction of a stormwater retention and infiltrationbasin,a packaged wastewater treatment system, screeningberms, and fencing. The entrance road would be a 24-foot wide asphalt surface that would allow two cars to pass safely. The road would support an occasional heavy service truck of up to 80,000 pounds. The parking lot would be asphalt and sized for 15 employees with the potential for additional parking for up to 20 visitors plus bus parking with adequateturning radius. Site access would be restricted with a 6-foot high security fence enclosing roughly 5 acres. Depending on the monitoring layout, the Alliance may elect to fence the primary injection well site and use 10-foot by 10-foot fenced areas for the other monitoring points. If a secondary injection well site were required, it would beaccessed bya gravel roadand protected witha 6-foot fence around the wellhead pad. Site Control Building The site control building would be located at the primary injection well site approximately 150 feet from one injection well to allow for visitor observation of the well and the booster pump building. Because there is no technical requirement for this distance, local landowner preferences regarding location would be taken into account during final design. The total building footprint would be approximately 5,500 square feet. Booster Pump Building If additional pressure were required to facilitate the injection of the CO2 into the storage formation, a booster pump building would be included. If required, the booster pump building would be approximately 3,120 square feet (78 feet by 40 feet). Although the conceptual design assumed that the booster pump building would be located at the primary injection well site adjacent to the injection well pad, the building could be located elsewhere along the pipeline as it approached the injection well sites. The final location ofthe building would be determinedinconsultation with local landowners. Well Maintenance and Monitoring System Building A well maintenance and monitoring building would be required at each injection well site to supply the well with fluid for annulus pressure. The total area for the building would be 1,000 square feet. For the primary injection well site, the building would be attached to the site control building with a common wall. The well maintenance and monitoring building would be enclosed to minimize noise and visual impacts to surrounding property. Figure 2-23. Dual-Site Scenario -Secondary Injection Well Site Surface Features Conceptual Layout Surface Facilities Operation Single-Site Scenario The area required for the CO2 injection wells and supporting facilities under the single-site scenario would occupy less than 10 acres for the permanent operational footprint of the injection and monitoring wells and associated infrastructure and approximately 4 acres for access roads as listed in Table 2-11 above. Approximately 10 to 15 people would be employed to manage and operate the CO2 pipelineandstoragefacilityas summarizedinTable2-13 above. All relevant parameters would be monitored and controlled from the site control and maintenance building, including the injection wells, pipeline operations, and site access. The building would contain well annulus maintenance and monitoring system equipment to supply the wells with fluid to maintain annulus pressurization. Maintaining the annulus of the well at a higher pressure than the injection pressure insures that there is no leakage from the injection wells. The well annulus maintenance and monitoring system equipment room would have a programmable logic controller cabinet and an uninterruptible power supply cabinet. The room would be enclosed to minimize noise and visual impacts on surrounding property. The Alliance would conduct a noise analysis of the site and ensure that the facilities would meet the Illinois’ noise regulatory standard at all property boundary lines. Dual-Site Scenario Information about the dual-site scenario as analyzed in the Draft EIS is included in the following discussion for purposes of comparison with the single-site scenario; however, the dual-site scenario is nolonger underconsideration bythe Alliance. As listed in Table 2-11, up to 10 acres would be needed for the permanent operational footprint of the injection and monitoring wells and associated infrastructure and buildings, and up to 15 acres for access roads to the wells and supporting facilities. Table 2-13 summarizes the anticipated management and operational personnel requirements to support the injectionwell facilities. Site Control Building The site control building would house the major operational components of the pipeline and injection wells, including the instruments for monitoring and controlling the injection wells, pipeline operations, and site access. A maintenance area would house the equipment needed for routine maintenance of pump equipment, repair parts, and at least one site and pipeline monitoring vehicle. The maintenance area would be approximately 1,600 square feet (40 feet by 40 feet). The facility would also include a conference room, restrooms (handicapped accessible), and an office area for visiting scientists and personnel. Booster Pump Building The CO2 pipeline would enter the site underground and, if additional injection pressure is needed, would emerge at the booster pump building. From there, it would remain aboveground to the injection wells for easy access and visual observation. The building would house the well injection pumps and associated flow meters, flow control valves, and variable speed drive cabinets. It would include an overhead crane for pump maintenance. The injection pump stations would include the following: • The facility would house three 710 horsepower booster pumps that would boost the CO2 to the required injection pressure. • Two of the pumps would be for normal operations and one for backup. Each of the two normal operations pumps would provide the total pumping power required for the injection wells and would be designed to operate continuously under full load. The third pump would be sized to replace one of the normal operations pumps. • The pump controls and the remote terminal unit metering output would be housed inside the site control building. The pump operation would be designed for remote operation but with local override capability. This would includenormal operation, shutdown, and re-start. • A variable frequencydrive would beprovided for each pump. • An emergency generator would be sized to power the pump station and the injection wells. The estimated power requirement for two 710 horsepower booster pumps is 1,111 kW, with continuous operation requiring approximately 799,920 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per month. The booster pump building would have constant, redundant CO2 monitoring, which would interface with a lockout security system and a high volume ventilation system. The lockout security system would not allow entranceinto the building if high levels of CO2 are present. Well Maintenance and Monitoring System Building A well maintenance and monitoring building would be required at each injectionwell site and would have a programmable logic controller cabinet and an uninterruptible power supply cabinet. The well maintenance and monitoring building would contain facilities to supply the injection well(s) at that site with fluid to maintain annulus pressurization. Maintaining the annulus of the well at a higher pressure thanthe injection pressure ensuresthat there would be no leakage fromthe injection well. 2.5.2.3 Injection Wells The Alliance evaluated several different injection well configurations using both horizontal and vertical wells at one or two injection well sites. After consideration of site-specific data from the stratigraphic well and computer modeling, the Alliance is proposing to construct four horizontal injection wells at a single injection well site. Figure 2-24 and Figure 2-25 show the conceptual design for a horizontal and vertical injection well, respectively. All four injection wells would originate from one drilling pad and would operate independently of each other. The Alliance proposed this configuration in the UIC permit applications (one permit application for each injection Vertical Injection Well – An injection well) it filedwith the USEPA in March 2013 (revised May 2013). well drilled from the ground surface to Pursuant to an Illinois Commerce Commission ruling on the a specified depth in a straight (vertical) line. FutureGen 2.0 Project, the Alliance is proposing a 20-year injection period. The injection wells would be designed to inject 1.2 million Horizontal Injection Well – An injection tons (1.1 million metric tons) of CO2 per year over the 20-year well drilled from the ground surface to injection period for a total of up to 24 million tons (22 million metric a specified depth and then curved to proceed in a horizontal direction. tons).5 Under normal operating conditions for the currently proposed injection well configuration of four horizontal wells, two wells would receive approximately 32 percent of total flow (each) and the other two would receive approximately 17 and 19 percent of the flow. Each injection well would be designed to accept up to one-third of the projected flow in order to provide operational flexibility and backup capability, such that one well couldbetakenofflinewhiletheremaininginjection well(s)receive100 percent of the flow. 5 On December 10, 2010, the USEPA published a final rule, “Federal Requirements under the Underground Injection Control Program for Carbon Dioxide Geologic Sequestration Wells” (75 FR 77230) (the “Class VI rule”). Under this rule, the USEPA created a new category of injection wells (Class VI wells) with new federal requirements to allow for injection of CO2 for geologic sequestration to ensure the protection of underground sources of drinking water. In accordance with the Class VI rule, the Alliance would be required to obtain Class VI UIC permits from the USEPA for the FutureGen 2.0 injection wells. In accordance with the Class VI rule, the Alliance would implement a MVA program to monitor the injection and storage of CO2 within the storage reservoir to verify that it stays within the target formation (see Section 2.5.2.4). CO2 = carbon dioxide; ft = feet; in = inch; KCl = potassium chloride; MD = measured depth; TVD = true vertical depth; UIC = Underground Injection Control; USDW = underground source of drinking water CO2 =carbon dioxide; ft =feet; in = inch;UIC = Underground InjectionControl; USDW = underground source of drinking water Figure 2-25. Geological Stratigraphic Column for the CO2 Storage Study Area and Vertical Injection Well Construction Details The storage reservoir for CO2 injection and storage is the Mt. Simon Formation, a sandstone formation that is one of the Illinois Basin's major deep saline formations. Figure 2-24 and Figure 2-25 also present the geological stratigraphic column for the CO2 storage study area, showing the depth and thickness of the Mt. Simon Formation. The bottom of the Mt. Simon Formation at the CO2 storage studyarea has been measured to be approximately 4,400 feet deep. The injection wells would be drilled to approximately 4,000 feet bgs. Under the Alliance’s original vertical well design, the vertical injection wells would have been over-drilled by approximately 150 feet to allow the casings to be cemented into the Precambrian granite below the Mt. Simon Formation. Under the Alliance’s revised horizontal well design, the horizontal wells would include a vertical section that extends through the Potosi Formation to an approximate depth of 3,150 feet and a 1,500-to 2,000-foot long horizontal section in the Upper Mt. Simon Formation at an approximate depth of 4,030 feet bgs. Under the Alliance’s proposed injection well configuration of four horizontal wells, each well would be oriented along a different azimuth to facilitate efficient distributionof theCO2 and porespace use. The Mt. Simon Formation's positive characteristics for CO2 storage include its isolation fromother strata, as well as its depth, lateral continuity, and relative permeability. The Mt. Simon Formation is bounded below by a Precambrian igneous rock and above by the Eau Claire Formation, which is a mixture of dense dolomite and siltstone layers with low permeability. The lower portion of the Eau Claire Formation (i.e., the Elmhurst Member) is comprised of sandstone and would be considered part of the storage reservoir, while the remainder would be considered caprock. The Franconia Dolomite would act as a secondaryseal above the Eau Claire Formation. The Mt. Simon Formation contains a highly saline aquifer with estimated total dissolved solids of approximately 48,000 parts per million at the CO2 storage study area. This high level of total dissolved solids exceeds safe drinking water standards, which are set per federal law at 10,000 parts per million; thus, this formation is not suitable to serve as a future drinking water source in Morgan County. The Mt. Simon Formation has several characteristics that are beneficial for CO2 storage; it is consistently deep (over 3,900 feet), laterally continuous, and a relatively permeable formation that is bounded by several impermeable layers. The total thickness of the injection zone (including both the Mt.Simon Formation and the Elmhurst Member) at the CO2 storage study area is 565 feet thick. The injection would likely focus on the upper third portion of the approximately 500-foot thick reservoir, which is thought to be the most permeable interval and may result in a more effective use of reservoir pore space. However, the perforated interval might also be extended over multiple permeable zones, or even the entire formation,tomaximizetheinjectionefficiencyof thewells. Ongoing efforts to characterize the geology at the CO2 storage study area, including drilling of a stratigraphic well, hydrologic testing, wireline logging, and vertical seismic profiling, have been used to provide an improved geologic understanding of the site. The Alliance conducted computer modeling using data from these efforts to simulate the currently proposed configuration of four horizontal injection wells to predict the areal extent and distribution of the CO2 plume within the storage reservoir. The results of this analysis are summarized in Appendix G, Geological Report. This report concludes that the CO2 plume would expand to encompass an area of nearly 4,000 acres over the 20-year injection period, as shown in Figure 2-26. Figure 2-26 depicts the predicted CO2 injection plumes after 5, 10, 20, 22, and 70 years. The 22-year plume is the predicted maximum extent of the plume. The impact analysis in this EIS conservatively assumes that the plume would be approximately 4,000 acres in size and contained withinthe6,800-acre CO2 storage studyarea. Injection Well Construction During construction, up to 14 construction workers would work in two 12-hour shifts. Staff would include a driller and six crew members of the drill staff. The drill staff would consist of a mud logger, a geologist, four Alliance representatives (including a drilling engineer and a site coordination ACZ = above confining zone; CO2 = carbon dioxide; MS = microseismic; USDW = underground source of drinking water; VSP = vertical seismic profile; yr = year superintendent), and a safety person. Construction duration is estimated to be 100 to 120 days of drilling per well. Once drilling is initiated, drilling would generally occur 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Figures 2-27 and 2-28 are picturesoftypical drill rigsduring daylightand nighttime hours. Figure 2-27. Drill Rig during Daytime Operations Figure 2-28. Drill Rig during Nighttime Operations As described in the Draft EIS for the dual-site injection well configuration, each drill pad would initially measure approximately 350 feet by 350 feet and would be reduced to a final 200-foot by 200-foot pad after drilling is completed. For the single-site configuration, as currently proposed by the Alliance, a larger well pad would be used, up to 688 feet by 950 feet that would accommodate all four horizontal injection wells. Larger gravel on a geotextile fabric would act as an underlayment with smaller gravel making up the top portion of the drilling pad. The removed gravel would be reused for the construction of access roadsto groundwater and other monitoring points. The drill pad would be surrounded by a berm on up to three sides and would be designed with drainage and erosion controls to ensure that stormwater is properly managed. These controls would include covering the berms with topsoil and planting grass seed; placing erosion control blankets on slopes, berms, and ditches around the drilling pad; and seeding stockpiled soil. Lined earthen pits would contain any excess fluids generated during drilling, discarded water used in the cementing process, and spent drilling mud from mud change-outs. The pits, which would measure approximately 100 feet by 60 feet by 10 feet, would be constructed after the drilling pads are constructed. The earthen pits would be lined with 30-mil high-density polyethylene plastic sheeting with welded seams to prevent infiltration offluids into the subsurface. After the drilling pad is constructed, drilling equipment and support facilities would be installed at the well site. Major drilling equipment components would include the drilling rig, a fuel tank, water tanks, pumps for circulating drilling mud, steel pits (tanks) for mud cleaning (i.e., solids settling) and mixing the drilling mud, pipe racks for holding drilling pipe, an electrical generator, and lights. In addition to the drilling rig equipment, the injection well site would include two temporary office trailers and two house trailers. The injection wells would likely be drilled with a conventional drilling rig and mud system using the same methods and principles as those commonly used in the oil and gas well-drilling industry. Drilling would involve using a drilling fluid (mud) system. Mud lubricates the bit and drill string, removes drill cuttings from the wellbore, and assists with pressure control. A mudlogging trailer equipped with gas-monitoring instrumentation would be used while drilling all sections below the conductor casing to monitor for natural gas and oil, plot drilling penetration rates, and describe the cuttings in the drilling returns. During the drilling of the injection wells, the Alliance anticipates that the equipment onsite (in addition to the drill rig) would include generators, compressors, backhoes, forklifts, and bulldozers. Approximately 22 semi-trucks would be required to move the drill rig to the site. The largest load would be approximately 87 feet long. The average load would be 100,000 pounds, and the heaviest load would be approximately 160,000 pounds. Trucks would visit the site to deliver fuel, cement, and casing. Trucks would also visit the site during wireline logging, hydrogeologic testing, and coring activities. These activities would occur infrequently and an average of a single truck per day to support these activities is anticipated. Vehicles would also visit the site to service the portable toilets. At completion of the drilling operation, trucks would beused to dispose of cuttings. The temporary office trailers would be powered by a field generator and would have temporary sanitary services. Water would be provided to the trailers from an onsite water tank. Based on the drilling of the stratigraphic well (see Section 2.5.2.5), the Alliance estimates that drilling and cementing of each injection well would require approximately 1.33 million gallons of water, with the potential for an additional 840,000 gallons if zones of lost circulation are encountered. Thus, up to a total of 8.68 million gallons of water could be required to drill and cement all four horizontal wells. The fresh water for the injection wells would be obtained from the North Morgan County Water Cooperative (Co-Op), as it was forthe stratigraphic well drilling. Construction of the injection wells would generate up to 1,100 cubic yards of cuttings. In addition, the drilling fluids and fluid removed from the formation during development and testing would need disposal as a non-hazardous waste. These would be fluids with salinitiesin excess of150,000 parts per million. The Alliance would implement BMPs during construction of the injection wells. These practices would include spill prevention and stormwater runoff management. For spill prevention, the drilling contractor would be required to use secondary containment for all fuel storage tanks to prevent leaked fuel from entering the environment. The preferred method for achieving secondary containment is to use double-walled tanks. If double-walled fuel tanks are not available, lined dikes with a capacity of 1.5 times the volume of the storage tank(s) would be used. Synthetic (plastic) sheeting (30 mil thick) would be laid down beneath all mud pits (steel tanks) and associated circulation equipment, including mud pumps to prevent releases of drilling fluids to the ground surface. The drilling contractor would also install a synthetic liner beneath the rig (rig underliner). The drilling contractor would maintain an inventory of absorbent materials (e.g., pads and booms) in order to respond to any release of engine oil, hydraulic oil, diesel fuel, gasoline, antifreeze, drilling fluids, or any other contaminants as a result of the driller’s activities. Any spills involving fuel or other liquid or dry chemicals would be cleaned up immediately, including any affected soil. All used spill cleanup materials, as well as any affected soil, would be contained and disposed ofproperly. In order to properly manage stormwater runoff during injection well installation, the Alliance would obtain a General NPDES Permit for Construction Site Activities from the IEPA. As noted above, the drilling pads would be constructed using stormwater and erosion control measures, including earthen berms around the drilling pads covered with topsoil and seeded with grass; erosion control blankets on slopes, berms, and ditches around the drilling pad; and seeding of stockpiled soil. Surface runoff originating upslope of the drilling pad would be routed beneath the pad through a standpipe with an inlet riserlocated upslopeofthedrilling pad connected to a12-inch pipe buried beneath the drilling pad. The Alliance examined the potential for encountering drilling hazards. The closest wells that penetrate the Mt. Simon Sandstone are in the Morgan County Waverly Field, approximately 16 miles south-southeast of the CO2 storage study area. However, there are several shallow oil and gas producing zones in the Morgan County area, as well as several zones of potential lost circulation. Small volumes of gas or oil are likely to be encountered in the Pennsylvanian section (see Figures 2-24 and 2-25) to a depth of about 350 feet. Hydrocarbons are expected to exist to a depth of about 1,200 feet. There are no records of over-pressured oil and natural gas reservoirs near the proposed site, but all proper safeguards would be used while drilling the well. A mud logging unit equipped with a gas detector and a gas chromatograph would be used to monitor the drill cuttings retrieved from below the conductor casing. Blowout preventers and choke manifolds would be used at all times when drilling below the conductor casing for well control in the event excessive gas isencountered. Pennsylvanian-aged coals and Mississippian-aged formations at the CO2 storage study area may contain traces of hydrogen sulfide. A hydrogen sulfide emergency action plan would be reviewed with all onsite workers and a written copy would be maintained in the mud logger’s trailer and in the field office trailer. When drilling through potential hydrogen sulfide-bearing zones, all drilling hands would be equipped with a personal monitor and would be instructed in proper safety response by a hydrogen sulfide safety consulting company representative. In the unlikely event hydrogen sulfide is encountered, the safety consulting company would determine the appropriate actions to be taken by the drilling crew and other onsite workers. Windsocks would beset up by the drilling contractor. Lost mud circulation, which occurs when the drilling fluid flows into a geological formation instead of returning up the annulus, may be encountered in the area planned for the wells. The stratigraphic well encountered lost circulation in the Potosi Dolomite but did not have an issue in the Ironton Sandstone and Borden Formation, which have been identified as potential zones of lost circulation in Illinois. Those geologicformations are shown in Figures 2-24 and 2-25. If circulationis lost inone of these or other zones, lost circulation material would be added to thicken the drilling fluid. If circulation cannot be restored with such material alone, the zone(s) would be squeezed with a sodium silicate solution and/or cement until circulation is restoredanddrillingcanresume. Injection Well Operations The demonstration period, with active injection and monitoring, would begin in 2017 and end in 2022; however, commercial operations could continue beyond the demonstration period. The CO2 injection would operate for a total of 20 years. The Alliance would be financially responsible for post-injection monitoring of the underground CO2 for up to 50 years after injection ceases in accordance with the UIC permits. In addition to the onsite staff managing and monitoring pipeline and injection well operations, the Alliance expects that two of the staff personnel (3 shifts per day, 7 days per week) would be onsite to continually monitor injection operations. Alternatively, the Alliance could acquire the services ofa vendorthat would remotely and continuously monitortheinjectionoperations. Maintenance operations for CO2 injection wells may include swabbing; sand removal; replacing and repairing tubing, the packer, valves, and sensors; repairing corroded casing; and remedial cementing (USEPA 2011a). The typical wastes generated from such maintenance are brine fluids and sand. Acid may be employed to remove scaling, if scaling is present in the well hole, in which case acid and scaling residue would be generated. The rigs used for well maintenance are mobile units, which generate wastes such as hydraulic fluids, rig wash water, spent solvents, used lubricating oil, and filters. The frequency of maintenance operations would depend on data from well monitoring, but external mechanical integrity tests are planned at not less than 5-year intervals and maintenance activity would likely coincide with those activities. The truck traffic from the well maintenance would consist of approximately 20 vehicles associated withthemaintenance rig. The solid waste generated from maintenance activities would be transported in dump trucks and would be properly disposed in landfills. The liquid waste from maintenance would be collected and transported in vacuumtanker trucks andhauledtoa wastewatertreatment plant. The volume ofwaste material generated during well maintenance would depend on pipe and equipment degradation. While the volume would vary greatly from well to well, it is expected that up to 20 tanker trucks with a capacity of 3,000 gallons each would be required for transporting liquid wastes and up to 10, 20-yard roll-off dumpsters would be required for transportingsolid wastes for each maintenance operation. 2.5.2.4 Monitoring, Verification, and Accounting An extensive MVA program, including monitoring activities required by the Class VI UIC regulations, would beestablished in accordance withthe ClassVIUICregulations to monitortheinjection and storage of CO2 to verifythat it stays withinthestorage reservoir. The MVA monitoring program would assess the potential for any migration that could adversely affect the shallow underground sources of drinking water (USDWs) or surface or near-surface ecological conditions. Early detection of any storage performance issues would allow for early action to address them through engineering or operational adjustments. The primary objectives ofthe monitoring program would be the following: • Trackthe lateral extent of dense phaseCO2 withinthestorage reservoir. • Characterize any geochemical or geomechanical changes that occur within the reservoir and confirma lack of migration through the overlying caprock. • Verifythatthere are no negative environmental impacts. The MVA program would meet injection control permitting requirements and requirements that DOE may impose. Prior to the initiation of injection operations, the Alliance would design and implement the monitoring program to address all requirements of the Class VI UIC regulations and the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule. Under subpart RR of the UIC Class VI rule, facilities conducting geologic sequestration are required to report the amount of CO2 received, develop and implement a USEPA-approved MVA plan, and report the amount of CO2 sequestered using a mass balance approach. In addition, the Class VI rule requires operators of Class VI wells to develop, gain approval for, and implement five project-specific plans, including: an Area of Review(AoR) andCorrective Action Plan, a Testing and Monitoring Plan, an Injection Well Plugging Plan, a Post-Injection Site Care and Site Closure Plan, and an Emergency and Remedial Response Plan. These plans would outline the monitoring techniques that would be implemented in support of the project. Monitoring procedures may be added or removed, or the duration of monitoring activities may be changed depending on the characteristics of the CO2 plume. The Post-Injection Site Care and Site Closure Plan are implemented to ensure that the well owner/operator has approval from the UIC Program Director for the procedures to be followed after injection operations cease.The Post-Injection Site Care and Site Closure Plan would also helpidentifythe appropriate types and amounts of data needed to verify that the CO2 plume and pressure front do not endanger USDWs, and it would support a determination of whether conditions warrant site closure and thereforean end to post-injection site care (i.e., there is no longer a risk ofendangerment to USDWs). The plan would identify the types and duration of monitoring that would occur; the minimum post-injection site care duration is 50 years unless otherwise approved by the UIC Program Director. The Emergency and Remedial Response Plan would identify the actions that would be necessary in the unlikely event of an emergency at the site. The plan would ensure that site operators know which entities are to be notified and what actions would need to be taken to expeditiously mitigate any emergency situation and protect human health and safety and the environment. The specific actions that would need to be taken would depend on the initiating event and any resulting effects. The Class VI UIC regulations also require the well owner/operator to demonstrate and maintain financial responsibility as determined by the UIC Program Director (under 40 CFR 146.85). Financial responsibility extends to the costs that may be associated with: (1) corrective action, (2) injection well plugging, (3) post injection site care and site closure, and (4) emergency and remedial response. The financial responsibility must be sufficient to address endangerment of USDWs. The Alliance's Supporting Documentation for its Class VI UIC permit applications was submitted to the USEPA in March 2013 and revised in May 2013 in accordance with the USEPA’s completeness review. The documentation is posted at the USEPA UIC website for public access (http://www.epa.gov/r5water/uic/futuregen/index.htm). The Supporting Documentation for the Class VI UIC permit applications addresses respective information in Sections 7.0, Post-Injection Site Care and Site Closure Plan; 8.0, Class VI Emergency and Remedial Response Plan; and 9.0, Financial Responsibility. As explained in Section 9.0 of the Supporting Documentation, the Alliance would obtain insurance and would establish a trust fund to ensure that sufficient funds are available tomeetits financial responsibility inaccordance withthe UICregulations. As documented in the plans addressed above, the MVA program would include monitoring that starts before injection activities are initiated and continues throughout the project and after closure of the injection wells. As part of the MVA program, the Alliance would establish baseline measurements of natural CO2 at the site of the injection wells and in the soil, groundwater, and atmosphere. Soil gas monitoring would be used to evaluate baseline CO2 concentrations and would provide a means of assessing potential increases in CO2 concentration at the surface during operations. The Alliance identified preliminary locations for soil gas monitoring within the CO2 storage study area and screened these areas for the presence of cultural and biological resources. No cultural resources or threatened or endangered species were found at these locations (see AppendixB, Consultation Letters, and Appendix F, Cultural Surveys). Soil gas monitoring would involve the installation of a shallow probe up to 5 feet in depth, which would be used to conduct long-term monitoring of soil gas. Other geophysical monitoring techniques, such as seismic and electrical resistivity methods (see Section 2.5.2.5 Interim Actions), would be evaluated for tracking the CO2 in the subsurface. The most effective method would be selectedfor long-term monitoring. The Alliance characterized the injection and confining zones and designedthe injection wells to minimize the potential of a CO2 release. If, however, an adverse event were to occur during construction or operation, the Alliance would deploy a variety of emergency or remedial responses, depending on the characteristics of the event (e.g., the location, type, and volume of a release). The immediate response would be to stop drilling or injection, in order to assess the situation. The Alliance would then conduct an investigation to determine the cause of the event by reviewing the monitoring records, checking the well casing, annulus seals and down-hole pressure, or performing geophysical surveys. Depending on the cause of the event, several remediation solutions could be implemented, including repairing the well casing, lowering the reservoir pressure by removing brine or CO2, increasing the upstream reservoir pressure (e.g., creating a hydraulic barrier), diverting the CO2 stream, or modifying the injection flow rate or quantity. In certain situations, an injection well could be sealed with cement, or USDW groundwater remediation could be implemented if necessary. The individual procedures, based on the event, are described in the MVA plan included in the Supporting Documentation for the Class VI UIC permit applications under Section 5.0, Testingand Monitoring Plan. In addition, the data collected from the MVA program would allow the Alliance to proactively manage the CO2 plume so that it remains beneath the CO2 storage study area. In the unlikely event that monitoring indicates that the plume has the potential to migrate off the study area, the Alliance could make adjustments to the injection rate or the duration of the injection period to prevent this from happening.  Monitoring Wells The MVA monitoring program would require a network of monitoring wells that would be used for containment monitoring and CO2 plume tracking. The wells would be designed to confirm the ongoing integrity of the primary caprock seal and assess the potential for any identified migration that could adversely affect the quality of the shallow underground drinking water aquifers or surface or near-surface ecological conditions. The monitoring wells would be used to track the lateral extent of liquefied CO2 within the targeted reservoir, characterize any geochemical or geomechanical changes that occur within the reservoir and overlying caprock that may affect containment, and determine whether the injected CO2 is effectively contained within the reservoir. The monitoring wells would be located in accordance with the requirements of the USEPA’s Class VI UIC permits. Table 2-14 lists the injection and monitoring wells that the Alliance expects toconstruct and operate in its proposed single-site scenario and describes the land area that could be affected. For comparison, Table 2-15 lists the injection and monitoring wells and potential land area affected for the dual-site scenario described in the Draft EIS. Any monitoring wells extending into the storage reservoir would be designed with an effective, long-term seal through the overlying caprock. Figure 2-26 illustrates the Alliance’s currently planned monitoring configuration as presented in the UIC permit applications. The monitoring well locations shown on the figure are representative but approximate and subject to landowner agreement and UIC permit approval. It is anticipated that the monitoring well network would consist of the following wells, at a minimum: • Two single-level wellswould be located near the predictedlateral extent of the 5-to 25-year CO2 plume. • One multi-level deep well would be located within the predicted lateral extent of the 2-to 5-year CO2 plume. This well would be designed to measure pressures and geochemistry at several different depth intervalswithin theinjection zone. • Three above-confining-zone early detection monitoring wells would be installed within the first permeable interval above the Eau Claire Siltstone/Shale Unit (most likely in the Ironton Sandstone). The wells would be located in the vicinity of the injection well drill pad, within the region of highest pressure buildup. These wells could also be used for vertical seismic profiling or microseismic monitoring. • A single regulatory compliance well would be installed within the St. Peter Sandstone, the lowermost USDW aquifer, although the aquifer is not used for drinking water in Morgan County due to its high salinity levels. The compliance well would be near the aboveconfining-zone, early detection monitoring well and within the region of highest pressure buildup. • Up to fivemicroseismic, shallow wells (upto 200 feet deep)may also be drilled.  • Up to 10 nearby farm or residential wells would also be monitored.6 6 The Alliance would monitor for major cations (aluminum, barium, calcium, iron, potassium, magnesium, manganese, sodium, silicon); RCRA trace metals (antimony, arsenic, barium, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, mercury, selenium, thallium); anions (chloride, bromide, fluoride, sulfate, nitrate, carbonate): gravimetric total dissolved solids; alkalinity; dissolved inorganic carbon; total organic carbon; stable isotopes ratios of deuterium/hydrogen, carbon 13/carbon 12, and oxygen 18/oxygen 16; perfluorocarbon, sulfonate tracers; pH; specific conductance; and temperature. Table 2-14. Surface Area Impacted by Injection and Monitoring Well System for the Single-Site Scenario a. This number reflects the total construction area at the injection well site. Construction of the injection wells and well pad would occur simultaneously with all other facilities associated withthe CO2 injection well site includingbuilding, sidewalk, parking, and infrastructure. b. Would also be used for vertical seismic profiling, microseismic monitoring, and as above-confining zone early detection monitoring well. c. This assumes that the stratigraphic well would be converted to a single-level monitoring well for the injection zone.

Note: This table reflects estimates fora singleinjectionwellsitewithfour injectionwells. Table 2-15.

Underthe single well site scenario, a largerwell pad (up to 640 feet by500 feet)would be required. ft = feet; mi = miles Monitoring Well Construction Construction ofthe monitoring wells required for MVAactivities would beconducted in a similar manner to that described for the injection wells. The footprint areas of disturbance are presented in Tables 2-14 and 2-15 for the single-site and dual-site scenarios, respectively. The water required and waste generated would also be similar to the injection wells, but in amounts proportional to their diameters and depths. Communications are intended to be wireless; however, new electrical lines may be constructed to reach each monitoring well site, in which case approximately 2 miles of new line would be installed. For single-phase low voltage rural lines, pole spacing of 320 feet can be assumed. With 320-foot pole spacing, 33 wooden single poles would be placed. Pole placement would be along existing roads or new access roads. An alternative for supplying electricity to monitoring wells would be photovoltaic solar panels with batteries at each monitoring well location. This would decrease the total construction impact, although it would entail higher maintenance cost and activity over the life of the project. The current conceptual design would require less than 1 mile of new electrical lines, which would only require 17 wooden electrical poles. The Alliance is also exploring the potential for supplying electricity to the monitoring wells using photovoltaic solar panels with battery storage at each monitoring well location. The use of solar panels would decrease the total construction impact, although it would entail highermaintenancecosts and activity over the life ofthe project. Monitoring Well Operations Monitoring operations would be performed at the monitoring wells in accordance with the Class VI UIC permits. Monitoring would be performed throughout the project and during the post-injection monitoring period. Monitoring operations would be finalized once the UIC permits have been issued for the project. 2.5.2.5 Interim Actions Stratigraphic Well Under its cooperative agreement with DOE, the Alliance proposed to drill a stratigraphic well at the CO2 storage study area to obtain subsurface data regarding, among other things, the porosity and permeability of the Mt. Simon Formation at that specific location. DOE determined that the activities related to the stratigraphic well were needed for the purposes of data collection and would be allowable under NEPA as interim actions, because they would not have an adverse environmental impact or limit the choices of reasonable alternatives for the project. The Alliance completed construction of the stratigraphic well in December 2011. The Alliance constructed the stratigraphic well on 2.2 acres of privately owned land at the CO2 storage study area in Alexander, Illinois. In conjunction with the construction, the Alliance also proposed to make road improvements at the intersection of Beilschmidt Road and County Road 123, as well as along Beilschmidt Road, west of County Road 123, and on a privately owned farm road to allow access of heavy equipment to the stratigraphic well site on the property. All affected property owners agreed to allowthe Alliance the use theirproperties forthese purposes. DOE’s approval was basedon the followingfactors consideredinits environmental review: • The stratigraphic well siteis not withinafloodplain. • Results from a field study confirmed that the site is not located in a wetland (see Appendix D, Wetland Surveys [D3]). A non-jurisdictional strip of grassy vegetation is present along the west side of a stream more than 200 feet from the stratigraphic well pad area. The stream is a tributary of Indian Creek and is a jurisdictional wetland by definition. The grassy strip ranges in width from approximately 5 feet at its narrowest point to more than 10 feet at its widest points, and it serves as a buffer between agriculturally-disturbed soils on its west side and the streamon its east side. • Results from a survey confirmed that there are no federally-listed or state-listed plant or animal species or critical habitat located on or adjacent to the site (see Appendix E, Biological Surveys [E4]). • Although the site and surrounding acreage were assumed to be prime or unique farmland, topsoil would be stockpiled, and the area would be restored following the removal of the drilling equipment, except for a portion of the gravel pad and an access road needed for long-term monitoring. • There are no state or national parks, forests, conservation areas, or other areas of recreational, ecological, scenic, oraesthetic importanceon or adjacent to the proposed site. • There are no wild and scenic rivers or other potentially sensitive resources (e.g., timber, range, minerals, fish, wildlife, waterbodies, oraquifers) on, below, or adjacent tothe proposedsite. • Based on the results of a field survey of the proposed site, the Illinois SHPO agreed that the property does not include any sites having historic, archaeological, or architectural significance (includingsitesonoreligiblefortheNRHPandtheNational Registryof Natural Landmarks). • There are no Native Americantribes or traditional cultural properties located on or adjacent to the proposed wellsite. In accordance with the proposed activities approved by DOE, the Alliance initiated drilling of the stratigraphic well in October 2011 and completed the stratigraphic well in December 2011. The drilling of the stratigraphicwell involved the followingspecificactivities: • Minor improvements to approximately 1.2 miles of Beilschmidt Road, west of County Road 123. These improvements consisted of improvements to the intersection of County Road 123 and Beilschmidt Road, including construction of pullouts along Beilschmidt Road, and widening of 90-degree turns to accommodate truck traffic. At the landowners’ request, these improvements remainedinplacefollowingcompletion of drilling. • Minor improvements to approximately 1 mile of a farm road to allow access to the property. The existing dirt road wascompacted and surfaced with gravel for 12 feet in width. • Construction of approximately 1 mile of a water supply line from a connection on Beilschmidt Road to the stratigraphic well drill pad. This temporary, aboveground water line was located partially within the non-jurisdictional grassy strip. Impacts to this grassy strip were minimized by hand-delivering supplies during construction and using low-pressure single-seat all-terrain vehicles as needed. All aboveground temporary piping was removed after drilling operations were completed. • Site preparation such as grading and construction of an in-ground reserve pit measuring approximately100 feet long, 50 feet wide, and 12 feet deep. Topsoil was stockpiled in a berm for later site restoration and toprovide a noise barrier forthe benefit of nearbyresidents. • Removal of a disused and deteriorating shed at the request of the landowner. Debris material, such as steel, was recycled to the fullest extent possible; any remaining debris was trucked to a nearby landfill. • Construction of a compacted gravel drill pad approximately 350 feet by 350 feet in size. In addition to the well, the drill pad accommodated associatedequipment andseveraltrailers. • Transportation of equipment, materials, and workers to and from the proposed site. Truck traffic occurred during construction of road improvements, site preparation, construction of the drilling rig, removal of the drilling rig, and site restoration. During the construction of the road improvements and site preparation, truck traffic was limited to the hours between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. and occurred 6 days per week. The increase in trucktraffic was temporary. • Drilling of the stratigraphic well approximately 4,800 feet deep. The Alliance obtained a well-drilling permit from the IDNR, Division of Oil and Gas. A drill rig was onsite for approximately 150 days (a large rig was onsite for approximately 90 days and a smaller rig was onsite for an additional approximately 60 days). During that time, noise and vibrations were generated 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, for a total of approximately 90 days. Site layouts were adjusted to mitigate potential noise impacts; this included placement of the stockpiled topsoil in a berm and placement of trailers to form noise barriers between the site and local residents. Affected landowners and residences were informed of the potential for temporary noise and vibration disturbances prior to thestart of construction. The stratigraphic well waslined with steel pipe, which is readily available. All wastes generated were non-hazardous and were disposed of at local disposal facilities. There are at least two solid waste disposal facilities within 50 miles of the stratigraphicwell site. • Removal of equipment and restoration of construction area after completion of the drilling. A small portion of the gravel pad surrounding the stratigraphic well and an access road remains for long-termaccess to the well for monitoringpurposes.The remainder of the site would be restored to its original condition. Data from the stratigraphic well confirmed that the local geology is suitable for CO2 storage. This data wasincluded as part of the Class VI UIC permit applications the Alliance submittedtothe USEPA. Electrical Resistivity Tomography Monitoring The Alliance proposed to initiate an electrical resistivity tomography monitoring program to evaluate the feasibility of this monitoring technique to support the MVA system for the project (Alliance 2013b). Electrical resistivity tomography is a geophysical method capable of producing a three dimensional image of the subsurface that may be used for monitoring the lateral extent of injected CO2. DOE determined that the proposed monitoring activities would be allowable under NEPA as an interim action, because they would not have an adverse environmental impact or limit the range of reasonable alternatives for the project. DOE’s approval of the monitoring program was based onthe following facts: • The Alliance would conduct cultural and biological surveys at each electrical resistivity tomography location to ensure that no sensitive resources are located that cannot be avoided. • The Alliancewould provide DOEwith the cultural and biological surveyswhen complete. Under this monitoring program, a temporary array of 18 electrodes would be placed along the side of Beilschmidt Road for a period of approximately 1 week. At each sample location, a 4-foot by 4foot shallow excavation would be completed that is 6 inches deep. Electrode rods would be driven into the center of each excavation to a depth of approximately 3 feet. The electrodes would be removed and any surface disturbance would be backfilled and returned to its original condition after the monitoring has been completed. In preparation for this monitoring program, the Alliance met with the Morgan County road supervisor and received approval to use the ROW. The Alliance also established a process to contact the Illinois Joint Utility Location Information Exchange to ensure no interference wouldoccur withburied utilitylines. The Alliance completed environmental and cultural surveys in some parts of this area in support of the soil gas monitoring stations. Additional environmental and cultural surveys would be conducted to ensure complete coverage of the areas that would be used to support the electrical resistivity tomography monitoring program. Since the electrodes would be placed along roadways in already disturbed ROWs, sensitive resources are not anticipated to be found. In the event that sensitive resources are found at a planned sample location, the sample site would be moved to a nearby locationthatis free of anysensitive resources. In addition, electrodes would not be installed in areas thatwould interferewith agricultural production. Additional Surface Monitoring Activities The Alliance has undertaken or intends to undertake several site characterization activities prior to the issuance of a Record of Decision. The Alliance sought and received interim action authority from DOE in accordance with 40 CFR 1506.1 and 10 CFR 1021.211 to conduct these activities. Although they generally involve some minor ground disturbance, the Alliance conducted field studies to confirm the absence of any sensitive resources that could be adversely affected. Because they are site characterization activities only—most in support of permit applications—DOE has authorized these activities because they do not adversely affect the environment and do not affect the choice of reasonable alternatives. These activitieswouldinclude the following: • Hyperspectral remote sensing data ground-truthing. Access would be required during peak growing season to survey crop vigor across the study area. Sensitive areas would be avoided. Staff would walk into fields where access is permitted and visually inspect crop cover. Ground-truth survey locations would not be identified until hyperspectral flyover data have been evaluated, but this would be a low impact activity with no permanent monitoring equipmentinstallation. • Surface water monitoring. A water quality parameter monitoring station would be installed in an existing farm pond northeast of the injection site. Access, with landowner permission, would be required during installation and periodically during the 2-to 3-year monitoring periodfor operations andmaintenance activities. • Shallow USDW monitoring. Groundwater samples would be collected from the same network of landownerwells that the Illinois StateGeological Survey sampledin 2012. • Leak detection field test. This test would be conducted in late summer or early fall and would involve releasing a tracer (i.e., naturally occurring isotopes) at the injection well site and performing mobile atmospheric monitoring to demonstrate detection capability. Air monitoring would occur along county roads, so access onto private property would not be required. 2.5.3 Visitor, Research, and Training Facilities The Alliance would construct and operate visitor, research, and training facilities (also referred to as the educational facilities) at suitable locations in the Jacksonville area to support public outreach and communication, and to provide training and research opportunities associated with near-zero emissions power and CO2 capture and storage technologies. These facilities would: • Familiarize visitors with the inner workings of the oxy-combustion facility, the CO2 pipeline, and the CO2 storage project area, as well as other local points of interest. It is anticipated that visitors and researchers from across the country and the world would visit the CO2 injectionwell site and theoxy-combustion system in Meredosia. • Provide research opportunities focused on monitoring processes and results, including improvements to monitoring system designs. • Educate and train trade workers, technicians, engineers, and scientists to manage and monitor CO2 sequestration operations and about near zero emission power generation technologies. The Alliance originally assumed that one building would house the visitor center and research functions and that a second building (possibly at a separate location) would house the training function. Since the completion of the Draft EIS, the Alliance modified its plans such that the current conceptual designassumes that the visitor, research, and trainingfacilities wouldbe housed in a single building, rather than two separate buildings. The remainder of this section summarizes the original conceptual plans for multiple educational buildings in comparison with the Alliance’s current plans for a single building. The intended general location for the educational facilities is the vicinity of Jacksonville, Illinois, which is the largest community in Morgan County and the analysis of impactsinthe Final EIS remains generallyfocusedon the Jacksonville vicinity. The Alliance has been working with local stakeholders to identify the location or locations that would be advantageous to the FutureGen 2.0 Project and to the local community. Discussions between the Alliance and Jacksonville authorities have recently focused on the prospect of locating the educational facilities within a 5-acre parcel in the northeast portion of Jacksonville Community Park. The location is adjacent to West Morton Avenue and South Main Street on the south side of the Jacksonville downtown area, and it is currently occupied by offices of the Jacksonville Area Chamber of Commerce, which would be demolished if the site were used. Construction of the educational facilities would disturb a maximum of 3.5 acres but would not affect the existing Ferris wheel near the corner of West Morton Avenue and South Main Street. The Community Park is a landscaped urban park that includes public structures, the Jacksonville Area Senior Center, playgrounds, soccer fields, internal roadways, and parking areas. South Main Street and Morton Avenue both provide access to Jacksonville from I-72, and the parcel is adjacent to all necessary utility infrastructure. Nodecision has been reachedwith respectto the use of this potentiallocation. 2.5.3.1 Educational Facilities Construction The proposed site or sites for the educational facilities would be areas that have been previously disturbed, with utilities (e.g., electricity, telecommunications, water, and sewer) located on or immediately adjacent to the site or sites. These educational facilities could involve new construction, rehabilitation of existing structures, or a combination of new construction and rehabilitation. However, for purposes of impact analyses in this EIS, DOE assumes a worst-case scenario involving all new building construction. The Alliance intends thatthe educationalfacilities wouldhave green building design elements. DOE intends to support LEED certification to the extent that the costs would be fair, reasonable, and within the scope of the Alliance-DOE Cooperative Agreement. Design, construction, and maintenance would strive to integrate the principles of universal and sustainable design and advanced energy technology as appropriate and feasible. The materials would be typical for new building construction; concrete, steel, wood, dry wall, insulation, glass, and roofing material. Under the current single-building conceptual design, the Alliance is planning to pursue the following design concepts, which DOE intends to support to the extent that the costs would be fair, reasonable,andwithinthe scope of the Alliance-DOE Cooperative Agreement: • The visitor, research, and training facility site would be located in Jacksonville, Illinois. It would be accessible to the community’s higher education complexes and located near traveler amenities suchashotels andrestaurants. • The distinct functions of the visitor, research, and training facility would be physically separatedwhere necessary, although the facilitywould havecommonareas. • Entrances, interior spacesand restrooms would behandicapped accessible. • A multi-function auditorium to serve all three aspects of the facility is under consideration. The Alliance assumes this would have a multi-media capability and seating designed for presentationsor community events. • The visitor component would include an open group gathering space, information desk, media displays, auditorium, static andinteractive displays illustratingthe processsteps. • The research component would include office areas and meeting space for visiting scientists and FutureGen personnel. The research component could also include data links to monitoring functions at the energy center and CO2 injection well site and potentially provide laboratory space for testing and analysis of geologic materials, gases, and groundwater. • The building is assumed to have a large open-space training area for equipment and site control simulationand additional classroomand lecture hall space. • The visitor, research, and training building footprint is assumed to be between 40,000 and 45,000 square feet. The building structure is assumed to meet and exceed the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc. (ASHRAE), Illuminating Engineering Society of North America Standard 90.1 for building envelope requirements. • The building would be built using green building design elements and would strive to integrate the principles of universal and sustainable design and advanced energy technology as appropriate and feasible. The exterior landscaping vegetation would be local prairie species that are drought resistant. Deciduous trees would be provided primarily within the parking lot area to reduce heat islanding. Backup power would be provided by a natural gas generator. DOE based the impact analysis on the Alliance’s conservative scenario whereby the building or buildings that would house the educational facilities would be single story (for a scenario with the largest surface area disturbance); and further, that the Alliance would construct a new building or buildings, as opposed to renovating existing buildings. Table 2-16 presents the construction requirements for the educational facilities for a configuration of two buildings (as analyzed in the Draft EIS) and for the current conceptual design that consolidates all the facilities into one building. The one-building configuration would result in a smaller operational footprint than the original two-building design, and thus less of an impact on the physical environment. The one-building configuration would require a shorter construction duration and less of a construction workforce. Table 2-16.

Approximately 10 outside researchers could be accommodated onsite at anyone time.The visitor and research center would be open 6 days per week for 9 hours per day. The training facility would be open 12 hours per day for six days per week. An estimate of 10,000 to 20,000 annual visitors would be anticipated with a significant percentage of that number being from local students arriving in buses. Table 2-17 presents the operational requirements for the educational facilities for a configuration of two buildings and for the current conceptual design thatconsolidatesall thefacilitiesintoone building. Table 2-17. Operational Requirements for Educational Facilities a. The facilities would use natural gas for space and water heating, where no geothermal heating was employed. The estimate for the two-building scenario is based on different therms/square foot for each of the two buildings to reflect the two different uses; the estimate for the one-building scenario is basedonthe higher of the two ratesfor the entire combined building area. b. Backuppower to thefacilitywouldbe providedbya naturalgasgenerator. c. Theannualwateruseisprojected assuming15gallonsper dayforeachemployeeandresearcherand10gallons per visitor. Btu/yr = British thermal units per year; therms/yr = therms per year; gal/yr =gallons per year 2.5.4 Decommissioning The project would be designed for 20 years of operation. The removal of the project facilities from service, or decommissioning, may range from “mothballing” to the removal of all equipment and facilities, depending on the conditions at the time. The process would involve decommissioning all surface facilities, including connections between the energy center and the injection wells. All exposed pipes, along with other surface facilities, would be decommissioned and may be removed during site closure. The UIC Class VI regulations require the Alliance to notify the UIC Program Director in writing at least 120 days prior to site closure and cessation of site core activities and provide any proposed changes to the Post-Injection Site Care and Site Closure Plan. The regulations also require the Alliance to submit a SiteClosureReport within 90 days of authorization of site closure by the UIC Program Director. The purpose of the report is to document appropriate closure procedures, as well as information concerning injection welloperation, which may be of interest to future land owners and planners. The Alliance would plug and abandon all injection wells in accordance with the Injection Well Plugging Plan approved by the UIC Program Director during the permitting process and updated as appropriate. In accordance with the UIC Class VIregulations,theAlliance wouldsubmit tothe UIC ProgramDirector an NOI to Plug 60 days prior to commencement of plugging. The Alliance would also submit a Plugging Report to the UIC ProgramDirector 60 days aftercompletion of plugging. The Alliance would conduct post-injection monitoring activities in accordance with the Post-Injection Site Care and Site Closure Plan approved by the UIC Program Director as discussed above under Injection Well Operations. 3 AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT AND IMPACTS This chapter describes the existing physical, biological, cultural, social, and economic conditions within the ROI for the FutureGen 2.0 Project. For each resource area, the chapter describes the ROI, the method of analysis and factors considered, and the potential direct and indirect impacts of the proposed action and the no action alternative in relation to the existing conditions (the baseline). The chapter addresses the potential environmental consequences of actions at the Meredosia Energy The Region of Influence (ROI) defines the extent of the areas where direct effects from construction and operation may be experienced, and it encompasses the areas where indirect effects from the proposed project would most likely occur. Center, the CO2 pipeline corridor, the CO2 storage study area, and the educational facilities, based on the project features described in Chapter 2, Proposed Action and Alternatives. The extent of the ROI varies by resource depending upon the scope of potential impacts on respective resources. For example, Air Quality would have a broader ROI, because air emissions travel many miles, while Physiography and Soils would have a more restrictive ROI, because impacts are more localized to the areas of physical disturbance. This chapterisorganized into subsectionsfor19 resource areas, as listedbelow: • Air Quality(Section3.1) • Climate andGreenhouse Gases (Section3.2) • Physiography and Soils(Section 3.3) • Geology (Section 3.4) • Groundwater(Section 3.5) • Surface Water(Section3.6) • Wetlands and Floodplains (Section3.7) • Biological Resources(Section 3.8) • Cultural Resources (Section3.9) • Land Use(Section 3.10) • Aesthetics (Section3.11) • Materials andWaste Management (Section 3.12) • Traffic and Transportation (Section 3.13) • NoiseandVibration(Section 3.14) • Utilities(Section 3.15) • Community Services (Section 3.16) • Human Health and Safety(Section 3.17) • Socioeconomics (Section 3.18) • Environmental Justice (Section 3.19) Characterization of Potential Impacts Effects of Evolving Project Design As noted at the beginning of Chapter 2, it is important to recognize that the FutureGen 2.0 Project has evolved since it was initially developed in 2011 and will continue to evolve as the Alliance works with local landowners and identifies cost-saving opportunities. Refinements in the final design are expected to affect assumptions relating to the analysis of impacts in this chapter. Examples of potential changes resulting from future refinements include: • The surface footprint for injection well facilities is expected to be smaller than analyzed in the EIS. • The construction of horizontal wells would enable the Alliance to use a single injection well site (although the size of the subsurface CO2 plume is not expected to increase). • The final pipeline route may change slightly; however, the same siting criteria would be employed and it would be sited within the pipeline corridor. Therefore, the preliminary design described in Chapter 2 and analyzed in this EIS is expected to reflect conservative, bounding parameters for critical features, which would not change substantially such that the impacts described in this chapter would be exceeded. Wherever possible, potential impacts associated with the proposed action and the no action alternative are quantified. Where it is not possible to quantify impacts, a qualitative assessment of potential impacts is presented. The following descriptors are used qualitatively to characterize impacts on respective resources: • Beneficial – Impacts would improve or enhancetheresource. • Negligible – No apparent or measurable impacts would be expected; may also be described as “none” if appropriate. • Minor – The action would have a barely noticeable or measurable adverse impact on the resource. • Moderate – The action would have a noticeable or measurable adverse impact on the resource. This category could include potentially significant impacts that would be reduced to a lesser degree bythe implementation of mitigation measures. • Substantial – The action would have obvious and extensive adverse effects that could result in potentiallysignificant impacts on a resource despite mitigation measures. Additionally, impacts may consistof directorindirect effects: • Direct impacts are defined as those caused by the action and occurring at the same time and place. Examples include habitat destruction, soil disturbance, air emissions, and water use. • Indirect impacts are defined as those caused by the action, but occurring later in time or farther removed in distance from the action. Examples include changes in surface water quality resulting from soil erosion, and alteration of wetlands resulting from changes insurface water quantity. Context and Intensity of Impacts Context and intensity are taken into consideration in determining a potential impact’s significance as defined in 40 CFR 1508.27. The context of an impact takes into account the ROI, the affected interests, and the locality. For example, a site-specific action is more likely to have a significant effect on the immediate environment or population within the ROI than on a wider geographic region. However, some aspects, such as GHG emissions, may have implications for a broader geographic area (e.g., global). The intensityof apotential impact referstotheseverityofthe impact andshould consider: • Beneficialand adverse impacts; • Degree of effects onhuman health and safety; • Proximity of, and degree to which actions may adversely impact, protected features or unique characteristics of the geographic area (e.g., protected species and their habitats, cultural resources, wetlands, prime farmland, parklands, wild and scenic rivers); • Levels ofpublic and scientific controversyassociatedwith a project’s impacts; • The degreeof uncertainty about project impacts orrisks; • Whetherthe action establishes a precedent for future actions withsignificanteffects; • Whether related or connected actions have been appropriately considered in the analysis of impacts;and • Whether the action threatens to violate federal, state, or local law, or requirements imposed for protection oftheenvironment. Impact Area Definitions Impact areas in this chapter are generally described as either “permanent” or “temporary.” In addition, a subset of the temporary impact areas would include areas that would be disturbed intermittently for shorter periods oftime during the construction phase. These impact areas are describedas follows: • Permanent impact areas include the areas that would be permanently converted from their prior uses by the FutureGen 2.0 Project. Existing habitat in permanent impact areas would be lost, and replanting as practicable would be consistent with the permanent uses designated for those areas. This would include areas upon which structures or access roads would be built, areas that would be fenced to restrict access, or areas that would be maintained with permanently altered vegetation (e.g., conversion from forest to grassland) after removal of natural vegetation. Locations on the Meredosia Energy Center property that would be altered for the construction of facilities associated with, or supporting, the oxy-combustion process would be permanent impact areas, as would the fenced areas, surface facilities, and access roads for the CO2 injection well site(s). The 50-foot wide operational ROW for the maintenance of the CO2 pipeline would include permanent impact areas where permanent conversion of vegetation and habitat (e.g., forest to grassland) would be necessary; but, agricultural uses could be restored with minimal restrictions. • Temporary impact areas include the areas that would be disturbed throughout the construction phase of the proposed project but subsequently restored to their original state with some potential modifications (e.g., planted trees instead of mature trees) at the end of the construction phase, which could be years after the areas are initially impacted. Uses for the temporary impact areas would include construction laydown areas, construction trailers, parking, and the barge unloading access road at the Meredosia Energy Center. The 80-to 100-foot wide construction ROW for the CO2 pipeline would encompass the 50-foot operational ROW and also include an additional 30-to 50-foot wide temporary impact area to facilitate movement of construction equipment and staging of supplies. Structures associated with temporary impact areas would include fences and construction trailers. Construction parking areas and equipment staging and laydown areas would be cleared, overlaid with a geosynthetic barrier, and surfaced with gravel. Any temporary impact area currently unfenced would be fenced. Temporary impact areas would be restored following completion of construction activities. Restoration would include removal of fencing, gravel, and geosynthetic barriers, as well as re-establishment of vegetation tothe extent practicable. • Barge impact areas include the areas that are expected to be in operation only on the days that a barge would be unloaded. Impacts would be limited to the times when these areas would be utilized during the extended construction phase. Principal Changes Between the Draft and Final EIS Since publication of the Draft EIS, the Alliance continued to develop its conceptual and preliminary design for the oxy-combustion facility, CO2 pipeline, injection wells, and educational facilities. To the extent that updated design information became available after publication of the Draft EIS, DOE updated and refined the analysis of impacts presented in this chapter for each resource area, as appropriate. In cases in which uncertainties remain about project details, DOE considers that the bounding conditions analyzed in the Draft EIS appropriately reflect the upper limits of anticipated impacts. The major changes to DOE’s analysis of impacts are discussed below and tabulated in Table S-1of the Summary. Oxy-Combustion Large Scale Test Initial design plans and air permitting documents for the FutureGen 2.0 Project were based on a 200 MWe system. The Alliance subsequently determined that a 168-MWe capacity system would be more appropriate and revised the design during preparation of the Draft EIS. DOE based its analyses in the Draft EIS on updated project design characteristics reflecting the 168 MWe system for all the project components with the exception of the air quality and GHG analyses. Because the construction air permit application for the 168 MWe system had not yet been prepared, DOEbased its air quality and GHG analyses for the Draft EIS on the prior construction air permit application for the 200 MWe system. Those evaluations provided conservative, upper-bound estimates for potential impacts. Since publication of the Draft EIS, the Alliance prepared and submitted a revised construction permit application in June 2013 for the updated design of the energy center. Accordingly, DOE updated Section 3.1, Air Quality, and Section 3.2, Climate and Greenhouse Gases, in the Final EIS to discuss estimated air emissions basedon the 168MWe design. Further, details related to site grading and site drainage for the FutureGen 2.0 Project at the Meredosia Energy Center were still under development when the Draft EIS was prepared. To assess the potential for physical impacts at the energy center, DOE used a generalized disturbance area map provided by the Alliance and Ameren (see Figure 2-14). That map, presented and analyzed in the Draft EIS, depicts boundaries within which development could occur and thus provides a conservative, upper-bound estimate of potential impacts. Since publication of the Draft EIS, the Alliance refined the energy center site plans in response to ongoing design efforts, and to address concerns from USFWS regarding the amount of forested land that could be cleared for the project. As a result, according to the Alliance’s current plans (see Figure 2-15), the amount of forested acreage that could be lost would likely be substantially lower than the upper bound identified in the Draft EIS (as discussed in Section 2.4.3 and Section 3.8, Biological Resources). Also, the stormwater detention area has been modified to a smaller, more-defined location (as discussed in Section 3.6, Surface Water; and Section 3.7, Wetlands and Floodplains). The following sections in this Chapter maintain the impact analysis presented in the Draft EIS as an upper bound, while also discussing applicable reductions in those impacts based on the Alliance’s current site plans, with substantiallylower impacts to soils, wetlands and floodplains, biological resources, andland use. CO2 Pipeline Routing Options The Alliance originally identified two options for the CO2 pipeline route (southern and northern pipeline alignments) using the criteria listed in Section 2.5.1.1 and best available data. Although the Alliance identified the southern pipeline route as the proposed route, both pipeline routes were carried through the impact analysis in the Draft EIS because together they represented a conservative upper bound for analyzing potential impacts resulting from the construction and operation of the pipeline. Both pipeline routes have been included in the Final EIS for comparative purposes, but the Alliance is nolonger consideringthe northernpipeline route. As the Alliance proceeds with the design of the pipeline along the southern pipeline route, the final pipeline alignment is still subject to change as the Alliance continues to conduct field studies and work with landowners regarding the specific alignment and compensation for the required pipeline rights-of-way. However, the final southern pipeline route is not expected to deviate significantly from the route as identified in this Final EIS and would not be sited outside of the 4-mile wide corridor for the CO2 pipeline. In the event that the Alliance were to find it necessary for the pipeline route to deviate from the southern alignment analyzed in this EIS, it is expected that impacts would be consistent with those addressed in this chapter, because the same siting criteria would be followed in the adjustment of the route. Since the location of the injection wells had not been identified prior to the completion of the Draft EIS, impacts related to the portion of the pipeline traversing through the CO2 storage study area (called end-of-pipeline routes [spurs]) were assessed in the Draft EIS by evaluating a range of reasonable alignment scenarios. In each of the scenarios, the spurs would pass from the western edge of the CO2 storage study area to hypothetical injection well site(s) within the CO2 storage study area. DOE used these hypothetical siting scenarios to evaluate a range of potential impacts, whereby some hypothetical routes would have lesser impacts to physical resources, and others would have greater impacts while still representingreasonable paths. The Alliance subsequently identified the location of the injection well site (as discussed in Section 2.5.2.1) and established pipeline routing from the southern pipeline route to the injection well site. Since the Alliance does not plan to move forward with the northern pipeline route, final routing was not identified from the end of the northern pipeline route to the injection well site. As a result, the impact analysis in the Final EIS compares the impacts of the entire southern pipeline route (from the energy center to the injectionwell site) to the impacts of the northern pipeline, which was conducted byincludingthe hypothetical spurs that were analyzed in the Draft EIS. Injection Well Siting Options The Alliance evaluated several different injection well siting options using both horizontal and vertical wells at one or two injection well sites. After consideration of site-specific data from the stratigraphic well and computer modeling, the Alliance is currently pursuing the option of constructing four horizontal injection wells at a single injection well site. Under this single-site scenario, all four injection wells would originate from one shared well pad and would operate independently of each other. The Alliance proposed this configuration in its Class VI UIC permit applications submitted to the USEPA in March 2013 and subsequently revised in May 2013. The Alliance is no longer considering the dual-site scenariofor injectionwells; however, the configurationof theinjectionwellswill not beconsidered final untilthe UICpermits have beenissued. The subsection for each resource addressing the CO2 storage study area details potential impacts fromthe construction and operation of the injection wells. The resource areas that examine impacts related to land disturbance maintain the analysis from the Draft EIS that analyzes impacts for the dual-site scenario with two injection well sites, since this configuration would have required more land disturbance and is considered the upper bound for land-based impacts analysis. These resource areas include soils, surface water, wetlands and floodplains, biological resources, and land use. Impacts for the other resources are analyzed based on which injection well configuration (one well site or two) represents the upper bound forthe given resource area. Educational Facilities The Alliance originally assumed that one building would house the visitor center and research functions and that a second building (possibly at a separate location) would house the training function. Since the completion of the Draft EIS, the Alliance modified its plans such that the current conceptual designassumes that the visitor, research, and trainingfacilities would be housed in a single building, rather than two separate buildings. However, since design concepts are still in development, the Final EIS evaluates impacts associated with the educational facilities based on the originaland more conservative conceptual designfor multiple educational buildings. Also, as explained in Section 2.5.3, the Alliance has been working with local stakeholders to identify a location or locations for the educational facilities that would be advantageous to the FutureGen 2.0 Project and to the local community. Discussions between the Alliance and Jacksonville civic authorities, after publication of the Draft EIS, have focused on the prospect of locating the educational facilities within a 5-acre parcel in the northeast portion of Jacksonville Community Park. The location is adjacent to West Morton Avenue near the corner of South Main Street on the south side of the Jacksonville downtown area. This location is currently occupied by offices of the Jacksonville Area Chamber of Commerce, which would be demolished and relocated if the site were used. Construction of the educational facilities could disturb a maximum of 3.5 acres but would not affect the existing Ferris wheel near the corner of West Morton Avenue and South Main Street. The Community Park is a landscaped urban park that includes public structures, the Jacksonville Area Senior Center, playgrounds, soccer fields, internal roadways, and parking areas. South Main Street and Morton Avenue both provide access to Jacksonville from I-72, and the parcel is adjacent to all necessary utility infrastructure. The use of this location for the FutureGen 2.0 educational facilities would be subject to review and approval by the Jacksonville City Council. The Jacksonville Community Development Department would be responsible for assessing compatibility and authorizing the use of the site within a Public Activity District as defined by the city’s zoning ordinance. As no decision has been reached with respect to the use of this potential location, the analysis of impacts in the Final EIS remains generally focused on the Jacksonville vicinity. 3.1 AIR QUALITY 3.1.1 Introduction This section provides an overview of the federal and regional air quality regulations, describes existingair quality and air emissions in the region, and presents potential direct and indirect air quality impacts from construction and operationof the FutureGen 2.0 Project. 3.1.1.1 Region of Influence The ROI for air quality includes the Meredosia Energy Center footprint and the West Central Illinois Intrastate Air Quality Control Region (AQCR) 75 as shown in Figure 3.1-1 (i.e., the airshed containing the FutureGen 2.0 Project and adjacent areas). AQCR 75 contains the following counties: Adams, Brown, Calhoun, Cass, Christian, Greene, Jersey, Logan, Macon, Macoupin, Menard, Montgomery, Morgan, Pike, Sangamon, Schuyler, and Scott. The Meredosia Energy Center is located near Meredosia, in Morgan County, Illinois, which is located in west central Illinois along the east side of the Illinois River. The ROI beyond the energy center’s footprint consists mainly of agricultural land used for growing row crops, scattered small communities, and the larger cities of Jacksonville, Springfield, Decatur, and Taylorville. 3.1.1.2 Method of Analysis and Factors Considered DOE analyzed the potential for air quality impacts associated with the proposed construction and operation at the Meredosia Energy Center, CO2 pipeline, injection wells, and educational facilities. DOE based its analysis of construction air quality impacts on calculations of pollutant emissions from construction equipment, trucks and passenger vehicles, and fugitive dust generated at the construction sites. DOE based its analysis of air quality impacts during operation of the project on estimated pollutant emissions, primarily from the combustion process at the oxy-combustion facility, with additional analysis of vehicular emissions, as well as fugitive dust generation related to the cooling towers and the conveyance and transfer ofcoal, ash, lime, and trona. The air quality analysis included modeling of emittedcriteria air pollutants to determine potential changes to ambient air quality in relation to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) (USEPA 2012a). Available ambient air quality data were obtained from monitoring stations in the region and analyzed to derive average regional baseline air concentrations for pollutants of interest. DOE considered thefollowing factors when characterizing existing air quality: • Proximityof monitoringstations tothe project site; • Representativeness of monitoringlocationsrelativetotheproject site; • Availabilityof specific pollutant data; and • Availabilityof the most recent data. DOE evaluated potential air quality impacts using current baseline conditions where the energy center is no longer in operation, as well as using historical baseline conditions prior to the 2011 suspension of operations at the energy center. DOE modeled estimated emissions using regional current data to determine whether projected emissions from operation of the FutureGen 2.0 Project would be significant (e.g., cause or contribute to any regional modeled NAAQS exceedances). DOE also evaluated air quality impacts in comparison to historical data to demonstrate that the FutureGen 2.0 Project would not trigger Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) applicability for significant net emissions increases (see Section 3.1.3.2). DOE assessed the potential for impacts to air quality based on whether the proposed projectwould: Source: IEPA2011a Figure 3.1-1.

Accordingly, USEPA developed primary and secondary ambient air quality standards for six criteria pollutants: sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, lead, and particulate matter. Two current standards for particulate matter have been promulgated: one standard covers particulates with aerodynamic diameters of 10 micrometers or less (PM10), and the other standard covers particulates with aerodynamic diameters of 2.5 micrometers or less (PM2.5). The NAAQS [40 CFR 50] are expressed as concentrations of the criteria pollutants in the ambient air; that is, in the outdoor air to which the public has access. Primary standards are set to protect the public health, including the health of sensitive populations such as asthmatics, children, and the elderly. Secondary standards are set to protect public welfare,including protection against decreased visibility and damage to animals, crops, vegetation, and buildings. Both short-and long-term air quality standards (i.e.,1-, 8-, and 24-hour, and annual averages) have been established for pollutants that can contribute to both acute and chronic healtheffects. Table 3.1-1 lists the NAAQS. Section 110 of the CAA requires states to develop federally-approved regulatory programs, called State Implementation Plans, which provide for the implementation, maintenance, and enforcement of the NAAQS throughout the state. Each state has the authority to adopt standards stricter than those established under the federal program. The intent of the CAA is for states to submit State Implementation Plans that, upon approval by the USEPA, allow the states to regulate air pollution within their borders. These plans must include enforceable emissions limitations, provide for monitoring, and prohibit emissions that would contribute to the nonattainment of a standard. The IEPA Bureau of Air is responsible for implementing the State Implementation Plan (USEPA 2011a), for improving and monitoring air quality in Illinois for each of the criteria pollutants, and for assessing compliance. Additionally, the IEPA Bureau of Air proposes appropriate regulations to the Illinois Pollution Control Board, which promulgates the rules governing ambient air quality in Illinois, under Title 35 Illinois Administrative Code (IAC), Subtitle B, 201 - 291. Federalregulations designate fourcategories for AQCRs or portions of AQCRs (generally by county): • Attainment: Attainment areas meet the NAAQS for a criteria pollutant. These areas are also referred to as being “in attainment”forthat pollutant. • Nonattainment: Nonattainment areas are areas in which a criteria pollutant concentration exceeds the NAAQS. • Unclassifiable: Unclassifiable areas are areas in which insufficient data exist to determine attainment status. Typicallythese areareasthat wouldnot likely have air quality problems. • Maintenance: Maintenance areas were once designated as nonattainment areas but are now in attainment and are underamonitoring plan to maintain their attainment status. Morgan County, Illinois, the county within which the proposed project activities would occur, has been designated by the USEPA as in attainment or unclassifiable for all criteria pollutants (USEPA 2011b; 40 CFR 81). Clean Air Act Conformity The 1990 Amendments to the CAA require federal actions to show conformance with the State Implementation Plan. This requirement is known as the General Conformity Rule. Conformance with the State Implementation Plan means conformity to the approved plan’s purpose of eliminating or reducing the severity and number of violations of the NAAQS, and achieving expeditious attainment of such standards (40 CFR 93). The need to demonstrate conformity is applicable only to actions within nonattainment and maintenance areas. Because all components of the FutureGen 2.0 Project would occur in areas designated in attainment or unclassifiable for the NAAQS, the general conformity rules do not apply.  Table 3.1-1.

To attain this standard, the 3-year average of the weighted annual mean PM2.5 concentrations from single or multiple community-oriented monitors must not exceed the standard. f. The 3-year average of the 98th percentile of 24-hour concentrations at each population-oriented monitor within an area must not exceed 35 µg/m3. g. Nottobe exceeded more than once peryearon average over 3years. h. Final rule signed June 2, 2010.

These standards, however, remain in effect until one year after an area is designated for the 2010 standard, except in areas designated nonattainment for the 1971 standards, where the 1971 standards remain in effect until implementation plans to attain or maintain the 2010 standard are approved. CO = carbon monoxide; mg/m3 = milligram per cubic meter; NAAQS = National Ambient Air Quality Standards; NO2 = nitrogen dioxide; O3=ozone;Pb =lead;PM2.5 =particulate matter ofdiameter 2.5 microns or less;PM10=particulate matter of diameter 10 microns or less; ppm = partsper million; SO2 =sulfurdioxide;µg/m3 = microgramper cubic meter Illinois Air Monitoring Network Illinois has a network of air monitoring stations strategically placed throughout the state, composed of instrumentation owned and operated by both the IEPA and by cooperating local agencies. This networkis designed to measure ambient air quality levels in the various Illinois AQCRs, using both continuous and intermittent instruments. Figure 3.1-2 shows the location of the air monitoring stations in Illinois with respecttothe location of the MeredosiaEnergy Center and the potential CO2 injection wells. Sources: IEPA2010a; IEPA2011a Figure 3.1-2. Illinois Air Monitoring Sites Air Quality Index Another measure of air quality utilized by the USEPA and the IEPA is the Air Quality Index (AQI), which is a human health-based measure of overall air quality that takes into account all of the criteria pollutants measured within an area. As shown in Table 3.1-2, an AQI value of 50 or less is considered “good” air quality; 51-100 is considered “moderate”; 101-150 is considered unhealthy for sensitive groups; and values of 151 or higher range from “unhealthy” to “very unhealthy” to “hazardous” (IEPA 2011a). Table 3.1-2.

Based on the size of the emissions units and type of pollutants emitted (criteria pollutants or HAPs), the Illinois Pollution Control Board sets permit rules and standards for emissions sources. Construction Permits The air quality permitting process begins with the application for a construction permit. For attainment areas, there are two types of construction permits available through the IEPA for the construction and temporary operation of new emissions sources, includingthefollowing: • PSD new source review permits, which are required for major new sources or major sources making major modifications; and • Minor new source review construction permits, which are required for new minor sources or existing major sources making minor modifications. Sources subject to PSD are typically required to complete best available control technology review for criteria pollutants, predictive modeling of emissions from proposed and existing sources, and public involvement activities. PSD preconstruction review and permitting applies on a pollutant by pollutant basis to construction of new “major sources” and to modifications at existing major sources. Major sources are defined under PSD as sources listed in any of 28 named source categories whose potential to emit is greater than 100 tons per year of any regulated pollutant; or if not in a listed source category, a source whose potential to emit any regulated pollutant is greater than 250 tons per year. Fossil fuel-fired steam electric plants with greater than 250 million Btu per hour of heat input are a named source category under PSD. Modifications at existing major sources are subject to PSD if the increase in air emissions from the modification exceeds any of the significant increase thresholds in Table 3.1-3 and the “net emissions increase” also exceeds any of the significant increase thresholds. Net emissions increases are determined by summing all increases and decreases resulting from a project with all contemporaneous emissions increases and decreases at the source. Minor source permitting applies to any construction of a new source or modification at an existing source where PSD permitting does not apply. Minor source permitting is required under state regulation and does not require sources to determine and implement best available control technologies or other PSD requirements. Table 3.1-3.

Deterioration of existing air quality levels is limited by the amount of additional pollutant concentration that is allowed to increase above a baseline concentration. The allowable increased concentration for each pollutant and the averaging period are referred to as the allowable PSD increments. The allowable air emissions increment limits are dependent on the land-use classification of the area. There are three area classifications. Each classification differs in terms of the amount of growth it would permit before significant air quality deterioration would be deemed to occur. Class I areas have the smallest increments and thus allow only a small degree of air quality deterioration. Class II areas can accommodate normal well-managed industrial growth. Class III areas have the largest increments and thereby provide for a larger amount of development than either Class I or Class II areas. Congress established certain areas (e.g., wilderness areas and national parks) as mandatory Class I areas (40 CFR 51.166(e); NPS 2011). Table 3.1-4 presents the maximum allowable increase in pollutant concentration above a baseline concentration for each of the Class area designations. Table 3.1-4.

Both are located more than 180 miles from the Meredosia EnergyCenter, which exceeds the distance within which USEPA typicallyrequires Class Iarea protection provisions (i.e., a distance of 62 miles [100 kilometers]). Because of this distance, air quality impacts to Class I areas are not expected from the FutureGen 2.0 Project; therefore, effects to Class I areas are not discussed further in this air quality analysis. All air regions within the ROI of the FutureGen 2.0 Project are designated Class IIareas, with moderate pollution increases allowed. Operating Permits Under state and federal Title V (CAA Permit Program) regulations, a Title V Significant Permit Modification is required for facilities whose increase in emissions exceeds the thresholds outlined in Table 3.1-3. In addition, a Significant Permit Modification would be required if it became necessary to establish federally-enforceable limitations to reduce potential emissions below the thresholds. A minor permit modification would be required if emissions were below the thresholds and afederally-enforceable limit was not necessary. Submission of an application for these permit modifications would be required withinone year of the firstoperation of a newemissions source. The Title V permit ensures that a plant’s emissions are in compliance with all federal CAA and state regulations. When the state issues a Title V permit, it assures that the permit includes sufficient monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements such that compliance with all relevant air quality standards andregulationscan be determined, and thus satisfies the Illinois State Implementation Plan. The Meredosia Energy Center Title V OperatingPermit (called a CAA Permit Program permit in Illinois) was originally issued in September 2005 but was appealed to the Illinois Pollution Control Board by Ameren. As a result of the appeal, Ameren was granted a stay of the permit and the permit never took effect. Ameren is currently in negotiation with the IEPA to resolve the issues identified in the appeal of the permit so that a Title V Operating Permit can be put into effect. Until the appeal is resolved and the stayis lifted bythe IllinoisPollution Control Board, IEPA cannot modifythe TitleVOperatingPermit. Also under the CAA Permit Program, the facility would be required to meet the requirements of Title IV, the Acid Rain Permit Program (40 CFR 72) that establishes limitations on sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides emissions,and requirements for permitting, monitoring, reporting, and compliance. Other Requirements In addition to the permitting requirements to construct and operate new or modified emissions sources, New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) (40 CFR 60) and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs) (40 CFR 63) set emissions and control standards for categories of stationary emissions sources of both criteria pollutants (i.e., NSPS) and HAPs (i.e., NESHAPS). The NSPS are promulgated by USEPA for criteria pollutant emissions from new, modified, and reconstructed sources in certain source categories. NESHAPs are emissions standards for HAPs from both existing and new sources from certain source categories. This program sets uniform emissions limitations for many industrial sources such as boilers and stand-by generators. On February 16, 2012, USEPA issued a NESHAP and NSPS applicable to coal-fired electric utility steam generating units. Parts of these rules related to startup and shutdown, and monitoring provisions were stayed until USEPA completes a reconsideration review of these rules.1 Other relevant requirements of the CAA include the Chemical Accident Prevention Act (40 CFR 68) that requires development of a risk management plan for stationary sources having more than threshold quantities of regulated toxic and flammable chemicals; and the Compliance Assurance Monitoring Rule (40 CFR 64) that requires monitoring and reporting of operation and maintenance of emissions control devices to assure compliance with emissions standards. See Chapter 5, Regulatory and Permit Requirements, for further descriptions oftheseprovisions. 3.1.2 Affected Environment 3.1.2.1 Meredosia Energy Center Existing Air Quality for Morgan County The Meredosia Energy Center is located in Morgan County, Illinois, in the west central part of the state, approximately 48 miles west of Springfield. The majority of Morgan County consists of agricultural land used for growing row crops, scattered small communities such as Meredosia, and the larger town of Jacksonville. There are a total of seven major or synthetic minor sources permitted in Morgan County, including: Ach Food Company Inc., AGI North America LLC, Ameren Energy Generating Company, Celanese, Jacksonville Developmental Center, Panhandle Easter Pipeline Company, and United Gilsonite Laboratories (USEPA 2011c). Other potential sources of air pollution would include sources in neighboring counties as well as activities, including vehicular traffic, in nearby towns of Jacksonville and Springfield. The IEPA Bureau of Air operates monitoring sites throughout the state that are used to monitor ambient air quality and determine whether areas or regions comply with all of the NAAQS. No ambient air monitoring stations are maintained by USEPA or IEPA in Morgan County. The ambient air quality monitoring stations within an approximate 50-mile radius are located in Adams, Jersey, Macoupin, and Sangamon counties, all within the West Central Illinois Intrastate AQCR 75. The pollutants measured by these monitoring stations include ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, lead, PM10, and PM2.5. No ambient monitoring stations for nitrogen dioxideexist withinAQCR 75. DOE performed a review of monitoring stations for each pollutant to determine average existing air quality data for the project region. Based on their location within the same AQCR and their relative 1 This rule is also known as the UtilityMaximum Achievable Control Technology(MACT) rule. proximity to the energy center, the Quincy (Adams County), Jerseyville (Jersey County), Nilwood (Macoupin County), and Springfield (Sangamon County) monitors were determined to be most appropriate for use in setting the background concentrations for all pollutants except nitrogen dioxide. For nitrogen dioxide, the St. Genevieve County, Missouri, location was chosen based upon its representativeness to the site as compared to the nitrogen dioxide monitoring locations in Illinois, which are locatedinthe major metropolitan areas of Cook County (metropolitan Chicago) and EastSt. Louis. Table 3.1-5 presents a listingof these stations andFigure 3.1-2 shows their locations.Table 3.1-6 presents average regional monitoring data for each criteria pollutant. Concentrations are presented for the closest monitoring station(s) that measures that particular pollutant. If multiple monitoring stations are nearly equidistant from the Meredosia Energy Center, the concentrations from these monitoring stations are averaged. Because localized ambient air quality depends on many factors, such as location and types of source emissions and air mixing patterns, these average regional data shown in Table 3.1-6 may not be truly reflective of actual air quality in and around the Meredosia Energy Center. These estimates serve to represent general regional air quality and were not used in the emissions modeling discussed in Section 3.1.3.2. Ameren obtained background concentrations from IEPA for emissions modeling. All measured pollutantlevelsfor the Morgan County region are currently (2010)below the NAAQS primarystandards. Table 3.1-5.

There were no recorded days with an unhealthy AQI (IEPA 2011a). However, it must be noted that this AQI for metropolitan Springfield is not necessarily representative for the ROI around the rural region of Meredosia. Table 3.1-6.

As discussed in Section 2.4.1, energy center operations were suspended at the end of 2011; therefore, the information and data presented in this section are based on configuration and operations before the energy center suspended operation. The energy center includes four generating units (Units 1 through 4), which were supplied with steam from six boilers. Boilers1 through 5 were coal-fired; Boiler 6 was oil-fired. Boiler 6 was the only boiler located outside and not enclosed within a building. Units 1 and 2 (Boilers 1, 2, 3, and 4) operations were suspended on November 9, 2009. Unit 3 (Boiler 5) and Unit 4 (Boiler 6) operations were suspended on January 1, 2012. The environmental permits for all these sources are currentlyactive.Unit 3has a nominal-rated generatingcapacity of 229 MWe (203 MWe net). Unit 4 was placed in service in 1975 and has a generating capacity of 210 MWe (166 MWe net). The six boilers are served by three emissions stacks. A combined stack serving Boilers 1, 2, 3 and 4 (Units 1 and 2) is the tallest at 526 feet; the stackservingUnit3 is 301feet tall; and the stack serving Unit 4 is 184 feet tall. Table3.1-7 presents the reported stackemissions for 4 years ofoperation (2007 through 2010) prior to the suspension of operations atthe energycenter at the end of 2011. The energycenteralsogenerated indirect emissions due to mobile sources, including onsite coal and ash handling equipment; trucks, train locomotives, and tugboats used to deliver and remove materials and waste from the property; as well as privately-owned vehicles used byworkers. Table 3.1-7.

Some of the liquid water evaporates, and some becomes entrained in the air stream and is carried out of the tower as “drift” droplets. Since water droplets generally contain the same dissolved solids as the water circulating in the tower, these solids can be carried out of the tower in the drift. When the drift droplets evaporate before being deposited, they produce particulate matter emissions (USEPA 1995a). Historical operations of the Meredosia Energy Center used a cooling tower to cool the water used in the electrical generation process in Unit 4. Mechanical draft cooling towers can produce some adverse environmental effects due to the liquid water plume coming directly from the tower (drift), as well as from the secondary liquid water formation caused by the condensation of water vapor (“fogging”). These adverse effects include: fogging at ground level and ice build-up, deposition of dissolved salt particles, and local shading ofthesun due to a visible plume (Holzman 2010). In 2010, the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) evaluated proposed alternative alignments for IL-104 over the Illinois River in the vicinity of the Meredosia Energy Center. As part of their Environmental Assessment, IDOT analyzed the impacts of cooling tower emissions from the Meredosia Energy Center. One of the alternatives (Alternative #9) in this study involved constructing a new bridge across the Illinois River landing approximately 700 feet north of the Unit 4 cooling tower at the Meredosia Energy Center (IDOT2011). As part of the impact analysis, IDOT evaluated the potential for fogging, icing, and other impacts to the proposed bridge resulting from operations of the existing cooling tower. IDOT conducted dispersion modeling analysis using the Seasonal/Annual Cooling Tower Impact (SACTI) model (Version11-01-90) to evaluate the following impacts (Holzman 2010): • Frequency of occurrence of cooling tower plume heights, plume lengths, and plume radii; • Frequency of occurrence and special distribution of ground-level fogging and rime ice deposition; • Special distribution and rate of salt deposition; and • Frequency and extent of plume shadowing effects. Although the cooling tower at the Meredosia Energy Center did not operate during winter months (since Unit 4 was only used as a summer peaking unit), the SACTI model analysis assumed the cooling tower operated 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, 365 days per year. The IDOT assessment concluded that continuous operation of the cooling tower at the Meredosia Energy Center would have generated fog and rime icing impacts predominantly downwind to the southeast of the tower. The maximum hours of fogging in any one location were estimated by SACTI to be 15.4 hours per year on average, with the maximum occurring at 200 meters, extending to a maximum distance of approximately 900 meters to the southeast. SACTI predicted less than 1 hour of fogging per year to the northwest. The maximum hours of rime icing were estimated to be 6 hours per year on average, with the maximum occurring 200 meters downwind to the southeast of the tower. At 700 feet north of the Unit 4 cooling tower (proposed bridge location), fog and rime ice were projected to occur only 1 hour over a 5-year period, and salt and water deposition could occur when the cooling tower was operating. Plume shadowing and related solar energy loss were not shown to be significant (Holzman 2010). 3.1.2.2 CO2 Pipeline, CO2 Storage Study Area, and Educational Facilities The existing ambient air quality for Morgan County is discussed under Section 3.1.2.1. The region around and within the pipeline corridor from the energy center to the CO2 storage study area consists mainly of agricultural land used for growing row crops, scattered small communities, and the larger town of Jacksonville. The area within the CO2 storage study area is also predominantly agricultural. The croplands in these regions are not highly susceptible to wind erosion and, most of the time, would not present a source of wind-blown particulates or dust. However, cultivation and tilling of the soil may cause some dust suspension or render the soil more susceptible to wind erosion for short periods of time. The educationalfacilities are expectedto be located inor nearJacksonville. 3.1.3 Impacts of Proposed Action 3.1.3.1 Construction Impacts DOE estimated potential emissions associated with construction of the oxy-combustion facility, the CO2 pipeline, the injection wells, and the educational facilities by considering the likely construction equipment and operating schedules, estimated area and duration of land disturbance, estimated number of construction worker vehicle trips, and truck trips for material deliveries and waste removal. DOE estimated the constructionemissions usingUSEPA models and methods: • Construction Equipment Emissions: estimated tailpipe emissions from the variety of internal combustion equipment using USEPA’s NONROAD model (USEPA 2008a, USEPA 2010a) based on the equipment type (horsepower) and hours of operation. • Vehicle Emissions: estimated tailpipe emissions from worker vehicles and delivery trucks traveling to and from the sites using USEPA’s Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES) model (USEPA 2012b)based on the vehicle types andmiles traveled. • Fugitive Dust Emissions: estimated fugitive dust emissions resulting from excavation, soil storage and handling, traffic over unpaved onsite roads, and earthwork, using standard USEPA methods (USEPA 1995a; USEPA 2005a; USEPA 2005b). The construction emissions for each of the various project components (energy center, pipeline, injection wells, and educational facilities) are presented separately below, followed by a collective tabulation and discussion of total construction emissions and their impacts. Emissions of CO2 during construction are presented and discussed in Section 3.2, Climate andGreenhouse Gases. Meredosia Energy Center The FutureGen 2.0 Project would involve the construction of an advanced oxy-combustion facility at the Meredosia Energy Center. The construction would includeinstallation of new FutureGen 2.0 components, new access roads, as well as improvements to the existing coal handling, process water and wastewater, and electrical and control systems, as describedin Section 2.4. Conventional construction methods would be used. The construction of the oxy-combustion facility would take place over approximately 42 months beginning in 2014 and extending through the middle of 2017, with the peak in number of construction workers occurring between June through December of 2015. The last 12 months of construction would overlap with a 1-year commissioning and startup effort. The Alliance developed a list of estimated construction equipment required, and hours of operation of each, along with the anticipated amount of gasoline or diesel that each piece would consume. Based on these assumptions, DOE calculated the total criteria pollutant emissions resulting from construction activities at the Meredosia Energy Center. DOE also calculated the tailpipe emissions from the worker vehicles and delivery and waste trucks that would be associated with project construction (see Section 3.13, Traffic and Transportation, for discussion of vehicle traffic). Table 3.1-8 presents these estimated emissionsresulting from construction ofthe oxy-combustion facilityatthe Meredosia EnergyCenter. Table 3.1-8.

Capture fraction for agricultural areas is 0.25 (USEPA2005a). e. The values presented in this table for fugitive dust emissions are based on the upper bound assumptions assumed in the Draft EIS reflecting a total impact area of 164 acres (as presented in Figure 2-14), during an average disturbance of 6 months. The Alliance’s current plan assumes a reduced impact area of 114 acres, as shown in Figure 2-15, which could result in fugitive dust emissions of PM10 = 369 tons and PM2.5 = 28 tons. It is not expected that land disturbance would cover the entire impact area, and the 6-month duration ofdisturbanceat anyonelocation isaconservativeestimate,asmost areas would be intermittentlydisturbed for shorter durations. f. Vehicle emissions calculated using the USEPA MOVES model, version 2010b (USEPA 2012b).

Construction of the pipeline and ROW would be accomplished with typical construction methods, within a construction easement of 80 to 100 feet wide depending on the terrain. Construction would involve clearing and grading, trenching, pipe stringing, welding and coating the pipe, lowering the pipe into trench and backfilling, testing, and land restoration. Some of the pipeline corridor would be within existing utility or highway ROWs, such that clearing and grading would not be necessary. However, for the purposes of impact analysis, DOE took a conservative approach in estimating construction emissions by assuming that any particular section of the ROW would be disturbed for approximately 2 months total, as the construction progressed along the pipeline length. Additionally, DOE assumed that all portions of pipeline construction would involve clearing and grading. DOE estimates that construction of the pipeline from the Meredosia Energy Center to the injection wells would take approximately 4 to 5 months. Pipeline construction would require up to approximately 300 workersthroughout the whole construction project, with varying schedules and locations. DOE calculated tailpipe emissions originating from the construction equipment, as well as fugitive dust emissions generated from mechanical disturbance of the surface and excavated material. DOE also calculatedthe tailpipe emissions fromthe worker vehiclesandthe deliveryand wastetrucks that would be associated with the project construction (see Section 3.13, Traffic and Transportation, for discussion of vehicle traffic). Table 3.1-9 summarizes the calculated estimated emissions for construction of the CO2 pipeline totheinjectionwells. Table 3.1-9.

DOE calculated exhaust emissions originating from the construction and drilling equipment, as well as the fugitive dust emissions generated in the construction area. DOE calculated the potential emissions assuming deep injection (and monitoring) wells would require drilling operations 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for 100 days; and shallow monitoring wells would require drilling operations 9 hours per day for 3 days. Other equipment used in construction of the injection well site(s) would include tractors, excavators, bulldozers, pumps, diesel generators, service vehicles, anddeliveryvehicles. DOE calculated tailpipe emissions originating from the construction equipment, as well as fugitive dust emissions generated from mechanical disturbance of the surface and excavated material. DOE also calculatedthe tailpipe emissions fromthe worker vehiclesandthe deliveryand waste trucks that would be associated with the project construction (see Section 3.13, Traffic and Transportation, for discussion of vehicle traffic). Table 3.1-10 summarizes the calculated emissions for construction of the injection wells and associated site buildings and access roads basedonthe most conservative injection-site scenario. Table 3.1-10.

Assumptions are based on the single-site scenario currently proposed by the Alliance, which would be the most conservative scenario regarding number of wells and drilling durations. The single-site scenario would include four deep injection wells, five deep monitoring wells (drilling 24 hours per day for 100 days), and three shallowwells (drillingfor 9 hours per day for 3 days). b. Emissions factors are derived for construction equipment using NONROAD 2008a, USEPA emissions model, assuming average values for Morgan County (USEPA 2008a), and load factors (fraction of available power) from USEPA 2010a. NONROAD total PM calculation is PM10 value. PM2.5 isassumed to be97 percent of PM10 for exhaust (USEPA2010b). c. Fugitive dust emissions estimates are calculated using the dual-site scenario described in the Draft EIS and no longer under consideration by the Alliance, which would be the most conservative scenario regarding land disturbance. Estimates are based on total approximate land disturbance of 90 acres for injection and monitoring wells and associated facilities including access roads, during an average disturbance of 3.3 months (100 days). Total suspended particles = 1.2 tons/acre/month (USEPA2012cAP-42, 13.2.3.3). PM10 is45 percent of total suspended particles (USAF 2003; USEPA 1995a).

These facilities could involve new construction, rehabilitation of existing structures, or a combination. Because the location and configuration of these buildings are currently undecided, DOE estimated emissions based on the most conservative scenario, which would be construction of new facilities. DOE calculated tailpipe emissions originating from the construction equipment, emissions from worker and delivery vehicles, as well as fugitive dust emissions generated from mechanical disturbance of the surface and excavated material. Table 3.1-11 summarizes the calculated emissions for construction of the educationalfacilities. Table 3.1-11.

DOE believes that these calculated total emissions overestimate actual potential emissions. Because Morgan County is in attainment for all criteria pollutants, CAA conformity requirements are not applicable, and thus there are no construction emissions thresholds that pertain to the construction phase of this project. Emissions fromconstruction activities would be short term in nature, and would be expected to have only a minor impact on local air quality. These emissions would be concentrated at the construction sites and would steadily decrease with distance. Fugitive dust emissions consisting of larger particulates would be greatest during land-disturbance activities and would generally deposit within several hundred feet of the construction areas. Construction equipment and vehicles that operate on diesel fuel produce exhaust that has been associated with several health-related concerns, particularly from emissions of particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, and HAPs. Diesel exhaust is a complex mixture of hundreds of constituents in either a gas or particle form resulting from the complete and incomplete combustion of fuel and small amounts of engine oil. Pollutant concentrations from diesel emissions during construction of the FutureGen 2.0 Project would be concentrated at the construction sites and would decrease with distance. DOE anticipates the resultant adverse impacts would be minor, as the construction duration is short term, and the sites are not in direct proximity to sensitive populations or at locations with severe existing pollutant concentrations such thatthe project wouldcontribute toa cumulative impact. Construction-related emissions would be further reduced with the implementation of industry standard BMPs, including control of vehicle speeds, minimizing or stabilizing exposed areas to reduce wind erosion, wetting of exposed areas and roads with water or appropriate surfactants, reducing or eliminating equipmentidling time, and using properly maintained equipment. Table 3.1-12.

The purpose of the proposed project would be to establish a coal-fired electrical generating facility that uses oxy-combustion technology and state-of-the-art flue gas scrubbing technology to minimize criteria pollutants, as well as capture at least 90 percent of the GHGs that would otherwise be emitted during normal steady-state operations. Emissions Analysis This section describes the FutureGen 2.0 Project’s environmental impacts using emissions calculations and analysis for both the current baseline conditions with the energy center no longer in operation, as well as using historical baseline conditions prior to the 2011 suspension of operations of the energy center. In addition to emissions from the oxy-combustion boiler and compression and purification unit, emissions would also be generated by the auxiliary boiler, the emergency diesel generator, as well as fugitive emissions from conveyance and transfer of the process materials and waste (coal, ash, lime, and trona), cooling towers, and truck traffic on the haul roads. Table 3.1-13 lists the units associated with the project and whether these units arenew or existing. Initial design plans and air permitting documents for the FutureGen 2.0 Project were based on a 200 MWe system. The Alliance subsequently determined that a 168-MWe capacity system would be more appropriate and revised the design during preparation of the Draft EIS. Because the constructionair permit applicationfor the 168MWe system had not yet been prepared,DOEbased its air quality analysis for the Draft EISon the prior constructionair permit applicationfor the 200 MWe system (Ameren 2012). That evaluation provided a conservative, upper-bound estimate for potential impacts. Since publication of the Draft EIS, the Alliance prepared and submitted a revised construction permit application in June 2013 for the updated design of the energy center (Ameren 2013). Accordingly, DOE updated this Air Quality section in the Final EIS to discuss estimatedair emissions basedonthe 168 MWe design. Table 3.1-14 presents a summary of the estimated (upper-bound) project emissions for the oxycombustion facility, operating at 168 MWe as presented in the construction permit application to the IEPA in June 2013 (Ameren 2013). These estimated emissionswere reported in the construction permit application to demonstrate that FutureGen 2.0 would not trigger PSD applicability for significant net emissions increases (as shown in Table 3.1-20). The estimated emissions were based on the conservative assumption that the energy center would operate 8,760 hours per year and with worst-case emissions rates for the three representative operating conditions evaluated (air firing, oxy-combustionwith storage, oxy-combustion without CO2 storage). Table 3.1-13.

This worst-case scenario is analyzed for permitting purposes only, and does not reflect the Alliance’s anticipated project plans (see Section2.4.4.1for discussionon the deliveryofcoal). c. The data in this table reflecta generating capacity of 168 MWe as presented in the June 2013 constructionpermit application (Ameren 2013). d. The emissions data presented in this table represent scenarios presented in the construction permit application (Ameren 2013). Project emissionsarebased on continuousoperation (8,760 hours per year)and conservatively highhourly emissions rates. e. These emissionsare for stationary source emissions. Note: This table was replaced in its entirety (from the Draft EIS version) to reflect the updated design of 168 MWe and revised construction permit application (Ameren 2013). CO = carbon monoxide; EGU = electrical generating unit; NOx = nitrogen oxides; PM2.5 = particulate matter of diameter 2.5 microns or less; PM10 = particulate matter of diameter 10 microns or less; PSD = Prevention of Significant Deterioration; SO2 = sulfur dioxide; tpy = tons per year; VOCs = volatile organic compounds It is important to note that the emissions levels presented in Table 3.1-14 are part of the PSD applicability analysis presented in the construction permit application, and are not normal or allowable emissions levels. These estimates are considerably greater than actual emissions during normal operations, because the oxy-combustion facility would also be subject to NSPS and NESHAP regulatory limits. Further, the data is based on the auxiliary boiler operating 8,760 hours per year during startup, when in reality, the operations design assumes only 240 hours of auxiliary boiler operation annually after the first year of operation. During normal operations (as described in Section 2.4.2.1), the flue-gas, upon exiting the boiler, would enter the gas quality control system, which comprises numerous steps designed to remove pollutants, recover heat, and prepare the flue gas before entering the compression and purification unit. The gas quality control system would incorporate processes to reduce criteria pollutants to low levels. Table 3.115 presents select pollutant emissions during normal operating conditions based on the 168 MWe design assuming an 85 percent operating capacity. Emissions would be higher during startup, in the case of a compression and purification unit or pipeline malfunction, and during shutdown. However, these conditions are expected to be rare as NSPS and NESHAP requirements would not allow for the FutureGen 2.0 Project to operate under these conditions for extended periods. Designers anticipate minimal HAPs emissions during normal operations. See Section 3.2, Climate and Greenhouse Gases, for further discussion on CO2 and other GHG air emissions from the proposed project. Table 3.1-15.

Expected annual operating conditions assumes the CPU (processing flue gas from the oxy-combustion boiler) operating at a maximum capacity for 7,446 hours per year; the oxy-combustion boiler operating in air-fire mode without the CPU for 240 hours per year; and 240 hours in oxycombustion transition annually. Estimates include emissions from the oxy-combustionboiler, the CPU, the auxiliary boiler, and the various material-handling units that support these operations. b. SeeSection 3.2,Climate andGreenhouse Gases,for discussion of CO2-eq.

Emissions fromthe newstack would have different plume velocity and buoyancy characteristics and thus its resultant air pollution dispersion characteristics would be different from those generated by the Meredosia Energy Center prior to suspension of operations at the end of 2011. Air dispersion modeling, usingUSEPA’s model AERMOD, was performed to assess the potential air quality impacts of the proposed project and demonstrate compliance with the NAAQS (Ameren 2013). The emissions modeling was based on the 168 MWe design of the oxy-combustion boiler, and assumed that all existing boilers would be decommissioned, and that the new auxiliary boiler could befully utilized.Modeling included four distinct operating conditions: • Model Condition 1: The boiler operates using ambient air for combustion, and the energy center requires the use of an auxiliary boiler for steam. • Model Condition 2: Normal full-load oxy-combustion operation of the new boiler and CPU. The CO2 stream is transported through pipeline and sequestered. The noncondensable CPU streamis vented tothe atmosphere. Theauxiliaryboiler is not operational. • Model Condition 3: Normal full-load oxy-combustion operation of the new boiler, including normal CPU processingflue gas, but the CO2 stream is vented to the atmosphere alongwith the noncondensablestream. The auxiliary boiler isnot operational. • Model Condition 4: An intermediate operation in which the new boiler has transitioned from air combustion to oxy-combustion, but it has not reached full load, nor is the CPU fully operational. The auxiliary boileris not operational. The first step in the modeling exercise was to determine if the proposed project components could generate ambient air quality impacts that would exceed the significant impact levels (SILs) established by the USEPA, as shown in Table 3.1-16. Air quality impacts at or below the SIL are considered de minimis in nature. Table 3.1-17 lists the highest modeled concentrations for these model conditions, and whether they cause a significant impact. If the ambient air qualityimpacts associated with the project emissions were found to be greater than the SILs for any pollutant, a cumulative impacts assessment was performedforthose pollutantsand model conditions. Table 3.1-16.

Table 3.1-18 lists the highest cumulative impacts and NAAQS for each modeled pollutant. This cumulative assessment included modeling emissions from the proposed project combined with other significant sources and background concentrations provided by IEPA (Ameren 2013) to provide a cumulative ambient air impact concentration. The analysis showed that modeled cumulative concentrationsofcertain pollutantsexceeded the NAAQS. To determine if the FutureGen 2.0 Project would contribute to the NAAQS exceedances, DOE performed a significant contribution analysis. If the cumulative concentration exceeds the NAAQS at a receptor, then the project’s contribution at that receptor, at the time of the modeled exceedance, is compared to the SIL. Contributions below the SIL are considered de minimis, and indicate that the proposed projectwould notsignificantly contributeto a violation of the NAAQS. Table 3.1-19 shows the FutureGen 2.0 Project’s maximum contribution to any modeled exceedances for each model condition and pollutant. The analysis shows that the FutureGen 2.0 Project would not significantly contribute to any of the modeled exceedances because none of the FutureGen 2.0 Project contributions were above the SILs when a NAAQS exceedance occurred, with the exception of 24-hour PM2.5 in model condition 1. There are nine receptors for which the contribution of the auxiliary boiler exceeds this threshold. The oxy-combustion boiler’s contribution is less than 1 percent of the total. Based upon alternative evaluation modeling, the Alliance has determined that this contribution would be lowered below the threshold through the use of a more specific and accurate emissions factor based on the actual equipment chosen for the project and adjustment of the stack height, if required. Therefore, operations of the FutureGen 2.0 Project would be unlikely to significantly contributeto any modeled NAAQS exceedance (Ameren 2013). Table 3.1-18.

In its air permit application with the state of Illinois, the Meredosia Energy Center would be taking credit for contemporaneous emissions decreases resulting from the permanent shutdown of all boilers at the energy center that would take place once FutureGen 2.0 becomes operational. Overall, the net emissions of the Meredosia Energy Center would decrease in comparison to historical emissions rates. PSD permits are required if net emissions from a project exceed the threshold limits. Net emissions increase is defined in 40 CFR 52.21(b)(3)(i)as “… the amount by which the sum of thefollowing exceeds zero: (a) The increase in emissions from a particular physical change or change in the method of operation at a stationary source … and (b) Any other increases and decreases in actual emissions at the major stationary source that are contemporaneous with the particular change and are otherwise creditable…” Net emissions were calculated in comparison to Contemporaneous emissions are used to “contemporaneous” operations of the energy center, which used determine if a PSD permit is required. two years of emissions levels within a five-year period prior to Contemporaneous changes in emissions are any the start of construction for the proposed project. Based on the increases or decreases in emissions that occur during any 2-year (24-month) period within the projected start of construction for the FutureGen 2.0 Project, the 5 years prior to the start of construction. emissions sources at the Meredosia Energy Center that would have contemporaneous emissions changes include the installation of an emergency diesel generator in November 2008 under IEPA Permit No. 08100029, the shutdown of the six existing boilers, and the proposed demolition of the existing Unit 4 cooling tower. Boilers 1 through 4 suspended service on November 9, 2009. Boilers 5 and 6 were suspended on January1, 2012. Operating permits for the existing boilers held by Ameren remain in effect, but were suspended by the Illinois Pollution Control Board pending resolution of an Ameren appeal. Under the Illinois Pollution Control Board rules, the facility may continue to operate under its previous operating permit until such time as the appeal process is resolved. Table 3.1-20 presents the total projected energy center emissions, the decrease in emissions due to the 2011 suspension of operations at the energy center, and the net change in emissions from pre-suspension historical conditions. As shown, the project would not result in net emissions greater than the PSD significance threshold (per40 CFR 52.21(b)(23)(i)) and, therefore, the project would not be subject to the PSD regulations. However, because the project would include the construction of new emissions units, a state construction permit would be required. As discussed above, these emissions changes are based on the conservative assumptions used in the construction permit application, whereby normal operations would only occur approximately 50 percent of the time (with the remaining periods consisting of startup, compression and purification unit or pipeline malfunctions, or shutdown scenarios, when the oxy-combustion and optimal flue-gas scrubbing would not be occurring). During normal operations, the system is designed for near-zero emissions levels as shown in Table 3.1-15.  Cooling Tower Impacts The oxy-combustion facility would have three separate cooling water loops and associated cooling towers. These are the main cooling tower, the cooling tower for both the air separation unit and compression and purification unit, and the cooling tower for the direct contact cooler polishing system. In order to assess the potential for impacts of vapor plumes fromthe proposed cooling towers, DOE used the 2010 IDOT Environmental Assessment of the Alternative #9 bridge location (see Section 3.1.2.1) as an analog for the analysis. This IDOT study reflects potential impacts of the historical cooling tower operations at the Meredosia Energy Center (assuming the cooling tower operated continuously year-round) on a potential bridge location approximately 700 feet upstream of the energy center (IDOT 2011).  Table 3.1-20.

As shown in the table, the new Unit 4 main cooling tower would be similar in size and water flow rate (85,000 gpm) to the historical main cooling tower (85,500 gpm). The combined water flow rate of all three proposed cooling towers would be an estimated 119,250 gpm, or approximately 39 percent higher than the historical cooling tower flow rate. However, the two smaller cooling towers would be physically separated from the new main cooling tower by more than 700 feet to the southeast. Vapor plumes generated from these towers would be expected to be substantially smaller than the plume generated by the main cooling tower, and would not be expected to contribute to any offsite impacts. DOE expects that the vapor plume generated by the proposed new main cooling tower would be similar to thehistorical plume estimated bythe SACTI model in the IDOT study (described in Section 3.1.2.1), whereby there may be fog and ice impacts for approximately 15.4 hours and 6 hours per year, respectively, to the southeast of the energy center (Holzman 2010). The IDOT study concluded that potential impacts from the historical vapor plume to the Alternative #9 bridge alignment would not be significant, and would be even less significant on the Alternative #3 bridge location that IDOT ultimately chose (located one third of a mile farther north from the Meredosia Energy Center). Thus, since the new main cooling tower is similar in size to the historical cooling tower, potential vapor plume impacts to the proposed bridge are not expected to occur as a result of the proposed project. Table 3.1-21.

During operations at the injection well site(s), the CO2 would be pumped down the injection wells via pipeline operating pressure imparted at the energy center (see Section 3.15, Utilities). The injection well site would, however, have an emergency diesel generator if the electricity were to fail. The generator would only be used during its monthly maintenance and upon emergency situations, and would therefore have only a minor impact on regional air quality. There would be no other stationaryemissions sources during operations of the injection well site. Table 3.1-22 shows the estimated emissions associated with the emergencygenerator,whichare well belowthe PSDsignificance thresholds (shown in Tables 3.1-3 and 3.1-16). Table 3.1-22. Generator Emissions at Injection Well Site during Operations a. Emergency diesel generator emissions are based on the current design of a 1 KW generator reflected in the revised construction permit application, using the assumption of 500 hours as an appropriate estimate of the number of operational hours for an emergency generator during worst-case conditions (Ameren 2013). The size of the emergency generator has been reduced since publication of the Draft EIS, due to the elimination of the booster pumps from the current design of the injection well site. b. Theseemissionsdonotincludemobilesourceemissions.

Diesel exhaust is a complex mixture of hundreds of constituents in either a gas or particle form resulting from the complete and incomplete combustion of fuel and, depending on the type of equipment, sometimes small amounts of engine oil. Pollutant concentrations from diesel emissions during operation of the FutureGen 2.0 Project would be concentrated at the project sites and would decrease with distance. DOEanticipates the resultant adverse impacts would be minor, as the sites are not in direct proximity to sensitive populations or at locations with severe existing pollutant concentrations such that the project would contribute to a cumulative impact. The emergency generators would be located over 1,000 feet away from any receptor, and are for emergency usage only and would not be permitted for continual usage. Mobile Source Emissions during Operations During operations, the project would indirectly generate exhaust emissions from worker vehicles and delivery and waste trucks associated with operations of the energy center, injection wells, educational facilities, and from periodic inspections of the pipeline (see Section 3.13, Traffic and Transportation, for discussion of vehicle traffic). Table 3.1-23 presents these estimated mobile source emissions. Mobile source emissions would be reduced by limiting speeds on roads, reducing vehicle idle time, and maintaining engines according to manufacturer’s specifications. See Section 3.2, Climate and Greenhouse Gases, fordiscussion of mobile sourceemissions of CO2 and other GHGs. Table 3.1-23.

The project would not jeopardize the attainment status of the region for any criteria pollutant; nor would the project impact the air quality or visibility at anyClass Iareas. 3.1.4 Impacts of the No Action Alternative Under the no action alternative, DOE would not provide cost-shared funding for the FutureGen 2.0 Project. Although the Alliance may still elect to construct and operate the project in the absence of DOE cost-shared funding, for the purposes of the analysis in this EIS, DOE assumed that the no action alternative is equivalent to a no-build alternative. Therefore, the project would not be constructed and there would be further reduction in air emissions with the suspension of all air emissions sources at the Meredosia EnergyCenter. 3.2 CLIMATE AND GREENHOUSE GASES 3.2.1 Introduction This section provides information on the climate in the region of the Meredosia Energy Center and the proposed CO2 pipeline, injection wells, and educational facilities. In addition, this section provides background information on GHGs including what they are, how they are produced, and why they are of concern and discusses regional and federal regulations and initiatives to limit GHG emissions. Current emissions levels are then presented, along with estimates of GHG emissions that could potentially occur as a result of the construction and operation of this project. The contributions of these emissions to regional and national levels are discussed, including potential direct and indirect project benefits from reductions in GHG emissions. A further discussion of GHG emissions from the project, as they relate to the potentialfor globalclimate change, is provided in Section 4.3, Potential Cumulative Impacts. 3.2.1.1 Region of Influence The ROI for climate is the regional area of the project location in Morgan County, Illinois. The ROI for GHG emissions is broadly discussed in regional (the state of Illinois), national (the United States), and global terms. Potential impacts of GHGs on climate change are generally viewed from a global cumulative perspective. 3.2.1.2 Method of Analysis and Factors Considered Meteorology and climate data were obtained primarily from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) data sources, as well as monitoring stations within Central Illinois. Weather data for Morgan County was obtained from a weather station in Jacksonville, Illinois, which has the most extensive and readily available information for the area. The Jacksonville weather station is approximately 20 miles southeast of the Meredosia Energy Center and approximately 8 miles southwest of the center of the CO2 storage study area. GHG data were obtained from a variety of sources including the USEPA, the Energy Information Administration, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the World Resources Institute, and the U.S. Global Change Research Program, formerly the U.S. Climate Change Science Program. DOE assessedthe potentialforimpacts basedon whether the project would: • Cause an increase or decrease in GHG emissions of at least 75,000 tons per year (68,250 metric tons per year) CO2-eq; or • Threaten to violate federal,state, or local laws or requirements regardingGHG emissions. Consistent with CEQ’s draft guidance on climate change and NEPA analysis (CEQ 2010a), DOE used emissions rates as a surrogate for impact severity. Although there is currently no consensus on NEPA significance thresholds for GHG emissions, USEPA’s GHG Tailoring Rule (see discussion under Table 3.2-1 below) limits applicability of GHG emissions standards under the CAA to new and modified stationary facilities emitting greater than 75,000 tons per year (68,250 metric tons per year) CO2-eq of GHGs. DOE considered this to be a reasonable significance threshold for the purposes of analysis under this EIS. 3.2.1.3 Regulatory Framework Concerns regarding the relationship between GHG emissions from anthropogenic (related to human activities) sources and changes to climate have led to a variety of federal, regional, and state initiatives and programs aimed at reducing or controlling GHG emissions from human activities. In addition to federal actions, regional organizations and numerous states have also taken action to address GHG concerns. In 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Massachusetts v. EPA that CO2 and other GHGs met the definition of an air pollutant under the CAA and therefore, the USEPA had a duty to regulate GHGs if it was determined that GHGs posed a threat to public welfare. The court also ruled that USEPA could choose not to regulate GHGs, but that decision would have to be grounded in the requirements of the CAA; the USEPA could no longer take the position that GHG regulation was best left to Congress as a national policy decision. This ruling became the impetus for the federal government to initiate various actions to address GHG-relatedconcerns. Table 3.2-1 summarizes the key federal actionsto date. In recent years, Illinois and various Midwestern regional organizations have initiated actions to address GHG concerns. Table 3.2-2 summarizes these actions. Table 3.2-1. Federal Actions to Address Greenhouse Gas Concerns Federal Legislation geologic sequestration or EOR (subpart RR and subpart UU) (75 FR 75060). Court Decisions U.S. Supreme Court U.S. Supreme Court decision (Massachusetts v. EPA, April 2007) that CO2 and other Decision GHGs met the CAA definition of an air pollutant. The decision concluded that USEPA has authority to regulate GHGs (Massachusetts v. EPA). Other Federal Actions Executive Order (issued October 2009) to make reduction of GHG emissions a priority for federal agencies (EO 13514). In October 2010, the CEQ finalized guidance establishing government-wide requirements for federal agencies in calculating and reporting GHG emissions associated with agency operations as required by EO 13514 (CEQ 2010b). USEPA and DOT’s National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration promulgated (April 2010) standards for model year 2012 to 2016 light-duty vehicles to reduce GHG emissions under the CAA, and new CAFE standards to improve fuel economy. Rulemaking (August 2012) was also completed to set standards for light-duty vehicles of model years 2017-2025 and to draft efficiency rules for medium- and heavy-duty engines and vehicles (EIA 2011; USEPA 2011f). Executive Order 13514, Federal Leadership in Environmental, Energy and Economic Performance USEPA and DOT GHG Emissions and CAFE Standards Table 3.2-1. Federal Actions to Address Greenhouse Gas Concerns Other Federal Actions (Continued) (USEPA 2011g; USEPA 2011h; USEPA 2010e; EIA 2011). On March 27, 2012, the USEPA proposed the first CAA standard for CO2 emissions from future power plants. The proposed rule would have required new power plants to emit no more than 1,000 pounds of CO2 per megawatt hour of electricity produced. In response to public comments and after considering recent trends in the power sector, on September 20, 2013, the USEPA announced a new proposed rule; in a Proposed Carbon separate action, it withdrew the 2012 proposed rule. The new proposed rule sets Pollution Standard for separate standards for coal- and natural gas-fired power plants. Coal-powered Future Power Plants plants could choose from one of two alternate standards: 1,100 pounds CO2/MWh gross over a 1-year operating period; or 1,000-1,050 pounds CO2/MWh gross over a 7-year operating period (USEPA 2013a). The longer operating period offers operators flexibility by allowing them additional time to phase in the use of carbon capture technologies. The FutureGen Initiative was conceived in the early part of the last decade and  announced by President George W. Bush on February 27, 2003. FutureGen was an  initiative to design and construct a first-of-its-kind IGCC, coal-to-hydrogen electric  FutureGen Initiative  power plant. The initiative would have created the world’s first coal-based, zero  emissions electricity and hydrogen power plant to support other federal initiatives,  including the National Climate Change Technology Initiative (2001) and the Hydrogen  Fuel Initiative (2003). However, in 2008 DOE announced that it would terminate funding  for the original FutureGen project, primarily due to higher than expected costs.  FutureGen 2.0 FutureGen 2.0 is the successor to the original FutureGen Initiative. It is a public-private partnership formed by DOE for the purpose of developing the first large-scale oxycombustion repowering project in the world that would use carbon capture and storage technology. The coal-powered, oxy-combustion facility would capture at least 90 percent of its CO2 emissions during steady-state operation and reduce other pollutant emissions to near zero. The captured CO2 would be transported through a 30mile pipeline to injection wells where it would be injected into a deep geologic formation for permanent storage. The project would be designed to capture, transport, and inject approximately 1.2 million tons (1.1 million metric tons) of CO2 annually, up to a total of 24 million tons (22 million metric tons) over approximately 20 years. CAA = Clean Air Act; CAFE = Corporate Average Fuel Economy; CEQ = Council on Environmental Quality; CFR = Code of Federal Regulations; CO2 = carbon dioxide; CO2-eq = carbon dioxide equivalent; DOE = U.S. Department of Energy; DOT = U.S. Department of Transportation; EO = Executive Order; EOR = enhanced oil recovery; FR = Federal Register; GHGs = greenhouse gases; IGCC = integrated gasification combined cycle; MWh = megawatt hour; PSD = Prevention of Significant Deterioration; U.S. = United States; USEPA = U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Table 3.2-2. Regional and State Actions to Address Greenhouse Gas Concerns Action or Initiative Description Clean Coal Portfolio Standard Law (20 ILCS 3855/1-5) Illinois’ Clean Coal Portfolio Standard Law (January 2009) established carbon sequestration targets for new coal-fueled power plants. New coal-fueled power plants that begin operations (1) before or during 2015 must capture and store 50 percent, (2) between 2016-2017 must capture and store 70 percent, and (3) after 2017 must capture and store 90 percent of the carbon emissions the facility would otherwise emit (ILGA 2009; Pew Center 2011). The law also requires large utilities serving Illinois to enter into long-term, cost-based contracts to purchase up to 5 percent of their electricity from clean coal facilities that capture at least 50 percent of their GHG emissions (ILGA 2009; Pew Center 2011). In October 2009, the MGA governors agreed to the Midwestern Energy  Infrastructure Accord committing to develop energy infrastructure to foster  energy security, reduce GHG emissions, and spur jobs and investment in  Midwestern Governors Association  low-carbon energy development and technology manufacturing. In 2010,  the MGA formed the CCS Task Force to help the Midwest meet its goals  for commercial deployment of advanced coal technologies with CCS (MGA  2012).  Illinois State Executive Order issued (October 2006) to initiate a long-term strategy by the state to combat global climate change, and build on the steps the state has already taken to reduce GHG emissions (Illinois Illinois Executive Order 2006-11 EO 2006-11). The order created the ICCAG to consider a full range of policies and strategies to reduce GHG emissions in Illinois and make recommendations to the Governor (IEPA 2011b). CCS = Carbon Capture and Storage; DOE = U.S. Department of Energy; GHGs = greenhouse gases; ICCAG = Illinois Climate Change AdvisoryGroup; ILCS = Illinois Compiled Statutes;MGA = Midwestern Governors Association;MGSC =Midwest GeologicalSequestration Consortium 3.2.2 Affected Environment 3.2.2.1 Regional and Local Climate General Conditions The FutureGen 2.0 Project would be located in a region of Illinois with a humid, continental climate consistent with Kppen Climate Classification “Dfa.” The Kppen Climate Classification System recognizes five major climate types based on annual and monthly temperature and precipitation averages. Each major type is designated by a capital letter A through E. The letter “D” refers tocontinental climates found in the interior regions of large land masses. Further subgroups are designated by a second, lowercase letter that distinguishes seasonal temperature and precipitation characteristics. The letter “f” refers to moist climates with adequate precipitation in all months and no dry season. A third letter is used to further denote climatevariations. The letter “a” refers to hot summers where thewarmest monthis over 72°F (Kottek et al. 2011; Blueplanet 2011). Central Illinois has cold winters with average daily temperatures around 29°F and warm summers with average daily temperatures around 73°F. Atmospheric relative humidity varies diurnally and seasonally, with annual averages ranging from 83 percent in the mornings and 64 percent in the afternoons (NCDC 2011a). Maximum precipitation occurs in the spring and minimum precipitation occurs in the winter (NCDC 2013). The central plains region of Illinois historically experiences a full spectrum of weather phenomena, including extreme heat and cold, ice storms and blizzards, high winds, heavy rainfall, thunderstorms, tornadoes, and localized floods. The proposed project site is located hundreds of miles inland from the Atlantic Coast and the Gulf Coast, such that coastal hurricanes do not occur within theregion. Meredosia Energy Center and Morgan County The proposed oxy-combustion facility at the Meredosia Energy Center would be located in Morgan County in the west central region of Illinois. The CO2 pipeline would travel approximately 30 miles east from the Meredosia Energy Center tothe injectionwells. In Morgan County, average high and low temperatures in January range from approximately 35°F to 17°F, respectively. On average, temperatures fall below 0°F on 7 days per year. In mid-summer, temperatures range from average highs of 86°F to average lows of 63°F. Summer high temperatures frequently reach 90°F or above. Average annual precipitation is approximately 39 inches and measurable precipitation occurs approximately 109 days per year. Peak monthly precipitation occurs in May, with an average of 4.8 inches. Average winter snowfall totals 17 inches with maximumaverage monthly snowfall of 5.2 inches in January (NCDC 2013). Table 3.2-3 presents additional seasonal weather data for Morgan County. Relevant severe weather events in Morgan County, Illinois, include frozen precipitation (hail, snow, and ice), tornadoes, floods, and drought (NCDC 2011b). Table 3.2-4 characterizes and quantifies historical severe weather events in Morgan County. Table 3.2-3.

Severe Weather Events in Morgan County Morgan County had 70 severe thunderstorm events with winds over 55 mph, which Thunderstorms included 20 in Jacksonville and 3 in Meredosia. There were 25 tornadoes reported in Morgan County. This included 8 F0 tornadoes  Tornadoesb  (40–72 mph), 10 F1 tornadoes (73–112 mph), 6 F2 tornadoes (113–157 mph), and 1  F3 tornado (158–207 mph). The single F3 tornado occurred in 1961, with a path  approximately 19 miles long.  There were 23 flood events in Morgan County, of which 19 were classified as flash Floodsc floods. Five of the flood events occurred in Jacksonville and 3 in Meredosia when heavy rains caused temporary flooding across roadways. There were 63 drought events reported in Illinois, ranging from mild to extreme. Droughtsd Source: NCDC 2011b a. The National Climatic Data Center database provides historical storm events from 1950 through 2012.

Figure 3.2-1 presents this wind rose displaying annual average wind characteristics generated using meteorological data from 2005 to 2009. The predominant surface wind direction for the region is from the south. The average wind speed is 9.4 miles per hour(4.23 meters per second).

A part of the incoming solar radiation (sunlight) that reaches the earth’s surface is absorbed and then re-emitted as infrared radiation. GHGs in the atmosphere, in turn, absorb some of that infrared radiation and cause the atmosphere’s temperature to rise. This process, known as the greenhouse effect, essentially traps some of the sun’s heat in the atmosphere. Without atmospheric GHGs, the earth’s temperature would be approximately 60°F colder than at present and would not support life as we know it (USEPA 2009b). Since the Industrial Revolution (onset circa 1750), anthropogenic emissions of GHGs have increased, resulting in current concernsabout the potential for global climatechange. GHGs include water vapor, CO2, ozone, methane, nitrous oxide, and several classes of halogenated substances that contain fluorine, chlorine, or bromine (including chlorofluorocarbons). After water vapor, CO2 is the most abundant GHG but, unlike water vapor, CO2 remains in the atmosphere for long periods of time and tends to mix quickly and evenly throughout the lower levels of the global atmosphere. There are also several gases that do not have a direct global warming effect, but indirectly affect terrestrial or m/s =meters per second; % =percent Figure 3.2-1.

These gases include carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and non-methane volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Extremely small particles, such as sulfur dioxide or elemental carbon emissions, can also affect the absorptive characteristics of the atmosphere andtherefore influence the greenhouse effect. Although several GHGs occur naturally in the atmosphere, human activities from all sectors of the CO2-equivalent is a measure used to compare GHGs economy also release these gases into the atmosphere. based on their global warming potential, using the Notably, industrial and agricultural activities release functionally equivalent amount or concentration of CO2 GHGs including CO2, methane, nitrous oxide, ozone, and as the reference.

Since GHG impacts are warming potential; this potential is a function of the gas’s ability to absorb infrared radiation and its persistence in often assessed on a global (international) scale, GHGs are the atmosphere after it is released. typically measured in metric units, specifically, metric tons. GHGs are often reported as CO2-eq, which is a measurement that puts all GHGs in terms relative to CO2 (the predominant GHG), based on their global warming potential. For a given mixture of GHGs, the CO2-eq is the amount of CO2 that would have the same global warming effect as the mixture of GHGs. Global warming potential is a measure of howmuch a given mass of a GHG is estimated to contribute to global warming in comparison to an equivalent mass of CO2. To calculate CO2-eq quantities, the mass of each GHG is multiplied by its global warming potential and summed (IPCC 2007). A list of global warming potential values can be found at 40 CFR 98 (Subpart A, Table A-1).  In the pre-industrial era (before 1750 AD), the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere appears to have been approximately 280 parts per million (IPCC 2007). Data indicates that from the 1700s to the present day, global atmospheric concentrations of CO2 have risen approximately 36 percent (USEPA 2009b). In 1958, C.D. Keeling and others began measuring the concentration of atmospheric CO2 at Mauna Loa in Hawaii. Measurements by Keeling’s teamand others document that the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has been steadily increasing from approximately 316 parts per million in 1959 to 391.76 parts per million in February 2011 (NOAA 2011). The average annual CO2 concentration growth rate during the last decade as measured at Mauna Loa (2001–2010 average: 2.04 parts per million per year) has been significantly higher than the average CO2 growth rate during the previous decade (1991–2000 average: 1.55 parts per million per year) or the last 50 years (1961–2010 average: 1.47 parts per million per year) (NOAA 2011). Much of the increase in global concentrations of CO2 can be attributed to GHG emissions resulting from human activities such as the use of fossil fuels and changes in land use. Figure 3.2-2 depicts the changes in global CO2 concentrations and CO2 emissions fromfossil fuel use over the past 250 years. Current Emissions Global anthropogenic emissions of CO2 (and other GHGs) have been rising since the 1800s, but the rate of emissions has increased sharply since the middle of the 20th century. Much of this rise in emissions is due to the use of fossil fuels in electricity generation, transportation, and industry. In 2004, emissions of CO2 from fossil fuel combustion (30,000 million tons; 27,264 million metric tons) accounted for approximately 57 percent of global anthropogenic GHG emissions fromall sources; by 2008, annual CO2 emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels equaled 34,000 million tons (30,421 million metric tons), an increase of approximately 12 percent (Boden et al. 2012; IPCC 2007). CO2 is also released as a result of deforestation and other changes in land use. Other important GHGs include: • Methane,releasedfromwaste management and agricultural activities;and • Nitrous oxide, released from agricultural soil and animal manure management, sewage treatment, combustion of fossilfuels, and industrial activities. 40000 400 Atmospheric CO2 Concentration (ppmv) 350 300 250 200 150 100 50 0 35000 30000 25000 20000 15000 10000 5000 0 Fossil Fuel CO2 Emissions (million metric tons) 2020 2010 2000 1990 1980 1970 1960 1950 1940 1930 1920 1910 1900 1890 1880 1870 1860 1850 1840 1830 1820 1810 1800 1790 1780 1770 1760 1750 Sources: Developed from Boden et al. 2012; Etheridge et al. 1996, 2006; NOAA2012.

Economic Sectors and Greenhouse Gases Contributing to Global Anthropogenic Emissions Within the United States, overall anthropogenic GHG emissions in 2010 totaled approximately 7,504 million tons CO2-eq (6,822 million metric tons CO2-eq), of which approximately 79 percent was composed of CO2 (USEPA 2012d). There was a 3.2 percent increase in anthropogenic GHG emissions from 2009 (7,234 million tons CO2-eq; 6,576 million metric tons CO2-eq) to 2010. Table 3.2-5 shows that as of 2010, CO2 emissions from United Stateselectricity generation had increased by 24 percent since 1990, while total GHG emissions (from all reported sources) grew by 10.5 percent over the same period. In 2010, electric power generation contributed 40 percent of all CO2 emissions in the United States(and 33 percent of all GHG emissions), of which 81 percent wasattributable tothe use of coal. Table 3.2-5.

Over the next two decades, the largest share of United States CO2 emissions will continue to come from electricity generation, followed closely by transportation. However, while electricitygeneration is projected to increase by 0.9 percent per year, CO2 emissions from electricity generation would increase by only 0.5 percent per year. This projected slower rate of increase in emissions is in part due to an expected increase in renewable energy sources from 8 percent in 2007 to 14 percent in 2030, as well as efficiency improvements in technologies that emit less CO2 and the commercial availability of CO2 mitigation techniques. More rapid improvements in technologies, mitigation techniques, and more rapid adoption of voluntary and mandatory CO2 emissions reduction programs could result in even lower CO2 emissions levels than thoseprojected(EIA 2009). Within the state of Illinois, GHG emissions from all sources equaled 317 million tons CO2-eq (288 million metric tons CO2-eq) in 2007, or approximately 4.3 percent of total U.S GHG emissions in that year (WRI 2012). Emissions of CO2 from all energy-related activities in Illinois totaled 267 million tons CO2-eq (243 million metric tons CO2-eq), with 104 million tons CO2-eq (95 million metric tons CO2-eq) resulting from electric power generation. Total GHG emissions for the state of Illinois are projected to increase to approximately 358 million tons CO2-eq (325 million metric tons CO2-eq) by 2020. Note that these are conservative projections, based only on increases in energy-related GHG emissions, and assume that emissions from industrial activity, agriculture, and waste management will remain constant at 2003 levels(WRI 2007). Source: Developed from 2007 and projected 2030 data presented in EIA2009 (Report No. DOE/EIA-0383 [2009]) Figure 3.2-4. United States CO2 Emissions by Sector 3.2.3 Impacts of Proposed Action 3.2.3.1 Construction Impacts Meredosia Energy Center, CO2 Pipeline, CO2 Storage Study Area, and Educational Facilities Construction of the project would generate GHG emissions from the use of construction equipment, delivery trucks, and construction worker vehicles. DOE calculated GHG emissions using the NONROAD and the MOVES models described in Section 3.1, Air Quality, based on estimates of the types and numbers of construction equipment and vehicles needed for construction of the project and the duration of their use. Table 3.2-6 presents the estimated GHG emissions that would be generated by the construction of the oxy-combustion facility at the Meredosia Energy Center, the CO2 pipeline, the injection well site(s), and the educational facilities. The total calculated emissions are based on the preliminary project design and conservative assumptions regarding activity levels and duration and are expected to be overestimates of actual emissions. Note that these values have been updated since publication of the Draft EIS to reflect the most current injection well design, which resulted in slightly increased emissions. DOE has revisited the impact analysis presented in the Draft EIS and concluded that the impactsremainconsistentwith those reportedin the Draft EIS. DOE estimates that GHG emissions from construction of the project would equal approximately 48,009 tons CO2-eq (43,688 metric tons CO2-eq). Over the three-year construction period for the project (assumed to be mid-2014 through mid-2017 for this analysis), GHG emissions for the state of Illinois are projected to be approximately 1,024 million tons CO2-eq (931 million metric tons CO2-eq) (WRI 2007). Construction-related impacts resulting from tailpipe emissions of GHGs would be minimized by the use of appropriate BMPs, such as maintaining enginesaccording to manufacturers’ specifications, minimizing idling of equipment while not in use, and using electricity from the grid if available to reduce the use of diesel or gasolinegenerators for operating construction equipment. Table 3.2-6.

At the energy center, operation of the proposed plant would generate direct GHG emissions from the oxy-combustion boiler and the compression and purification unit, the auxiliary boiler, and the diesel emergency generator, as well as indirect emissions of GHGsas a result of transportation-related exhaust fromemployee vehicles andtruck transport of materials and wastes. At the injection well site(s), operations would generate direct GHG emissions from operation of the diesel emergency generator (which is expected to be infrequent), and indirect GHGemissions fromtransportation-related exhaust. GHG emissions estimates have been updated to reflect project design changes that have occurred since publication of the Draft EIS. The FutureGen 2.0 Project would be designed to capture 90 percent of the CO2 generated during steady-state operation, or approximately 1.2 million tons (1.1 million metric tons) ofCO2 annually. However, in order to accuratelydescribe impacts from GHG emissions, DOE considered a range of operational scenarios with steady-state CO2 capture efficiency varying from 90 to 98 percent. Accordingly, this section presents a range of GHG emissions estimates. While these changes resulted in slightly increased upper bounds for GHG emissions, DOE has revisited the impact analysis presented in the Draft EIS and concluded that the impacts remain consistent with those reported in the Draft EIS. Annual GHG emissions would be up to approximately 157,144 tons CO2-eq (142,858 metric tons CO2-eq) from the oxy-combustion boiler alone; after taking all project components into account, annual emissions would be up to 169,701 tons CO2-eq (154,283 metric tons CO2-eq). Operational impacts resulting from tailpipe emissions of GHGs would be minimized by the use of appropriate BMPs such as maintaining engines according to manufacturers’ specifications, minimizing idling of equipment while not in use. Table 3.2-7 presents the direct and indirect GHG emissions generated by the proposed project. Table 3.28 presents the estimated emissions of individual GHGs from project operations, and illustrates the calculation of CO2-eq emissions using global warming potentials. As discussed under Section 3.2.2.2, CO2-eq quantities are derived by multiplying each GHG’s emissions by its global warming potential. These CO2-eq quantitiescan then be summed to obtain total CO2-eq emissions. Table 3.2-7.

In that year, GHG emissions for the state of Illinois are projected to be approximately 345 million tons CO2-eq (315 million metric tons CO2-eq) (WRI 2007). By utilizing advanced oxy-combustion technology and capturing and storing CO2, the project would reduce GHG emissions from the generation of 168 MWe (gross) of electricity by approximately 90 percent compared to a conventional coal-fueled plant, or by approximately 70 percent compared to a natural gas-fueled plant (see Table 3.2-9), and would thus have a beneficial impact on regional GHG emissions during operations. On a broader scale, successful implementation of the project may lead to widespread acceptance and deployment of oxy-combustion technology with geologic storage of CO2, thus fostering a long-term reduction in the rate of CO2 emissions from power plants across the United States. Table 3.2-9.

Fuel use during startup or shutdown not included. Btu/kWh = British thermal units per kilowatt hour; CO2-eq = carbon dioxide equivalent; mtpy = metric tons per year; tpy = tons per year During operation, the project would comply with all GHG-related federal and state rules. The FutureGen 2.0 Project would comply with all GHG-related requirements in the proposed plant’s CAA operating (Title V) permit. As an emitter of more than 27,500 tons (CO2-eq) per year (25,000 metric tons CO2-eq per year) of GHGs, the project would also be required to comply with the federal Mandatory Reporting Rule, and would submit annual GHG inventories to USEPA. Finally, Illinois’ Clean Coal Portfolio Standard Law requires that any new coal-fired power plants that begin operations in 2016-2017 capture and store 70 percent oftheir GHG emissions, and plants beginning operations after 2017 capture and store 90 percent of their emissions. The FutureGen 2.0 Project is expected to begin operations in 2017 and would capture between 88 to 96 percent of its total GHG emissions (at least 90 percent during steady-state operation),andwould therefore be incompliance with the Illinois law. On September 20, 2013, USEPA proposed a new rule that would require new coal-fired power plants with a capacity greater than 25 MWe to emit no more than 1,100 pounds CO2/MWh gross within any 1-year operating period, or 1,000–1,050 pounds CO2/MWh gross within any 7-year operating period (USEPA 2013a). The proposed oxy-combustion facility would emit up to approximately 295 pounds CO2/MWh gross during normal operations, and would therefore meet USEPA’s requirement if itwere to be finalized. Current scientific methods do not enable an evaluation of the relationship of reductions or increases in GHG emissions from a specific source to a particular change in either local or global climate. Therefore, the potential contribution or removal of anthropogenic GHGs attributable to this project, and its impact on global climate change, is discussed within the context of cumulative impacts. Section 4.3, Potential Cumulative Impacts, presents a discussion of the potential cumulative impacts related to GHG emissions in this context. This project’s reduction in potential CO2 emissions, compared to the emissions from a conventional coal-or natural gas-fueled power plant generating the same amount of electricity, would potentiallygenerate beneficial impacts interms ofcumulative effects on climate change. GHG Emissions Impact Summary in Relation to Historical Baseline Conditions at the Meredosia Energy Center The PSD and Title V GHG Tailoring Rule requires an existing source that increases GHG emissions by more than 75,000 tons (CO2-eq) per year (68,250metric tons CO2-eq per year) to comply with PSD permitting requirements. It also requires existing sources that emit more than 100,000 tons (CO2-eq) per year (91,000metric tons CO2-eq per year) of GHGs to comply with Title V operating permit requirements. However, as discussed in Section 3.1, Air Quality, historical emissions levels may be taken into consideration when determining PSD applicability. In its air permit application with the state of Illinois, the Meredosia Energy Center would be taking credit for contemporaneous emissions decreases resulting from the shutdown of all boilers at the energy center that were historically operational prior to 2012. Overall, the net emissions of the Meredosia Energy Center would decreasein comparison tohistoricalemissions rates. Table 3.2-10 presents total projected GHG emissions from the energy center, the decrease in GHG emissions due to the 2011 suspension of operations at the energy center, and the net change in GHG emissions from pre-suspension historical conditions, as shown in the 2013 construction permit application submitted by the Alliance to IEPA (Ameren 2013). The project would not result in net emissions greater than the PSD significance threshold (per 40 CFR 52.21(b)(23)(i)) and, therefore, the project would not be subject to the PSD regulations. Note that these emissions calculations are based on conservative assumptions used in the construction permit application, as discussed in Section 3.1, Air Quality, and are not reflective of normal operating conditions. During normal operations, theprojectwould generate significantlylower GHG emissions as shownin Table 3.2-7. Table 3.2-10.

Although the Alliance may still elect to construct and operate the project in the absence of DOE cost-shared funding, for the purposes of the analysis in this EIS, DOE assumed that the no action alternative is equivalent to a no-build alternative. Therefore, the project would not be constructed and there would be no demonstration oftechnologiesthat could change GHG emissions. Under the no action alternative, equivalent electrical generation by a conventional coal-fueled or natural gas-fired power plant in the absence of the proposed project could result in higher emissions of GHGs with an associated greater contribution to global climate change (see Table 3.2-9). Furthermore, the potential future benefits to GHG emissions reduction that may be achieved nationally and internationally through the retrofit of existing coal-fueled power plants using oxy-combustion technology plus CO2 capture and geologic storage might not be realized without successful commercial demonstration of these technologies. 3.3 PHYSIOGRAPHY AND SOILS 3.3.1 Introduction This section describes the physiography (i.e., the earth’s surface and exterior physical features) and soils that could be directly or indirectly affected by the construction and operation of the FutureGen 2.0 Project. This section alsoanalyzes the potential effectsof this project onthese resources. 3.3.1.1 Region of Influence The ROI for physiography and soils includes the areas potentially affected by the construction and operation of the FutureGen 2.0 Project, which consists of the oxy-combustion facility at the Meredosia Energy Center, the CO2 pipeline, the injection wells, and the educational facilities. The ROI defines the extent of the areas where direct effects from construction and operation may be experienced, and encompasses theareas where indirect effects fromthe proposedproject would most likely occur. 3.3.1.2 Method of Analysis and Factors Considered DOE evaluated the potential effects of the construction and operation of the proposed project on soils within the ROI, primarily focused on their ability to support agriculture and their potential for erosion hazards. DOE used several data sources to support this analysis, including U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) topographic maps, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) soil surveys, and consultation with the IDOA. DOE analyzed the potential impacts to physiography and soils by overlaying the areas of proposed construction on soil survey maps. DOE calculated quantitative estimates of the potential for loss of soil resources using geographic information systems (GIS) and existinglandcover data. DOE made qualitative assessments for the potential effects on physiography and soils based on properties of soils that could be impacted and the expected attributes of theproject. DOEassessedthe potentialforimpacts basedon whether the proposed project components would: • Result in permanent ortemporarysoilremoval; • Cause the permanent loss of prime farmland soil or farmland of statewide importance (through conversion to nonagricultural uses); • Result in significant soilerosion; • Cause soil contamination due to spills of hazardous materials; or • Change soil characteristicsand composition. 3.3.1.3 Regulatory Framework The Federal Farmland Protection Policy Act (Public Law 97-98; 7 USC 4201 et seq.) seeks to minimize the extent to which federal programs contribute to the unnecessary and irreversible conversion of farmland soils (prime farmland) to nonagricultural uses. The supply of high quality farmlands is limited; therefore, the USDA encourages the preservation of soils classified as “prime farmland,” “prime farmland if drained,” or “farmland of statewide importance.” The definition of prime farmland, as per NRCS Handbook, part 622.04 (USDA 2011), is included below. Prime farmland is land that has the best combination of physical and chemical characteristics for producing food, feed, forage, fiber, and oilseed crops and that is available for these uses. It has the combination of soil properties, growing season, and moisture supply needed to produce sustained high yields of crops in an economic manner if it is treated and managed according to acceptable farming methods. In general, prime farmland has an adequate and dependable water supply from precipitation or irrigation, a favorable temperature and growing season, an acceptable level of acidity or alkalinity, an acceptable content of salt or sodium, and few or no rocks. Its soils are permeable to water and air. Prime farmland is not excessively eroded or saturated with water for long periods of time, and it either does not flood frequently during the growing season or is protected from flooding. Most of the native soils in Illinois are considered prime farmland. Prime farmland soils in Illinois are identified in NRCS soil surveys by soil association. The IDOA is tasked with reviewing all federal and state projects for their potential impact to prime farmland by considering project data, soil surveys, and land use by completingForm AD-1006, the Farmland Conversion Impact Rating. Soil erosion prevention and control, particularly during construction activities, associated with stormwater discharges are regulated by the IEPA under Sections 401 and 402 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) (permitting requirements) through the NPDES permit program (see Chapter 5, Regulatory and Permit Requirements). The state’s NPDES program is modeled on the federal NPDES program, which requires soil erosion control measures during construction. The CWA also regulates the handling and storage of petroleum products, which could contaminate soilsfrom an unintended release. 3.3.2 Affected Environment 3.3.2.1 Physiography The project study area is located within the Lower Illinois River Basin. The majority of the basin is extremely flat with less than 20 feet of relief, although the Illinois River dissects the flat topography of the basin in central Illinois. The area of greatest topographic relief occurs along the Illinois River valley, where elevations can vary by as much as 200 to 400 feet (USGS 2000a). Lands within the basin range from 600 to 800 feet abovesealevel. The Lower Illinois River Basin is located within the Central Lowland physiographic province (USGS 2011a). The Central Lowland province is characterized by low relief and gently rolling hills. The major landforms for the province are glacial in origin. Much of this lowland is a glacial till plain that is presently covered by loess(wind-driven), lacustrine(lake-related), and alluvial (river-related) deposits. More specifically, 99.5 percent of the basin is in the Till Plains Section of the Central Lowland physiographic province (see Figure 3.3-1). The Till Plains Section is further divided into four subsections: the Bloomington Ridged Plain (38 percent), the Galesburg Plain (26 percent), the Springfield Plain (35 percent), and the Kankakee Plain (1 percent) (USGS 2000b). The FutureGen 2.0 Project lies entirely within the Springfield Plainsubsection. The Springfield Plain is covered by glacial drift deposits from the Illinoian stage and is mostly flat, with very localized variations in topography. Section 3.4, Geology, discusses the sequence of glacial deposition inthe Lower Illinois River Basin. 3.3.2.2 Soils The evaluation of soils potentially impacted by the proposed project is based on the mapped NRCS soil units. A mapped soil unit is a collection of areas defined and named the same in terms of their soil components. The NRCS uses the chemical and physical characteristics of the soil to organize similar soils into groups. Soil map units are defined by a series of properties that are important to soil use, such as surface texture and slope, and are typically used in displaying localized changes. Each map unit differs in some respect from all others in a survey area and is uniquely identified on a soil map. Soil map units made up of two or more major soil types in a complex pattern or in a very small area (where each soil type cannot beidentifiedseparately) areconsideredsoil complexes. The soils in the Lower Illinois River Basin formed mostly in thick loess. Loess consists of fine-grained material, typically silt-sized particles, deposited by wind. Loess represents one of the dominant mechanisms for soil formation across the region. Historically, some loess deposits have been observed in thicknesses greaterthan 60 inches (USGS 2011a). Source: ISGS 2012a CO2 = carbon dioxide; Mt. = Mount Approximatelocation of Meredosia EnergyCenter ApproximatelocationofCO2storagestudyarea Figure 3.3-1. Physiographic Divisions of Illinois Soils formed in sandy to clayey alluvial sediments are found near major streams. Several soil properties are relevantto characterizingthe environment or determiningthe potential for adverse effectsto soils: • Soil erodibility is a characteristic based on the potential for soil detachment by runoff and raindrop impact. Sedimentation in lakes and the Illinois River is one of the most important water-quality problems in the Lower Illinois River Basin (USGS 2011a) (see Section 3.6, Surface Water). Soil erosion also reduces the amount of vertical buffer soil between pipelines and deep tillage implements (see Appendix H, Agricultural Mitigation). The basin is particularly susceptible to erosion and sedimentation for three reasons: (1) the soils' parent materials (loess) tend to erode easily; (2) under conventional tillage practices for corn and soybeans, bare earth is present for the majority of the year; and (3) Illinois experiences higher rainfall during the spring, a period which tends to have lower vegetative cover on cropland (USGS 2011a). The NRCS soil erosion factor for water is based on physical tests and calculations of the grain size, amount of organic material, structure classes, and permeability of the soil (Römkens et al. 1996). Each of these factors contributesto a soil being more susceptible to erosion when disturbed.  The NRCS soil survey designates the hazard associated with soil erosion for each map unit, when disturbed, as either slight (low), moderate, or severe, as described below (Soil Survey Division Staff 1993): o Slight. Presents, at most, minor problems associated with erosion. The soil gives satisfactory performance with little or no modification required. Modifications or operations dictated by the use are simple and relatively inexpensive. With normal maintenance, performance should be satisfactoryfora periodof time generallyconsidered acceptablewithrespecttoerosion. o Moderate. Does not require exceptional risk or cost associated with erosion, but the soil does have certain undesirable properties or features. Some modification of the soil itself, special design, or maintenance is required for satisfactory performance over an acceptable period of time. The needed measures usually increase the cost of establishing or maintaining the use, but the added cost is generally not prohibitive. o Severe. Requires unacceptable risk to use the soil if not appreciablymodified. Special design, a significant increase in construction cost, or an appreciably higher maintenance cost is required for satisfactory performance over an acceptable period of time. A limitation that requires removal and replacement of the soil would be rated severe. The rating does not imply that the soil cannot be adapted to a particular use, but rather that the cost of overcoming the limitation would behigh. • Slope gradient influences the retention and movement of water, the potential for increased soil erosion, the amount and ease of construction machinery movement, and engineering uses of the soil (USDA 2012). Construction on larger or steeper slopes may require additional cut and fill, and steeper slopes can increase the potential for soil erosion. Typically, soils with the steepest gradient are rated as severe erosion hazard but are usuallywelldrained. • Prime farmland or farmland of statewide importance is a NRCS designation of a soil series based on the characteristics described in Section 3.3.1.3. Prime farmland soils may occur in a variety of parent materials, geomorphic locations, and climates. Most of the native soils in Illinois are considered prime farmland. Soils that contain water near or at the surface may also be considered “prime farmland, if drained.” Drain tiles and man-made ditches are often used by farmers to drain the excess water in these soils. Some soils that are not considered prime farmland, but may have properties that are recognized by the state as highly productive, are classified as “farmland of statewide importance.” The presence of hydric soils within the ROI was also examined. Hydric is a USDA/NRCS classification that is primarily based on the wetness of the soil, which can produce anaerobic conditions in the upper layers (USDA 2011). Not all poorly drained soils are considered hydric, asotherfactors, such asthe depth and duration of the water table, and iron oxidation in the soil column are also taken into consideration. Hydric soils are used, in addition to vegetation types present and other attributes, to delineate wetlands. Impacts to hydric soils, specifically those located in state-or federally-regulated wetlands, were not analyzed within this section. Refer to Section 3.7, Wetlands and Floodplains, for a discussion of wetlands and impacts towetlands within the ROI. Tables 3.3-1 through 3.3-3 identify the soil map units coincident with the project components. The tables include the soil map unit code, texture, the potential for erosion, drainage class, range of slopes, and the farmland status for each of the soil types. Most of the soils are considered prime farmland, although some retain enough water to require draining to support crops. Since the Draft EIS was published, the USDA/NRCS has issued updated soils data for Illinois. The new data include revised soil descriptions, soil unit symbols, drainage classes, and/or slope percentages. These new data have been incorporated intothe Final EIS. Althoughmany of the soil names remain the same or are very similar, some have changed more significantly while others may have been eliminated altogether. Therefore, it is possible that some soil data may have changed when compared to the Draft EIS even though no changes have occurred to a particular project design component. None of the changes, however, has significantly altered the project impacts, conclusions, or recommendations with respectto physiography and soils. The entire project is located within Morgan County, Illinois. Agricultural land use has increased in Morgan County during thelast decade. In 1997, Morgan County contained a total areaof 305,585 acres of farmland, representing approximately 83 percent of the county land area (USDA 1999). In 2007, Morgan County had increased the total farmland to 320,512 acres, with an average farm size of 433 acres (USDA 2009). The primary crops in Morgan County are corn, soybeans, and wheat. 3.3.2.3 Meredosia Energy Center The area around the existing Meredosia Energy Center is relatively flat, with an average elevation of approximately 446 feet above sea level. Natural and man-made variations in the topography cause an average relief of up to 6 feet. The elevation at the proposed location for the oxy-combustion facility is approximately 450 feet above sea level, which is the highest elevation onsite and where all of the existing structures associated withthe Meredosia EnergyCenter are located. As discussed in Section 3.3.2.1, the Meredosia Energy Center is located within the Lower Illinois River Basin. The Meredosia Energy Center is located in an area with high soil permeability. Therefore, the aquiferis vulnerable tocontamination(Berget al. 1984) (see Section 3.5, Groundwater). Most of the soils in the Meredosia area have characteristics that are well suited for agriculture and farmland use. On the Meredosia Energy Center property, the soil survey of Morgan and Scott counties identified soils with beneficialagricultural production properties(Soil Survey Staff 2011a). The Meredosia Energy Center property encompasses approximately 263 acres. The majority of the soils at the Meredosia Energy Center are identified as Plainfield soils, which are characterized as farmland soils of statewide importance. Urban soils are also located on portions of the energy center property. Urban soils are formed from previously disturbed soil series and typically are covered by impervious structures and pavement; in this case, by the existing Meredosia Energy Center facilities. Since the last soil survey review at the Meredosia Energy Center, additional structures and facilities have been built (e.g., coal piles, detention basins, roads), which have disturbed the Plainfield soils and modified the positive soil characteristics for farmland. In addition, the soils onsite have not been farmed in at least several decades, and the majority of land surrounding the energy center has been developed for industrial use, both of which are factors which decrease the overall farmland value of the soils at the Meredosia EnergyCenter. Since the publication of the Draft EIS, changes in project design have occurred. As described in the Draft EIS, the Alliance originally anticipated the need to disturb 164 acres of the property for construction of the proposed oxy-combustion facility (see Figure 2-14). Through ongoing refinements in site plans in response to the aforementioned comments, the Alliance reduced the anticipated area of disturbance to 114 acres as describedin this Final EIS (see Figure 2-15). Table 3.3-1 identifies and describes the soil map units present within the proposed construction footprint at the Meredosia Energy Center as addressed in the Draft EIS; these same soil types are also included in the revised construction footprint currently proposed by the Alliance. Similarly, Figure 3.3-2 depicts the extent of the construction footprint with respect to onsite soil types based on the design presented in the Draft EIS. Since the design presented in the Draft EIS results in larger impact areas, that design is analyzed herein to represent the conservative upper limit of potential soil impacts. The soil types present onsite have a slight or moderate potential for erosion. Slopes at the site range from nearly flat to 15 percent. Plainfield soils, the predominant onsite soil type, form in sandy drift and are typically found on outwash plains, glacial lake basins, stream terraces, moraines, and other upland places. Plainfield soils are further identified as being excessively drained, having rapid to very rapid permeability, and having a negligible to medium potential for surface runoff (National Cooperative Soil Survey 2006). Although the Plainfield sand is described as excessively drained, it contains a component that may be identified as hydric (i.e., those soils typically found in wetlands) when found along depressions and stream terraces. Although the FutureGen 2.0 Project as currently proposed would not affect these areas, there are two small areas of jurisdictional wetlands onsite, which are discussedin Section 3.7, Wetlands and Floodplains.  As stated earlier, a majority of the mapped soil types at the Meredosia Energy Center are generally classified as farmland of statewide importance and account for up to 86 percent of the project area. However, the Meredosia Energy Center property has been extensively developed for decades and some of the underlying surface soils have been significantly disturbed. The site is currently used solely for industrial purposes and does not contain any agricultural production. Therefore, although the soil types onsite are associated with farmlands of statewide importance, today these soils wouldlikely notmeet the necessary criteria tosupportthis classification. Table 3.3-1.

The Meredosia Energy Center site is an industrial site, and many of the underlying soils have been disturbed since the soil survey was initially performed. Therefore, although soil types on the property can be categorized as farmland of statewide importance, today these soilswouldlikely not meet the necessary criteria to support this classification. Source: USDA/NRCS 2012 Figure 3.3-2. Soils Map of Meredosia Energy Center 3.3.2.4 CO2 Pipeline The CO2 pipeline would be located entirely within the Springfield Plain, a physiographic subsection of the Till Plains Section (see Figure 3.3-1). Table 3.3-2 identifies the soil types that are located within the ROI for the southern and northern CO2 pipeline routes. Table 3.3-2 also describes the primary properties of these soils, their potential for erosion,andtheir status as prime farmland soils. Most of the soils are identified as Rozetta silt loam, Ipava silt loam, Sable silty clay loam, and Osco silt loam. A majority of the soils are considered prime farmland, although some retain enough water to require draining to support crops. Farmers use drain tiles beneath their fields and man-made ditches to remove water from those soils classified as “prime farmland, if drained.” As shown in Table 3.3-2, a variety of soil map units are located along the CO2 pipeline corridor, although many are found in patches that are 1 acre or less in area.  Table 3.3-2.

Although a specific site has not yet been identified, the proposed site or sites for the educational facilities would be areas that have been previously disturbed, with utilities (e.g., electricity, telecommunications, water, and sewer) located on or immediately adjacent to the site or sites. These educational facilities couldinvolve new construction, rehabilitation ofexisting structures, ora combination of new construction and rehabilitation. The Alliance is working with local stakeholders to identify thelocationsthat would best serve these functions. Whether in or near Jacksonville, the educational facilities would be located within the Lower Illinois River Basin in the Springfield Plain subsection of the Till Plains Section of the Central Lowland physiographic province(see Figure 3.3-1).  The majority of the soils in Jacksonville are classified as Tama urban land complex, found on 2 to 5 percent slopes, and Ipava urban land complex, found on 0 to 3 percent slopes. The Tama urban land complex is a gently sloping, moderately well drained soil intermingled with areas of Urban land. Water and air move through the Tama soil at a moderate rate. Surface runoff is medium on the Tama soil and rapid on the Urban land. The Ipava urban land complex is a somewhat poorly drained soil intermingled with areas of Urban land. Water and air move through the Ipava soil at a moderately slow rate. Surface runoff is slow on the Ipava soil and rapid on the Urban land. Ipava and Tama soils are both considered prime farmland; however, when they are intermingled with Urban land, as with the complexes found aroundJacksonville,the soil complexis not classified as prime farmland. 3.3.3 Impacts of Proposed Action This section describes the potential impacts on physiography and soils from the construction and operation of the proposed project. 3.3.3.1 Construction Impacts Direct impacts to soils would occur fromthe construction of the oxy-combustion facility at the Meredosia Energy Center, CO2 pipeline, injection wells, and the educational facilities. Construction activities that could affect soils for each of these project components include clearing vegetation, grading, and basic earthmoving. The CO2 pipeline would also require trenching. Brush clearing would be required at and around the Meredosia Energy Center, although most construction would occur on already developed portions of the property. These construction activities for the FutureGen 2.0 Project would increase the potential for soil erosion, as well as permanent topsoil loss. Conversion of prime farmland could occur at the injection well site(s). Potential soil contamination due to spills of hazardous materials during construction could also occur. As stated earlier, since the Draft EIS was issued, several project design changes have occurred, resulting in fewer potential impacts. The most significant project design changes with respect to physiography and soils have occurred at the Meredosia Energy Center, while additional changes have also occurred along the proposed southern pipeline route and at the CO2 storage study area. The analyses below focus on the maximum potential impacts which could occur based on a comparison between the project design presented in the Draft EIS and the current proposed project design, while also including a discussion of the potential for reduced impacts based on the various designchanges that have been proposed. Soil Erosion The Meredosia Energy Center has an existing NPDES permit, which would be updated to include the oxy-combustion facility; a modified permit application request was submitted on June 20, 2013. For construction along the CO2 pipeline and injection well site(s), the Alliance would develop and implement a project-specific SWPPP to address erosion prevention measures, sediment control measures, permanent stormwater management, dewatering, environmental inspection and maintenance, and final stabilization, in accordance with the NPDES stormwater construction permit requirements. The SWPPP would include erosion and sedimentation control measures recommended by the IEPA, and include suggestions by IDOA and the Illinois Urban Manualsuchasthefollowing: • Silt fences, sand bags, straw bales, trench plugs, and interceptor dikes during construction to minimizesoil erosion;and • Stabilization of soils through post-construction revegetation and mulching of temporarily disturbed areas. Soil erosion BMPs implemented as part of the project-specific SWPPP, including stockpiling and covering topsoil for replacement after construction, installing silt and wind fences, and reseeding temporarily disturbed areas, would minimize soil erosion impacts from construction. The SWPPP would ensure proper treatment of highly erodiblesoilsduring construction. The Alliance would also use topsoil conservation procedures to minimize topsoil loss in areas disturbed by construction. These would include identifying, stripping, and storing the topsoil away from subsoil materials and replacing the topsoil in temporarily disturbed areas following construction for reseeding. The topsoil displaced by construction would be stockpiled separately and re-used for revegetation of disturbed areas. The Alliance would either quickly revegetate exposed soils after construction, in compliance with the SWPPP, or return farmland to the landowner’s preference (e.g., bare soil vs. vegetation) within the IDOA guidelines. As such, erosion impacts and loss of topsoil in disturbed areas during construction wouldbe short term and minor. Prime Farmland Construction of the project components, based upon the maximum potential impacts of the various project scenarios, would disturb up to 364 acres of soils classified as prime farmland, farmland of statewide importance, and soils that could be prime farmland if they were protected from flooding or if they were adequately drained. Of these soils, all but a maximum of approximately 25 acres would be returned to their native state or agricultural production. The permanent soil conversions (up to 25 acres) would only occur at the injection well site(s) and access roads to the injection well site(s), as these soils would be removed from agricultural production forthe duration of the project. Although up to 79 acres of soils at the Meredosia Energy Center have been classified as soils of statewide importance within the potential permanent impact areas analyzed in the Draft EIS, these soils were already disturbed by industrial construction, have not been used for agricultural production for decades, and have not been included in the overall calculation. Soils identified as prime farmland require special consideration during construction. DOE is working with IDOA and the Illinois NRCS state office to complete the Farmland Conversion Impact Rating Form AD-1006. Form AD-10061 compares the amount of farmland soils that would be permanently converted to nonagricultural use to those present in a region to determine the significance of the conversion. Once additional site-specific (location) data for all of the proposed project components is known, the Illinois NRCS office would finalize the form and produce a farmland impact rating. The farmland impact rating would indicate the value of the affected soils for agricultural production, and may guide mitigation measures if high value soilsare converted. Based on the nature of the proposed project and the mitigation that would be taken to reduce impacts, impacts to prime farmland are not expected to be significant. During construction of the proposed CO2 pipeline, topsoil would be segregated and returned to mirror the pre-construction soil profile. The proposed CO2 pipeline ROW would also be returned to agricultural use following construction. All construction work would be performed in accordance with the conditions and stipulations of applicable federal, state, and local permits, authorizations, and clearances. In particular, the Alliance signed an Agricultural Impact Mitigation Agreement (see Appendix H, Agricultural Mitigation) with the Illinois Department of Agriculture;the Illinois Farm Bureau also participated in the development of the agreement by reviewing and providing comments that were then incorporated. The agreement sets forth the activities the Alliance would undertake to mitigate any adverse impactsto farmland associated with the construction of the CO2 pipeline. Through the Agricultural Impact Mitigation Agreement, the Alliance would adopt the IDOA-developed construction procedures that are designed to conserve topsoil and farmland during the construction of pipelines and ensure that no permanent damage occurs to the drainage patterns of the adjacent fields (see Appendix H, Agricultural Mitigation). The Alliance would use these standards to guide construction practices so that the impacts to soils and farmland are minimized. For example, surface disturbance impacts fromconstruction of the CO2 pipeline would be limited to the CO2 pipeline ROW and minimized through the implementation of standard BMPs, including efforts to minimize rutting and compaction of soils from vehicle and heavy equipment use. The pipeline installation process would involve clearing the vegetation from the surface, stripping and stockpiling the topsoil, segregating the topsoil from the subsoil materials, digging and preparing pipeline trenches, and laying the pipeline. During the process, workers would document the location of irrigation systems, drainage tiles, sensitive soils, and the groundwater table. The pipeline would be placed deep enough so that it is below drain tiles to ensure that the pipeline would not beencountered or exposed by farming methods orexcessive erosion. The CO2 pipeline would be buried at least 4 feet underground, which is deeper than required by 49 CFR 195. An additional depth of cover would be provided at stream and road crossings, beneath drainage ditches, and beneath irrigation tiles. In agricultural lands, the CO2 pipeline would be buried at least 5feet deep in accordance with IDOA pipeline construction standards and policies in the Agricultural Impact Mitigation Agreement. Drain tile BMPs, including marking where tiles are connected, keeping a 1-foot buffer between the drain tiles and pipeline, and conducting timely repairs would ensure that the drain tiles would not be permanently impacted by construction. Following pipeline installation, the subsoil would be 1 For the Site Assessment Criteria Form AD-1006, IDOA uses a statewide process to determine the construction that would cause the least harm to agriculture and its environment. The Land Evaluation and Site Assessment System is used by IDOA for the Site Assessment Criteria to assist the NRCS with making land use decisions in Illinois. The Land Evaluation and Site Assessment form uses soil surveys to assess the quality of the soils that would be disturbed by the project, and then compares the property location to the surrounding area. Projects that disturb high-quality soils in agricultural areas would need to use more stringent erosion control and mitigation measures to ensure that the project would not significantly reduce the overall qualityof farmland inthose areas. placed on top of the pipeline, then capped by the reserved topsoil, and re-contoured and revegetated with vegetation appropriate to the area in order to restore the lands to their previous conditions. Construction debris and large rocks would be removed fromthe trenches prior to topsoil replacement. To minimize soil erosion, workers would implement BMPs, including covering the soil stockpiles, installing silt and wind fences, and revegetating the exposed soil(see AppendixH, AgriculturalMitigation). The Alliance would implement a monitoring and remediation period of no less than 2 years immediately following initial operation of the pipeline or the completion of initial ROW restoration, whichever occurs last. The 2-year period would allow for the effects of climate cycles, trench settling, crop growth, drainage, soil erosion, etc. to be identified through monitoring and addressed through restoration activities. Essentially, this period would be used to identify any remaining impacts associated with the pipeline construction that would require correction and follow-up restoration, and would allow time for the Alliance to conduct necessaryrestoration(seeAppendixH, AgriculturalMitigation). Spills and Potential Soil Contamination To minimize the potential for soil contamination during construction, the Alliance would update the existing SPCC plan at the Meredosia Energy Center to accommodate the additional elements of the project. The implementation of the revised plan would help to prevent, control, and respond to releases of petroleum products that could potentially contaminate soils per the Oil Pollution Prevention regulations underthe CWA. Meredosia Energy Center The construction laydown areas, oxy-combustion facility, coal-handling system, electrical and control systems, access roads, and water and wastewater systems would be included within the Meredosia Energy Center property, which encompasses 263 acres. A temporary barge unloading facility would be constructed at an existing boat ramp area just north of the Meredosia Energy Center property boundary. An existing gravel road that connects the boat ramps to the main facilities at the site would be improved to handlethe transport of the large equipment from theunloading area to the Meredosia Energy Center. Direct impacts that could be caused during construction of the oxy-combustion facility and its associated elements include removal of soil; soil erosion from wind, water, or construction equipment action; soil compaction; and change in soil composition. Soil removal disrupts soil properties such as permeability and horizon structure, and removes stabilizing vegetation. Soil blowing could cause the movement of topsoil, making it unstable as well as unsuitable for vegetation growth. Soil compaction could cause changes in soil characteristics such as permeability, surface runoff, root penetration, and water capacity. Impacts to soils could result in soil erosion due to runoff and wind, potential decline in nearby surface water quality due to increased sedimentation (see Section 3.6, Surface Water), potential soil contamination due to spills, and a decrease in biodiversity due to changing soil characteristics (see Section 3.8, Biological Resources). Initial project design as presented in the Draft EIS estimated that the construction of the oxycombustion facility and its associated elements at the Meredosia Energy Center could directly disturb up to 164 acres of soil. Of this amount, approximately 146 acres of soils are classified by the NRCS as farmland of statewide importance. However, the current design at the energy center could reduce the area of disturbance to approximately 114 total acres during construction, of which approximately 95 acres are classified as farmland of statewide importance (see Section 2.4.3 for further discussion on estimated impact areas). As stated earlier, soils at the energy center have not been in agricultural use for decades. Most of these soils have been disturbed by previous construction and operational activities at the energy center and have not retained the characteristics of prime farmland soils. As a result, these soils wouldmost likelynot be classified as farmland of statewide importance if theywere assessedtoday. Of the 18 or 19 acres of soil that are not classified as prime farmland (depending on the final project design), approximately 2 acres are classified as hydric, and the remainder are considered Urban soils. Urban soils are likely covered by impermeable surfaces or existing structures at the energy center (see Figure 3.3-2). All of the soils at the energy center are classified as having erosion hazards of slight or moderate;none are characterized as severe erosion hazards. Table3.3-4 lists the maximum acreages of soils that could be disturbed during construction at the Meredosia Energy Center based upon the initial design presented in the Draft EIS, and analyzed as an upper bound of potential impacts. Of the approximate maximum of 164 acres of soil that could be disturbed during construction (based upon the initial design presented in the Draft EIS), 68 acres could be temporarily disturbed and up to 96 acres could be permanently disturbed. However, based on the current design, 114 acres of soil would be disturbed during construction, which includes 73 acres of permanent disturbance and 41 acres of temporary disturbance. At the energy center, temporary impact areas are those that would be disturbed during the construction effort resulting in a temporary change in use before being restored to their original state. The permanent impact areas are those that would be either covered with impermeable surfaces (e.g., lined detention basin, roads, new structures), or permanently changed from their prior use (e.g., forest to field) but remain permeable. Because the exact location of the impermeable structures within the permanent impact areas are not known, the total permanentimpact area is used for the soils impact analysis.The total amount of soilsthat are permanently affected could be smaller once construction is complete, but it would not be larger. Figure 2-14 and Figure 2-15 summarize the temporary and permanent impact areas at the Meredosia Energy Center based on the project design presented in the Draft EIS and the current proposed project design, respectively. Table 3.3-4.

Not prime farmland. b. The Meredosia Energy Center site is an industrial site, and many of the underlying soils have been disturbed since the soil survey was initially performed. Therefore, although soils on the property are categorized as farmland of statewide importance, today these soils would likelynot meet thenecessarycriteriatosupportthisclassification. c. The acreages presented in this table reflect the upper bound of potential impacts, based on the Alliance’s initial design presented in the Draft EIS. Since publication of the Draft EIS, the Alliance reducedthe acreage of the potential impact areas as shown in Figure 2-15. Because the temporary and permanent impact areas on the property would be cleared at the beginning of the construction process, there would be increased potential for topsoil erosion. As described above, implementation of a project-specific SWPPP would further ensure this impact is minor. Topsoil erosion would be prevented by using geosynthetic barriers, silt fencing, and layers of gravel. Potential impacts from spills during construction would also be minor because the existing SPCC plan would be updated to address spill prevention and response procedures for all oils that are stored onsite. The construction employees would be trained in spill prevention and cleanup to prevent any potential soil contamination. The Meredosia Energy Center property is an industrial site, and soils within the existing site boundary have been previously disturbed from construction and operations of the facility. Of the approximate 96 acres of maximum potential permanent soil disturbance, 79acres of soils are classifiedas farmland of statewide importance, although most of these soils no longer exhibit the characteristics of prime farmland soils. Assuch, impacts to prime farmlandsoils atthe Meredosia EnergyCenterwouldbe negligible. CO2 Pipeline The construction of the CO2 pipeline would disturb the area within the construction ROW for the pipeline. The construction ROW would be up to 80 feet in width in most areas, but could be expanded to 100 feet in wooded or hilly terrain to accommodate construction equipment. During construction, temporary impacts to soils from surface disturbance caused by moving equipment, topsoil storage, and other activities would occur within the construction ROW (see Figure 2-19). Pipeline installation would require trenching and trenchless drilling that would occur near the center of the construction ROW. Table 3.3-5 provides the number of acres of prime farmland soils and soils characterized as having a severe erosion hazard within the construction ROW for the southern and northern CO2 pipeline routes based on the criteria in Section 3.3.1.2.  Table 3.3-5.

This table presents the most conservative acreages from that analysisfor eachresource. CO2 = carbon dioxide Since the release of the Draft EIS, the Alliance identified a location for the proposed injection well site (see Section 2.5.2.1). DOE has updated the acreages of soil impacts shown in Table 3.3-5 to account for the Alliance’s currently proposed pipeline routing for the southern pipeline, which extends from the Meredosia Energy Center to the proposed injection well site. Table 3.3-5 also includes additional easement areas (approximately 26 acres) that would be required along the southern route, primarily to facilitate additional construction equipment and activities that would be needed at the locations of trenchless boring activities(i.e.,where the pipeline route crosses roads, railroad tracks, waterbodies, and similar features). The Alliance has not defined any additional routing for the northern route to the proposed injection well site, since it is no longer under consideration. In order to facilitate a representative comparison of the two routes, Table 3.3-5 presents the amount of soil impacts for the northern route including the portion of the pipeline that would traverse the CO2 storage study area based on hypothetical routing scenarios analyzed in the Draft EIS. As explained in Section 3.0, DOE used these hypothetical siting scenarios to evaluate a range of potential impacts, whereby some hypothetical routes would have less impact to physical resources and others would have greater impact,while still representing reasonable routes. The majority of the soils within the southern (272 acres) and northern (248 acres) pipeline routes are considered to be either prime farmland or farmland of statewide importance, which represents 93 percent and 89 percent, respectively, of the total construction ROW for each pipeline route (assuming an 80-foot wide ROW along the entire length). The proposed southern route traverses 13 soil map units that are classified as having a severe soil erosion hazard, totaling 44 acres of the construction ROW. The northern route crosses a maximum of 17 soil map units that have a soil erosion hazard ratingof severe, amounting to 48 acres of the construction ROW. In the event that the Alliance finds it necessary for the pipeline route to deviate from either the southern or northern pipeline routes analyzed inthis EIS, it is expected that impacts would be consistent with those addressed in this section, since the same siting criteria would be followed. Any impacts resulting from surface disturbance to soil resources which occur during pipeline installation would be reduced by implementing the erosion BMPs described in this section. In addition, impacts to prime farmland soils and agricultural uses would be minimized through compliance with the Agricultural Impact Mitigation Agreement (see Appendix H, Agricultural Mitigation), the NPDES permitting requirements, and implementing the SPCC plan, asdescribed above, resulting in a minorimpact. As identified above, the Alliance and IDOA have established an Agricultural Impact Mitigation Agreement (see Appendix H, Agricultural Mitigation) that identifies mitigation measures that would be implemented during pipeline construction to preserve prime farmland soils, includingthe following: • Topsoil would be identified, stripped and stored along the pipeline route, and kept separate from the subsoil. • Stockpiled subsoil would be usedto backfillthe trench prior to replacing the topsoil. • Topsoil would be replaced so that after settling occurs, the topsoil’s original depth and contour would berestored. CO2 Storage Study Area The proposed injection wells and associated surface facilities would be located within the approximately 6,800-acre CO2 storage study area in the northeastern portion of Morgan County (see Figure 2-17). The majority of soils (96 percent) within the CO2 storage study area are considered either prime farmland or farmland of statewide importance. In addition, seven soil types, totaling approximately 605 acres (9 percent) of the CO2 storage study area are characterized as presenting a severe hazard for soil erosion. Because of the high percentage of prime farmland soils within the CO2 storage study area, it is likely that most or all of the soils disturbed during construction of the injection wells, supporting facilities, and roads would be classifiedas prime farmland soils regardlessof the finallocation selected. For the dual-site scenario analyzed in the Draft EIS and no longer under consideration by the Alliance, construction activities would affect up to 28 acres for the injection and monitoring wells and associated facilities; and up to 64 acres for the staging and construction of access roads. The updated design for the single-site scenario would affect up to approximately 15 acres for construction of the injection wells and associated facilities, and up to 4 acres for the access roads. An additional 24 acres would be affected during staging and construction of the monitoring well network, which would include monitoring wells located at the injection wells and within the plume radius (see Figure 2-26). The land not required for the permanent access roads would be returned to agricultural production once construction is complete. Some of the area would be regraded and revegetated once construction was complete, while the fenced areas around the injection well site(s) and the facilities would be removed from agricultural production for the duration of the project. Table 3.3-6 provides the number of acres of prime farmland soils and soils characterized as having a severe erosion hazard within the proposed injection well site under the single-site scenario (see Figure 220). The amount of soils permanently withdrawn is described in Section 3.3.3.2. The Alliance, to the extent practicable, would avoid net reductions in agricultural land by potentially replacing lands taken out of agricultural use with local land that could be placed into agricultural use. However, the total amount of prime farmland soil wouldstillbe reducedby25acres as a resultofthis project. Table 3.3-6.

CO2 = carbon dioxide Impacts to prime farmland soils and agricultural uses would be minimized through compliance with the Agricultural Impact Mitigation Agreement, the NPDES permitting requirements, and implementation of the SPCC plan. As a result, there would be minor, temporaryimpacts to soils from construction within the CO2 storage studyarea. At the injection well site(s), the Alliance would use drilling BMPs, including using secondary containment for all fuel storage tanks, and placing synthetic sheeting in all mud pits and associated circulation equipment. A synthetic liner would be placed beneath the drilling rig, and the drilling contractor would maintain an inventory of absorbent materials (e.g., pads and booms) in order to respond to any release of engine oil, hydraulic oil, diesel fuel, gasoline, antifreeze, drilling fluids or any other contaminants as a result of the driller’s activities. Any spills involving fuel or other liquid or dry chemicals would be cleaned up immediately, including any affected soil. All spill cleanup materials as well as any affected soil would be contained anddisposed of properly. Section 2.5.2.3 provides additional detail on the drilling techniques that would be used to construct the injection wells, including spill prevention methods. As a result, impacts to soils from the construction of the injection and monitoring wellsare expected to beshortterm and minor. Educational Facilities As described in Sections 2.5.3 and 3.0, since the release of the Draft EIS, discussions between the Alliance and Jacksonville civic authorities have focused on a potential site in Jacksonville for the educational facilities, but the specific locations currently remain unknown. The educational facilities could involve new construction, rehabilitation of existing structures, or a combination of new construction and rehabilitation. Although a specific site has not yet been identified, the proposed site or sites for the educational facilities would be areas that have been previously disturbed, with utilities (e.g., electricity, telecommunications, water, and sewer) located on or immediately adjacent to the site or sites. Considering that the selected site(s) would be located on previously disturbed land with utility connections, it is unlikely that additional, new soil disturbance would result from the construction of the educational facilities. No farmland soil impacts would be anticipated. Compliance with NPDES permitting requirements and spill prevention and soil contamination minimization measures as outlined above would ensure effects to soilremainnegligible tominor. 3.3.3.2 Operational Impacts Direct impacts to soils during operation could include soil contamination from hazardous or nonhazardous material spills or soil disturbance during routine maintenance and repairs. These impacts are discussed in more detail below. Overall, impacts to soils from operation of FutureGen 2.0 Project would be minor. Meredosia Energy Center Impacts to soils during operation would be minimal. There would be a minor potential for soil contamination from hazardous and non-hazardous material spills due to storage and transport of process chemicals and wastes at the Meredosia Energy Center. Soils could also be contaminated from fuels, oils, and other fluids used to power onsite vehicles and operational equipment. With effective BMPs and compliance with all federal and state regulations, including a facility SPCC plan for storage and handling of oils, spills would be infrequent and minimized. Personnel would be trained and equipped to respond to spills,so the spills wouldbe cleanedand remediated. Implementationof these measures would ensure that impacts to soils during operations would be minor. CO2 Pipeline After construction, the soils above the CO2 pipeline that previously supported agricultural production, including the operational ROW, would be returned to agricultural production. Pipeline patrolling would be conducted by road, by foot, and potentially by helicopter, and contracted to specialist companies. Access to the pipeline would be through existing access roads or at access points for the new pipeline. These visual surveys would be conducted every 2 weeks and would look for signs of leaks (e.g., discolored vegetation, disturbed soil) and potential infrastructure concerns (e.g., exposed pipe at stream crossings), as required by the DOT. If major repairs or maintenance activities (i.e., periodic hydrotesting) were needed along the pipeline, impacts would be similar to those described for pipeline construction in Section 3.3.3.1. Impacts to prime farmland soils andagricultural uses would be minimized through compliance with the Agricultural Impact Mitigation Agreement (see Appendix H, Agricultural Mitigation) and othermeasures,as described above,resulting in minorimpacts during operation. CO2 Storage Study Area Under the dual-site scenario that was analyzed in the Draft EIS but is no longer under consideration by the Alliance, operation of the CO2 injection wells and supporting facilities would require up to 25 acres (including access roads). However, under the single-site scenario now proposed by the Alliance, operation of the CO2 injection wells and supporting facilities would require approximately 14 acres (including access roads). Based upon the current proposed location of the injection well site under the single-site scenario (proposed option) as depicted in Figure 2-20, approximately 9.5 acres of prime farmland soils or soils of statewide importance would be permanentlychangedto nonagricultural use, resulting in along-term,minorimpact. No additional impacts, beyond those addressed in Section 3.3.3.1, would be anticipated during the operation of the pipeline across the CO2 storage study area to the injection wells. Between 7 and 14acres of prime farmland would be disturbed within the proposed operational ROW; however, agricultural production would beallowed within the ROW up to the fence line ofthe injectionwell site(s). Although highly unlikely, near-surface leaks during injection could cause an increase in CO2 in the soil horizon. Because supercritical CO2 readily vaporizes at atmospheric pressure, an increase of CO2 concentration in the soil could lower the pH of the soil, which could affect plant growth (DOE 2007a). CO2 dissolved in groundwater could also increase the mobility of heavy metals through the soil column. However, periodic integrity testing of each well would eliminate the risk of such a near-surface leakage. As discussed in Section 3.4, Geology, there would be a very low risk that the CO2 would travel up from the Mt.Simon Formation and through the caprockformation; therefore, these types of impacts are not anticipated. Educational Facilities No additional impactsto soils would occur during operation oftheeducationalfacilities. 3.3.4 Impacts of the No Action Alternative Under the no action alternative, DOE would not provide cost-shared funding for the FutureGen 2.0 Project. Although the Alliance may still elect to construct and operate the project in the absence of DOE cost-shared funding, for the purposes of the analysis in this EIS, DOE assumed that the no action alternative is equivalent tothe no-build alternative. Therefore,there would be no changes to physiography and soils underthis alternative. 3.4 GEOLOGY 3.4.1 Introduction This section describes the geologic resources potentially affected by the construction and operation of the FutureGen 2.0 Project and its related components. This section also analyzes the potential direct and indirect effects of this proposed project onthese resources. 3.4.1.1 Region of Influence DOE identified three different ROIs for the analysis of potential impacts to geologic resources. The first ROI addresses potential impacts to geologic formations and landforms resulting from the planned construction and presence of surface facilities at the Meredosia Energy Center property, within the CO2 pipeline corridor, at the CO2 storage study area, and at the site for the proposed educational facilities. This ROI would include any geologic resources underlying or near the proposed project features, and would be restricted to the construction footprint. The second ROI addresses potential impacts to geologic resources resulting from the injection of CO2 into deep geologic formations. This ROI is specific to the formations that would be used for the injection and storage of CO2 (the injection zone) and the lateral extent of the CO2 plume within those formations. Since the Draft EIS was released, the Alliance submitted the UICpermit applications to the USEPA, which identified the proposed locations for the injection wells and the location of the AoR. The permit applications also identified the 25-square mile UIC survey area, which matches the area analyzed in the Draft EIS. The UIC survey area is centered around, and encompasses the CO2 storage study area and is used as the injection ROI. This ROI would includeall potentiallocationsofthe CO2 plume. The thirdROIaddresses potentialimpacts from seismic (i.e.,earthquake)effects on theFutureGen 2.0 Project. The ROI includes the area within a 30-mile radius around the proposed injection well site(s), which covers the area that could be impacted by earthquakes, based on damage reports from past seismic events in the region (USGS 2013). 3.4.1.2 Method of Analysis and Factors Considered The geologic setting for the proposed project includes the glacial deposits, bedrock, and any minerals within the ROIs that have been defined for the project. DOE evaluated the potential effects of the construction and operation of the project on these geologic resources. Several data sources were used to support this analysis, including USGS topographic maps, geologic reports and GIS data from the Illinois State Geological Survey, and USGS earthquake maps. In addition, DOE used data provided by the Alliance from geologic characterization activities conducted in the CO2 storage study area, including a two-dimensional seismic survey and stratigraphic well data. Under its cooperative agreement with DOE, the Alliance completed a stratigraphic well in the CO2 storage study area in December 2011. This well was constructed to allow the Alliance to collect the comprehensive data needed to characterize the geology and hydrogeology of the area. This data will be used to support the design and permitting of the project as well as the analysis of impacts in this EIS. DOE incorporated into the Final EIS the latest project design information and data from the UIC permit applications, which include updates to the CO2 pipeline routes, the CO2 storage study area, the location of the injection wells, and the plumemodeling. CO2 Storage Study Area – 6,800-acre area that would contain the injection and monitoring wells and the CO2 plume. Area of Review (AoR) – an area of approximately 4,000 acres around the injection wells, and determined by computer modeling of the CO2 plume. The dimensions and location are presented in the UIC permit applications. UIC Survey Area – a 5-mile by 5-mile square (25 square miles) area, centered on the CO2 storage study area, used to analyze the USDW and well locations within and around the AoR to support UIC permitting. DOE, the Midwest Geological Sequestration Consortium, and other private entities are researching the possibility for large-scale geologic sequestration throughout the Illinois Basin (NETL 2012a). Three other sequestration projects have been planned or are in operation in Illinois, and are discussed in further detail in Section 4.3, Potential Cumulative Impacts. Two projects are located outside of Decatur, IL, and one is in the planning stage near Taylorville, IL. The information and data gathered from these projects have been usedto support the impactanalysisin this EIS. DOE assessedthe potentialforimpacts basedon whether the proposed FutureGen 2.0 Project would: • Cause or be damaged by geologic-related events (e.g., earthquakes, landslides, sinkholes); • Reduce the value of mineral or petroleum resources or unique geologic formations, or render theminaccessible; • Alter unique geologic formations resulting in the migration of geologically stored CO2 through faults, compromised caprock, or other pathways such as abandoned or unplugged wells; • Cause visible ground heave or upward vertical displacement of the ground surface; or • Affect human exposure to radon gas. 3.4.1.3 Regulatory Framework The injection of CO2 for geologic sequestration is regulated under the authority of the Safe Drinking Water Act’s UIC Program. On December 10, 2010, the USEPA published a final rule, “Federal Requirements Under the Underground Injection Control Program for Carbon Dioxide Geologic Sequestration Wells” (75 FR 77230) (the “Class VI rule”). Under this rule, the USEPA created a new category of injection wells (Class VI wells) with new federal requirements to allow for injection of CO2 for geologic sequestration and to ensure the protection of USDWs. In accordance with the Class VI rule, the Alliance submitted permit applications to the USEPA to obtain UIC Class VI permits for each injection well. Since the state of Illinois does not have the authority to issue Class VI permits at this time, the USEPA would need toissue the permits beforeinjection could commence. The Class VI rule requires operators of Class VI wells to develop, gain approval for, and implement five project-specific plans, including an AoR and Corrective Action Plan, a Testing and Monitoring Plan, an Injection Well Plugging Plan, a Post-Injection Site Care and Site Closure Plan, and an Emergency and Remedial Response Plan. The AoR and Corrective Action Plan describes how an operator intends to delineate the AoR for the Class VI injection well and ensure that all identified deficient artificial penetrations (i.e., wells that are improperly plugged or completed) would be addressed by corrective action techniques so that they would not become conduits for fluid movement into USDWs. The AoR is defined as the region surrounding the geologic sequestration project where USDWs may be endangered by the injection activity. The AoR is delineated using computational modeling that accounts for the physical and chemical properties of all phases of the injected CO2 stream and displaced fluids, and is based on available regional and site characterization, monitoring, and operational data as set forth in 40 CFR 146.84. The Alliance submitted the UIC permit applications for the four proposed Class VI wells in March 2013, and revised the applications in response to USEPA comments in May 2013. The permit applications describe the computer modeling used to predict the lateral extent of the CO2 plume within the injection zone. Appendix G, Geological Report, provides the plume modeling methodology, data, and results that were submitted in the UIC permit applications. Computer modeling was used to simulate the currently proposed injection well configuration of four horizontal injection wells at one injection well site, whereby 1.2 million tons (1.1 million metric tons) of CO2 would be injected per year for 20 years into a horizon within the Mt. Simon Formation. Section 2.5.2.3 has a description ofthe wellsthat the Alliance used for the model analysis. The computer modeling results indicated that the CO2 plume would encompass an area of approximately 4,000 acres, roughly centered on the injection wells. In the UIC permit applications, this area was designated as the AoR. In addition, the Alliance collected data within the 25-square mile (16,000-acre) UIC survey area, centered on the 6,800-acre CO2 storage study area, to identify any existing deep wells that have the potential to be confining zone pathways. The analysis in this section uses the 25-square mile UIC survey area when characterizing potential impacts resulting from the injection of CO2 into the injection zone. The Class VIrule also requires the identification of the USDWs withinthe AoR that could be affected by injection activity (40 CFR 146.81(d)). Section 3.5, Groundwater, describes the USDWs in the CO2 storage studyareain more detail, alongwithpotential impactsto these aquifers. The UIC Class VI permit applications present the location of the injection wells and the delineated AoR. The Alliance would reevaluate the AoR at least every 5 years after the issuance of the UIC Class VI permits, which would consider the volume of CO2 injected, the resulting subsurface CO2 plume, and any other results from the MVA program. The Alliance may also be required to update the injection procedures, AoR, or MVAprogram. 3.4.2 Affected Environment 3.4.2.1 Regional Geologic Setting The FutureGen 2.0 Project would belocated in the Central Lowland Province, which is further subdivided into till plain areas based on glacial topography. The delineation of the till plain areas is based on the change of sedimentary deposits from the glaciations of the Illinois and Wisconsin episodes (USGS 2011a). In the Central Lowland Province, the topography is generally flat, although scarps and moraines are present in the region. The FutureGen 2.0 Project is located within the Springfield Plain, which is also flat with very localized variations in topography from the glacial deposits from the Illinois episode. Beneath the glacial deposits is a deepsequence of sedimentarybedrock that formed over a period of millions of years. The ages of the bedrock units range from the Pennsylvanian (300 million years) Spoon-Carbondale formation to the Precambrian metarhyolite basement (540 million years). Metarhyolite is a volcanic rock that has been altered by heat and pressure over time. The remainder of this section providesadditional detailson the geologic formations that underlietheproject area. Surficial Geology The topography of Morgan County has low relief, which is incised by small streams that flow to the Illinois River. The elevation ranges from 400 feet in the west, near the Illinois River, to 700 feet above sea level in the east. The northwestern and southern portions of Morgan County tend to have deep valleys and narrow upland ridges, while the eastern portion is nearly level to slightly undulating. The Illinois River forms the western border of Morgan County. Adjacent to the river is a flat floodplain with alluvial sediments deposited over the remnants of an ancient glacial channel. The floodplain extends eastward for approximately 2 miles until it reaches a series of sand outwash hills that stretch from north to south (Hajic and Leigh 1985). These hills rise 100 to 120 feet above the river valley. The Illinois episode drift deposits in Morgan County are also covered by fine, wind-blown sediment (loess)from the Wisconsin episode. The most common glacial formations in Morgan County include the Cahokia, Glasford, and Peoria Formations (ISGS 2011a). The Cahokia Formation is present in the floodplain area between the Illinois River and the glacial bluffs. The formation consists of stratified silt, clay, loess, and sand deposits that were deposited after the last glacial event (Wisconsin episode) and reworked by the Illinois River. The Cahokia Formation is approximately 100 to 200 feet thick around the Illinois River (Piskin and Bergstrom 1975). Loess deposits are not usually found immediately around the Illinois River because the soils have been extensively reworked by the flow of the river. Starting at the bluffs, and extending eastward, is the glacial till plain of the Glasford Formation, which was deposited during the Illinois episode, and then covered by loess of the Peoria Formation during Wisconsin episode (ISGS 2011a). The Cahokia Formation is also found in the bottom of stream valleys, such as Snake Creek, where the glacial tills have been reworked by stream action. The Glasford Formation is comprised of glacial tills interbedded with sandy outwash deposits. The thickness of the glacial till generally increases from west to east; however, the thickness is extremely variable, ranging between 25 and 100 feet from Meredosia to Jacksonville (Piskin and Bergstrom 1975). Soils in eastern Morgan County are formed from the Peoria Loess, which was draped over the deeper till and drift deposits at the end of the Wisconsin glacial event. The Peoria Loess decreases in thickness from west to east, from over 20 feet outside of Meredosia to 10 feet in the CO2 storage studyarea (ISGS 2011b). Bedrock Geology The FutureGen 2.0 Project components would be located in the western shelf of the Illinois Basin, which covers an area of about 110,000 square miles in parts of Illinois, Indiana, and Kentucky. The bedrock sequence within the basin consists of thousands of feet of sandstone, shale, and carbonate layers over a basement of ancient granite and rhyolite. The sediments that formed the bedrock were deposited in alluvial fans and shallow water in a variable coastal environment during the Paleozoic era, starting 570 million years ago. There are no bedrock formations younger than the Pennsylvanian epoch (300 million years ago) in the Illinois Basin, which indicates that the basin ceased to grow and the dominant sedimentary processes changed from deposition to erosion. The presence of an erosion contact between formations in the bedrock sequence also represents a period ofhalting deposition and subsequenterosion. A primarycharacteristic ofthe IllinoisBasin’s westernshelf is the presence of broad, parallel sedimentary layers that do not display any major faults (Alliance 2013a). The major structural feature in the bedrock at Morgan County is the Sangamon Arch, a broad, gently curving anticline, whose “ridge” runs roughly east-northeast from Jacksonville to Champaign (ISGS 1995a). The arch causes the bedrock in Morgan County to gently dip about 1 to 2 degrees to the southeast. Figure 3.4-1 shows a representative cross section of the bedrock formations in Morgan County. The bedrock is shown dipping to the east; therefore, the bedrock closesttothe surface tends tobecome younger fromwestto east. Figure 3.4-2 presents a detailed stratigraphic column for the formations present at the CO2 storage study area.The figure details the formationdepths basedonmeasurements takenfromthe stratigraphic well that was completed by the Alliance in fall 2011. The well was drilled through the Mt. Simon Formation and into the Precambrian metarhyolite basement to a depth of 4,826 feet bgs. Descriptions of the formations are provided in thetext below. Mississippian and Pennsylvanian Formations The shallowest bedrock formations are located in the eastern portion of Morgan County. The youngest formation in the FutureGen 2.0 Project area is the Spoon-Carbondale Formation, which was deposited in the middle Pennsylvanian epoch, and consists of shale deposits with sandstone lenses. The Spoon-Carbondale presents a small section of a larger sequence of alternating marine and non-marine sediments that have been identified in other areas of the Illinois Basin (Willman et al. 1975). The upper and lower contacts oftheformation are erosionalsurfaces. The next sequence of formations was formed in the Mississippian epoch, when much of Illinois was beneath a large inland sea. As such, the individual formations and members tend to taper out from east to west, as the deposits were controlled by the depth of the water and location in relationtothe coastline and rivers (Willman et al. 1975). These formations are characterized by alternating sequences of dolomitic limestone, calcareous shales, and light grey limestones that slowly change in composition from one formation into the one above. The Mississippian formations in eastern Morgan County are the St. Louis Limestone, SalemLimestone, WarsawShale,Keokuk-Burlington Limestone, and Hannibal Shale. The St. Louis and Salem Formations are fine-grained, cherty limestone formations. The St. Louis is laterally extensive, and is truncated at the top by an erosion unconformity (Willman et al. 1975). The Warsaw Shale is comprised of gray shale and silty limestone with numerous invertebrate fossils. The Keokuk-Burlington Limestone is a fine-grained, cherty limestone, with numerous microfossils. It gradually becomes siltier as it grades upwards to the Warsaw Shale. The Hannibal Shale is a green to gray, clay-rich shale with abundant microfossils. Source: Alliance2013a Dev = Devonian; Dol = Dolomite; Fm = Formation; Ls = Limestone; Quat = Quaternary; Sdst = Sandstone; Sh = Shale; Sil = Silurian; Sltst = Siltstone Figure 3.4-1. Cross Section of the Bedrock through Morgan County In western Morgan County, near the Meredosia Energy Center the sequence of Mississippian formations is the Burlington-Keokuk Limestone, Fern Glen Formation, and Meppen Limestone (ISGS 2005). The Fern Glen consists of red and green calcareous shale, shaley limestone, and a base of large, yellowish gray limestone, with abundant invertebrate fossils. The Meppen Limestone is a tan dolomitic limestone with smallcalcite geodes. Silurian and Devonian Formations The New Albany Shale is an Upper Devonian-Lower Mississippian formation that is comprised of black, organically rich marine shales. The New Albany has an erosion contact with the Devonian Limestone with thin beds of sandy material near the base and carbonates near the top of the formation. The New Albany Shale is the primary source of oil and gas in Illinois, although its presence at a location does not guarantee the existence of economicallyrecoverableoilor gas deposits (CluffandDickerson 1982). Beneath the New Albany Formation are two undifferentiated formations, which are part of the Hunton Limestone Megagroup. These Silurian and Devonian formations are very thin because tectonic activity at the time changed the area’s sediment deposition patterns and increased erosion. The Silurian and Devonian formations are local deposits of fine-grained limestone, with numerous microfossils. These formations have erosion contactsatthe base and top. Source: Alliance2013a Dol = Dolomite; ft GS* = feet below ground surface; Fm = Formation; Mbr = member; Sh = Shale; Sltst = Siltstone; Ss = Sandstone; USDW = underground source of drinking water Figure 3.4-2. Generalized Stratigraphic Column for the CO2 Storage Study Area Upper Ordovician Formations The Upper Ordovician formations include the Maquoketa Shale, Galena Limestone, Platteville Limestone and Dolomite, and the Joachim Glenwood Dolomite. Each of these formations has upper and lower erosion contacts, which represent multiple episodes of deposition and erosion of the unconsolidated sediments. Theformationstend to befine grained and low porosity. The Maquoketa Shale contains gray to dark brown shale, while the Galena Limestone has fine limestone, which contains numerous fossils, and is occasionally capped by dolomite. The Plattesville Limestone/Dolomite consists of brown, slightly shaley limestone and impure dolomite. The Joachim-Glenwood Dolomite are two formations that cannot be differentiatedwithinthestratigraphic well, and are characterized bylight gray, clay-rich, silty and sandy dolomite, with beds of brownish gray, and relatively pure dolomite. Sandy bedsand otherinclusions mayalso be present(Willman et al. 1975). St. Peter Formation The St. Peter Formation is an Ordovician-age, well-sorted, poorly-cemented, quartz sand with little clay or carbonate inclusions. The formation was deposited in a beach environment in a period of increasing water depth (Willman et al. 1975). An erosion contact occurs between the Shakopee Dolomite and the St. Peter. In Illinois, the St. Peter is a well-known bedrock aquifer with salinity that varies from northwest to southeast. Maps of the aquifer salinity show that the St. Peter aquifer contains water with total dissolved solids between 2,500 and 10,000 milligrams per liter at the storage area (ISGS 2004). Samples taken from the stratigraphic well confirm that the salinity concentration is less than 10,000 milligrams per liter. Section 3.5, Groundwater, contains additional hydrogeologic information about the St. Peter Formation. The St. Peter is also a well-documented natural gas storage formation with 38 gas reservoirs throughout Illinois. In the early 1950’s, the Panhandle Eastern Pipeline company acquired gas storage rights to inject natural gas in the Waverly dome of the St. Peter Formation, about 15 miles south of the CO2 storage study area. After injecting approximately 5,500,000 million cubic feet of natural gas over 5 years, injection was discontinued through 1960 (Bell 1961). Lower Ordovician and Upper Cambrian Knox Group The formations between the St. Peter and the Eau Claire, which were deposited in the Ordovician and Cambrian, are correlated to the Knox Group, which is found throughout the Illinois Basin (Swezey 2009). Regionally, the Knox Group consists of impermeable, dense dolomites, and few thin sandstone formations. At the stratigraphic well, the Knox group consists of about 1,500 feet of bedrock. From top to bottom, the Ordovician formations within the sequence are the Sakopee Dolomite, New Richmond Sandstone, Oneota Dolomite, and Gunter Sandstone. The Shakopee Dolomite is a thick, clay-rich to pure fine-grained dolomite with some thin beds of sandstone, siltstone, and shale. Beneath the Shakopee is the New Richmond Sandstone, a fine-to medium-grained sandstone with some interbedded sandy dolomite. The Oneota Dolomite is a fine-to coarse-grained cherty dolomite with minor amounts of sand and thin shaley beds at the base. The Gunter Sandstone consists of medium-to fine-grained quartz sand and is generally thin throughout the basin. The Oneota Dolomite/Gunter Sandstone sequence is bounded in the top and bottom byerosional contacts with the surrounding formations. The rest of the formations (Eminence Dolomite, Potosi Dolomite, Franconia Dolomite, and the Ironton-Galesville Sandstone) were deposited in the Cambrian. The Eminence Dolomite is a medium-grained dolomite with some chert and thin beds of sandstone, while the Potosi Dolomite is a relatively pure dolomite. The Franconia Dolomite is a clay-rich dolomite sequence that is separated into two members: the Derby-Doerun and the Davis. The Davis is a widespread, low-permeability shale that grades upwards into the silty and sandy dolomite of the Derby-Doerun Member. The Ironton-Galesville Sandstone is a calcareous coarse sandstone, and contains a deep subsurface aquifer. The formation has been used for natural-gas storage in the Waverlyfield in southeastMorgan County.  Eau Claire Formation (Confining Zone) The Eau Claire Formation consists of dolomite, dolomitic sandstone, limestone, siltstone, and shale, with no erosion contact between its base and the top of the Mt. Simon Formation, (Willman et al. 1975). The Eau Claire has been identified throughout Illinois, with thicknesses that range from less than 200 feet in western Illinois to greater than 1,000 feet in the southeast (Willman et al. 1975). The Eau Claire is composed of three members, which reflect the increasing water depth in the depositional environment. The upper layer is the Proviso siltstone member, which consists of dolomite and sandy siltstone with beds of greenish gray, pink, or red shale. Below the Proviso is the Lombard dolomite member, which consists of glauconitic and sandy dolomite interbedded with greenish gray shale (Willman et al. 1975). The underlying Elmhurst member consists of sandstone with thin, irregular gray shales, which gradually contains more carbonate and fine-grained material as it grades into the Lombard member. The Proviso and Lombard members make up the confining zone, while the Elmhurst member is included in the injection zonewith the Mt. Simon Formation. Mt. Simon Formation (Injection Zone) The Cambrian-age Mt. Simon contains one of the Illinois Basin’s major deep saline aquifers and is considered the best formation for carbon sequestration in the region. The DOE estimated that the CO2 storage capacity for the Mt. Simon Formation is approximately 12 to 165 billion tons (11 to 150 billion metric tons) (NETL 2012a). The Mt. Simon is comprised of fine-to coarse-grained quartzose-cemented sandstone that is partially conglomeratic, with some lenses of micaceous shale toward the top of the formation. In the southern Illinois Basin, the Mt. Simon Formation formed from distal alluvial fan deposits from the granitic highlands and likely included extensive braided river deposits, barrier islands and deltaic environments (Bowen et al. 2011; Leetaru and McBride 2009). Over time, accumulating sediment and tectonic movement shifted the depositional environment to more extensive braided fluvial systems, with a gradual transition to a marginal marine environment that formed the shales of the Eau Claire (Bowen etal. 2011). The Mt. Simon is present throughout Illinois, with thicknesses that range from over 2,000 feet in the northeast to 500 feet or less in the south-southwest. For years, natural gas has been successfully stored in the Mt. Simon in 50 wells throughout north-central Illinois. This suggests that the formation exhibits characteristics, such as sufficient permeability and porosity, which make it suitable for long-term gas storage. The total dissolved solids concentration in the brine that was sampled at the stratigraphic well (at a depth of 4,050 feetbgs) was 48,000milligramsperliter. Precambrian Metarhyolite and Sedimentary Breccia At the base of the Mt. Simon is a thin layer of fractured and weathered rhyolite wash deposits (sedimentary breccia), which are weathered remnants of the Precambrian metarhyolites and granites that form the base of the Illinois Basin. The basement metarhyolite is medium to coarse-grained, silica-rich, volcanic rock, with an age of approximately 1.47 billion years. After it was formed, the Precambrian basement was subjected to long periods of heat and pressure, which reorganized the mineral structure of the bedrock. Seismic Activity The presence or absence of faults and seismic activity is particularly relevant to carbon sequestration projects because faults, if present, could provide preferential pathways for injected or displaced fluids to migrate from the injection zone. The proposed project area is located in a relatively low risk zone for earthquakes, with no major mapped faults within or near the proposed project areas. In addition, no known large, structural faults occur in Morgan County (ISGS 1995b). The nearest major fault zone to the project area is the Wabash Valley Seismic Zone, which is located along the Illinois and Indiana border, approximately 150 miles southeast of the energy center and 180 miles southeast of the CO2 storage study area. The New Madrid Fault Zone, which has been the source of magnitude 7.0 or greater earthquakes in the central United States, is located approximately 210 miles south of the energy center and the CO2 storage study area. Historically, earthquakes from either of these two fault zones have not caused damage in central Illinois. To identify past earthquakes that could have been felt at the project sites, USGS earthquake records were searched in a 30-mile radius around the FutureGen 2.0 Project areas. Since 1973, when the USGS and other government agencies started monitoring seismic activity in the United States, no earthquakes have been recorded within 30 miles. However, historical documents show that at least two earthquakes occurred within the seismic ROI before the start of seismic monitoring. One earthquake occurred approximately 15 miles northeast of the CO2 storage study area and 37 miles northeast of the energy center, just outside of Petersburg, Illinois. The earthquake occurred on November 10, 1923, with an estimated magnitude of 3.3 (Stover et al. 1984). Another earthquake occurred on July 19, 1909, with an estimated magnitude of 4.5. This earthquake occurred approximately 26 miles directly north of the CO2 storage study area, and 40 miles northeast of the energy center (Stover et al. 1984). These earthquakes were alsotheclosestreported earthquakes to the Meredosia EnergyCenter. Through the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program, the USGS has generated a geologic seismic hazard probability database to estimate the potential for earthquakes in the United States. The database is built from data on known fault sequences and historical earthquake data. Models generated from the database showthe probabilityof a damage-inducing earthquake at alocation. According to this data, there is less than a 1 percent chance that a magnitude 5.0 or greater earthquake would occur within 30 miles of the FutureGen 2.0 Project in the next 50 years (USGS 2012a) for any of the areas proposed for the construction and operation of the proposed project. This is the lowest probability rating for the model. For shaking hazard potential in the next 50 years, there is a 2 percent probability of exceeding a peak horizontal acceleration of 8 to 10 percent of the gravity coefficient (USGS 2012b). Peak horizontal acceleration of 10 percent of the gravity coefficient is considered capable of minor structural damage in normal buildings. These model results show that the Morgan County area is considered part of the tectonicallystable section of North America(see Figure 3.4-3). Economic Mineral Resources In Illinois, oil and gas deposits were initially discovered in the early 1860s. The most productive oil and gas formations, deposited in the Mississippian to lower Pennsylvanian epochs, are generally absent in Morgan County. Three gas fields are located along the eastern edge of the county. The Prentice field is located south of Ashland and has 25 oil and gas wells that were drilled in the 1950s and 1980s. Oil and gas fromthe Prentice fieldhas been produced from small stratigraphic traps in the shallow Pennsylvanian formations (e.g., Spoon-Carbondale), at depths of 250 to 350 feet bgs. As of 2009, there were no producing wells, and many of the wells in the field have been plugged, although at least one well was drilled to 279-foot horizon in 2012 (ISGS 2012b). The Jacksonville field is located directly east of the city of Jacksonville, and contains more than 75 wells drilled between 1900 and 1984. The wells were drilled between 350 and 500 feet deep, primarily to the Pennsylvanian bedrock. The field was first discovered in 1910 and had produced a total 10,400 barrels by the end of 2009. As of 2009, there were three producing wells (ISGS 2012b). The Waverly field natural-gas storage site in the southeast corner of Morgan County originally produced oil from a structural trap in Silurian carbonates called the Waverly Dome. The field no longer produces oil, butthefield hasbeen used for natural gas storage sincearound 1954 (Alliance 2013a). The Herrin, Springfield, and Colchester coal-bearing formations are present in the southern portions of Morgan County; however, they are very thin or absent in the project area. Minable subsurface coal deposits are found to the southeast of the CO2 storage study area, with the closest active mine located 10 miles away. Three closed sand pits are located on either side of Interstate (I-) 104, on the west bank of the Illinois River. The farthest sand pit is located about 625 feet north of the highway, while the other two pits are located 160 and 380 feet south of the road. Aerial photos showthat excavation likely started around 1939, but by 1956, the pits were overgrown and no longer used (ISGS 2011c). Source: USGS 2012b %g =peak horizontal acceleration asa percent of the gravity coefficient Figure 3.4-3. Peak Horizontal Acceleration Values (as %g) with a 2 Percent Probability of Exceedance in 50 years 3.4.2.2 Meredosia Energy Center The Meredosia Energy Center is located within the Illinois River valley. The topography at the energy center is very flat up to the riverbank, which then drops about 20 feet to the Illinois River. The Cahokia Formation is the primary surficial deposit at the Meredosia Energy Center. The bedrock at Meredosia is buried beneath the glacial and river sediments. The shallowest formations at the energy center are the Meppen Limestone, the Fern Glen Formation, and theBurlington-Keokuk Limestone. 3.4.2.3 CO2 Pipeline The CO2 pipeline to the CO2 storage study area would initially cross deposits of the Cahokia Formation, then the Glasford Formation, which is covered by the Peoria Loess. The CO2 pipeline would also cross several bedrock formations. Starting at the Meredosia Energy Center, the proposed CO2 pipeline would initially cross the older Mississippian formations (e.g., Burlington-Keokuk Limestone), then the Warsaw-Chouteau limestone, in the central section of the corridor. The final approach of the CO2 pipeline corridor to the CO2 storage study area crosses the Spoon-Carbondale Formation and undifferentiated Middle Pennsylvanian bedrock. 3.4.2.4 CO2 Storage Study Area The surficial geology for the CO2 storage study area consists of the Glasford Formation, which is approximately 75 to 100 feet thick and covered with 10 to 15 feet of loess deposits. The topography at the CO2 storage study area gradually slopes towards stream channels that drain to the Illinois River to the west. The Spoon-Carbondale Formation isthe bedrock formation that occurs beneaththe glacial deposits. CO2 would be injected into the Mt Simon Formation; however, the injection zone for the FutureGen 2.0 Project is comprised of both the Mt. Simon Formation and the Elmhurst Member of the Eau Claire Formation (see Figure 3.4-2). The Mt. Simon has several characteristics that are beneficial for CO2 storage; it is consistently deep (over 3,900 feet), laterally continuous, and a relatively permeable formation that is bounded by several impermeable layers. At the CO2 storage study area, the Mt. Simon is approximately 500 feet thick, located at approximately 3,900 feet bgs to 4,400 feet bgs. The formation thickness gradually increases towards the east and can be found in outcrops throughout the midwestern and eastern states (Bowen et al. 2011). The Elmhurst Member is 66 feet thick. The total thickness of the injection zone (including both the Mt. Simon Formation and the Elmhurst Member) at the CO2 storage studyarea is 565 feet. In January 2011, the Alliance performed a two-dimensional seismic survey on public roads throughout the CO2 storage study area. The profiles show a thick sequence of the Mt. Simon Sandstone with no visible faulting (Alliance 2013a). In addition, the Alliance measured the permeability and porosity of the formations in the stratigraphic well. The measurements confirm that the confining zone has much lower permeability and porosity levels than the injection zone, as measured at other sites (Griffith et al. 2011; O’Connor and Rush 2005). The horizontal permeability for the injection zone ranges from less than 0.1 millidarcies to 300 millidarcies, withlower values at the contact with themetarhyolite basement, then gradually increasing in the center of the Mt. Simon, then starting to decrease again as it grades to the Elmhurst member (Alliance 2013a). The vertical permeability in the injection zone ranges from less than 0.1 millidarcies to 400 millidarcies and varies between each of the depositional layers of the injection zone. The porosity in the injection zone ranges from 5 to 20 percent, with the greater porosity in the middle of the Mt. Simon (Alliance 2013a). The permeability and porosity ranges measured in the stratigraphic well were similar to those used in the early plume modeling analysis of the Mt. Simon Formation, which used a horizontal permeability of 37 to 417 millidarciesand porosity of 9.6 to 17.1 percent. The Mt. Simon Formation is confined between metarhyolite at its base and the Proviso and Lombard Members of the Eau Claire Formation. These two upper members of the Eau Claire Formation make up the primary confining zone (caprock formation) and are located between 3,838 and 3,425 feet bgs. Together the Proviso and Lombard Members comprise 413 feet of low porosity and permeability caprock. The members have been correlatedto layers in Pike County, and have beensuccessfullyused as confining layers for 38 natural gas storage reservoirs across Illinois (Alliance 2013a). The permeability values decrease from the base of the Lombard upwards through the Proviso, which mirrors the decreasing amount of silt found in the Eau Claire Formation (Alliance 2013a). The Proviso horizontal permeability ranges from 0.0001 millidarcies to 0.1 millidarcies. Permeabilities of the Lombard member range from 0.0001 millidarcies to 9 millidarcies. The porosity for the Lombard member is between 5 and 10 percent, with greater porosity at the base of the formation. The Franconia Dolomite is located from 3,286 and 3,072 feet bgs, and forms a secondary confining zone. The formation is comprised of low-permeability shale andsiltydolomite. The deepest USDW at the CO2 storage study areais the St. Peter Formation, which is about 200 feetthick and occurs at approximately 1,740 feet bgs. It is located approximately 1,480 feet above the Proviso Member of the Eau Claire. A USDW is an aquifer that is used or could be used to supply drinking water. Section 3.5, Groundwater, provides additional detail on the presence of USDWs in the CO2 storage study area. There are several wells located within the UIC survey area, including 24 water wells, which are typically drilled within the first hundred feet of the surface. The use and location of these wells are described in Section 3.5, Groundwater. The discovery of three oil and gas fields in Morgan County surrounding the CO2 storage study area in the early 20th century resulted in exploratory wells being drilled in the area, including the UIC survey area. None of the oil and gas fields is located within the survey area, although the Prentice gas field and Jacksonville field are located within a mile of the survey area boundary (2,500 feet east and 3,000 feet south, respectively). The Waverly field is located about 13 miles south of the UIC survey area boundary. There are 22 oil, gas, gas storage, and research wells within the survey area (see Figure 3.4-4). Table 3.4-1 presents the well types, range of depths, their purpose, and the status as logged with the Illinois State Geological Survey. Most of these wells were drilled to investigate the presence of coal, gas, or oil and were plugged or abandoned afterwards. At the CO2 storage study area, the top of the Eau Claire Shale (the primary confining formation) is 3,425 feet bgs, which is well below the deepest oil and gas well. Table 3.4-1.

Oil, Gas, and Gas Storage Wells in the Underground Injection Control Survey Area 3.4.3 Impacts of the Proposed Action This section analyzes the potential for impacts based on the criteria listed in Section 3.4.1.2 and the affected environment information found in Section 3.4.2. Impacts resulting from increased soil erosion or groundwater contamination (including potential contamination of USDWs) are discussed in Section 3.3, Physiography and Soils, and Section 3.5, Groundwater, respectively.  3.4.3.1 Construction Impacts Meredosia Energy Center Construction of proposed project components at the energy center would have negligible impacts on the local geology. The major equipment at the Meredosia Energy Center would be constructed on deep foundations, which would provide additional stability for the structures. Construction would primarily occur on previously disturbed land at the Meredosia Energy Center site, so construction would not affect geologic resources unique to the region. Activity during construction would not induce seismicity in the area, and the flat topography would preclude impacts from landslides or subsidence. There are no coal beds or oil and gas deposits in the area, so no economic minerals would be affected by the construction at theMeredosia EnergyCenter. CO2 Pipeline Construction of the CO2 pipeline would occur at a depth of at least 4 feet in loess and glacial till. The Alliance does not anticipate that any blasting would be required for the pipeline installation. Due to the overalllow topographic relief of the terrain that would be crossed by the pipeline corridor, construction of the pipeline is not expected to require any stabilization efforts to ensure that landslides or ground instability would not be induced as a result of construction. As needed, standard construction practices and BMPs used in the pipeline construction industry, as described in Section 3.3, Physiography and Soils, would be implemented to minimize the potential for construction to result in locally induced ground instability. Pipeline construction procedures would also follow IDOA guidance, which would ensure safe storage of topsoil and proper restoration of the surface topography (Appendix H, Agricultural Mitigation). There would be no impact to the local geologic resources from construction of the pipeline, because the construction would only temporarily disturb the glacial deposits, which would be replaced once construction is completed. For the portion of the pipeline that would extend into the CO2 storage study area, the impact analysis in the Draft EIS used hypothetical end-of-pipeline spurs to evaluate a range of reasonable siting scenarios (see Section 3.0). Since the release of the Draft EIS, the Alliance identified the proposed location for the injection well site (see Section 2.5.2.3) and established pipeline routing within the CO2 storage study area for the southern route to the proposed injection well site. Since the Alliance does not plan to move forward with the northern pipeline route, final routing within the storage study area was not identified for the northern route to the injection well site. The pipeline route could ultimately deviate as a result of final project design and coordination with landowners; however, the same siting criteria would be followed and impacts would be consistent with those addressed in this section. The impacts to the geology from construction of the pipeline within the CO2 storage study area would be negligible,similar totheimpactsfor therest oftheCO2 pipeline, as described above. The project is locatedina relatively low risk zone for earthquakes, with no major or mapped faults within or near the proposed CO2 pipeline. Based on these conditions, there is minimal potential for geologically related impacts to occur either to the proposed pipeline or to geologic resources during pipeline construction. CO2 Storage Study Area Construction of the injection wells in the CO2 storage study area would have a negligible impact on the local geology. Up to 4 injection wells and 12 deep and shallow monitoring wells would be constructed at the CO2 storage study area. The existing stratigraphic well would be converted for use as a single-level monitoring well for the injection zone. Construction of the wells would remove some bedrock, although the amount would be negligible and not unique to the region. Drilling and installation of the injection wells would not induce seismicity, nor would it cause landslides or subsidence. The Alliance submitted the UIC Class VI permit applications to the USEPA in March 2013 and is working with the USEPA to complete the permitting process. Under the dual-site scenario analyzed in the Draft EIS and no longer under consideration by the Alliance, the injection and monitoring wells and associated infrastructure and buildings would be constructed on a maximum of 28 acres within the CO2 storage study area. An additional 64 acres would be utilized to support construction of access roads. Under the Alliance’s currently proposed single-site scenario, 42 acres would be required to support construction activities. Local fill may be required during the grading process; however, the use of materials would not reduce the overall availability of the gravel and other fill. As a result, the construction of the facilities would have a negligible impact to the local geologic resources. Educational Facilities The educational facilities would be located in or near Jacksonville, Illinois. The Alliance would either renovate existing structures or build new facilities. In either case, the construction activities would have a negligibleimpact ongeologic resources. 3.4.3.2 Operational Impacts Meredosia Energy Center Impacts to geologic resources from the operation of the oxy-combustion facility at the Meredosia Energy Center would be negligible and limited to areas of soil-related impacts, as discussed in Section 3.3, Physiography and Soils. No onsite or nearby geologic resources (e.g., valuable gravel or clay or other deposits) are known to exist that could be impacted by operation of the facility. Operation of the oxycombustion facility would not be expected to result in seismic effects that could lead to damage of structures or facilities; result inimpacts to,or render inaccessible, anyunique geologic resources; or result in displacement of the ground surface. CO2 Pipeline There would be negligible impacts to geologic resources from the operation of the proposed CO2 pipeline. Pipeline repairs or maintenance may be required during operation; however, these activities would only disturb surficial and near-surface soils that were previously disturbed during construction of the pipeline. Operation of the pipeline would not be likely to result in any seismic effects that could damage structures; result in destruction of high-value or unique geologic resources; render any such resources inaccessible; orcause displacement ofthe groundsurface. CO2 Storage Study Area During operations, CO2 would be injected into the Mt. Simon Formation through up to four injection wells located in the CO2 storage study area. Since the release of the Draft EIS, the Alliance identified the proposed location for the injection well site using the results of plume modeling, the characterization activities, and the siting criteria detailed in Section 2.5.2.1. The Alliance would operate the injection wells under the UIC Class VI permits issued by the USEPA, which would include the procedures and practices for CO2 injectionandmonitoring.  The Alliance evaluated several injection well configurations using both vertical and horizontal injection wells at one or two injection well sites. After consideration of site-specific data from the stratigraphic well, the Alliance is currently proposing to operate up to four horizontal injection wells at one injection well site for the annual injection of 1.2 million tons (1.1 million metric tons) of CO2 over a 20-year period. Under normal operating conditions, 64 percent of the CO2 flow would be split equally between two of the wells while the remaining two wells would receive 17 and 19 percent of the flow. The injection wells would be constructed to provide operational flexibility and backup capability, such that one well could be taken off line while the remaining three injection wells receive 100 percent of the flow. The horizontal injection would occur along the final 1,500 to 2,500 foot section of each injection well, allowing the CO2 to infiltrate through a single horizon within the Mt. Simon Formation at about 4,030 feet bgs. Over the course of the injection period, the individual CO2 streams from each of the four wells would merge to form a combined plume.  The Alliance conducted modeling using the Subsurface Transport Over Multiple Phases (STOMP)-CO2 computer programto predict the areal extent and distribution of the CO2 plume for the proposed injection well configuration. Data from the stratigraphic well, as well as data collected from hydrologic testing, wireline logging, and vertical seismic profiling, was used to support the modeling effort. The formations within the injection zone and confining zones were modeled as horizontal layers that simulated the hydrogeologic characteristics of each formation. The Alliance used multiple variables to model the formation (e.g., vertical and horizontal permeability and porosity, rock and grain density, capillary pressure) and the reservoir (e.g., temperature, fluid pressure, salinity), combined with the injection stream values (pressure, saturation) to determine the lateral extent of the plume after 20 and 70 years. The Alliance ran the model to determine the maximum extent of the plume, the time period of pressure buildup and drop off, and a sensitivity analysis to determine the most significant parameters for determining plume size (i.e., fracture gradient and porosity). Appendix G, Geological Report, contains the technical report detailing the model’s inputs, assumptions, and outputs. As shown in Figure 2-26, the plume model predicted that the CO2 plume would occupy a subsurface area of approximately 4,000 acres withinthe CO2 storage studyarea. The first step to safely manage the injection and storage of CO2 is the selection of a site with characteristics that make it suitable for the long-term storage of CO2. The USEPA has outlined a set of siting requirements to ensure that site proponents demonstrate that there is a viable injection zone and a separate, competent confiningzone (caprock formation) at the project site (USEPA2013b; 75 FR 77230). The Mt. Simon Formation is an ideal target for sequestration, as research has shown that it contains the characteristics that support long-term storage of CO2 (Zhou and Birkholzer 2011; DOE 2011a; Griffith et al. 2011; NETL 2012a). At the CO2 storage study area, the Mt. Simon Formation is located over 3,900 feet bgs and is laterally continuous and about 500 feet thick, as described in Section 3.4.2 and shown in Figure 3.4-2. It is capped by members of the Eau Claire Formation, which consists of 400 feet of siltstone and shale layers. Brine aquifers in sandstone formations that formed in braided fluvial environments, such as the Mt. Simon Formation, are believed to be ideallysuited for fluid storage, because the shale lenses in the sandstone allow the plume to spread and react with the brine before reaching the caprock formation (Berger et al. 2009). These characteristics are particularlyevident in the transition between the Mt. Simon Formation and the Elmhurst member ofthe Eau Claire. There are several geologic resource impacts that could occur as a result of the injection and storage of CO2. These impacts couldinclude: • CO2 migration out of theinjectionzone and into a USDW; • Earthquake generation; • Ground surface displacement;and • Increasedhuman exposure to radon gas. DOE expects adverse impacts to geologic resources to be unlikely and negligible to minor for a variety of reasons that are addressed in the remainder of this section. Although CO2 sequestration technology is still evolving, injection regulations, site selection methods, industry BMPs, and additional mitigation procedures would minimize the potentialfor impacts. CO2 Migration As supercritical CO2 is injected into a deep saline formation, the brine (saline groundwater) is displaced and flows away fromthe injection wells through the interconnected pore space. Because the injected CO2 is less dense than the surrounding groundwater, buoyancy causes the CO2 to rise within the injection formation to lower-pressure zones until it is stopped by laterally extensive impermeable layers (e.g., the caprock layer or confining zone). Generally, as CO2 filters through the formation, it starts to slowly mix and dissolve with the brine, creating a denser, mildly acidic solution. However, if a pathway exists between the injection zone and the shallower formations that overlie the confining zone, CO2 could migrate vertically from the injection zone into shallower bedrock formations. This can occur if there are faults or fractures in the caprock seal or if the CO2 pressure exceeds the capillarypressure of the caprock. In addition, a leak could occur if the injected CO2 finds a pathway through a more permeable zone within the caprock (Griffith et al. 2011). CO2 could also migrate upward along improperly sealed injection well casings, or improperly abandoned wells that penetrate the caprock. Given the site investigation and characterization undertaken by the Alliance and studies that have been conducted by the Illinois State Geologic Survey over many years, the existence of unknown faults, fractures, or wells within the CO2 storage area is highly unlikely. CO2 is trapped in the injection zone by four primary mechanisms: (1) structural trapping, (2) residual CO2 trapping, (3) solubilitytrapping, and (4) mineral trapping. These trapping mechanisms are dependent upon the physical and chemical properties of the CO2 and the injection zone. Figure 3.4-5 shows the comparative effectiveness and time delay for the different types of trapping mechanisms. Mechanisms that take longer to occur (solubility trapping, mineralization) are also more effective for long-term trapping (Liu and Maroto-Valer 2011). Structural trapping is the retention of the injected CO2 by a physical barrier (the impermeable caprock). Residual CO2 trapping (or hydraulic trapping) occurs as the formation acts like a sponge, capturing CO2 in the pore spaces. The effectiveness of residual trapping is dependent upon the permeability and porosity of the injection zone. Solubility trapping occurs when CO2 dissolves in the brine, forming a liquid that is denser than the host brine. The dissolved CO2 and brine may sink in relation to the surrounding brine. Mineral trapping occurs when the injected CO2 reacts with minerals in the brine or the formation to form carbonate minerals. In the Mt. Simon Formation, carbonate minerals that could be formed through mineralization would include iron carbonate precipitates. The presence of feldspar in the Mt. Simon Formation may enhance mineral trapping (Alliance 2013a). The Mt. Simon Formation contains lenses of shale within the sandstone layers, which would likely increase the storage capacityof the formation by forcing the CO2 to move laterallyas its buoyancycauses it to migrate upward (Ambrose et al. 2008; Bowen et al. 2011; Zhou et al. 2010). This would provide additional exposure to brine and pore space, which would improve the potential for long-term trapping of CO2. As part of the site selection and UIC permitting process, the Alliance performed seismic studies and modeling to determine how the Mt. Simon, Eau Claire, and overlying formations are draped over the metarhyolite basement and whether any local fracture or fault systems intersect the confining zone. The studiesfound noindications of faults ortectonicfracture zones in the bedrocklayers and it is unlikelythat any undetected faults or fracture zones are critically stressed (Alliance 2013a). While there is no evidence of vertical fractures or fissures in the shallow subsurface in the CO2 storage study area, some of the well logs indicated that karst zones may be present in some of the dolomite formations around 1,600 feet bgs. These zones are encased within carbonate units with low permeability, located over 1,500 feet above the primary confining layer (caprock) (Alliance 2013a). It is very unlikely that CO2 could reach these dolomite formations because the primary confining zone would inhibit the upward migration of CO2. The secondary confining zone and several layers of dense, low permeability dolomite would also impede upward migration. A review of the drilling records of existing water, oil, and gas wells in the UIC survey area determined that the only well penetrating the injection zone is the stratigraphic well drilled by the Alliance in 2011. This well, which would be used as a deep monitoring well, was specifically designed to be resistant to brine acidification by CO2, and has been cemented with CO2-resistant cement to prevent upward CO2 migration. The next deepest well was drilledto1,530 feet bgs, well above the injection zone. Therefore, it is very unlikely that CO2 would migrate up through existing well bores or abandoned wells, because it would first have to escape from the primary and secondaryconfiningzones toreach the next deepest well. CO2 migration up the injection well bores is a potential threat to containing CO2 in the Mt. Simon Formation. The Alliance would design and construct the injection wells by following CO2 injection well BMPs, using CO2-resistant cement to construct the injection wells within the injection zone, and cementing each string casing up to the surface (see Figure 2-24 and Figure 2-25) (NETL 2013b). A CO2resistant cement that is specifically designed to prevent casing degradation from contact with the acidic brine would be used in the production casing where it crosses the injection and primary confining zones. A corrosion inhibited potassium chloride brine, or similar fluid, would be used in the space between the pipe (tubing) that delivers the CO2 into the well and the well casing (annular space) (see Figure 2-24 and Figure 2-25). To prevent the CO2 from infiltrating the annular space, the packer assembly, which secures the well tubing and separates the annular space from the perforated section of the well, would be maintained at a pressure sufficient to contain the injected CO2. The packer assembly would be designed for an estimated pressure differential of 500 pounds per square inch (psi), including a factor of safety. Prior to injection, extensive testing would be conducted on the injection wells to ensure the integrity of the tubing, annular fluid and cemented casings. For example, pressure testing, wireline logging, and mechanical integrity testing, would be performed to ensure that the casing can withstand the injection pressures and thatthe cement has curedproperly. Acidic brine solution can also dissolve minerals, which could increase the salt and heavy metal concentration in the brine. However, models have shown that the quartz-rich Mt. Simon Formation would tend to be resistant toaciddissolution(DOE 2007a). As a result of the BMPs and design elements that the Alliance would execute in the design and construction of the injection wells, the leakage of brine fromthe injection zone up through the well casing is considered unlikely, and as a result, impacts to geologic resources fromvertical brine leakage wouldbe considered negligible to minor. In general, brine from the injection zone that is displaced by the injected CO2 can migrate from the point of injection either vertically (potentially up through the confining zone) or laterally (Zhou et al. 2010). The injection of CO2 would displace brine and increase the pressure within a portion of the injection zone, gradually decreasing with distance from the injection wells. For UIC permitting purposes, the pressure front is defined as a zone of elevated pressure, where the pressure differential is sufficient to cause movement of CO2 or brine into a USDW (USEPA 2013c). Models that simulate the increased pressure from CO2 injection have been used to investigate the potential for brine migration and have shown that while the confining zone does prevent vertical CO2 migration (provides structural trapping), the pressure front can be strong enough to force small amounts of brine from the injection zone into shallower formations (Birkholzer et al. 2009; Lemieux 2011). This process would occur over tens of years, as the displaced brine is first forced into the Mt. Simon pore space before it can migrate vertically (Zhou et al. 2010). If the brine does passthrough thecaprock and reaches a shallower (less than 3,500 feet bgs), permeable formation, it would likely also spread laterally within the formation, slowing its vertical migration. The temperature and density differential between the injection zone brine and the shallower formation would cause the dense brine to stay within the lower-most region of the formation. Birkholzer et al. (2009) determined that vertical brine migration through a sequence of layers into shallow aquifer bodies (e.g., USDW), would be extremely unlikely. Brine could migrate with CO2 through permeable pathways through the caprock; however, as mentioned above, the project site selection would minimize this potential effect. Overall, the impact from brine migration would be minor because it would be extremelyunlikelythat it wouldreach the deepest USDW. Brine in the injection zone can also be displaced laterally, although the models show that the lateral movement would be slow and not much faster than the natural groundwater flows in deep saline aquifers, on the scale of inches over hundreds of years (Birkholzer et al. 2009; Zhou et al. 2010). For the Mt. Simon, this means there is no potential for displaced brine to migrate up-dip (i.e., towards the northeast) to the potable Mt. Simon aquifers in the northern Illinois Basin. The closest potable Mt. Simon aquifer is over 50 miles away (Zhou et al. 2010; Brower et al. 1989). Because the displaced brine would remain within the vicinity of the CO2 storage study area, the impacts from up-dip brine migration would be negligible. Ongoing monitoring and modeling would serve as an important means of reducing the potential for impacts to geological resources from the proposed project. The plume modeling conducted by the Alliance, as discussed earlier, projects that injected CO2 would remain within the CO2 storage study area and remain stable after 70 years (see Figure 2-26). The Alliance ran the plume model for over 300 years to determine the greatest extent of the aerial plume and the peak pressure differential within the formation. Although the plume does change slightly throughout the modeling period, the variation from the maximum plume extent becomes insignificant after the injection period. The pressure differential also peaks at the end of the injection period, but slowly dissipates to 90 percent of the peak within the first 100 years ofinjection (Appendix G, Geological Report). As part of the proposed CO2 MVA program, the Alliance would conduct monitoring to detect migration of injected or displaced fluids, should migration occur, so that potential long-term impacts to geologic resources may be minimized or avoided (e.g., by correcting deficiencies in well construction, adjusting injection and production rates or locations, or other appropriate mitigation strategies). While some of the monitoring would be required by the Class VI injection regulations, the Alliance is also planning to use additional monitoring techniques for research purposes. A preliminary CO2 monitoring program is summarized at the end of this section and has been described in the MVA plan that was submitted with the UIC permit applications. Considering the proposed mitigation measures (i.e., the well integrity testing program and the CO2 monitoring and verification program) and the low probability of CO2 leakage from the injection zone, potential impacts related to migration of injected and displaced fluids through improperly sealed wellsorunknown faults or fracturepathways are expected to be negligible to minor. Induced Seismicity The expanding use of pressurized fluids in hydraulic fracturingand wastewaterinjectionhas increasedthe visibility of human-induced seismic effects in energy projects (NRC 2012; Ellsworth et al. 2012; Suckale 2010). DOE recognizes the public’s interest in human-induced seismicity from geologic sequestration, as CO2 would be injected into asalineaquifer within a sandstone formation deep within the earth’s crust. The remainder of this section addresses the potential for the project to induce seismicity basedon currentlyavailable information. A report produced in 2012 by the National Research Council (NRC 2012) summarized the latest research into induced and triggered earthquakes as a by-product of energy production, which includes carbon sequestration. Currently running projects, such as the Sleipner field in Norway, the In Salah gas field in Algeria, and the Illinois Basin-Decatur Project (by the Midwest Geological Sequestration Consortium) in Decatur, Illinois were used to characterize the potential risk of seismic events from the injection of CO2. The report notes that no harmful seismic events have been connected with any of these projects, although their injected volumes are still considered small-scale (NRC 2012). From the review of seismic events from other injection-related energy technologies (e.g., geothermal, enhanced oil recovery, wastewater injection), the National Research Council identified an apparent correlation between the net fluid balance (difference between the amount of fluid injected and withdrawn) and the maximum magnitude of seismic events at an injection well. However, this analysis is extremely site-specific, and the report notes that it cannot be used to predict earthquake magnitudes for an entire region or industry. In areas that are already predisposed for faulting and earthquakes, the combination of increased pore pressure and potential hydrochemical-mechanical effects of liquid CO2 in saline formations could increase the potential for seismic risk on induced or triggered earthquakes. This risk could be mitigated through lowering the fluid viscosity, using lower injection pressures, and implementing site-specific limits to permanent pressure change within the injection zone. Ultimately, the National Research Council determined that there is not enough large-scale data to accurately analyze the seismic risks from geologic sequestration, and that additional test projects would be needed to expand the knowledge base. Data gathered from operating the FutureGen 2.0 injection wells would be used to help furtherthe overall researchinthis area. There are three types of seismic events that could be caused by subsurface fluid injection: microseismic, induced, and triggered seismicity. Microseismic events are low-intensity (too small to be felt by humans, magnitude less than 2) seismic occurrences that occur when the host formation is fractured by injecting large quantities of fluid under high injection pressures (NRC 2012; IPCC 2005). Hydraulic fracturing uses this method to increase formation permeability when extracting natural gas. An induced seismic event occurs when the increase in pore pressure introduces large changes to the local stress field and reactivates an existing fault. A triggered seismic event would occur if the CO2 or migrating brine reduced the friction along a fault line, which reduced the amount of stress needed to generate an earthquake. In theory, a triggered seismic event could happen without being influenced by the injection pressures, while microseismic orinduced events are unlikelyto occur naturally (Oldenburg 2012). As discussed above, an increase in pore pressure as a result of injection has been identified as a major factor in microseismic and induced seismicity. The pressure field would change three times during injection: (1) the early stage with little pressure interference, (2) an intermediate stage with transient changes between injection wells, and (3) a final stage in which the fields have intermingled and there was a continuous pressure buildup fromthe injection wells (Zhou et al. 2010). The pressure field could extend laterally for tens of miles, gradually decreasing with distance from the injection wells (Zhou et al. 2010). Pressure can be reduced over time as brine is displaced from its original location. Modeled studies of large-scale injection in the Mt. Simon Formation have projected that the formation can safely accommodate the pressure changes within the fractional pressure buildup thresholds deemed safe by naturalgas entities inthe region (Zhou and Birkholzer2011). Although there are no known faults or seismic-related structures at the CO2 storage study area, the large CO2 volumes that would be injected at the site could increase the potential for seismic activity, especially if they are not monitored and managed correctly. Excess pressurization at the injection wells could cause microseismic events (bedrock fracturing). The pressure response would depend on the boundary conditions of the injection zone. Each formation has a fracturing pressure threshold, where additional stress applied would cause the formation to fracture and cause microseismic events. Excessive injection pressure can also limit the storage capacity of a formation, as it represents the inability of the host brine and earlier injected CO2 to move out of the way of the newly injected CO2. The potential for microseismic events to occur can be limited during injection operations by maintaining the injection pressure below the fracturing pressure threshold for both the injection zone and confining zone formations. In the modeling that the Alliance conducted, a pressure gradient of 0.65 psi per foot was used. The injection zone would be between 4,000 and 4,400 feet bgs, for a calculated fracture pressure of 2,600 psi at 4,000 feet bgs and increasing to 2,860 psi at 4,400 feet bgs. Pursuant to the USEPA UIC Class VI regulations, the injection pressures must not exceed 90 percent of the fracture pressure in order to protect the confining zone and to prevent fractures from forming. The pressure constraint is required to maintain the CO2 in a supercritical state during injection, while preventing fractures from forming in the injection and confining zone formations. As part of the MVA plan, the Alliance would monitor the injection pressure at the surface and within the formation to ensure that the fracture threshold is not exceeded, which would substantiallyreduce the riskfor induced seismicity. By activelymonitoringthe injectionand formation pressures, the Alliance would be able to adjust the injection rate to ensure that the injection pressures remain withinthelimits ofthe UICpermits,andtherefore remain below thefracturethreshold. The primary method to prevent seismic events is through careful site selection during the planning process, and monitoring the CO2 and formation pressures during injection. In cases where fluid injection has been positively attributed to small, triggered earthquakes, the earthquake foci were connected to mapped faults that were miles long (Frohlich et al. 2011). There are no mapped faults in the UIC survey area, and the Sangamon Arch is the only structural feature in Morgan County, which indicates that the stresses strong enough to cause visible faults and deform bedrock have not been present for hundreds of millions of years. In the subsurface seismic study of the CO2 storage study area, no faults were found in the injection and confining zones. This suggests that induced or triggered seismic events would be very unlikely, as the seismic stability of the location and lack of faults would minimize the potential that the CO2 or increased injection pressure could mobilize an existing fault. The impacts due to the increased potential for injection-induced events would be minor because the Alliance would follow the procedures in the injection plan to ensure that the maximum fracture pressure threshold is not exceeded in the injection or confining zone formations. The Alliance would also construct a multi-level monitoring well that would be designed to measure the pressures at several different layers above the caprock, and use it to help regulate the formation pressure during injection. Surface Deformation Injection of large quantities of fluid, such as supercritical CO2, can cause small changes to the ground surface that can be measured by sensitive equipment, as seen in some oil and gas fields (McColphin 2009). Research at the In Salah CO2 injection site in Algeria has shown that the ground surface around the injection site tends to rise when injection starts, and then starts to settle as injection tapers off (Onuma and Ohkawa 2009). At the In Salahgas field,the surface deformation occurred at a rate of up to 7 millimeters (0.3 inches) per year and was measured using radar technology from satellites. The rate also varied based on the well location, which may be related to the underlying bedrock structure (Onuma and Ohkawa 2009). Other technologies, including tiltmeters and differential global positioning system receivers can also be used to measure the changes, since the deformation is too small to be visually perceived (McColphin 2009). Measuring subtle surface changes can also be a cost-effective way to estimate the location of the CO2 plume (NETL 2012b). As surface deformation is related to the plume size, any changes would occur close to the injection wells, and remain within the CO2 storage study area. While surface deformation monitoring is not required under the UIC regulations, the Alliance is considering using a variety of technologies (e.g., tiltmeters or satellite surveys) in addition to the monitoring techniques outlined in the proposed MVA plan. The monitoring program that the Alliance would implement would ensure that any surface deformation is measured and monitored; therefore, impacts due tosurface deformation are expectedtobe localized totheinjectionwell site(s) and minor. Radon The USEPA has labeled Morgan County as an area that has a high potential for radon gas, which indicates a predicted average indoor radon level over 4 picocuries per liter (USEPA 1993). In Morgan County, the Illinois Emergency Management Agency (IEMA) has recorded 40 homes that were tested for radon, of which 28 (70 percent) recorded over 4 picocuries per liter of radon (IEMA 2012a). As a result, nine mitigationsystems have been installed(IEMA 2012b). If CO2 were to escape the injection zone and increase pore pressures in the shallow unsaturated soil zone, it could potentially displace radon. As stated above, the potential for a leak from the injection zone is considered unlikely. As a result, the chance that CO2 could leak from the injection zone and reach the shallow soil is considered to be highly unlikely, and any increase of CO2 in the soil would not have a pressure great enough to displace radon gas. The monitoring procedures described below would identify any CO2 migration before it reaches shallow soils and affects radon concentration at the surface; therefore, impacts resulting from the potential for increased exposure to radon gas are considered to be negligible. Monitoring and Verification Overall, the potential impacts from CO2 leaving the injection zone would be minor, as the injection well site(s) havethe characteristics needed for long-term carbon sequestration. The potential for impacts would be further reduced by implementing various monitoring and verification techniques to identify the CO2 plume, detect CO2 leaks, and monitor brine movement and formation pressure. This section addresses the monitoring technologies that could be implemented as part of the project to further reduce the likelihood of the impacts discussedabove. The UICClass VIrule regulates CO2 injection for sequestration, including the monitoring proceduresthat would be implemented in support of the proposed FutureGen 2.0 Project. The UIC Class VI rule requires the establishment and implementation of a monitoring program to demonstrate the integrity of the injection wells and monitor the location of injected CO2. In addition, the program must be able to detect leaks and identify procedures for quickly implementing remediation activities in the event that an issue is identified. As part of the monitoring program, and at regular intervals, the Alliance would identify the CO2 plume location during the operation and post injection periods to determine the movement of the plume boundary. Both the USEPA and NETL have provided guidance for designing and implementing a monitoring program that complies with the UIC Class VI requirements (USEPA 2013c; NETL 2013b; NETL 2012b). The Alliance proposes to undertake five major types of monitoring: (1) mechanical integrity testing, (2) operational testing, (3) groundwater quality monitoring, (4) plume and pressure front monitoring, and (5) near-surface gas (soil and surface air) monitoring. Each of these types of monitoring would have its own timeline based on the status of the injection wells. Mechanical integrity testing would assess the reliabilityof theinjectionwells and would occur prior to injection, during the injection phase, and prior to well plugging. Injection monitoring would occur during injection and include analyzing the CO2 stream; monitoring the rate, pressure, and volume of injection; and monitoring the well for corrosion. Groundwater monitoring would occur at set intervals before, during, and after the injection period by using a monitoring well network to assess groundwater quality and groundwater pressure at various depths. Pressure front monitoring would be used to track the pressurefront and the CO2 plume during and after injection and would be used to update the AoR after injection had ceased and the injection wells had been closed. Soil and air monitoring would involve the collection of air samples from the ambient area and from shallow soils above the injection zone to monitor for changes in concentrations of CO2 that could indicate a leak. The USEPA has suggested, but not required, that a suite of monitoring activities be implemented (USEPA 2013c) based on the characteristics of each site. Soil and gas monitoring may be required at the UIC Program Director’s discretion, based upon site-specific characteristics and the potential that CO2 could reach a USDW. The Underground Injection Control (UIC) Program Class VI Well Testing and Monitoring Guidance (USEPA 2013c) describes each monitoring requirement, the reason why it is included, and the applicable regulatory citation in greater detail. These monitoring technologies can also be used to support monitoring that would satisfythe GHG reporting requirementsof CAA Subpart RR. The Alliance designed a monitoring program to address all requirements of the UIC Class VI regulations and the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule. Monitoring would be conducted through each stage of the project, including construction, operations, and post injection to identify and address any instance of well breakdown, CO2 leak, or other adverse impacts. As part of the UIC Class VI permit applications, the Alliance provided an injection plan and post-injection MVA plan, which outlines the monitoring techniques that would be implemented to protect USDWs. The Alliance would reevaluate the AoR and MVA plan every5 years (at a minimum) after the issuance of the UIC Class VIpermits. This reevaluation would consider the volume of CO2 injected during the previous 5 years, the pressure at which it has been injected, and the resulting CO2 plume. Injection and monitoring procedures would be revised, added, or removed, or the duration of monitoring activities would be changed depending on the actions of the CO2 plume. Monitoring techniques that the Alliance proposed as part of the MVA plan are summarized in Table 3.4-2. Additional monitoring activities may also be considered, but have not been included in the table. The Alliance would also report injection amounts to the USEPA annually, as required by the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule, by calculating the amount of CO2 retained within the injection zone usinga mass balance approach (USEPA 2010f). The Alliance characterized the injection and confining zones and designed the injection wells to minimize the potential of a CO2 release. If, however, an adverse event were to occur during construction or operation, the Alliance would deploy a variety of emergency or remedial responses, depending on the characteristics of the event (e.g., the location, type and volume of a release). The immediate response would be to stop drilling or injection, in order to assess the situation. The Alliance would then conduct an investigation to determine the cause of the event by reviewing monitoring records, checking the well casing, annulus seals and down-hole pressure. The Alliance could also perform geophysical surveys to support the investigation. Depending on the cause of the event, several solutions could be implemented, including repairing the well casing, lowering the reservoir pressure by removing brine or CO2, increasing the upstream reservoir pressure (e.g., creating a hydraulic barrier), diverting the CO2 stream, or modifying the injection flow rate or quantity. In certain situations, an injection well could be sealed with cement or USDW groundwater remediation could be implemented if necessary. All emergency and remedial response procedures are described in detail in the MVA, which was included with the UIC permit applications. Section 2.5.4 describes the closure procedures for the injection wells at the end of the 20-year injection period. During the injection period, the Alliance would work with the UIC ProgramDirector torefine and finalize the Post-Injection Site Care and Closure Plan, which would detail the plugging and abandonment of the wellsand future monitoringactivities. Educational Facilities There would be no direct or indirect impacts to local geology from the operation of the educational facilities. Use of the facilities by employees and visitors would not affect the geologic resources or regional economic mineralresources. 3.4.4 Impacts of the No Action Alternative Under the no action alternative, DOE would not provide cost-shared funding for the proposed FutureGen 2.0 Project. Although the Alliance may still elect to construct and operate the project in the absence of DOE cost-shared funding, for the purposes of the analysis in this EIS, DOE assumed the no action alternative is equivalent to the no-build alternative. Therefore, the project would not be constructed and there would be no change to the local geologic resources. In addition, CO2 injection would not occur under the no-build alternative, so there would be no change to the subsurface within the CO2 storage studyarea. Table 3.4-2.

This section also analyzes the potential directandindirecteffects of this proposedproject onthese resources. 3.5.1.1 Region of Influence The ROI for groundwater resources includes the drinking water aquifers that underlie the Meredosia Energy Center, CO2 pipeline corridor, CO2 storage study area, and the educational facilities, which have the potential to be contaminated from spills during construction and operations. The ROI includes the aquifers that would be usedas a source of waterto support construction and operations. The ROI also includes the drinking water aquifers within the UIC survey area, as identified in the UIC permit applications, which overlie the anticipated CO2 plume. This ROI encompasses a 25-square mile survey area, centered on the CO2 storage study area (see Section 3.4, Geology). Computer modeling of the CO2 plume suggests that the plume would encompass an area of approximately 4,000 acres around theinjectionwellswithin the CO2 storage studyarea. 3.5.1.2 Method of Analysis and Factors Considered The affected environment for the FutureGen 2.0 Project was characterized using GIS data from the Illinois Natural Resources Geospatial Data Clearinghouse, drinking water aquifer reports produced by the IDNR, USEPA water quality reports, and water source data from the Meredosia Water Department and the Meredosia Energy Center. DOE determined potential impacts to groundwater resources based on anticipated project water requirements, spill prevention and mitigation BMPs, and the results of computer modeling of the CO2 plume. DOE also incorporated into the Final EIS the latest project design information and data from the UIC permit applications, including updates to the CO2 pipeline route, the CO2 storage study area, the location of the injection wells, and results of the plume modeling. DOE assessedthe potentialforimpacts basedonwhether the proposedFutureGen2.0 Project would: • Deplete groundwater supplies on a scale that would affect available capacity of a groundwater source for use by existing water rights holders, or interfere with groundwater recharge; • Conflict with established water rights, allocations, or regulations protecting groundwater for future beneficial uses; • Potentially contaminate shallow drinking water aquifers due to chemical spills, well drilling or wellcompletion failures; • Conflict with regional or local aquifer management plans or goals of governmental water authorities; or • Potentially contaminate a drinking water aquifer (i.e., USDW) due to migration of CO2 or brine (saline groundwater) into the aquifer from CO2 injection, or through contamination by chemical spills,well drilling,well development,or well failures. 3.5.1.3 Regulatory Framework The injection of CO2 for geologic sequestration is regulated under the USEPA’s UIC Program (see Section 3.4, Geology, for additional details), which protects underground drinking water resources from contamination by waste injection. In 2010, the USEPA designated a new UIC classification (Class VI) specifically for geologic sequestration of CO2. This new class of regulations includes minimum technical criteria for the permitting, geologic site characterization, injection well construction and operation, monitoring requirements, and post-injection requirements. Identification of the deepest source of drinking water in relation to the injection zone is a critical part of the permitting process. The USEPA defines a USDW as anaquifer, or part ofan aquifer, withthe followingcharacteristics: • Supplies any public water system or contains a sufficient quantity of groundwater to supply a public water system and currently supplies drinking water for human consumption or contains fewer than 10,000 milligrams per liter oftotal dissolved solids; and • Is not an exempted aquifer. The UIC Program works with state and local governmentsto oversee underground injection in an effort to prevent contamination of drinking water resources. The program requires that the permit applicant demonstrate the integrity of the confining zone between the injection zone and the deepest USDW. All injection wells require authorization under general rules or specific permits. The Alliance would apply for Class VI Geologic Sequestration Well Permits from the USEPA, which would cover the injection activities fortheproposed FutureGen 2.0 Project. 3.5.2 Affected Environment 3.5.2.1 Regional Hydrogeology In Illinois, potable groundwater is usually obtained from near-surface aquifers composed of deposits of sand and gravel, or from deeper limestone or sandstone formations. Some sand and gravel aquifers can produce large quantities of water from relatively shallow depths and are used to provide water for many municipalities and industrial users. The deeper limestone and sandstone formations that exist below the sand and gravel aquifers are used to supply groundwater in the northern third of Illinois, but as the formations dip to the southeast in the Illinois Basin, they become more saline (briny) and unsuitable for most purposes. In Morgan County, shallow sand and gravel aquifers are the primary USDW. Drinking water is also obtained from the Illinois River. Figure 3.5-1 presents the areas where sand and gravel aquifers are present within the ROI. The map shows major sand and gravel aquifers, which are defined as aquifers capable of yielding at least 70 gpmof potable water, and shallow sand and gravel aquifers that are located less than 50 feet bgs (ISGS 2004). In western Morgan County, the primary sand and gravel aquifer is directly influenced by the Illinois River, which follows an ancient lake and riverbed formed and then buried during the Wisconsin Episode of glaciation. The major sand and gravel aquifers have a greater potential to support municipal and industrial users, while individual users may still be able to withdraw water from small, localized aquifers. In areas without a major aquifer, groundwater is likely present between thin layers of sand and gravel and confined in layers of clay, which restricts groundwater flow and precludelarge withdrawals. Shallow bedrock formations (less than 500 feet bgs) do not typically exhibit the yields and water quality required to support commercial and industrial users in the area. Shallow Pennsylvanian formations consist principally of shale in Morgan County. They are not considered a potential source of potable groundwater except for thin beds of sandstone or fractured limestone that may yield small domestic supplies. The Mississippian formations in Morgan County dip to the southeast at about 10 to 40 feet per mile (Woller and Sanderson 1979). The Burlington-Keokuk Limestone and the Salem Limestone units of the Mississippian System contain the principal bedrock aquifers, but their yield greatly depends on the fracture sequences within the bedrock. The Salem Limestone has the potential to support domestic and farm supplies, although yields are marginally adequate. Formation depths range from 175 feet in the northwest part of Morgan County to about 650 feet in the southeast (Woller and Sanderson 1979). The salinity and mineral concentration increases with depth in the Salem Limestone groundwater. In the east and the south, the Salem Limestone is as much as 200 feet thick and is overlain by the St. Louis Limestone. These two units have limited potential for water supply uses and may contain mineral concentrations too high formost uses. Source: ISGS 2004 < = less than; CO2 = carbon dioxide; ft = feet Figure 3.5-1. Shallow Groundwater Aquifers Major deep bedrockaquifers (greaterthan 500 feet bgs) are also located in Morgan County. Theseinclude the Mt. Simon, St. Peter, and Ironton/Galesville Formations. However, these aquifers are not used as sources of public drinking water in Morgan County because of their depth and salinity (Woller and Sanderson 1979). Of the three major deep bedrock aquifers, only the St. Peter Sandstone has a mineral concentration within USEPA drinking water standards (ISGS, 2004; Alliance 2013a). However, the St. Peter Sandstone lies at a depth of about 1,750 to 1,950 feet, and its salinity is high enough that it is unusable as drinking water (without treatment) and the state of Illinois does not consider it a source of drinking water. There are no sole source aquifers in the state of Illinois. A sole source aquifer is one that supplies at least 50 percent of the drinking water consumed in an area where no alternative drinking water sources can supply those who depend upon the aquiferfordrinking water. 3.5.2.2 Meredosia Energy Center The Meredosia Water Department withdraws water from the Illinois River and a shallow sand and gravel aquifer to produce drinking water. The water department serves a population of approximately 1,040 people (USEPA 2011i) and provides potable water that meets USEPA water quality standards, with no health-based violations in the past 10 years. While there were incidences of monitoring and reporting violations in 2007 and 2009, compliance was achieved within three months of the end of testing (USEPA 2011i). The Meredosia Water Department pumps groundwater from production wells that were first installed in 1950 (Woller and Sanderson 1979) into a sand and gravel aquifer. Currently, the utility withdraws water from two wells that were drilled in 1980 at depths of 90 and 92 feet (ISGS 2012c). The wells are located approximately one mile south of Main Street and have an approximate capacity of 300 gpm (Midwest Technology Assistance Center 2009). The sand and gravel aquifer system from which these wells withdraw water is hydraulically connected to the Illinois River, so it has a good withdrawal capacity and is considered an unconfined aquifer (Midwest Technology Assistance Center 2009; Anliker and Woller 1998). In 1995, the village of Meredosia and the Meredosia Energy Center each withdrew approximately 0.06 mgd from the sandandgravel aquifer (Anlikerand Woller 1998). In addition to the Meredosia Water Department, several industrial and other private users operate their own well systems in the area. Most groundwater wells around the Illinois River extend 50 to 130feet bgs (Gibb et al. 1979). Farms and residences not connected to the Meredosia public water supply use their own wells to extract water from sand and gravel aquifers. The majority of the groundwater withdrawn through private wells is used for crop irrigation along a 6-mile strip of farmland between the bluffs and the Illinois River (Gibb et al. 1979). In 1995, manufacturing plants south of Meredosia and the Meredosia Energy Center withdrew a combined 3.13 mgd of groundwater from large capacityshallow wells(Anliker and Woller 1998). There isno regional groundwater plan for Morgan County or the local aquifer. Although regional groundwater levels vary based on the Illinois River level, the local ground surface elevation, and season, the average groundwater levels for the Meredosia Energy Center wells are approximately 23 to 25 feet bgs. The Illinois State Water Survey conducted pumping tests on one of the groundwater wells at the Meredosia Energy Center (Ameren well 6) to evaluate the characteristics of the sand and gravel aquifer in this area. From these tests, it was determined that the transmissivity of the aquifer is 100,000 gpd per foot and the hydraulic conductivity is 1,200 gpd per square foot (Gibb et al. 1979). Transmissivity is a parameter used to characterize the amount of water that can be transmitted horizontally through an aquifer, while hydraulic conductivity is a parameter used to characterize the ease with which water can flow through an aquifer. These values of hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity can be attributed to the high permeability of the sand and gravel aquiferandthefact that the Illinois River is hydraulicallyconnected to the aquifer system.  At the end of 2011, Ameren suspended operations at the Meredosia Energy Center. While it was operating, the Meredosia Energy Center withdrew makeup water and potable water from the major sand and gravel aquifer using three production wells (Wells 5, 6, and 7). The Ameren wells are screened in sand deposits near the base of the Cahokia Formation, at approximately 103 to 106 feet bgs. Each well has a capacity of approximately 500 gpm. Two older wells (Wells 3 and 4) are still present on the energy center site but have not been used since before the energy center suspended operations. The energy center also supplemented the process water supply with an intake in the Illinois River (Anliker and Woller 1998). Table 3.5-1 presents an estimate of the amount of groundwater withdrawn from the three Ameren wells, as reported by Ameren tothe Illinois State Water Survey under the Illinois Water Inventory Program. The general decrease in annual water use in 2008-2009 is attributable to Ameren reducing the use of boilers for energy production. Table 3.5-1.

The IEPA assessed the vulnerability of groundwaterto contamination from ash ponds throughout the state and categorized facilities with ash ponds into two priority groups according to their potential to cause groundwater contamination. Priority1 facilities were identified in areas where there is a high potential for aquifer recharge and an existing or future population that depends on the groundwater as a source of drinkingwater. Priority2 facilities have a low potential for aquifer recharge and existing or future potable uses inthe area. Because the ash ponds at the Meredosia Energy Center are located above a potable aquifer with a high potential for recharge, the facility was categorized as Priority 1 (IEPA 2011c). As a result, Ameren submitted a hydrogeologic assessment plan, which was accepted by the IEPA, and is conducting groundwater monitoring on a quarterly basis. The IEPA analyzed the groundwater flow direction at the Meredosia Energy Center and determined that groundwater flows toward the river. Therefore, potential contamination from the ash ponds would not impact the drinking water wells near the facility. Ameren is continuing to maintain theash ponds and is working with the IEPAonits management strategy. 3.5.2.3 CO2 Pipeline As the proposed CO2 pipeline corridor leaves the Meredosia area, it crosses the major sand and gravel aquifer that is described in Section 3.5.2.1. The majority of the CO2 pipeline corridor overlies groundwater aquifers that are shallower than 50 feet and consist of glacial sand and gravel deposits that are limited inextent (see Figure 3.5-1). These aquifers are present in layers too thin for municipal or large industrial use, although households and farms may use them for individual water wells. 3.5.2.4 CO2 Storage Study Area There is a major sand and gravel aquifer beneath the CO2 storage study area located in the northeastern corner of Morgan County (Figure 3.5-1). This aquifer could be connected to the sand and gravel aquifer system at the Meredosia Energy Center by a bedrock valley buried by glacial deposits. The other groundwater resources in the area are typically found in glacial till, mostly confined to thin layers of sand and gravel betweenclay.  A shallow monitoring well drilled and installed at the CO2 storage study area found thin glacial sediment consisting of silts and clays, which resulted in a poor yield of groundwater. The Alliance conducted groundwater sampling from this monitoring well in the fall of 2011. The groundwater pH values ranged from 7.08 to 7.66. Most of the constituent concentrations were below applicable drinking water standards, although a few exceeded the USEPA primary or secondary standards. The concentrations of iron, manganese, nitrate and total dissolved solids exceeded the USEPA primary or secondary standards in some of the groundwater samples. The aquifers located in the sand and gravel deposits and the shallowest bedrock (less than 500 feet bgs) are considered USDWs because they are used as potable water and have a total dissolved solids concentration well below the USEPA’s threshold (10,000 milligrams per liter). The deeper bedrock aquifers are typically characterized by increased levels of total dissolved solids, which increase with depth. Around Chicago and in northern Illinois, the St. Peter and Mt. Simon Formations have total dissolved solids concentrations that are low enough to be used as freshwater aquifers. The formations depths andsalinities increase tothesoutheast. At the CO2 storage study area, the St. Peter Formation containsa deep aquifer at approximately 1,740 feet bgs, with a total dissolved solids concentration of 2,500 to 10,000 milligrams per liter (ISGS 2004). The Alliance sampled water from the St. Peter aquifer at the stratigraphic well (see Figure 3.5-2) and determined that the total dissolved solids concentration was about 3,700 milligrams per liter. Although the aquifer could likely support the volume of pumping required by a public utility, none of the communities in and around Morgan County withdraw water from the St. Peter aquifer and the state of Illinois does not consider it to be a source of potable water at this location. For the UIC permit applications, the St. Peter Formation is classified as a federal USDW, and as an Illinois non-USDW (Alliance 2013a). There are about 1,900feet of bedrock between the top ofthe injection zone and the base of the St. Peter Formation, of which 570 feet are composed of the primary and secondary caprock formations (Figure 3.4-2). At the CO2 storage study area, the Mt. Simon Formation has a reported total dissolved solids concentration of over 48,000 milligrams per liter and is not considered a USDW in Morgan County (Alliance 2013a). In the 25-square mile UIC surveyarea, there are 24 water wells present (ISGS 2012c). Figure 3.5-2 shows the location of the groundwater wells within the UIC survey area. Seventeen wells are screened to depths of 50 feet or less. These wells are drilled for domestic use and for livestock watering. One well is drilled to 54 feet bgs and is used as a livestock watering well. Five groundwater wells have been drilled deeper than 100 feet bgs. The deepest of these was drilled to 1,056 feet bgs by the Linden Oil Company; the other four wells were drilled to a depth of 100 to 400 feet bgs (ISGS 2012c). The deep well was likely drilled for hydrocarbon production, proved unsuccessful (as a “dry hole”), and was transferredtoa private user to support agricultural needs. The stratigraphic well drilled by the Alliance is also included in the water well database. The stratigraphic well wasdrilledto4,820 feet bgs and penetrates the Mt. Simon and Eau Claire Formations (Alliance 2013a). It was designed and constructed using carbon sequestration well standards to prevent the upward migration of CO2, with the intention for it to be used as a deep monitoring well. Source: ISGS 2012c CO2 = carbon dioxide; ROI = region of influence; UIC = underground injection control Figure 3.5-2. Shallow Groundwater Wells in the Underground Injection Control Survey Area The village of Ashland, the closest community to the CO2 storage study area, is located approximately 5 miles to the northeast and outside of the study area. The municipal water sources for the community are between 12 and 26 miles from the CO2 storage study area. Although the village of Ashland had drilled municipal water wells in 1936, Ashland’s current water supply comes from the city of Jacksonville water systemand the water plantat Virginia,Illinoisvia rural water cooperatives (Journal Courier 2011;Journal Courier 2010). The Virginia water plant is located about 12 miles northwest of the CO2 storage study area and withdraws groundwater from five wells drilled between 50-70 feet bgs in the Mahomet aquifer. The city of Jacksonville withdraws most of its water from a radial well drilled on the banks of the Illinois River, about 26 miles west of Jacksonville (City of Jacksonville 2012a). When the main well is undergoing maintenance, two local, gravel pack wells are used. The water is piped to a local water treatment plant before being distributed to the public. 3.5.2.5 Educational Facilities The educational facilities are expected to be located in or near Jacksonville, Illinois. The groundwater in this area is restricted to thin, individual pockets in sand deposits. The Alliance expects that the public water utility would providefor the water needs of the educationalfacilities (see Section 3.15,Utilities). 3.5.3 Impacts of the Proposed Action 3.5.3.1 Construction Impacts During construction, accidental spills of fuel, fuel constituents, and other materials onto the ground surface may occur and could potentially impact shallow groundwater resources. The potential for spills to impact groundwater is considered low as the BMPs described in Section 3.3, Physiography and Soils, would be applied to prevent spills and unintentional releases to groundwater from wastes or petroleum-based materials generated during construction. If oil spills were to occur, response actions and control measures specified in the SPCC plan for the project would be employed to address the spill. As a result, DOE expects that impacts to groundwater resources from spills during construction would be short term and minor. Meredosia Energy Center The Alliance would remove Wells 3, 4, and 5 and construct one new production well at the Meredosia Energy Center to replace them. The new well would be completed in the same shallow sand and gravel aquifer in which the other wells at the energy center are installed. Three potential locations have been identified for the new well, although a final location has not been selected. The construction of the well would comply with Title 77 IAC 920, Illinois Water Well Construction Code. The construction of this well wouldnot cause or contributeto adverse impacts to the groundwater resources inthisarea. During construction, the Alliance mayuse thenew and existing groundwater wells onsiteto provide water to supportconstruction needs. Watercould also be obtainedfromthe village of Meredosia or trucked in to support construction. The construction demand is not expected to exceed the operational demand for the project, and would be less than the historical water demand of the Meredosia Energy Center (see Table 3.5-1). As a result, adverse impacts to the local aquifer, which is connected to the Illinois River, are expected to be negligible. In addition, there would be no direct onsite discharge to groundwater during the construction process. CO2 Pipeline Potential impacts to groundwater from spills that could occur during construction of the CO2 pipeline would be similar to those addressed for the energy center. In the Draft EIS, one existing water well was identified within the construction ROW for the southern pipeline route. Since publication of the Draft EIS, the Alliance identified an updated alignment for the southern pipeline route that no longer intersects (i.e., within the construction ROW) any water wells. Therefore, construction activities would not directly impact groundwater resources. Based on the proposed depth of pipeline burial (between 4 and 5 feet), shallow groundwater is unlikely to be encountered during excavation of the pipeline trench. Any groundwater wells that exist within the vicinity of the pipeline would likely be screened at depths much deeper than the pipeline trench; therefore, the aquifers used would not be directly impacted by trenching or horizontal directional drilling because of their depth below the pipeline and the distance fromthe pipeline to the wells. Therefore, based on the location of the proposed pipeline routes, it is not anticipated that any existing water supply wells would be directly affected by construction of the CO2 pipeline. In the unlikely event that an existing supply well were to be directly impacted by the construction activities, resulting in the temporary impairment of the quantity or qualityof water available in that well, alternative sources of water would be identified and provided (e.g., a new well would be drilled to replace the damaged well or other water service would be provided until such time as theissue was resolved). For the portion of the pipeline traversing the CO2 storage study area, impact analysis in the Draft EIS used hypothetical end-of-pipeline routes (spurs) to evaluate a range of reasonable siting scenarios (see Section 3.0). Since the release of the Draft EIS, the Alliance identified a location for the injection wells (see Section 2.5.2.3) and established the pipeline routing within the CO2 storage study area for the southern route to the proposed injection well site. Since the Alliance does not plan to move forward with the northern pipeline route, final routing within the storage study area was not identified for the northern route to the injection well site. As a result, DOE analyzed the pipeline impacts for the southern route based on the currently proposed pipeline alignment from the energy center to the injection well site; and for the northern route based on the analysis presentedin the Draft EIS using hypotheticalend-of-pipeline spurs. The Alliance designed the southern pipeline route such that the construction ROW would not intersect existing water supply wells; therefore, no direct impacts to water supply wells are anticipated. Potential indirect impacts resulting from the construction of the pipeline across the CO2 storage study area would be similar to those described regarding pipeline construction within the pipeline corridor. The pipeline route could ultimately deviate as a result of final project design and continued coordination with landowners; however, the same siting criteria would be followed and impacts would be consistent with those addressedin this section. The Alliance has no current plansto withdraw groundwater or to discharge directly to groundwater during construction of the proposed pipeline. Water required for construction purposes (e.g., hydrostatic testing, preparation of drilling mud for directional drilling, and dust suppression) may be trucked in or obtained from surface waterbodies adjacent to the pipeline. If hydrostatic test water is discharged to the ground after testing, an NPDES permit would be obtained for each discharge, as appropriate, and applicable procedures, including water quality testing, would be followed; therefore, impacts to groundwater resources would benegligible. CO2 Storage Study Area The injection wells would be located above a major sand and gravel aquifer, so the construction impacts would be similar to those described for the groundwater wells at the Meredosia Energy Center. The wells would be designed and installed in accordance with the design standards specified by the Class VI injection well regulations and as defined in the UIC permits. These design standards were adopted to protect drinking water resources from well construction and operation. The wells would be constructed to isolate each of the potential aquifers from one another and from the CO2 reservoir. This would be accomplished byconstructingthe injection wells withcasings that telescope downin diameter withdepth. In other words, the largest diameter casing is at the surface and each succeeding casing of smaller diameter is drilled and installed through the larger casing above. As each casing is installed, it would be cemented in place before the borehole was advanced. The base of the long string casing would be cemented with CO2-resistant cement in the injection zone. Figure 2-24 and Figure 2-25 present the casing program, depths, cement types, and well design for vertical and horizontal injection wells, respectively. The series of cemented casings would prevent CO2 from escaping around the borehole casing and would isolate each of the aquifers. In addition, the Alliance would locate the pipeline and injection wells using the siting criteria listed in Sections 2.5.1.1 and 2.5.2.1, which includes avoiding major bodies of water and wetland areas. Such areas tend to have shallow groundwater tables and high infiltration rates, so avoiding these locations would reduce the potential forimpactstoshallow groundwater resources. Educational Facilities The construction of the educational facilities would not require groundwater pumping or the direct discharge of water or wastewater to an aquifer. Potential impacts to shallow aquifers would be consistent withthose describedfor the energy center and would be expected to be negligible. 3.5.3.2 Operational Impacts During operations, petroleum, oils, lubricants, and other hazardous materials could be spilled onto the ground surface and potentially contaminate groundwater resources at any of the project facilities. However, the operational BMPs and SPCC plan for the project, as described in Section 3.3, Physiography and Soils, would be implemented to reduce the potential for impacts to groundwaterresourcesfrom spills. Meredosia Energy Center Historically, the Meredosia Energy Center used well water as its source for drinking water as well as for freeze protection of the bottom ash pond piping during the winter months when necessary. Groundwater was obtained from several groundwater wells located east of the energy center on the property. As shown in Table 3.5-1, in the late 2000s, Ameren was withdrawing up to 294,000 gpd (daily maximum flow) from each of the three operational wells. The planned operations of the oxy-combustion facility under the proposed project would require approximately 124,000 gpd. Groundwater would be pumped from one new well and two existingwellson the Meredosia EnergyCenter site. The IEPA has determined that the groundwater flow at the Meredosia Energy Center is toward the Illinois River (IEPA 2011c). While withdrawal from the new well would change highly localized groundwater movements, the changes are not anticipated to affect the surrounding groundwater wells. The new well would be located further from the river and would not withdraw enough water to divert the local groundwater flow. A groundwater monitoring study performed in 1981 at an industrial site less than a mile from the energy center determined that, while pumping 1,400,000 gpd, the drawdown cone stayed within 100 feet of the well (Naymik and Barcelona 1981). The municipal and other industrial wells are located over 100 feet from the energy center wells, which suggests that any impacts on existing wells from changes in local groundwater movement caused by the addition of the newwell would be minor. The amount of water withdrawn for the FutureGen 2.0 Project would generally be lower than the historical usage at the energy center. Based on the characteristics of the sand and gravel aquifer and the history of pumping at the facility, the aquifer can readily supply the water required to support operations of the energy center and would not affect the available capacity or quality of groundwater in the area. Therefore, DOE would expect impactsto groundwateravailability to be minor. A revised NPDES permit application has been submitted for the FutureGen 2.0 Project. Under the NPDES permit, stormwater not exposed to industrial pollutants would flow to a stormwater management basin, which would allow the water to infiltrate back to the groundwater. Since the water from this basin would not be exposed to industrial contaminants, it is not expected that the infiltration of stormwater to the groundwater table would adversely impact groundwater quality in the area. CO2 Pipeline Although there are no anticipated needs for groundwater supplies along the pipeline and no plans to discharge directly to groundwater during operations, there may be limited discharges of water to the ground (e.g., spent hydrostatic test water used for periodic testing of pipeline integrity), subject to the provisions of the NPDES permit. During project operations, there is also some potential for spills to occur from operational equipment (e.g., hydraulic fluids, fuels, lubricants) during maintenance activities. These activities along the pipeline would be limited in scope and frequency. The Alliance would follow the BMPs discussed in Section 3.3, Physiography and Soils, as applicable, during maintenance activities to avoid or minimize potential impacts to groundwater resources from accidental spills of fuel, fuel constituents, and other materials. Takingthese BMPs into account, DOE anticipates that potential impacts to groundwater quality from the operation of the CO2 pipeline would be minor. DOE expects that operation of the CO2 pipeline would notimpactthe availability of groundwater resources. During the operation of the pipeline, supercritical CO2 would be pumped through the pipeline to the injection wells. As discussed in Section 3.17, Human Health and Safety, based on the frequency of releases from similar pipelines in the United States, a release of CO2 due to pipeline puncture or rupture is considered unlikely. Several design and procedural methods would be implemented to minimize the potential for an accidental pipeline release. The CO2 pipeline would use mainline block valves to isolate pipeline sections, a leak detection system to alert the operator, and a SCADA telecommunication system to communicate information and data about pipeline performance. In addition, pipeline monitoring and surveillance procedures would be included in the Operating Manual for the pipeline and implemented in the field on a daily basis. If CO2 were released from the pipeline, it would expand rapidly as a gas and could include both liquid and solid phases, depending on temperature and pressure. As the product in the pipeline is over 97 percent CO2 with few impurities and would not remain under sufficient pressure to dissolve into groundwater, it would have negligible impacts to groundwater quality in the unlikely event of a release. CO2 Storage Study Area The Alliance evaluated several injection well configurations using both vertical and horizontal injection wells at one or two injection well sites. After consideration of site-specific data from the stratigraphic well, the Alliance is currently proposing to operate up to four horizontal injection wells at one injection well site for the annual injection of 1.2 million tons (1.1 million metric tons) of CO2 over a 20-year period. The injection wells would be designed to inject CO2 in a horizon within the Mt. Simon Formation (the target injection formation). Under normal operating conditions, 64 percent of the CO2 flow would be split equally between two of the wells while the other two wells would receive 17 and 19 percent of the flow, respectively. The injection wells would be constructed to provide operational flexibility and backup capability, such that one well could be taken off line while the remaining three injection wells receive 100 percent of the flow. The horizontal injection would occur along the final 1,500 to 2,500 foot section of each injection well, allowing the CO2 to infiltrate through a single horizon within the Mt. Simon Formation at about 4,030 feet bgs. Over the course of the injection period, the individual CO2 streams from each of the four wellswould merge to form a combined plume.  The Alliance conducted modeling using the STOMP-CO2 computer program to predict the areal extent and distribution of the CO2 plume for the proposed injection well configuration. Data from the stratigraphic well, as well as data collected from hydrologic testing, wireline logging, and vertical seismic profiling, was used to support the modeling effort. The Alliance used multiple variables to model the formation (e.g., vertical and horizontal permeability and porosity, rock and grain density, capillary pressure) and the reservoir (e.g., temperature, fluid pressure, salinity), combined with the injection stream values (i.e., pressure, saturation) to determine the lateral extent of the plume after 20 and 70 years. The Alliance ran the model to determine the maximum extent of the plume, the time period of pressure buildup and drop off, and a sensitivity analysis to determine the most significant parameters for determining plume size (i.e., fracture gradient and porosity). Appendix G, Geological Report, contains the technical report detailing the model’s inputs, assumptions, and outputs. As shown in Figure 2-26, the plume model predicted that the CO2 plume would occupy a subsurface area of approximately 4,000 acres withinthe CO2 storage studyarea. Injected CO2 would be less dense than the surrounding brine (saline groundwater), so it would migrate upwards and laterally within the injection zone to areas of lower pressure until it reached impermeable layers (e.g., the caprock). Over time, the CO2 would be incorporated into the brine and would either migrate with the groundwater flow, be trapped in the formation’s pore space by capillary action, or would begin to mineralize to formnew carbonate minerals. As the CO2 migrates through the formation, it would displace the Mt. Simon Formation brine within the plume radius. As a result, the brine would migrate laterally to lower pressure areas within the formation. Brine displacement would decrease with distance from the injection wells and CO2 plume.  The potential impacts associated with well operations and CO2 injection into geologic formations are largely associated with the possibility of CO2 leakage into drinking water aquifer resources. CO2 could leakfromthe target formationby: • Passing through the caprock through a higher permeability zone or from excessive pressure within the injection zone; • Leaking into a drinking water aquifer via a transmissive fault; • Escapingthrough a fracture or more permeable zone in the caprock into a drinking water aquifer; • Migrating up-dip and increasingreservoir pressure andpermeabilityof anexistingfault; or • Escapingintoadrinkingwater aquifervia improperlyinstalled, abandoned, orunknown wells. The potential for leaks to occur would depend on caprock integrity, the reliability of well construction and well-capping methods, and the degree to which CO2 is permanently stored by long-term trapping mechanisms. CO2 is trapped in the injection zone through four mechanisms: (1) structural trapping, (2)residual CO2 trapping, (3) solubility trapping, and (4) mineralization. These mechanisms are described in Section 3.4, Geology.  If CO2 were to escape the injection zone and reach a USDW, there is a potential that it could react with and acidify the groundwater. However, this occurrence would be very unlikely because the CO2 would have to escape from the injection zone to reach the St. Peter Formation or shallower drinking water aquifers and, as discussed earlier, the site was specifically selected to reduce the potential of this happening. In addition, vertical migration of CO2 to USDW aquifers would be unlikely as a consequence of the following: • Depth of the injection zonein the Mt. Simon Formation; • Substantial primaryseal provided by the Eau Claire Formation (413 feet thick); • Presence of a secondary seal formation (Franconia Dolomite) between the Mt. Simon Formation and the St. Peter Formation; • Presence of more than 3,700 feet of various strata(much of it with low permeability) between the injection zoneand any actively used drinkingwateraquifers inthe project area; • Lackof regional wells thatpenetrate the Eau Claire Formation;and • Aquifer monitoring of the injection zone, St. Peter Formation and shallow sand and gravel aquifers as outlined in theMVA plan. CO2 would be injected into the middle of the Mt. Simon Formation, so that the CO2 would need to migrate up before it would reach the base of the primary confining zone, the Proviso and Lombard Members of the Eau Claire Formation. Refer to Section 3.4, Geology, for a detailed description of the primary confining zone. In addition, the lenses of silt and clay that are present throughout the Mt. Simon Formation would likely help to laterally disperse the CO2 and reduce opportunities for vertical migration. Section 3.4, Geology, presents a full discussion on how the site selection has minimized the potential for CO2 leaks and migration. A two-dimensional seismic study performed by the Alliance in 2011 confirmed that the Mt. Simon Formation is uniformly thick, dips gently (less than 1 degree) to the southeast, and there are nofaults orbreaks in the lateral continuityof the formation(Alliance 2013a). In the UIC survey area, the only well that currently penetrates the St. Peter, Eau Claire, or Mt. Simon Formations is the stratigraphic well completed by the Alliance, which was specifically drilled with CO2 injection well techniques. Any other deep wells that would be drilled for the proposed project (e.g., injection, or other monitoring wells) would be constructed to the same CO2-resistant standards. The next deepest water well is 1,056 feet bgs, which is almost 700 feet shallower than the top of the St. Peter Formation. Because of the lack of deep wells in the area, it is very unlikely that the CO2 could migrate to shallower USDWs through improperly sealed water wells. The longer that CO2 is in contact with the brine in the Mt. Simon Formation, the more time is available for the CO2 to react and dissolve, producing carbonic acid that would slightly lower the pH of the injection zone brine. While the carbonic acid would react with any clay-rich or calcium-rich minerals in the Mt. Simon and Eau Claire Formations, the quartz in the formations would not react to the change in pH (IPCC 2005). Heavy metals could be liberated as minerals react with the CO2-brine solution and dissolve; however, there are no known anomalous concentrations of metals that could pose a risk to the shallower drinking water aquifers. The injection wells would be constructed with CO2-resistant cement and specificallydesigned so that the acidificationof thebrinewouldnot reduce the well integrity. The increased pressure from CO2 injection would also force the brine in the target formation laterally from the injection zone. The research on brine migration in reaction to the injection pressure front is still ongoing, as models are refined with new data. As discussed in Section 3.4, Geology, there is a potential, if the injection pressure is high enough, for small amounts of brine to diffuse into or through the caprock, while simultaneously trapping the CO2 (Birkolzer et al. 2009; Zhou and Birkolzer 2011; Lemieux 2011). While the upward movement of brine would reduce the overall pressure to the Mt. Simon Formation and the Eau Claire Formation, it would increase the possibility that brine could reach a shallower drinking water aquifer. However, if the brine were to pass through the caprock and reach a shallower (less than 3,700 feet bgs) permeable formation, it would tend to spread laterally and slow its vertical migration. The temperature and density differential between the target formation brine and the shallower formation would cause the dense brine to onlyremain within thelower-most region. Models suggest that the gradual cooling at the shallower horizon would increase the density of the brine, and pull it back to the deeper reservoir (Oldenburg and Rinaldi 2011). The Ironton-Galesville Sandstone is located between the primary and secondary confining formations, at about 3,300 feet bgs. If brine were forced upwards, it is likely that it would first reach the Ironton-Galesville Sandstone and spread laterally along the formation bed before continuing upwards. Another sandstoneformation, the New Richmond Sandstone, is also located between the secondary confining zone and the St. Peter Formation. Therefore, it is very unlikely that brine displaced by CO2 and the injection pressure front would reach the St. Peter Formation. In formations like the Mt. Simon that have slowly flowing groundwater, reservoir-scale modeling for similar projects shows that, over tens of years, up to 30 percent of the CO2 would dissolve (IPCC 2005). Once CO2 dissolves in the saline groundwater, it could be transported away from the injection wells by circulation on a regional scale, or it could sink from the increased density, but the time scales of such transport are millions of years and are not considered relevant for this EIS (IPCC 2005). Therefore, it is extremely unlikely that the laterally moving brine would reach locations in northern Illinois and Wisconsin where theMt. Simon USDW aquifers are closertothe landsurface. The Alliance would employ a series of construction and operation techniques, materials, activities, and other injection BMPs to prevent the migration of CO2 or brine from the injection zone. The USEPA also requires all UIC Class VI permit applications to submit a detailed description of all of the procedures that would be implemented to prevent impacts to USDWs, and to create an early warning system in the event of a problem. The MVA program would be implemented to track the lateral migration of CO2 within the injection zone, monitor containment within the injection zone, characterize any geochemical or geomechanical changes that occur within the injection zone and overlying confining zones, and provide for early detection of any leakage of injected CO2 or brine to ensure protection of USDWs (Alliance 2013a). Although unlikely, if the monitoring results showed that CO2 was released from the injection zone, then injection would be halted, the source of the leak would be identified, and a series of remediation procedures would be implemented, depending on the adverse event. These procedures could include repairing the well casing, lowering the reservoir pressure by removing brine or CO2, increasing upstream reservoir pressure (e.g., creating a hydraulic barrier), diverting the CO2 stream, or modifying the injection flow rate or quantity. In a situation where CO2 or brine reaches a USDW, the Alliance would implement groundwater remediationintheimpacted aquifer. As required by the Class VI Rule, a single monitoring well would be drilled into the lowermost USDW aquifer (St. Peter Formation) above the injection zone to monitor changes to the aquifer during CO2 injection and storage. In addition, three early detection monitoring wells would be installed within the first permeable formation above the confining zone (e.g., Ironton Sandstone), which lies approximately 1,300 feet below the lowermost USDW aquifer (St. Peter Formation). As the St. Peter Formation contains the deepest USDW in relation to the injection zone, the early detection monitoring wells would provide first evidence of a leak in the caprock formations before CO2 can reach the USDW. Collectively, these measures would minimize the potential for long-term impacts on potable groundwater fromCO2 storage activities to a negligible level. Educational Facilities There would be no impacts to groundwater from the operation of the educational facilities. The activities at the facilities would be located in buildings with little opportunity for an outside spill. The educational facilities would not consume groundwater or directly discharge to groundwater; therefore, no impacts to groundwater resources areexpected from the operation of the educational facilities. 3.5.4 Impacts of the No Action Alternative Under the no action alternative, DOE would not provide cost-shared funding for the FutureGen 2.0 Project. Although the Alliance may still elect to construct and operate the project in the absence of DOE cost-shared funding, for the purposes of the analysis in this EIS, DOE assumed that the no action alternative is equivalent to the no-build alternative. Therefore, the project would not be constructed and there would be no impacts to groundwaterresources. 3.6 SURFACE WATER 3.6.1 Introduction This section describes the surface waters potentially affected by the construction and operation of the proposed project. This section also analyzes the potential direct and indirect effects of this project on these resources. Surface waters are closely related to wetlands and floodplains, which are further addressed in Section 3.7, Wetlandsand Floodplains. 3.6.1.1 Region of Influence The ROI defines the extent of the areas where direct effects from construction and operation may be experienced, and it encompasses the areas where indirect effects from the proposed project would most likely occur. The ROI for surface water resources includes the surface waters that exist within the areas potentially affected by the construction and operation of the proposed project, consisting of the Meredosia Energy Center, the CO2 pipeline, the CO2 injection wells, and the proposed educational facilities. It also includes the surface waters that would receive stormwater and wastewater discharges from the construction and operationof the proposed project. 3.6.1.2 Method of Analysis and Factors Considered DOE reviewed the proposed project to determine which construction and operational activities would have the potential to directly or indirectly affect surface waters. DOE also reviewed published studies and GIS-based data of surface water features within the ROI. DOE assessed the potential for impacts to surface waters based on whether the project would: • Alter stormwater discharges, which could adversely affect drainage patterns, flooding, erosion, and sedimentation; • Alter ordamage existing farmland drainage infrastructure; • Alter infiltration rates, which could affect (substantially increase or decrease) the volume of surface water thatflows downstream; • Conflict with applicable stormwater management plansor ordinances; • Violateany federal,state,or regional waterqualitystandards ordischarge limitations; • Modify surface waters such that water quality no longer meets water quality criteria or standards established inaccordance withthe CWA,stateregulations, or permits; or • Change the availabilityof surface water resourcesfor current or future uses. 3.6.1.3 Regulatory Framework The USEPA regulates water quality under the Safe Drinking Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) is defined Water Act (SDWA) and the CWA. Section 303(d) of the as the maximum amount of a pollutant that a CWA requires states to identify and develop a list of impaired waterbody can receive and still safely meet water quality standards. TMDLs are based on analyses waterbodies. Impaired waterbodies are considered too polluted that include pollution source identification and or otherwise degraded to meet the water quality standards or development of strategies for contaminant source designated uses set by the state. Section 305(b) of the CWA reduction or elimination. requires states to assess and report the quality of their waterbodies. The IEPA monitors the waters of the state as required by the CWA and reports the results in the Impaired Waters of Illinois Integrated Report, published biennially in even-numbered years. This report lists impaired waterbodies under Section 303(d) indicating their total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) andtheir water assessment and designateduse determinations under Section 305(b). Stormwater and wastewater discharges are regulated by the IEPA under Sections 401 and 402 of the CWA (permitting requirements) through the NPDES permit program. The state’s NPDES program is modeled on the federal NPDES program, which requires stormwater to be treated to the maximum extent practicable. NPDES permits also include effluent limits and requirements for facility operation and maintenance, discharge monitoring, and routine reporting. Many of the surface water resources addressed in this section qualify as waters of the U.S., which are regulated by the USACE under the CWA, because they are important for the preservation of navigable waterways and interstate commerce. Waters of the U.S. are subject to federal jurisdiction and permitting under Section 404 of the CWA and Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899. Waters of the U.S. include all navigable waterways and their tributaries, as well as wetlands contiguous (connected) to and adjacent tothose navigable waterways andtributaries. Under Section 404 of the CWA, a USACE permit would be required for the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S., which is often authorized by a Nationwide Permit or could be authorized by an Individual Permit. Construction of utility lines (e.g., pipelines) that would affect waters of the U.S. can be permitted with a Nationwide Permit (Number 12 – “UtilityLine Activities”) ifless than 0.5 acreof waters of the U.S. are disturbed, or an Individual Permit, if more than 0.5 acre is disturbed. Throughout the project area,federal regulations are enforcedbyeither the USACESt. Louis or RockIsland District. Construction within or alteration of (e.g., dredging activities, placement of fill material) a traditional navigable waterway (e.g., the Illinois River) belowthe defined ordinary high water mark requires USACE permitting under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act. The ordinary high water mark is the highest level that a body of water maintains for a sufficient period of time to leave visual evidence (i.e., changes incharacterof soil, destructionof vegetation) on theshoreline. 3.6.2 Affected Environment This section describes the surface water resources potentially affected by the construction and operation of an oxy-combustion facility at the existing Meredosia EnergyCenter, as well as those present within the potential CO2 pipeline corridor and CO2 storage study area, and the location for the proposed educational facilities. As discussedinthis section, surface waters in these areas canbe broadlyclassified as follows: • Perennial Streams and Rivers:Waterbodies in which some water flows throughout the year. • Intermittent Streams and Rivers: Waterbodies in which water flows for only part of the year and may come from groundwater or runoff (e.g., from rainfall). When not flowing, surface water may remain inisolatedpools ormaybe absent. • Ephemeral Streams and Rivers: Waterbodies in which water flows only during, and for a short duration after, precipitation events in a typical year. Runoff from rainfall is the primary source of waterfor streamflow; groundwater is not a source of streamflow. • Ditches and Canals: Man-made waterbodies generally used for drainage or to convey stormwater (i.e., ditches and swales) orto provide waterfor irrigation or industrial use (i.e., canals). • Lakes and Ponds: Naturally occurring or man-made waterbodies typically located in topographic low spots, that receive water from runoff (e.g., from rainfall) or other overland flow (e.g., creeks, streams, rivers) or from groundwater sources(i.e., springs and seeps)and generally do not flow. Wetland areas (i.e., areas that are generally inundated or saturated by water and that support vegetation typicallyadapted to saturated soil conditions, such as swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas) may also occur within or around the perimeter of surface waterbodies. Additional details regarding wetlands are provided in Section 3.7, Wetlands and Floodplains. Surface water systems are typically defined in terms of watersheds (also called basins). A watershed is a land area bounded by topography that drains water to a common destination. Watersheds vary in size; every waterway (stream, tributary, and river) has an associated watershed and smaller watersheds combine to form larger watersheds. Any activity that affects water quality, quantity, or rate of movement at one location withina watershedhas the potential to affectthe characteristics of locations downstream. The proposed project would be located within the Illinois River Basin (see Figure 3.6-1), which encompasses approximately 30,000 square miles, covering 44 percent of the land area of the state of Illinois (USACE 2007). Nearly 11,000 miles of perennial streams occur in the Illinois River Basin, with an estimated 20,000 to 25,000 additional miles of ephemeral streams (USACE 2007). The Illinois River Basin is divided into the Upper and Lower Illinois River watersheds. The proposed project would be located in the Lower Illinois River Watershed (HUC 07130011), which encompasses 17,960 square miles of central and western Illinois (USEPA 2011j; USDOI/USGS 1994). This watershed extends from the downstreamend of the Upper Illinois River Watershedat Ottawa, Illinois, to the confluence of the Illinois and Mississippi rivers at Grafton, Illinois. Major rivers in the watershed include the Illinois, Vermilion, Mackinaw, Spoon, Sangamon, and La Moine rivers. The mean annual precipitation for the Lower Illinois River watershed is 35 to 39 inches and the mean annual precipitation at the Meredosia Energy Center is 38 to 39 inches (USGS 2011a). Precipitation and discharge from the Upper Illinois River watershed account for most of the inflow to the Lower Illinois River watershed. Discharge to the Illinois River across the watershed basin consists of return flow, surface runoff, and groundwater discharge. Return flow is water that has been released from a facility (e.g., discharges from industrial and municipal wastewater treatment facilities). The combined return flow, basedon average annual discharge for all facilities, was 4,400 mgd in 1991 (USGS 2011a). Major water quality issues in the Lower Illinois River watershed include sedimentation, toxic substances in sediment, high concentrations of nutrients and agricultural chemicals, and low dissolved oxygen concentrations. Sedimentation has resulted in the partial or complete filling of many lakes within the watershed. The Illinois River receives much of the state's human, animal, industrial, and agricultural wastes (USGS 2000c). As a result, contaminants detected in sediments from the Chicago metropolitan area in the Upper Illinois River have also been identified in sediments in the Lower Illinois River watershed. The Chicago area appears to be the source of these contaminants, which include the USEPA priority pollutants: arsenic, barium, chromium, lead, and mercury (Colman and Sanzolone 1991). The Illinois River flows for a distance of 273 miles, entering the Mississippi River at Grafton, Illinois, approximately 40 miles north of St. Louis, Missouri. The Illinois River is the largest tributary to the Mississippi River above the mouth of the Missouri River (USACE 2007) and is a navigable link between Lake Michigan and the Mississippi River (USDOI/USGS 1994). Water depth and flow in the Illinois River is maintained bya series of locks and dams (see Figure 3.6-2) (USDOI/USGS 1994; USGS 2011a). The Alton, La Grange, Peoria, and Starved Rock pools are the reaches of stream (i.e., navigation pools) between the locks and dams from Grafton to Ottawa. The general change in stream elevation between locks and dams is 20 feet, and each pool is named for the dam immediately downstream. The Alton Lock and Damare locatedontheMississippi River andalsoregulate flow on the Illinois River. 3.6.2.1 Meredosia Energy Center Surface waters located on the Meredosia Energy Center property are limited to fly and bottom ash ponds (these ponds are not part of the FutureGen 2.0 Project). The nearest natural surface water feature is the Illinois River, which is located immediately adjacent to the Meredosia Energy Center property, approximately 700 feet west of the proposed oxy-combustion facility. The USACE determined that the ordinary high water mark of the river in the area is 440 feet above sea level (see Appendix D, Wetlands Surveys [D1]). The Meredosia Energy Center is located between miles 70 and 71 on the Illinois River (USACE 1998), where the Illinois River ranges in width between approximately 1,000 and 1,200 feet. The La Grange Lock and Dam is the closest dam to the Meredosia Energy Center, located approximately 9 miles upstream (north). Source: USGS 2011a CO2 = carbon dioxide Figure 3.6-1. Watershed Boundaries and Surface Water Features in the ROI Figure 3.6-2. The Elevation of the Lower Illinois River Watershed and Locations of the U.S. Geological Survey Surface Water Monitoring Stations The Meredosia Energy Center is located along the Alton Pool portion of the Illinois River (seeFigure3.6-2). The Alton Pool extends from the confluence of the Mississippi and Illinois rivers (River Mile 0) to the base of the La Grange Lock and Dam (River Mile 80.2), for a total length of 80.2 miles. The Alton Pool is characterized by a dramatic loss in productive backwaters, side channels, and channel border areas due to excessive sedimentation and erosion, which limits the ecological health and alters the character of the river (IEPA 2010b). The section of the Illinois River adjacent to the energy center is impaired due tomercury, PCBs, and fecal coliform contamination (IEPA 2012a; IEPA 2010b). This segment, a subsection of the Alton Pool described above, is identified as segment IL_D-32 by the USEPA. Table 3.6-1 summarizes the information from the 2010 and 2012 Impaired Waters of Illinois Integrated Reports related to the impairment (from Section 303(d) ofthe CWA) of the Illinois River inthisarea. Table 3.6-1.

Table 3.6-2 summarizes this data, which shows that streamflow in the Illinois River is highly regulated by locks and dams. In addition, the minimum and maximum flow rates vary significantly, which demonstrates that the Illinois River is highly influenced by precipitation and surface runoff. Table 3.6-2.

It represents the lowest streamflow for 7 consecutive days that would be expected to occur once in 10 years. The 7Q10 low-flow frequency value is determined by statistically analyzing streamflow data fromUSGS streamgauging stations. The 7Q10 low-flow value for the stream gauging station closest to the energy center (Meredosia gauge) was 2,391 mgd, while the 7Q10 low-flow value at a stream gaugingstationupstream of the energy center (Kingston Mines gauge) was 1,971 mgd (Singh et al. 1988). At the end of 2011, operational activities at theMeredosia EnergyCenter were suspended. Until that time, the energy center pumped water from the Illinois River at an average rate of 217 mgd to support energy center operations. Water was drawn from a river water intake structure (with five separate intake bays) located at mile 70.8 in the Illinois River (USACE 1998). The design capacity for the intake structure is 414 mgd, which represents 17 percent ofthe 7Q10 low-flowratefor theriver. Prior to the suspension of operations at the Meredosia Energy Center, the facility generated approximately 189 mgd of wastewater from industrial processes. The treated wastewater and stormwater from the site was discharged to the Illinois River at eight locations (outfalls) under NPDES Permit No. IL0000116. The NPDES Permit was renewed on September 30, 2011 (IEPA 2011d). An application to modify this permit based on the proposed future operations at the energy center was submitted to IEPA on June 20, 2013. This application is discussed further in Section 3.6.3.2. The existing (2011) permit covers eight discharges (outfalls) to the river and includes the following: • Outfall 001 – Condensercooling water(Units 1, 2, and 3) • Outfall A01 – Boiler blowdown • Outfall 002 – Cooling tower blowdown • Outfall A02 – Cooling tower emergency overflow • Outfall 003 – Bottom ash pond discharge • Outfall A03 – Chemical metalcleaningwastewater • Outfall 004 – Fly ash pond discharge • Outfall 006 – Intake screenbackwash From 2006 to 2010, there were two exceedances of NPDES permit discharge limitations, both for total suspended solids only. One exceedance occurred in 2008 at discharge point (Outfall) 003 and the other in 2009 at discharge point (Outfall) 004 (IEPA 2011d). There have been no exceedances of permit discharge limits since the permit was renewed in September 2011. The location of each outfall at the Meredosia EnergyCenteris depicted on Figure 2-4 in Chapter 2. 3.6.2.2 CO2 Pipeline The proposed CO2 pipeline corridor from the Meredosia Energy Center to the CO2 storage study area is approximately 26 miles in length and 4 miles in width (see Figure 3.6-1) (note that the total length of the CO2 pipeline would be approximately 30 miles and the operational pipeline ROW would be 50 feet wide). Table 3.6-3 summarizes the existingsurface water features within the CO2 pipeline corridor. These surface water features are located within the Lower Illinois River watershed and ultimately drain to the Illinois River. The Alliance identified two possible pipeline routes from the energy center to the western border of the CO2 storage study area in which the injection wells would be located. These are referred to as the southern route and northern route. As discussed in Section 2.5.1.1, the Alliance’s proposed option is the southern route. Table 3.6-3.

Major streams within the corridor include Willow Creek, Coon Run, Spring Run, Indian Creek, Lick Branch, Snake Creek, and Conover Branch. A levee (dike) has been constructed along a portion of Coon Run, which extends from the Illinois River to U.S. Highway (US-) 67 (State Route 100), approximately 3 miles eastofthe MeredosiaEnergyCenter. Two of the perennial streams within the pipeline corridor are impaired; the Mauvaise Terre Creek (also called Mauvaise Terre River) and Indian Creek. The Mauvaise Terre Creek runs along the southern boundary of the pipeline corridor just east of Jacksonville with tributaries extending further north into the pipeline corridor. The Mauvaise Terre Creek supports aquatic life and is impaired due to turbidity and mercury (IEPA 2010b; IEPA 2012a). Approximately 1.7 miles of Mauvaise Terre Creek is located within the pipeline corridor. A 15.1-mile-long section of Indian Creek, which flows through much of the eastern half of the pipeline corridor, supports aquatic life and is impaired due to habitat alterations. Impairment due to habitat alteration indicates that adverse changes to the stream environment, including channelization, absence of streambank vegetation, bank failure, and heavy erosion, have significantly affectedthe waterbodyandmaylimit itsabilitytosupport aquatic life. 3.6.2.3 CO2 Storage Study Area Indian Creek and its associated tributaries flow through the northern half of the 6,800-acre CO2 storage study area from east to west. The entire section of Indian Creek within the CO2 storage study area (approximately 3 miles in length) is impaired from habitat alteration. The CO2 storage study area also includes approximately 52 miles of intermittent streams and 14 acres of ponds and lakes, none of which arelistedas animpaired waterbody. Table 3.6-4 summarizes the existingsurface waterfeatures within the proposed CO2 storage study area. Table 3.6-4.

The CO2 storage study area was originally analyzed in the Draft EIS as a 5,300-acre area. Since the Draft EIS was issued, the Alliance expanded the study area to 6,800 acres to allow for additional flexibility for CO2 injection. Refer to section 2.5.2 for additional details about the CO2 storage study area. This table reflects data based on the updated 6,800-acre storage study area. CO2 = carbon dioxide 3.6.2.4 Educational Facilities Visitor, research, and training facilities (also referred to as the educational facilities) would be provided at a suitable location in the Jacksonville area. Jacksonville is approximately 10 square miles in size, of which approximately 0.2 square mile is covered with surface water (U.S. Cities 2012). Major surface waters inJacksonvilleinclude Mauvaise Terre Creek, JacksonvilleLake, andMauvaise Terre Lake. 3.6.3 Impacts of Proposed Action This section summarizes potential impacts to surface waters that could result from the construction and operation of the proposed oxy-combustion facility, CO2 pipeline, CO2 injection wells and associated infrastructure (e.g., access roads). This section also discusses impacts to surface waters that would result from the construction and operation of the proposed educational facilities. DOE assessed the potential for impacts to surface water resources based on whether the proposed project would result in any of the effects identified in Section 3.6.1.2. Impacts are limited to those associated with water quality as well as the availability and use of surface water resources. Section 3.7, Wetlands and Floodplains, addresses impacts to wetlands in terms of impacts related to the placement of fill material, type conversions, and surface disturbances, which can ultimately affect the functions and values of these resources (e.g., flood flow attenuation). 3.6.3.1 Construction Impacts Many of the general construction activities for the proposed project would be similar in nature; therefore, the potential impacts to surface water resources from these construction activities would also be similar, regardless of where or when the construction takes place. This section summarizes potential impacts resulting from general construction activities, while the remaining subsections address impacts related to construction specific to the energy center, CO2 pipeline, injection wells, and proposed educational facilities. Initial construction activities for the proposed project would consist of clearing vegetation and leveling areas, which would expose soil and make it susceptible to erosion. Stormwater runoff from construction sites has the potential to carry the exposed soils offsite, resulting in increased sedimentation and turbidity to receiving waters downstream. Additionally, stormwater runoff from construction sites has the potential to be contaminated by hazardous materials, such as fuel, that are used onsite. These types of impacts would increase during heavy rains or during snowmeltdue to the increasein stormwater runoff. Stormwater runoff fromconstruction sites is regulated by the IEPA and the IDNR under Sections 401 and 402 of the CWA (permitting requirements) and implemented through NPDES permits. For the components of the proposed project that would require more than 1 acre of disturbance and that are not currently regulated by an NPDES permit, an NPDES General Permit from the IEPA would be required prior toconstructionactivities. The NPDES GeneralPermit for construction would require the preparation of a SWPPP that includes BMPs for erosion control and pollution prevention. The NPDES permit would also require that the construction standards outlined in the IEPA Urban Manual be followed, including material specifications, planning principles, and procedures (AISWCD 2012). The SWPPP would describe all of the BMPs to be followed during construction. Typical BMPs that could be used to minimize impacts on surface waters duringconstruction arelistedbelow: • Use siltfencingand other erosion control devices to prevent soils and debris fromentering nearby streams during construction. • Except on cropland, use temporary seeding and mulching or matting to produce a quick ground cover to reduce erosion on exposed soils that may be re-disturbed or permanently stabilized at a later date. This would minimize bare soil available for sedimenttransport during storm events. • Use gravel or stones to stabilize temporary access roads, haul roads, parking areas, laydown areas, material storage areas, and other onsite vehicle transportation routes immediately after grading. This practice would reduce erosion and the need for subsequent regrading of temporary and permanent roadbeds, work areas, and parking areas rutted by construction traffic during wet weather. • Maximize use of existingroads when planningsite access. • Keep construction materials, debris, construction chemicals, construction staging, fueling, etc. at a safe distance from surface waters to prevent unintentional contamination and keep spill kits on hand in case of spills to reduce response time. • Where practical, consider weather and ground conditions when scheduling construction activities to minimize potential impacts to surface waters, such as erosion and the spread of contaminants that maybe exacerbatedbysheet flow duringstormevents. • Locate construction staging, parking, and equipment storage activities in areas already disturbed by past construction activities to minimize theneed for additionalland disturbance. • Use water conservation measures to the extent practicable (e.g., efficient landscaping and recyclingwastewater). • After construction, re-seed all temporarily disturbed areas with indigenous species to re-establish vegetative cover, except on cropland. In addition, the Alliance intends to drill under all waterbodies, except perhaps for certain ephemeral or intermittent streams that would be trenched only when seasonally dry. Withimplementationof BMPs as a condition of the NPDES General Permit and drilling under all waterbodies, it is anticipated that impacts to surface waters during construction would be temporary and minor. Proper project design would ensure that drainage and runoff would occur withoutexcessive erosion and increased turbidity. Meredosia Energy Center As described in Chapter 2, construction would take place in several areas of the Meredosia EnergyCenter and nearby offsite areas, as shown on Figure 2-14 and Figure 2-15. Figure 2-14 depicts the extent of impact areas based upon the project design presented in the Draft EIS, while Figure 2-15 depicts the reduced impact areasbased upon project design revisions that occurredafter the Draft EIS was issued. As no surface waters exist within the footprint for the oxy-combustion facility and the construction laydown areas, no direct impacts to surface waters would occur under either the original or the revised project design. Temporary indirect impacts resulting from potential stormwater runoff to the Illinois River from areas of construction would be consistent with those described above for general construction. Development of impervious surfaces in areas that were previously pervious (e.g., grassy areas) would cause an increase in stormwater runoff; however, this effect would be negligible, as a majority ofstormwater would berouted to an existingstormwater detention area (see Section 2.4.2.2). No water would be withdrawn from surface waters on or adjacent to the site to support construction activities. Water required during construction (for mixing concrete, dust suppression, washing tools and machinery, etc.) would be supplied by onsite groundwater wells and city water; therefore, the availability of surface water resourceswould not beimpacted by construction. The temporary barge unloading facility (see Section 2.4.3.2) would be located on the eastern bank of the Illinois River. The Draft EIS evaluated two options for barge unloading operations: (1) using mooring dolphins or (2) grounding the barges on the river bottom. The use of mooring dolphins would require the installation of support piles into the riverbed and subsequent removal at the end of the barge delivery phases. Each of the 3 to 5 pilings that would be required for this option would be up to 48 inches in diameter. Pile drivingis likelytostir upsedimentsthatwould be carried downstream, as would also occur during removal of the pilings. The suspension of sediment would increase turbidity locally, but the river current would provide some dilution. Dissolved oxygen demand could increase locally with the suspension of anaerobic sediments. Given the small amount of sediment resuspension expected to occur during pile driving (and later removal), it is anticipated that temporary direct impacts to the Illinois River would include minor increases in turbidity during construction. It is also possible that sediments contaminated with mercury and PCBs could be resuspended, which could temporarily increase the concentrations of these contaminants in the water column during construction. Overall, the construction of the pilings for the barge unloading facility and subsequent removal would result in minor temporary impacts towater qualityinthe Illinois River duringtheconstruction and removal events. The second option for the barge unloading facility, grounding the barges, would require that large objects (e.g., boulders) be removed from the river bottom to ensure that they do not puncture the barge during unloading. If necessary, rip-rap or other suitable material would be placed on the river bottom to provide a foundation for the barge and prevent damage to the barge. This option could result in the disturbance of up to 18,360 square feet of the river bottom and bank. Disturbance would occur during the installation of rip-rap on the river bottom (and subsequent removal at the end of construction) or during each grounding and unloading event (in the event that rip-rap is not used). These disturbances and the potential installation of rip-rap on the river bottom would result in increased turbidity and temporary streambed disturbance. These impacts would be similar in nature to those described for the installation of pilings but would occur over a larger area of the streambed.  Implementation of either of these options would require a permit from USACE under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act for construction of the temporary facility and for the potential temporary placement of fill material. It is possible that a Section 404 Permit (Nationwide Permit 33) may also be required depending upon the option selected and the specific nature of the activities; however, the specific permit(s) needed will be confirmed after the design has been finalized and prior to construction. It is also possible that these permits could be applied for as part of an Individual Permit application that could cover other regulated activities relatedtothe proposedproject. After construction, any rip-rap or other temporary fill material would be removed from the river. This would create additional turbidity and increased streambed disturbance, resulting in additional minor temporaryimpacts. The Alliance is also evaluating options for unloading equipment from barges that would avoid potential impacts by using a combination of on-shore equipment, tugs, and temporary ramps so that there would be no disturbance to the bank or bottom of the Illinois River. Under this scenario, a portion of the temporary ramp may extend into the river to form a usable platform between the edge of the barge and the existing boat ramp. This temporary rampmight extend 20feetfromthe shoreline, although it has not yet been defined. River currents at the boat ramp area are usually mild, and there would be no need for filling, dredging, or modifications to the shoreline. Heavy equipment or haul trucks parked above the boat ramp could be used as temporary mooring devices for the barges. However, these plans are still under development and are being reviewed for their feasibility. Because the Alliance has not thoroughly determined the feasibility of this alternative scenario or developed a preliminary design, the Final EIS considers the impacts presented in the Draft EIS as representing appropriate, upper bounds for the barge unloading operations during construction of the oxycombustion facility. CO2 Pipeline As described in Chapter 2 and in further detail below, DOE would use one of three primary methods to construct the pipeline in areas of surface water features. The method used to construct pipeline crossings would be dependent upon the size of the stream or waterbody to be crossed, as well as the presence or absence of water within the feature (e.g., seasonally dry ephemeral and intermittent stream channels). The three methods to be used by DOE include horizontal directional drilling, jack and bore tunneling, and dry trenching. Horizontal directional drilling would be used to cross major waterbodies (i.e., crossings of perennial streams, and ponds and lakes, greater than 100 feet in width). As necessary, geotechnical investigations would be performed prior to the use of horizontal directional drilling to ensure that subsurface conditions can safely support drilling operations. Horizontal directional drilling would not disturb the bed or bank of the waterbody that would be crossed, thereby eliminating impacts such as increased turbidity and sedimentation. However, it could still present a remote potential for surface disturbance through inadvertent drilling fluid releases, as well as minor increases in sedimentation and turbidity from ground vibrations caused by drilling adjacent to the stream. An unexpected release of drilling mud (consisting primarily of water and bentonite, a naturally occurring clay) to the environment could occur if a natural fracture or unconsolidated area in the ground is encountered. Therefore, primary factors in selecting the pipeline crossing profileincludethetype of soil and rock in the geological material and the depth of cover material. Impacts resulting from horizontal directional drilling are expected to be minor, since geotechnical investigations and adequate planning would be conducted to reduce the likelihood of any releases of drillingfluid. Jack and bore tunneling (also known as pipe ramming) would be used for crossings of smaller perennial streams and wetlands, as well as intermittent and ephemeral streams that contain water at the time of construction. The jack and bore tunneling method involves the use of a horizontal bore machine or auger to drill a hole and a hydraulic jack to push a casing through the hole under the crossing. As the bore proceeds, a steelcasing pipe would bejacked into thehole; then the pipelineis installed in thecasing. The casing would be jacked using a large hydraulic jack in a pit located at one end of the crossing. The jack pit would be excavated and shored. Similar to horizontal direction drilling, jack and bore tunneling would involve no disturbance to the bed or bank of the stream being crossed, eliminating impacts related to stream diversion. Impacts from jack and bore tunneling would be minor and limited to increased turbidity and sedimentation resulting from stormwater runoff from the jack and bore pits on either side of the stream. Dry trenching would be employed for narrow intermittent and ephemeral stream channels that are devoid of water at the time of construction, such as when a stream feature is seasonally dry or is frozen to the bottom. A field assessment would be made prior to construction at each crossing to determine the presence of water, and weather forecasts would be monitored to evaluate the potential for precipitation events that could lead to temporary water flow within the stream channel. Dry trenching would consist of excavating a trench through the stream channel, laying the pipe down, and then burying the pipe with the spoils removed during trench excavation. The pipeline crossing would be as nearly perpendicular to the stream channel as possible to minimize overall linear disturbance to the stream channel. After pipeline installation, the surface would be regraded to match pre-construction contours, which would allow the stream channel to continue to function without permanent impacts to surface water flow. BMPs required through Section 404 permitting (i.e., Nationwide Permit No. 12, Utility Line Activities) would be implemented both during and after construction. The BMPs would reduce temporary minor impacts by ensuring that stream crossings are restored to their original grade to stabilize streambanks post construction. Dry trenching would cause temporary direct and indirect disturbances to stream channels and streambanks during trench excavation and pipe installation. For the purposes of analysis in the Draft EIS, DOE conservativelyassumed thatall surface waters within the 50-foot operational ROW would be drilled underneath for placement ofthe pipeline. Furthermore, any streams located outside ofthe operational ROW, but within the construction ROW (80 to 100 feet), would be avoided to the maximum extent practicable. In the event that avoidance of surface waters within the construction ROW is determined to be impracticable, temporary impacts to surface waters would be minimized and mitigated as necessary. Pipeline attributes (e.g., ROW width, pipe size, etc.) and methods of installation (e.g., horizontal directional drilling, jack and bore, or dry trenching) would be essentially the same for each potential pipeline route. Therefore, the type of construction impacts would be the same for each route; however, the magnitude of potential temporary impacts would be dependent upon the number of dry streamcrossings that would berequired.  Table 3.6-5 summarizes the types and quantities of stream crossings that would be required for each pipeline route based upon GIS mapping data. A subsequent investigation of the proposed southern pipeline route conducted by the Alliance identified far fewer streamswithinthe ROW; the results of this investigation are discussed in further detail later in this section. Since the release of the Draft EIS, the Alliance identified the location of the injection well site (see Section 2.5.2.3). As a result, DOE updated the number of waterbodies shown in Table 3.6-5 (based on GIS mapping) to accountfor the Alliance’scurrently proposed southern pipeline routingfromthe Meredosia Energy Center to the proposedinjectionwell site. As discussed in Chapter 2, additional easements have been identified along the southern pipeline route that would be used to support trenchless drilling and boring activities. These easements represent construction areas that would be required on either side of a crossing. The total area of all of these easements would be approximately 26 acres and would intersect with one stream. A 0.1-mile section of intermittent stream is located within the additional easement areas. This value has been included in Table 3.6-5. Impacts to this stream would be similar to those addressed above for intermittent stream crossings. The Alliance has not defined any additional routingforthe northern route to the proposedinjection well site, since it is no longer under consideration. In order tofacilitate a representative comparison of the two routes, Table 3.6-5 presents the number of surface water crossingsfor the northern route including crossings through the CO2 storage study area based on hypothetical routing scenarios analyzed in the Draft EIS. As explained in Section 3.0, DOE used these hypothetical siting scenarios to evaluate a range of potential impacts, whereby some hypothetical routes would have less impact to physical resources and others would have greater impact, while still representing reasonable routes. Impacts related to the crossing of intermittent and ephemeral streams using dry trenching would be consistent with those presented above. There would be no impacts associated with stream channels that wouldbe avoided using horizontal directional drilling or jack and bore tunneling. Table 3.6-5.

This provides a conservative estimation of the number of features crossed by each pipeline route. The Alliance conducted a survey of waterbodies and wetlands along the southern pipeline route in spring 2013, which confirmed the presence of 2 perennial streams and only 13 intermittent streams (significantly fewer than the number identified via GIS mapping), as well as many ephemeral streams, ditches, and swales. Horizontal directional drilling or jack and bore technology would be used for all surface water crossings, except for dry intermittent or ephemeral streams. In order to confirm the presence and extent of streams and other waterbodies, the Alliance conducted a formal wetland survey (delineation) of the southern pipeline route (proposed option) in spring 2013 (after the Draft EIS was published) in accordance with USACE delineation methodology. A similar investigation was not conducted for the northern pipeline route, as it is no longer under consideration by the Alliance. The wetland delineation, which included surface waterbodies (i.e., open water wetlands), confirmed the presence of two perennial streams within the southern route. The investigation also identified a total of only 13 intermittent streams within the proposed southern route (significantly fewer than the number identified via GIS mapping as analyzed in the Draft EIS and depicted in Table 3.6-5), as well as many ephemeral streams, ditches, and swales. The Alliance will use this information to submit a jurisdictional determination request to the USACE prior to construction. The USACE will ultimately determine which features are considered waters of the U.S. and which features may be considered intermittent versus ephemeral. The final wetland determination will also be used as part of a Nationwide Permit No. 12 application for the project. If any significant changes occur to the final southern route or if another pipeline route would be selected, the Alliance would conduct a formal wetland delineation of the final CO2 pipelineroute prior to construction. The Alliance intends to avoid the surface water features during construction by employing the various trenchless technologies for the pipeline installation, as described earlier. Based on the results of the delineation described above, the Alliance indicated a projected total of 13 major pipeline crossing locations involving wetlands and/or surface waterbodies, some of which involve two or more co-located features, which would require horizontal direction drilling and/or jack and bore tunneling in the currently proposed southern route. The exact number, type, and length of crossingswould ultimately depend on thefinal pipelineroute. For either of the potential routes, the CO2 pipeline would cross beneath the Coon Creek Dike. For this crossing, the Alliance would be required to obtain permission from the USACE. In addition, the Alliance would likely be required to consult with the Coon Run Levee and Drainage District prior to construction. The dike and the creek would be crossed using horizontal directional drilling and no direct impacts to the waterway would be anticipated. In the event that the Alliance finds it necessary for the pipeline route to deviate fromthe southern pipeline route, impacts would be consistent with those addressed in this section, as the same siting criteria would be followed. In the event that the final pipeline routing would result in additional impacts to surface water resources, impacts would be temporary and minor, since they would be limited to the construction period and the Alliance would follow the construction processes and permittingrequirements addressedearlier in this section. Hydrostatic Testing The construction of the CO2 pipeline would require hydrostatic testing to certify the integrity of the pipeline before it can be put into operation. Hydrostatic testing would be performed in accordance with DOT pipeline safety regulations. If water is used, the pipeline would be filled with water and pressurized to check for any pressure loss that may indicate a leak. Table 3.6-6 summarizes the estimated amounts of water that would be required to support hydrostatic testing for both the southern and northern pipeline routes. These estimates represent a worst-case scenario and are based on the assumption that 31,000 gallons of water would be required for each mile of pipeline, that the entire pipeline would be a nominal 12 inches in diameter, and that no reuse of water would occur. Actual pipeline sizing would be determined during final engineering. If a smaller diameter pipeline were used, then less water would be required to support testing. The proposed southern pipeline route would require slightly less water than the northern pipeline route based upon the potential maximum length of the northern route (including hypothetical end-of-pipeline spurs). Table 3.6-6. Hydrostatic Water Needs for Pipeline Routes Water to support hydrostatic testing may be supplied from local streams or trucked in; however, sources for hydrostatic testing water have not yet been identified. In the event that water is withdrawn from local streams, a water use (appropriation) permit from the IDNR would likely be required, since any withdrawal of more than 10,000 gpd or 1 million gallons per year is required to be permitted. No chemicals would be added to the water used to test the pipeline. In the event that hydrostatic testingwater is withdrawn from streams, it would cause temporary minor impacts to the streams from which it is withdrawn, due to the diversion of flow that would occur to support the water withdrawal. Water withdrawals from surface waterbodies would only occur at features with sufficient flow to sustain such withdrawals without permanent impacts. Any such withdrawals would be conducted in compliance with wateruse permitrequirements. Hydrostatic testing water that could not be reused would likelybe discharged to local waterways under an NPDES permit from the IEPA or to an existing treatment facility. Sampling of the water would occur prior to discharge if required by the NPDES permit or receiving facility. The results of sample analysis would determine the fate of the discharge water. Since the hydrostatic testing would occur in virgin pipe prior to implementation, it is not anticipated that unacceptable concentrations of contaminants would be present in the effluent. Since any disposal of hydrostatic testing water would occur in compliance with NPDES permit conditions, only minor temporary impacts to local surface water resources would occur fromthe disposalof hydrostatic test water. CO2 Storage Study Area In the Draft EIS, DOE analyzed a dual-site injection well scenario, which would involve two injection well sites with one vertical injection well at each site. During the preparation of the Draft EIS, the Alliance modified its injection well design. The Alliance now proposes a single-site injection well scenario, which consists of one injection well site containing four horizontal injection wellslocatedwithinonewell pad. Under the single-site scenario now proposed by the Alliance, only one building would be constructed at the injection well site. This building, known as the site control and maintenance building, would house the well annulus maintenance and monitoring system equipment. Other features of the surface facilitieswould include meters, surface piping, and piping-related equipment such as pig launchers. The conceptual layout for the injection well site includes a gravel well pad, the site control and maintenance building, and a parking lot connected to Beilschmidt Road by two access roads. The updated design for the single-site scenario would affect up to 15 acres of land for construction of the injection wells and associated facilities, and up to 4 acres for the access roads. An additional 24 acres would be affected during staging and construction of the monitoring well network, which would include monitoring wells (see Figure 2-26). For the dual-site scenario analyzed in the Draft EIS, which is no longer being considered by the Alliance, construction activities would affect up to 28 acres for the injection and monitoring wells and associated facilities, and up to 64 acres for the staging and construction of access roads. See Section 2.5.2.2 for additional details about the proposed surface facilities. The proposed location for the injection well site under the single-site scenario (the proposed option) is depicted in Figure 2-20 and intersects approximately 0.1 mile of an intermittent stream. The Alliance indicated that this stream, an unnamed tributary to Indian Creek, and the adjacent wooded area in the southwest corner of the proposed location would remain undisturbed during construction; therefore, no direct impacts to surface waters would occur under this option. However, the location(s) of the injection wells has not yet been finalized. It is anticipated that the Alliance would conduct a formal wetland delineation at the selected injection well site(s) prior to construction. Direct and indirect impacts to surface water resources located in close proximity to the injection well site would be consistent with those described above for general construction impacts. Construction could cause temporary, indirect impacts to adjacent surface waters (including the unnamed tributary to Indian Creek depicted in Figure 2-20), such as increased sedimentation and surface water turbidity from runoff. These impacts would be minimized or avoided using BMPs as outlined in the NPDES and UICpermits (see Section 2.5.2.3). Construction of the injection wells and monitoring wells would require fresh water to support drilling operations. The Alliance estimates that up to a total of 8.68 million gallons of water could be required to drill and cement four horizontal wells. The monitoring wells would likely require an amount less than this, since they would be smaller in diameter and shallower than the injection wells. The fresh water for well construction would be obtained from the North Morgan County Water Co-Op, as it was for the stratigraphic test well. The North Morgan County Water Co-Op obtains its water from the city of Jacksonville, which obtains raw water from groundwater and surface water sources. As a result, negligible impacts to surface water availability would occur due to the construction of the injection and monitoring wells. Construction of the wells would result in the generation of wastewater, including brine, requiring disposal. For the injection wells and any deep monitoring wells, the groundwater withdrawn during well development would be very saline and would require measures to prevent this water from reaching surface waterbodies. These measures could include pre-treatment before discharge to surface water or direct removal of the withdrawn water by a tanker truck offsite. Lined earthen pits would contain any excess fluids generated during drilling, discarded water used in the cementing process, and spent drilling mud from mud change-outs. The pits would be lined with 30-mil high-density polyethylene plastic sheeting with welded seams to prevent infiltration of fluids into the subsurface. By appropriately storing and managing wastewater, potential runoff to nearby streams would be avoided. Potential impacts to surface waters from the construction of the wells would be short term and negligible based on the fluid-handling proceduresemployed during the well construction process. Construction of access roads to the injection well site(s) from existing roadways could result in the need for additional stream crossings; however, the Alliance would use existing roads to the maximum extent practicable to avoid the need to construct access roads over streams. DOE does not anticipate that any perennial streams would be crossed to support the construction of access roads, since existing public roads are present throughout the CO2 storage study area. Stream crossings would be limited to ephemeral and intermittent streams, which would be culverted. The construction of access roads over these features could result in minor to moderate temporary adverse impacts to these streams. BMPs required through Section 404 permitting (i.e., Nationwide Permit No. 12, Utility Line Activities) would be implemented both during and after construction. The BMPs, including a combination of stabilization and structural erosion and sediment control methods, would be implemented to reduce temporary impacts by controlling sedimentation and turbidity and to stabilize streambanks after construction. Key aspects of the BMPs are to control both surface and subsurface slope drainage, minimize slope erosion, and minimize or prevent channel erosion at stream crossings. Specific types of structural BMPs include installing temporary controlstructures such as sediment traps andfilterfences. Educational Facilities As discussed in Section 2.5.3, the specific locations of the educational facilities are currently unknown, but would be located in the Jacksonville area. This proposed component would require approximately 3.5 acres of land and could involve new construction, rehabilitation of existing structures, or a combination of both types of construction activities. If development of the educational facilities involves new construction, it would most likely occur on previously disturbed land with existing utility connections. As such, it is unlikely that that direct impacts on surface waters would occur. Since the location of the educational facilities is flexible within Jacksonville, it is anticipated that sites with surface water features would be avoided. Potential indirect impacts to adjacent surface water features related to the construction of the educational facilities would be consistent with those addressed above for general construction activities. These impacts would be short term and minor with BMPs applied as described above for general constructionactivities. As described in Sections 2.5.3 and 3.0, since the release of the Draft EIS, discussions between the Alliance and Jacksonville civic authorities have focused on a potential site in Jacksonville for the educational facilities. Because the locations of the educational facilities currently remain unknown, DOEcannot characterize existing surfacewater resources. 3.6.3.2 Operational Impacts Impacts common to the operation of the proposed project would include water quality impacts to local streams from stormwater runoff generated at these facilities, which generally consist of increased sediment and contaminants entering these waterbodies from surface sources and increased flow due to an increase in impervious cover. Adequately designed stormwater collection and distribution systems and pollution prevention measures would reduce or eliminate the potential for these operational impacts to surface water resources. Adherence to applicable laws, regulations, policies, standards, and BMPs would also help avoid and minimize potential adverse operational impacts to surface waters; therefore, impacts to water quality from typical operations would be minor. As with any industrial activity, there is potential for surface water contamination from spills of fuels, lubricants, and coolants used by vehicles or heavy equipment for maintenance and operations at the Meredosia Energy Center, CO2 pipeline, or the CO2 injection wells. The Alliance would implement a SWPPP (if required), SPCC plan, and BMPs during maintenance activities to avoid or minimize potential impacts to surface waters from accidental spills of fuel, fuel constituents, and other materials. Taking into account the spill prevention and response procedures and BMPs that would minimize the potential for spills to affect surface water resources, DOE anticipates that potential impacts to surface water quality would be minor. The remainder of this section addresses potential impacts from operations specific to each element of the proposed project. Since the Draft EIS was published, project design changes have occurred. As a result of these changes, a modified NPDES permit application was prepared and submitted by the Alliance to the IEPA on June 20, 2013. The modified permit application contained revised estimates regarding water withdrawal volumes from the Illinois River; water discharge volumes to the Illinois River; and constituent loads within discharges from several outfalls at the energy center. These changes are addressed inthis section. Meredosia Energy Center Stormwater runoff not exposed to industrial pollutants would be directed to an existing stormwater detention area that would be managed by Ameren. The location of the existing stormwater detention area is depicted on Figure 2-13. This detention area would store noncontact, nonindustrial stormwater runoff (i.e., stormwater runoff not exposed to industrial pollutants). The collected water would naturally evaporate and infiltrate into the groundwater system. Runoff would be conveyed using surface drainage; however, it is likely that some newly constructed stormwater inlets and underground storm sewers would be required. Minor indirect impacts of sedimentation could occur as a result of any construction activities associated with the installation of any new stormwater conveyances; however, these impacts would be short term and minimized through the implementation of the SWPPP required for NPDES permitting, which would include BMPs tocontrolerodedsediments. Stormwater runoff exposed to coal storage (including coal pile runoff, coal handling dust suppression water, coal handling equipment wash-down water, and stormwater from the coal yard) would be diverted to a new lined detention basin through berms and above-ground conveyance systems. The basin would be lined to detain water and provide detention for removal of suspended solids. After an appropriate detention time, the stormwater would flow to the wastewater treatment system and would then be discharged to the Illinois River. Chemical reagents, including flocculants and polymers, may be used in thelined detention basin toincrease detention before discharge tothewastewatertreatment system. The detention basin has not yet been designed; so the required size, depth, and retention time have not yet been determined for this feature. The Alliance designated the area where the detention basin is expected to be sited (Figure 2-13). The detention basin would be constructed on a portion of this site andwould not encompass the entire area. Stormwater from other areas where the water may be exposed to industrial materials or processes would be identified during the final design (e.g., the bottom ash bunker and fly ash silo unloading) and would flow either to the lined detention basin or flow directly to the wastewater treatment system through the use of curbing and either aboveground or underground conveyances. The treated effluent would be dischargedto the Illinois River in compliance withanNPDES permit. Water sources for the project’s makeup water would include deep wells on the property, city water, and the Illinois River. The Illinois River would be the primary source of makeup process water for the proposed project and would require additional treatment at the new process water treatment facility as discussed in Section2.4.2.2. River water would be used to meet thefollowing needs: • Screen andstrainerbackwash; • Makeup water for the cooling towers for Unit 4, the direct contact cooler polishing system, and the airseparation unitand compression and purification units; • Makeup waterfor gas quality control equipment; • Process waterfor the air separation unitand compression and purification unit; • Equipment cooling; • Equipment wash down; and • Coal handling dust suppression in the coal yard. As indicated earlier, the Meredosia Energy Center used an average of 217 mgd of cooling water supplied through the river water intake structure until operations were suspended at the energy center at the end of 2011. The maximum capacity of the river water intake structure is 414 mgd. The proposed project would require approximately 13.6 mgd of cooling water withdrawal from the river, which represents a nearly 94 percent reduction in river water usage from past operations at the energy center. However, water discharges from the Meredosia Energy Center to the Illinois River would equal approximately 10.6 mgd, whichresults inan actual net withdrawal fromthe river of only 3.0 mgd. As a result of the significant reduction in cooling water withdrawal compared to historical values, there would be no need for an upgrade to the existing river water intake structure. The projected net total demand for the project of 3.0 mgd of water from the river represents approximately 0.02 percent of the average flow rate (14,139 mgd) and approximately 0.1 percent of the 7Q10 low-flow rate (2,391 mgd) for the Illinois River. Therefore, the proposed project would have a minor impact on the Illinois River even during typicaldrought(i.e., 7Q10 low-flow) conditions.  In 2011, a new rule was proposed under Section 316(b) of the CWA for existing facilities, which the USEPA plans to finalize by November 2013. As per the proposed rule, existingfacilitiesthat withdrawat least 25 percent of their water from an adjacent waterbody exclusively for cooling purposes and have a design intake flow of greater than 2 mgd would be subject to an upper limit on how many fish can be killed by being pinned against intake screens or other parts at the facility (i.e., impingement). In addition, existing facilities that withdraw very large amounts of water (125 mgd or more) would be required to conduct studies to help their permitting authority determine whether and what site-specific controls, if any, would be required to reduce the number of aquatic organisms sucked into cooling water systems (i.e., entrainment). The decision process may also include public input. The scheduled Section 316(b) rulemaking would likely have no bearing on the proposed project because the water withdrawn via the existing intake structure would be used predominantly to provide makeup water for the cooling water systems and the intake structure would be designed such that the intake velocity does not exceed 0.5 feet per second. At this rate, most fish can swim away from the cooling water intake of the facility (USEPA 2011k). See Section 3.8, Biological Resources, for an analysis of potential impacts of the cooling water intake on fish species. Cooling water intake structures are reviewed by the IEPA with each NPDES operating permit renewal application; therefore, any required upgrades would be identified during thisprocess. Prior to the suspension of the energy center at the end of 2011, the Meredosia Energy Center generated approximately 189 mgd of wastewater fromindustrial processes (including noncontact cooling water) and discharged treated wastewater to the Illinois River under NPDES Permit No. IL0000116. In September 2011, the Alliance received approval for a modified NPDES Permit No. IL0000116, which went into effect on November 1, 2011, and is valid through October 31, 2016. As indicated earlier, on June 20, 2013, the Alliance submitted an NPDES permit application to further modify the existing NPDES Permit No. IL0000116 based on project operational design changes and revisions. The application was prepared after submittal of the Draft EIS; therefore, the analysis described herein has been updated accordingly. The new permit application includes changes in effluent water sources, contaminant loads, and flow rates (discussed in greater detail below) to support the planned discharges from the FutureGen 2.0 Project. If the final design for the proposed project results in any changes to contaminant loads orflowrates, the permit may need to be modified further. Under the proposed project, a considerably smaller amount of wastewater (10.6 mgd) would be discharged to the Illinois River, as summarized in Table 3.6-7. Most of the wastewater would come from blowdown water from the main cooling tower (9.8 mgd), while the remainder would consist of backwash from the river water intake screen, once-through cooling water from the air compressor, effluent from two new onsite wastewater treatment systems, and other minor sources. The other sources of wastewater discharge would include strainer backwash, effluent from the oil-water separators, and process condensate. The proposed project would use two wastewater treatment systems to remove contaminants from wastewater before discharge to the Illinois River. The compression and purification unit wastewater treatment system would use pH adjustment and mercury filtration media to treat wastewater before conveyance to the Unit 4 wastewater treatment system. The Unit 4treatment system would be designed to meet all state of Illinois applicable water quality standards found in 35 IAC 302 (Water Quality Standards) and applicable state and federal effluent limits. The proposed project would also utilize up to three oil-water separators during operations. The existing oil-water separator for Unit 4 would be replaced, and up to two additional oil-water separators would be installed as required for new facilities. One new oil-water separator would be installed near the compression and purification unit island and an additional unit would be installed near the air separation unit island. The proposed oil-water separators would be coalescing plate type units andwouldtreat effluentwater prior to discharge at Outfall 002. Table 3.6-7.

Impacts to the Illinois River resulting from the discharge of wastewater are expected to be minor, and no effluent limits would be exceeded. In addition, discharges would not contribute to the impairment of the Illinois River for fecal coliform, PCBs, or mercury. The total flows and loads associated with the FutureGen 2.0 Project would be substantially lower than the historic Meredosia Energy Center flows and loads, taking discharges from all outfalls into account, which includes Outfalls 001, A01, 002, 003, 004, and 006. Collectively, the 33 constituent loadings listed on the NPDES discharge permit application would be reduced by an average of nearly 86 percent. Five of the six outfalls associated with the project would see a reduction for all applicable constituents. The discharges from Outfall 002 would have increased loads of certain constituents when examined in isolation, which includes an increase in sulfate of more than 50 percent at that outfall. The increased sulfate discharged at Outfall 002 would be a result of removing sulfur dioxide from the boiler flue gas by the air pollution control devices and transferring the sulfur to water as sulfate. Other constituents that could increase in discharge amount at Outfall 002 include total suspended solids, fluoride, nitrate/nitrite, aluminum, barium, iron, magnesium, manganese, titanium, and chromium. However, as stated earlier, the FutureGen 2.0 Project would result in a net decrease in all constituents when all discharges are taken into account. In addition, since the recirculating cooling towers release heat to the surrounding air, the towers would minimize thermal discharges to the Illinois River, which would also have a positive impact onwaterquality when compared with historical operation of the energy center. Table 3.6-8 provides a summary of the daily maximum effluent concentration limits for each constituent by outfall, pursuant to the modified NPDES Permit No. IL0000116. The permit also includes 30-day average concentration limits and 20 additional special conditions that are applicable to onsite operations and monitoring requirements. Table 3.6-9 compares the water withdrawal rate and wastewater production rate for the FutureGen 2.0 Project with historic flow rates for the energy center prior to its suspension at the end of 2011. The historical scenario represents the water demand before the energy center suspended operations, while the projected scenario represents the estimated water demand for the proposed project. The river water withdrawal rate and wastewater production rate would decrease by approximately 94 percent when compared with the prior operation of the energy center. With this significant reduction in flow, the FutureGen 2.0 Project would reduce impacts to the Illinois River when compared with historical operation of the energy center. However, the river withdrawal and discharge rates would increase by a net withdrawal rate of 2.4 mgd, in comparison to the current conditions where there is no withdrawal or discharge. Table 3.6-8.

On occasion, maintenance or inspection activities may require excavation around segments of the pipeline. During these kinds of maintenance operations, the BMPs discussed in Section 3.6.3.1 would be used, as applicable, to avoid or minimize any indirect impacts (e.g., sedimentation and turbidity) to adjacent surface waters. Hydrostatic testing may be required every 3 to 5 yearsto verify the integrity of the CO2 pipeline. If water were used in the testing, it would be obtained from available sources and trucked to the testing sites. Hydrostatictesting water would likely be discharged to local waterways under an NPDES permit from the IEPA, or to a permitted treatment facility. Since any disposal of hydrostatic testing water to local waterways would occur in compliance with NPDES permit conditions, disposal of hydrostatic test water would have minor temporary impacts on local surface water resources. These impacts would be similar to the construction impacts discussed in Section 3.6.3.1. Table 3.6-9.

Mainline block valves would be provided approximately every 10 miles to isolate and contain any pipeline leak. If CO2 were released from the pipeline, it would expand rapidly as a gas and could include both liquid and solid (i.e., dry ice) phases, depending on temperature and pressure. As the product in the pipeline would be over 97 percent CO2 with few impurities (i.e., oxygen, nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, nitrogen, argon, and water) and would not remain under sufficient pressure to dissolve into surface water, it would have negligible adverse impact on surface water quality in the unlikely event of a release; however, it could potentially reduce surface water temperatures near a release. The magnitude of temperature reduction would depend upon the size of the release. The effects of temperature changes on aquatic biota are discussed further in Section 3.8, Biological Resources. Section 3.17, Human Health and Safety, addresses the potential human healthimpacts resulting from the operation ofthe CO2 pipeline. CO2 Storage Study Area As discussed in Section 3.17, Human Health and Safety, a possible impact from the operation of the injection wells may result from an injection well blowout (i.e., a sudden loss of CO2 from failure of an injection well during operation), which is considered an extremely unlikely event. If a CO2 injection well blowout were to occur, the main adverse outcome to surface waters near the wellhead would be the potential for release of formation fluids (e.g., brine) to an adjacent surface waterbody, which would be similar to a conventional spill. Because such a release is considered highly unlikely, operation of CO2 injection wells would be expected to have a minor impact on any surface water resources present near the well. Effects would include an increase in salinity of nearbysurface water features and would be localized to the area around the affected wellhead. This could have direct, temporary adverse impacts to surface water chemistry and aquatic biota. The effects would be temporary as continued flow would dilute and disperse the brine, in addition to remedial activities conducted during spill cleanup. Events of this type would be avoided or minimized by incorporating high-pressure piping, overpressure protection (i.e., relief) valves, and blowoutpreventersinto the design of the injection wells. No additional impacts, beyond those addressed previously for the operation of the CO2 pipeline, would be anticipated during the operation ofthe pipeline across the CO2 storage studyarea to the injection wells. Educational Facilities Normal operations of the educational facilities would generally not affect surface water resources. Considering that the selected site(s) would be located on previously disturbed land with existing utility connections, itisunlikely that directorindirect impacts would result from operation ofthefacilities. 3.6.4 Impacts of the No Action Alternative Under the no action alternative, DOE would not provide cost-shared funding for the FutureGen 2.0 Project. Although the Alliance may still elect to construct and operate the project in the absence of DOE cost-shared funding, for the purposes of the analysis in this EIS, DOE assumed the no action alternative is equivalent to the no-build alternative. Therefore, the project would not be constructed and there would be no change to surface waterresources. 3.7 WETLANDS AND FLOODPLAINS 3.7.1 Introduction This section describes wetlands and floodplains potentially affected by the construction and operation of the proposed project. This section also analyzes the potential direct and indirect effects of the proposed projecton these resources. This section provides the required wetland and floodplain assessment in compliance with regulations promulgated at 10 CFR 1022, “Compliance with Floodplain and Wetland Environmental Review Requirements.” These regulations provide a guide for DOE compliance with Executive Order (EO) 11988, “Floodplain Management,” and EO 11990, “Protection of Wetlands.” EO 11988 requires federal agencies, while planning their actions, to avoid to the extent possible adverse impacts associated with the modification of floodplains and to avoid support for development in a floodplain when there is a better practicable alternative. EO 11990 requires that federal agencies, while planning their actions, consider alternatives to affecting wetlands, if applicable, and limit adverse impacts to the extent practicable ifimpacts cannot be avoided. Floodplains are closely related to surface waters, as rivers, streams, lakes, and ponds are the ultimate destination for precipitation and snowmelt on land and the primary source of flood flows. Surface waters are specificallydiscussedinSection3.6, Surface Water. 3.7.1.1 Wetlands Wetlands are among the most productive environments in the world, comparable to rain forests and coral reefs. Many species of wildlife, including a large percentage of threatened and endangered species, depend on wetlands for survival. Wetlands are also important for scientific and educational opportunities and can provide openspaceforrecreation where publicaccess is available. Wetlands have unique characteristics that set them apart from other environments, providing the basis for wetland identification and classification. These unique Wetlands are defined by the USACE as characteristics include a layer of soil that is saturated or follows (40 CFR 230): Those areas that are inundated with water for part of the growing season, soils that inundated or saturated by surface or contain little or no oxygen, and plants adapted to wet or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal seasonally saturated conditions. Wetlands serve many functions, circumstances do support, a prevalence of including the storage and slow release of rain, snowmelt, and vegetation typically adapted for life in seasonal floodwaters to surface waters. Additionally, wetlands saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally provide wildlife habitat, stabilize and retain sediment, and include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar perform an important role in nutrient (e.g., nitrogen and areas. phosphorus) cycling. Wetlands also help to maintain stream flow during dry periods and provide groundwater recharge functions. Wetland types are often categorized using the USFWS document Classification of Wetlands and Deepwater Habitats of the United States. This classification system is used by the USFWS when categorizing wetland types to develop the National Wetland Inventory (NWI), a series of maps that show wetlands and deepwater habitats of the United States. The Illinois Wetland Inventory (IWI) classification was developed to facilitate the use and presentation of NWI data. The IWI uses spatial data provided by the NWI, but provides its own, more simplified classification system describing each area of NWI-mapped wetlands. The IWI data does not include any additional wetland mapping, but relies on NWI-mapped wetlands. Although the NWI classification provides valuable information, a relatively high level of detail makes data analysis cumbersome (e.g., there are 617 unique NWI codes used in Illinois) (Suloway and Hubbell 1994). In contrast, the IWI classification system is much less detailed, containing only 13 basic groups of wetland and deepwater classification codes. Certain wetland types in the IWI classification system may be characterized as a combination of 2 or more of the 13 basic groups. For simplicity and consistencywith IDNR, the description of wetlands inthis sectionutilizes the IWIclassificationsystem. The IWIclassificationsystemcontains 13 wetland types (Suloway and Hubbell 1994; USFWS 2012a): 1. Bottomland Forests: Dominated by woody vegetation 20 feet tall or greater covering 30 percent or more of the area, which are temporarily or seasonally flooded, but which lack continuously standing water. 2. Swamps: Dominated by woody vegetation 20 feet tall or greater covering 30 percent or more of the area where water is present on a permanent or semi-permanent basis. 3. Scrub-Shrub: Characterized by woody vegetation less than 20 feet tall covering 30 percent or more of thearea. 4. Shallow Marsh and Wet Meadow: Dominated by rooted, herbaceous vegetation. Characterized by standing water that is present for brief to moderate periods during the growing season. 5. Deep Marsh: Dominated by rooted, herbaceous vegetation. Characterized by standing water or soilsaturation on a semi-permanent to permanent basis during the growing season. 6. Open Water: Unvegetated areas less than 20 acres that are covered by water less than 6.6 feet deep. This includes ponds, borrow pits, small reservoirs, and open water areas within a marshor swamp. 7. Shallow Lake: Shallow open waterbodies that are 20 acres or more in area and less than 6.6 feet in depth that occupy topographicdepressionsor that are impounded river channels. 8. Lake Shore: Locatedalongthe edges of large rivers and the shores of wave-affectedlakes. 9. Emergent Lake: Lake shore wetlands that have a zone of emergent vegetation extending from the shoreto approximately 6.6 feet in depth. 10. Perennial Riverine: Characterized by flowing water throughout the year. Largely shallow (less than 6.6 feet deep) rivers and streams within unimpounded channels; they are either unvegetatedor vegetated with nonpersistent emergentplants or aquatic plant beds. 11. Intermittent Riverine: Contain flowing water for only part of the year. Largely shallow (less than 6.6 feet deep) rivers and streams within unimpounded channels; they are either unvegetatedor vegetatedwithnonpersistent emergent plants or aquatic plant beds. 12. Deepwater Lakes (Lacustrine): Waterbodies deeper than 6.6 feet that occupy topographic depressions orthat are impounded riverchannels. 13. Deepwater Rivers (Riverine): Unimpounded channels containing flowing water greater than 6.6 feetin depth. Wetlands once covered more than 8 million acres in Illinois, or approximately 23 percent of the total land area. As a result of human modification of the environment, approximately 90 percent of those wetlands have been destroyed. Approximately 1.25 million acres of wetlands exist in the state, although approximately one-fourth of that total were modified or created by dikes, impoundments, or excavation activities. In Illinois, wetland loss is principally attributed to conversion of the land for agricultural purposes and to a lesser extent by land development associated with population growth (Suloway and Hubbell 1994). Over half of the counties in Illinois (53 counties) have less than 2 percent of their land area occupied by natural wetlands. Most of the state’s remaining natural wetlands (over 57 percent) are located in southern Illinois. Northern Illinois contains approximately 22 percent of the state’s natural wetlands, while the remaining 21 percent arelocated in central Illinois (Suloway and Hubbell 1994). 3.7.1.2 Floodplains Rivers and streams are part of nature’s system for carrying water from high ground down to lakes and oceans. The land areas adjacent to the streams, rivers, and lakes that are inundated when flooding occurs are floodplains. Flooding is a natural process and floodplains are a vital part of that process. Beneficial values of floodplains include the moderation of floods, water quality, groundwater recharge, fish and wildlife habitat, open space, and recreational value. A flood occurs when heavy rains or snowmelt send more water downstream than the carrying channel can handle. There are three primary types of flooding in Illinois: riverine flooding (a flood typically seen as water flowing over a stream’s banks), ponding (a flood occurring when low areas fill up faster than they can be drained), and sheet flooding (a flood when water flowsalong the surface withouta channel)(IDNR 2006). Flooding potential is generally described in terms of flooding recurrenceintervals, such as the 100-year or 500-year flood. The 100-year floodplain is the area projected to be inundated by a storm that has a one percent probability of occurring in any year. The 500-year floodplain is the area projected to be inundated by a storm with a 0.2 percent probability of occurring in any year. The 100-year floodplain is the national standard on which floodplain management and the National Flood Insurance Program are based. Since flooding events can cause very costly natural disasters, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), through the National Flood Insurance Program, enables property owners to purchase insurance protection against losses from flooding. Floodplain management activities of the National Flood Insurance Programinclude the development of flood insurance rate maps for flood insurance rating purposes. A flood insurance rate map outlines flood risk zones within communities and is usually issued following a flood insurance study that summarizes the analysis of flood hazards within the subject community. FEMA provides flood insurance rate maps to a wide range of users includingprivate citizens, community officials, insurance agents and brokers, lending institutions, and other federal agencies. A flood insurance study includes detailed engineering studies to map predicted flood elevations at specified flood recurrence intervals. Generally, the study is concerned with peak discharges in streams and rivers for 100-year and 500-year storm events and includes engineering analyses of predicted flood elevations for each flood recurrence interval. Based on the results of the engineering analyses, flood risk zones are assignedforinsurance purposes. Illinois has one of the largest inland systems of rivers, lakes, and streams in the nation. Nearly 15 percent of the total land area in the state (or 7,400 square miles) is subject to flooding. As Illinois developed, the state’s waterways often served as the focal pointfor growthandcommerce, because theyprovided needed water resources and transportation corridors. Homes, buildings, businesses, and, in some instances, entire communities now occupy floodplains across Illinois. This floodplain development has resulted in continual and, often, severe damage as well as loss of life. In Illinois, it is estimated that over 250,000 buildings are located in floodplains. Floods are by far the most common natural disaster in the state, accounting for well over 90 percent of the declared disasters. Annual damages due to flooding are estimated toaverage nearly$700million(IDNR 2006). 3.7.1.3 Region of Influence The ROI for wetlands and floodplains includes the areas potentially affected by the construction and operation of the proposed project, consisting of the Meredosia Energy Center, the CO2 pipeline, the CO2 injection wells, and the proposed educational facilities. The ROI defines the extent of the areas where direct effects from construction and operation may be experienced, and it encompasses the areas where indirect effects from the proposed project wouldmost likelyoccur. 3.7.1.4 Method of Analysis and Factors Considered DOE assessed potential impacts to wetlands and floodplains primarily by using a GIS mapping application to calculate impact acreages for NWI-mapped (and IWI re-classified) or field delineated wetlands and FEMA-mapped floodplains. DOE overlaid baseline environmental data (i.e., wetland and floodplain locations) with potential project features to determine the locations and extents of potentially affected wetlands and floodplains. In locations where wetlands and floodplains would be impacted, qualitative assessments were made of what those impacts would be. DOE assessed the potential for impacts to wetlands and floodplainsbased on whetherthe proposedproject would: • Cause fillingof wetlandsorotherwisealterdrainage patternsthat would affect wetlands; • Cause wetland type or classification conversions due to alterationsof land cover attributes; • Alter a floodway or floodplain or otherwise impede or redirect flows such that human health, the environment, or personal property could be affected; • Conflict withapplicable flood management plans orordinances; or • Conflict with FEMA’s national standard for floodplain management (i.e., maximum allowable increase of water surface elevation of 1 foot for a 1 percent annual chance [100-year recurrence interval] flood event). With respect to wetlands, this section discusses the potential for impacts related to the loss of resources (i.e., filling impacts), type Fill material is defined by the applicable or classification conversions (e.g., converting a forested wetland regulatory agencies [USACE and USEPA] as, “material placed in waters of the U.S. where to an herbaceous wetland), and surface disturbances within the material has the effect of either replacing wetlands or their vicinities that would alter or affect the wetland any portion of a water of the U.S. with dry land or its hydrology or characteristics. Each such action would or changing the bottom elevation of any ultimately affect the functions and values of wetland resources portion of a water.” [67 FR 31129] (e.g., attenuating flood flows and providing habitat for wildlife). For wetlands, the following three types of potential impacts could occur: • Direct wetland loss byplacement of fill material orstructures; • Wetlandtype conversions caused byproject activities; and • Wetland disturbances, which are generally considered temporary, construction-relatedimpacts. DOE assessed potential floodplain impacts by determining the potential of the proposed project components to place fill material or structures in a floodplain in a manner that would expose people or structures to increased levels of flood hazards or violate FEMA’s national standard for floodplain management. 3.7.1.5 Regulatory Framework Wetlands Certain wetland features, called “waters of the U.S.,” are regulated by the USACE under the CWA because they are important for the preservation of navigable waterways and interstate commerce. Waters of the U.S. are subject to federal jurisdiction and permitting under Section 404 of the CWA and include all navigable waterways, their tributaries, as well as wetlands contiguous (connected) to and adjacent to those navigable waterways and tributaries. Isolated wetlands (those that have no physical, chemical, or biological connection to waters of the U.S.) are not regulated under federal jurisdiction unless they are adjacent to waters ofthe U.S. Isolated wetlands arenot currently regulated by thestate of Illinois. Throughout the ROI for wetlands and floodplains, federal wetland regulations are enforced by the USACE St. Louis and Rock Island districts. Under Section 404 of the CWA, a USACE permit would be required for the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S., which is authorized by a Nationwide Permit or an Individual Permit, depending upon the extent of the impact and the characteristics of the impacted wetland(s). Construction of utility lines (e.g., pipelines) that would affect waters of the U.S. can be permitted with a Nationwide Permit (Number 12 – “Utility Line Activities”) if less than 0.5 acre of wetlands or waters of the U.S. are disturbed, or an Individual Permit if more than 0.5 acre is disturbed. Both the Nationwide Permit and the Individual Permit require that certain conditions are met. In addition, construction within or alteration of (e.g., dredging activities, placement of fill material) a traditional navigable waterway (e.g., the Illinois River) below the defined ordinary high water mark requires USACE permitting under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act. This is discussed in greater detailin Section3.6, Surface Water. Floodplains FEMA has adopted a maximum allowable increase of water surface elevation of 1 foot for a 1 percent annual chance (100-year recurrence interval) flood event as the national standard for floodplain management purposes. Manylocal ordinances have adoptedthis standard. The Morgan County Floodplain Ordinance states that no elevation in flood heights is permissible unless approved via permit by IDNR. IDNR requires permitting for construction in a floodway (i.e., the channel of a river, lake, or stream and that portion of the adjacent land area that is needed to safely store and convey the 100-year flood event without substantial increases in flood heights), which are sometimes defined on FEMA maps. When FEMA mapping in an area does not include a floodway delineation, IDNR generally requires permitting for any work in the floodplain. Since FEMA has not mapped floodways in the project area, IDNR must review all construction activities within the 100-year floodplain. The Illinois Floodplain Regulations enforced by IDNR (17 IAC 3700) state that the maximum water level increase within a floodway is 0.5 foot in rural areas and 0.1foot in urban areas. The Morgan County Floodplain Ordinance also states that any non-residential buildings constructed in a 100-year floodplain must either be constructed such that the lowest floor (including basement) is elevated to, at least, one foot above the level of the base flood elevation or flood-proofed (i.e., watertight and capable of withstanding the effects of a 100-year flood) below 1 foot above thebaseflood elevation (Morgan County 2009). 3.7.2 Affected Environment The entire proposed project would be located in Morgan County, Illinois. Morgan County contains approximately 6,170 acres of wetlands, which comprise approximately 1.7 percent of the county’s total land area. Of that acreage, approximately 4,210 acres are considered natural wetlands. The most abundant wetland type in the county is bottomland forest, which consists of temporarily or seasonally flooded forested wetlandsthat lack continuously standing water (Suloway and Hubbell 1994). Morgan County contains approximately 36,830 acres of 100-year floodplains, which comprise approximately 10 percent of the county’stotalland area (IDNR 2009a). 3.7.2.1 Meredosia Energy Center This section assesses impacts to wetlands and floodplains based on the original design for the energy center that was analyzed in the Draft EIS. Although the Alliance updated its design to reduce the amount of area that would be impacted by the construction and operation of the facility (see Figure 2-15),the impact analysis in this sectionaddresses the original design, since it represents a conservativeupper boundfor the analysis ofthese resources. Wetlands Based on a wetland delineation conducted in May 2011 at the Meredosia Energy Center property, two small wetlands were identified. Both wetlands are located near the eastern property boundary along Old Naples Road (see Appendix D, Wetlands Surveys [D1]). These two wetlands cover areas of 0.37 acre (Wetland Area PA) and 0.26 acre (Wetland Area PB), respectively. Based upon the current design, thesewetland areas are not locatedwithin the proposed footprint of the FutureGen 2.0 Project. Representatives from the USACE performed a site visit at the Meredosia Energy Center on August 16, 2011, to conduct a Jurisdictional Determination. The USACE agreed with the results of the wetland delineation regarding the location and extent of each wetland feature. The USACE identified that the two onsite wetlands are both subject to USACE jurisdiction under Section 404 of the CWA. Although there is no surface hydrologic connection between these wetlands and the Illinois River (i.e., a navigable waterway), the USACE stated that the onsite wetlands are connected to the river via groundwater, rendering them waters of the U.S. The larger of the two wetlands is a low-lying area that appears to capture stormwater from other portions of the property, such as the main entrance and exit roads to the energy center. These wetlands are not mapped by NWI, and therefore have not been categorized by the IWI. However, based on field observations, these wetlands would be classified as scrub-shrub/shallow marsh/wet meadow in the IWI classification system. Vegetation in these wetlands consists primarily of cattail (Typha spp.), eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides) seedlings, and grasses (Sedge spp.). These wetland areas, aswell as other NWI-mapped wetlands inthe vicinityof the Meredosia EnergyCenter, are depicted in Figure 3.7-1 superimposed over the potential impact areas from the original design presented in the Draft EIS. Floodplains The FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Map covering the Meredosia Energy Center (Map Number 17137C0004D; effective date August 18, 2009) indicates that portions of the overall site and potentially affected offsite locations lie within the 100-year floodplain of the Illinois River. This 100-year floodplain has a mapped base flood elevation of 447 feet above mean sea level. Small areas of 500-year floodplain bordering this 100-year floodplain are also mapped within the Meredosia Energy Center property. The portion of the energy center where the main physical structure of the oxy-combustion facility is proposed to be located is outside of the mapped 100-year floodplain, indicating a minimal flood hazard in this specific location (FEMA 2009). Areas of FEMA-mapped 100-year and 500-year floodplains at the energy center are depicted in Figure 3.7-2 superimposed over the potential impact areas from the original designpresentedin theDraft EIS. DOE = U.S. Department ofEnergy; NWI = National Wetland Inventory Figure 3.7-1.

Floodplains at the Meredosia Energy Center 3.7.2.2 CO2 Pipeline The proposed CO2 pipeline corridor from the Meredosia Energy Center to the CO2 storage study area is approximately 26 miles in length (see Figure 2-17). DOE derived wetland spatial data from NWI digital mapping data obtained from USFWS (USFWS 2011a). However, DOE cross-correlated and renamed the NWI codes with their corresponding, simpler IWI codes as described earlier. DOE obtained floodplain information forMorgan County through FEMA digital Flood Insurance RateMap data(FEMA 2011). Coon Run is located within the pipeline corridor. A levee has been constructed along a portion of Coon Run, fromjust east of the Illinois River until itsintersection with US-67 (State Route 100), approximately 3 miles east of the Meredosia Energy Center. This levee serves to control and direct flood flows in this vicinity. Wetlands An overview of wetlands in Morgan County is presented in Section 3.7.2. Figure 3.7-3 and Figure 3.7-4 present the extents of NWI-mapped wetlands within the pipeline corridor. Table 3.7-1 summarizes the wetland types (based on their corresponding IWI classifications; see Section 3.7.1.1) within the 4-mile wide pipeline corridor. Table 3.7-1.

CO2 = carbon dioxide; IWI = Illinois Wetland Inventory; NWI = National Wetland Inventory Within the pipeline corridor, several wetland types are present as indicated in Table 3.7-1. The majority of these wetlands (approximately 60 percent) are either bottomland forest or perennial stream. Refer to Figure 3.7-3 and Figure 3.7-4 for specific wetland locations, as well as the map view figures in Appendix C, Map Views of Pipeline. Wetland delineations were conducted along the entire pipeline ROW in the spring and summer of 2013. All waters of the U.S. that could be considered jurisdictional by the USACE were identified and will be submitted to the Corps in September 2013 for Jurisdictional Determination. Floodplains An overview of floodplains in Morgan Countyis presentedin Section 3.7.2.

Wetlands and Floodplains in CO2 Pipeline Corridor (Eastern Portion) and CO2 Storage Study Area Within the 4-mile wide corridor for the proposed CO2 pipeline, several major surface waters have associated floodplains along their banks. As shown in Table 3.7-2, these include the Illinois River, which has a wide floodplain in western Morgan County and is the only surface water in the ROI with substantial areas of 500-year floodplains. Other surface waters in the ROI with associated 100-year floodplains include: Willow Creek, Coon Run, Spring Run, Indian Creek, Lick Branch, Snake Creek, Conover Branch,Mauvaise Terre Creek, and Little IndianCreek(FEMA2011). Table 3.7-2. Floodplains within the CO2 Pipeline Corridor CO2 = carbon dioxide 3.7.2.3 CO2 Storage Study Area Tables 3.7-3 and 3.7-4 provide a summary of wetland features and floodplains that are located within the CO2 storage study area. DOE derived wetland spatial data from NWI digital mapping data obtained from USFWS (USFWS 2011a). However, DOE cross-correlated and renamed the NWI codes with their corresponding IWI codes as described earlier. DOE obtained floodplain information for Morgan County through FEMA digital Flood Insurance Rate Map data (FEMA 2011). Wetlands In April 2011, a wetland field investigation was conducted by the Alliance on two separate parcels within the CO2 storage study area. The field investigation was conducted to inspect for the presence of jurisdictional wetlands at two proposed locations for the stratigraphic well pad. The proposed locations included the Beilschmidt Characterization Pad and the Hoagland Characterization Pad. The Beilschmidt Pad is an approximately 11.25-acre area located on the south side of Beilschmidt Road (shown in Figure 3.7-4 as stratigraphic well); the Hoagland Pad is approximately 15.28 acres and is located on the north side of Beilschmidt Road (approximately 2,000 feet northwest of the stratigraphic well). Jurisdictional wetlands were not identified on either parcel during the investigation (see Appendix D, Wetlands Surveys [D3]) and the USACE later concurred with these findings. The Beilschmidt Pad was eventually selected as the location for the stratigraphic well, which was installed during the period October to December 2011. Refer to Section 2.5.2.5foradditionaldetails regardingthe stratigraphic well. The Alliance also conducted a wetland delineation of the preliminary locations for soil gas monitoring within the CO2 storage study area (see Appendix D, Wetlands Surveys [D2]). This wetland delineation was limited to seven monitoring sites comprising less than 50 square feet in total, all of which were located adjacent to county roads. No wetlands were observed during this survey. No other wetland delineation has yet been conducted elsewhereon the CO2 storage studyarea. Elsewhere within the CO2 storage study area, three NWI-mapped wetland types have been mapped, totaling approximately 67.5 acres (see Figure 3.7-5 and Map View 4 in Appendix C, Maps Views of Pipeline [C1]). These wetland types include open water, shallow marsh/wet meadow, and bottomland forest (USFWS 2012a). These wetland areas represent less than 1.0 percent of the 6,800-acre CO2 storage studyarea. Assuch,the NWIidentifies relativelyfewwetlands inthis area. Additional areas of wetlands outside of those mapped by NWI may be present elsewhere on the CO2 storage study area. Based upon the size of the site and the presence of forested (unfarmed) areas along streams within the site, it is possible that additional wetlands exist. A formal wetland delineation would be conducted prior to construction activities. CO2 = carbon dioxide; NWI =National Wetland Inventory Figure 3.7-5.

These facilities would support public outreach as well as provide training and research opportunities associated with near zero emissions power and carbon capture and storage technologies. Wetlands Within Jacksonville and South Jacksonville, there are few wetlands, as these areas are heavily developed. The primary locations within each city that have wetlands occur around Mauvaise Terre Lake. Wetland areas around Mauvaise Terre Lake consist of the following wetland types: bottomland forest, scrub-shrub, shallow marsh/wet meadow, deep marsh, and lacustrine deepwater lakes (see Section 3.7.1.1). One other concentrated area of wetlands occurs in northern Jacksonville, near Mauvaise Terre Creek. This area contains the following wetland types: bottomland forest, shallow marsh/wet meadow, deep marsh, and open water (see Section 3.7.1.1). Most of the land area in the immediate vicinity of Jacksonville consists of agricultural land with few wetlands. The majority of wetlands outside of Jacksonville consist of farm ponds or wetlands adjacentto surface waters (USEPA 2011l). Floodplains Floodplains in the Jacksonville area consist primarily of 100-and 500-year floodplains associated with Mauvaise Terre Creek and associated branches and tributaries. Mauvaise Terre Creek runs roughly along the northern and eastern boundaries ofJacksonville and the eastern boundary of South Jacksonville. Town Brook runs in an east-west direction across Jacksonville, roughly paralleling Hoagland Boulevard. Town Brook, a tributary to Mauvaise Terre Creek, is bounded by narrow, mapped 100-and 500-year floodplains. Town Brook and its associated floodplains extend across the mid to southern portion of Jacksonville. The 500-year floodplains in the area generally extend in narrow bands along the boundaries of the 100-year floodplains (USEPA 2011l). South of the town of South Jacksonville, mostly along the south side of US-72, 100-year floodplains occuralongBigSandyCreek, associated branchesand tributaries,and Lake Jacksonville (USEPA 2011l). 3.7.3 Impacts of Proposed Action 3.7.3.1 Construction Impacts Meredosia Energy Center Wetlands Stormwater runoff not exposed to industrial pollutants would be directed to an existing stormwater detention area. The location of the existing stormwater detention area is south of two small, delineated wetland areas (see Figure 3.7-1 and Appendix D, Wetlands Surveys [D1]) at the energy center and is depicted on Figure 2-13. This detention area would store noncontact, non-industrial stormwater runoff (i.e., stormwater runoff not exposed to industrial pollutants). The collected water would naturally evaporate and infiltrate into the groundwater system. The detentionarea currently exists and would not be significantly altered as part of the proposed project. As a result, no direct impacts are expected and no permitting associated with the nearby small jurisdictional wetlands would be required. Runoff would be conveyed using surface drainage; however, it is likely that some newly constructed stormwater inlets and underground storm sewers would be required. Minor indirect impacts of sedimentation could occur as a result of any construction activities associated with the installation of any new stormwater conveyances; however, these impacts would be short term and minimized through the implementation of the SWPPP required for NPDES permitting, which would include BMPs to control eroded sediments. Stormwater runoff exposed to coal storage (including coal pile runoff, coal handling dust suppression water, coal handling equipment wash-down water, and stormwater from the coal yard) would bediverted to the new coal handling and contact runoff treatment system (see Section 2.4.2.2). No project components are proposed within or immediately adjacent to the onsite wetlands. The majority of construction would occur in areas that are currently developed or have historically been disturbed. In addition, no other NWI wetlands have been mapped within the boundaries of the FutureGen 2.0 impact areas as identified in Figure 3.7-1. No other wetlands were observed within, or immediately adjacent to, these impact areas during the field investigation conducted from May 23 to 27, 2011. As such, direct and indirect effects to wetlands at the Meredosia Energy Center would be minor, and would be avoided through sensitive project siting and design. Floodplains As shown on Figure 3.7-2, portions of the Meredosia Energy Center property and potentially affected offsite properties are located within mapped 100-year and 500-year floodplains associated with the Illinois River. As described in Section 2.4.3, portions of the Meredosia Energy Center and nearby offsite areas are proposed foreither permanent, temporary, or barge construction impactsas follows: • Proposed permanent impact areas include the areas that would contain the oxy-combustion facilityand associatedfeatures (e.g.,pavedareas) as shown in Figure 2-14 and Figure 2-15. • Proposed temporary and barge impact areas include construction laydown areas or other construction-related work areas. This could also include areas in the Illinois River and along the shoreline where temporary pilings for fill could be installed to support barge unloading during construction. These areas would only be used during the construction period. As shown on Figure 3.7-2, some of these proposed areas are located within mapped 100-year and 500-year floodplains. Based upon original project design, as presented in the Draft EIS, approximately 24 acres of proposed permanent impact areas are located within the 100-year floodplain, while an additional 13.6 acres of proposed temporary or barge impact areas are located in the 100-year floodplain. However, the current design for the energy center would reduce the area of disturbance during construction to approximately 7.6 acres for permanent impact areas and 7.4 acres for temporary impact areas(see Section 2.4.3 for further discussionon estimatedimpact areas). The structures associated with the proposed oxy-combustion facility would be constructed adjacent to the existing Meredosia Energy Center within an area that is outside of mapped floodplains. Thus, the proposed structures would not present obstructionsto flood flows in a mapped floodplain. The existing stormwater detention area intersects the 100-year floodplain. This existing structure would not adversely affect flood flows or the floodplain since it would not interfere with flood flows and would likely provide additional storage. The settling basin for the coal handling and contact runoff treatment system would be constructed in an area outside of any mapped floodplain. As such, neither of these structures would adverselyaffect flood flows or the floodplain. Although no new permanent structures are proposed to be constructed in a mapped floodplain, associated features (e.g., paved areas) would be located within up to 24 acres of a mapped floodplain based upon the original project design as analyzed in the Draft EIS. However, based upon the current project design, only 7.6 acres of permanent impact areas would be located within a mapped floodplain. These permanent impact areas would be developed in a manner that would not obstruct flood flows; however, specific plans have not yet been developed. Development of approximately 10 acres of impervious surfaces in areas that were previously pervious (e.g., grassy areas) would result in increased flow velocity and a reduction in infiltration rates in these areas. Certain beneficial aspects of floodplains, such as groundwater recharge and water quality maintenance, would also be reduced by an increase in impervious cover within the floodplain. However, these effects would be minor in terms of the size of the newly paved areas relative to the remaining unpaved areas. Should project planning ultimately propose additional buildings or structures within mapped 100-year floodplains, the Alliance would construct these buildings in accordance with the IAC and Morgan County Floodplain Ordinance as described in Section 3.7.1.5. As noted above, up to 13.6 acres of proposed temporary or barge impact areas are located in the 100-year floodplain (based upon the original configuration presented inthe Draft EIS; current project design would reduce these impact areas to 7.4 acres). The temporary presence of construction equipment and materials in these areas could cause a minor temporary direct impact. Impacts would not endanger human health or property or conflict with any state, local, or federal floodplain ordinances, as equipment would representrelativelysmall obstructions comparedtotheoverall area oftheIllinoisRiver floodplain. IDNR, Office of Water Resources, requires permits for various construction activities that occur in floodplains or floodways, under the Rivers, Lakes, and Streams Act. Depending on the types and locations of proposed construction activities, the Alliance may be required to obtain either a Statewide Permit #6 (Minor, Non-Obstructive Floodway Construction Activities), Statewide Permit #8 (Underground Pipeline and Utility Crossings), or Statewide Permit #13 (Temporary Construction Activities)from IDNR prior to any construction activities. Emplacement and use of the proposed temporary barge unloading facility during construction would result in only negligible floodplain impacts. Two options have been evaluated for barge unloading operations that would involve some level of disturbance to the river bottom, as detailed in Section 2.4.3.2. Under the first option, the placement of three to five dolphins would add 54 to 89 cubic yards of fill to the 100-year floodplain and reduce the 100-year flood area by 553 to 922 square feet. In comparison, IDOT determined that the proposed Illinois Route 104 bridge project, which would require 18,800 cubic yards of fill in the Illinois River, would cause a less than 0.005-inch increase in flood height and a minimal increase in floodplain limits (IDOT 2011). Thus, placement of the dolphins would cause a negligible increase in flood hazards and would not exceed any regulatory standards. Under the second option, the placement of any rip-rap on the riverbed (assumed to be 1-foot thick over an area of 200 feet by 50 feet) would add 370 cubic yards of material (2percent of the new bridge volume [IDOT 2011]) and decrease the flow area by 50 square feet (0.1 percent of the existing flow area). This reduction would also cause a negligible increase in flood hazards and would not exceed any regulatory standards. If either of these options were carried forward, hydrologic modeling would likely be required to support required permitting of such activities and to ensure thatno unacceptable impacts would occur to the floodway. Development of the temporary barge unloading facility under either of these options would require a permit from IDNR for construction in a floodway, under IAC 17, Chapter I, Subchapter H, Part 3700. For a large waterbody such as the Illinois River, flash floodingis typically not a concern based upon the large volume of the streambed. However, large precipitation events or rapid snowmelt upstream within the watershed can result in significant riverine flooding. These types of flood events can typically be predicted hours to days ahead of time, based upon water levels within the river and known flood stage thresholds. The National Weather Service is the primary agency responsible for issuing flood advisories, watches, and warnings; such notices are often issued when flood conditions are anticipated within 48 to 72 hours or less. To avoid impacts from foreseeable flood events, the construction contractor would monitor official statements issuedbythe National Weather Service regarding flood potential in the project area. If such conditions are anticipated, the contractor would, to the extent possible, cease operations and move all equipment out of the floodplain prior to any flood occurrences. The Alliance is also evaluating options for unloading equipment from barges that would avoid potential impacts by using a combination of on-shore equipment, tugs, and temporary ramps, so that there would be no disturbance to the bank or bottom of the Illinois River. Under this scenario, a portion of the temporary ramp may extend into the river to form a usable platform between the edge of the barge and the existing public boat ramps. This temporary ramp might extend 20 feet from the shoreline, although it has not yet been defined. River currents at the boat ramp area are usually mild, and there would be no need for filling, dredging, or modifications to the shoreline. Heavy equipment or haul trucks parked above the boat ramp area would potentially be used as temporary mooring devices for the barges. However, these plans are still under development and are being reviewed for their feasibility. Because the Alliance has not thoroughly determined the feasibility of this alternative scenario or developeda preliminary design, the Final EISconsiders the impacts presented in the Draft EIS as representing appropriate, upper bounds for the barge unloading operations during construction of the oxy-combustion facility. CO2 Pipeline Within the 4-mile wide pipeline corridor to the CO2 storage study area, DOE analyzed two alternative routes: the southern route and the northern route (see Figure 2-18). After the Draft EIS was published, the Alliance identified a proposed location for the injection well site (see Section 2.5.2.3) and additional routing for the southern pipeline (the Alliance’s proposed route) so that it terminates at the proposed injection well site (see Section 2.5.1.1). The Alliance has not defined any additional routing for the northern route to the proposed injection well site, because the route is no longer under consideration. In order to facilitate a representative comparison of wetlands and floodplains impacts for the two routes, the assessment of the southern route has been updated to include the final pipeline routing to the proposed injection well site. The assessment of the northern route has been updated to include potential impacts as determined through an analysis of hypothetical routing scenarios, as further described in Section 3.0. DOE used these hypothetical siting scenarios to evaluate a range of potential impacts, whereby some hypothetical routes would have less impact to physical resources and others wouldhave greater impacts,whilestill representing reasonable routes. Wetlands As discussed in the Draft EIS, no NWI-mapped wetlands exist within the construction ROW for the southern route, and only approximately 0.2 acre of open water wetland is mapped within the construction ROW for the northern route (including hypothetical end-of-pipeline routes). However, it is noted that additional, non-NWI-mapped wetlands may be present within the construction ROWs, since the absence of NWI-mapped wetlands does not conclusively indicate the absence of wetlands. In order to further confirm the presence and extent of wetlands, the Alliance conducted a formal wetland delineation of the southern pipeline route (proposed option) in spring 2013 (after the Draft EIS was published) in accordance with USACE delineation methodology. Based on the delineation, 14 wetland areas, ranging in size from about 0.02 to 0.1 acre for a total of approximately 0.5 acre of wetland, were identified within the ROW for the southern pipeline. The wetland survey also indicated that the southern route would cross 2 perennial streams, 13 intermittent streams (as classified by the USGS), and many ephemeral streams, swales, and ditches; see Section 3.6, Surface Water. The Alliance is coordinating with USACE for a determination with respect to wetlands that are considered waters of the U.S. and to identify permitting requirements. The Alliance intends to avoid wetlands by using the trenchless technologies described in Chapter 2 in order to meet the requirement of Nationwide Permit No. 12 (Utility Line Activities) that “the activity does not result in the loss of greater than 0.5 acre of waters of the United States.” The Alliance plans to trench through only 0.03 acre of wetland, as authorized by the USACE (which is not anticipated to consider the feature jurisdictional), in an area that is currently actively-cultivated agricultural land and which is expected to return to the same use after installation of the pipeline. Table 3.7-5 summarizes the amounts of wetland present within the construction ROW of each pipeline route option, and includes both wetlands mapped by NWI and wetlands identified by the Alliance as describedabove. The wetlandacreage presentedfor the southernpipeline route is based upon the delineation conducted by the Alliance; the acreage presented for the northern route is based solely on NWI mapping data. As stated earlier, the actual number, type, and extent of wetland areas within the southern pipeline corridor must ultimately be verified by the USACE prior to construction; therefore, the acreages of wetlands present and amount of impact may change slightly. A formal wetland delineation has not been conducted for the northern pipeline route, since it is no longer under consideration by the Alliance. If any significant changes occur to the final southern route and/or if another pipeline route is selected, the Alliance would conduct a formal wetland delineation of the final CO2 pipeline route prior to construction. The final wetland determination willalso be used as partof a Nationwide Permit No. 12 applicationfor the project. The Alliance sited the proposed southern pipeline route to minimize crossings of waterways (e.g., larger streams, rivers, ponds, and lakes) and wetlands. However, where water and wetland crossings are unavoidable for either route, the Alliance committed to using trenchless technologies, such as horizontal directional drilling or jack and bore tunneling, to lay pipe beneath wetlands and surface waterbodies. Traditional trenching activities may still be used during pipeline installation across seasonally dry ephemeralorintermittentstreams that are devoidof waterat the time ofconstruction. Table 3.7-5.

CO2 = carbon dioxide; NWI = National Wetland Inventory; ROW = right-of-way Horizontal directional drilling would be used for major waterbody crossings (i.e., waterbodies more than 100 feet wide). The minimum depth of cover for waterbodies requiring horizontal directional drilling would be at least 4 feet as required under 49 CFR 195.248(a). Jack and bore tunneling would be used for smaller surface water features and wetland areas. Additional trenchless technologies may be required due to environmental, land, or constructability requirements. Geotechnical investigations would be performed at proposed horizontal directional drilling locations, and contingency plans would be developed, as required, for completing waterbody crossings in the event of an unsuccessful horizontal directional drilling. By implementing trenchless construction techniques, impacts to waterbodies (such as the 0.2-acre open water area identified in Table 3-7.5) would be avoided and the waterways’ beds and banks would not be disturbed. See Section 3.6, Surface Water, for further discussion of impacts to these surface waterfeatures. The Alliance intends to avoid wetlandfeatures (including open water wetlands) during construction by employing the various trenchless technologies for the pipeline installation, as described earlier. Based on the results of the wetland delineation described above, the Alliance indicated a projected total of 13 major pipeline crossing locations involving wetlands and/or surface waterbodies in the currently proposed southern route, some of which involve two or more co-located features, which would require horizontal direction drilling and/or jack and bore tunneling. The exact number, type, and length of crossingswould ultimately depend on thefinal pipelineroute. Through the implementation of trenchless technologies, the only wetland areas that could be directly impacted by conventional pipeline constructionwould be wetland areas encounteredwithin or immediately adjacent to agricultural lands, as is the case for the 0.03 acre of potential wetland impacts for the southern route discussed earlier. However, these types of wetland areas are not expected to be considered jurisdictional by the USACE. Many wetland features in agricultural fields are not considered jurisdictional, because they typically lack the presence of sufficient hydrophytic vegetation due to the existence and maintenance of agricultural crops at these locations. To meet the criteria for a regulated (jurisdictional) wetland as defined by the USACE, a feature must possess each of the characteristics (hydric soils, hydrophytic vegetation, and hydrology) of the USACE’s three-parameter approach to wetland identification. Additionally, it is also probable that wetlands within a large farm field would be hydrologically isolated from waters of the U.S., which would also likely exclude them from regulation under the CWA. However, the USACE would have ultimate discretion over which wetland areas are considered regulated or not. A formal delineation would be conducted in the final pipeline route, and would be submitted to the USACE for Jurisdictional Determination, prior to construction. Following any trenching and pipeline installation activities in agricultural wetlands, excavated wetland soils would be backfilled into the trenches so that the deepest soils excavated are returned as the deepest soils backfilled. This method of wetland soil backfilling would help maintain pre-construction wetland soil characteristics. These areas could then be returned to agricultural use consistent with pre-existing conditions. The only regulated waters of the U.S. that could be directly impacted by pipeline construction would be dry ephemeral and intermittent streambeds. The majority of pipeline construction impacts to these features would be temporary and minor, consisting of short-term disturbances during pipeline construction. For crossings of dry streambeds, the pipeline construction ROWs would be cleared of any woody vegetation and the ground surface disturbed, primarily by the movement of equipment, digging of trenches, and stockpiling of excavated soils. After pipeline installation has been completed across a dry streambed, the ground surface would be restored and regraded to pre-construction contours, including restoration of the streambed and banks, so that there would be no permanent impact to, or loss of, jurisdictionalephemeral or intermittentstreams. In the event that the Alliance finds it necessary for the pipeline route to deviate from either the proposed southern route or the northern pipeline route, it is expected that impacts would be consistent with those addressed in this section, since the same siting criteria would be followed. In the event that the final pipeline routing results in additional impacts to wetlands, or if the pre-construction wetland delineation of the final CO2 pipeline route identifies potential jurisdictional wetlands, trenchless construction methods would be used to avoid impacts to these areas; therefore, no direct impacts would be anticipated. Trenching would only be used within jurisdictional features if additional dry intermittent or ephemeral streams are encountered. In such cases, impacts wouldbe similarto those describedabove. Potential indirect impacts to wetlands from construction would be consistent with those presented earlier inthissection. As previously indicated, it is assumed that construction of the CO2 pipeline would be authorized under a Nationwide Permit 12 (Utility Line Activities) issued by the USACE. A Nationwide Permit 12 authorizes the construction, maintenance, or repair of utility lines, including outfall and intake structures, and the associated excavation, backfill, or bedding for the utility lines, in all waters of the U.S., provided there is no change in pre-construction contours. Wetland mitigation is often required by USACE to allow activities to be performed in waters of the U.S. as part of the permitting process. Wetland mitigation offsets the loss of the benefits and functions of wetlands by providing an equivalent increase in benefits and functions in another area. There are five types of wetland mitigation: creation, restoration, enhancement, preservation, and the purchase of wetland mitigation credits from a wetland mitigation bank. If wetlandmitigationisrequired, the magnitude and form of mitigation would be determined during the permitting process by USACE. Wetland mitigation would follow the USACE Rock Island District Compensatory Mitigation Policy for Illinois and would be determined through coordination with the USACE Rock Island District and St. Louis District, asneeded and applicable. Floodplains Table 3.7-6 identifies the areas of mapped floodplains within the construction ROWs for the each of the proposed routesto the CO2 storage studyarea. Construction of the proposed pipeline would result in minor direct temporary impacts to 100-year and 500-year floodplains. At any crossing of a perennial stream or waterbody (e.g., larger streams, rivers, ponds, and lakes), the Alliance would use trenchless technologies to construct the pipeline beneath the waterway and any associated floodplain, thereby avoiding impacts. For the largest crossings, such as beneath the Coon Creek Dike, soil boring may be required prior to horizontal directional drilling to characterize the underlying soils. These borings would likely be narrow-diameter, direct-push boreholes that would create negligible disturbance to adjacent waterbodies or floodplains. All boreholes would be properly closed in accordance with state regulations and restored to original grade. In areas where trenching occurs in floodplains, trenching would not be expected to increase flood hazards in the area or reduce the beneficial values of the floodplains. The installation of the pipeline through floodways would likely be covered under Statewide Permit No. 8 (Authorizing the Construction of Underground Pipeline and Utility Crossings), which authorizes the constructionof pipelines beneathrivers, lakes, andstreams. Table 3.7-6. Floodplains within the Proposed Construction Right-of-Way for CO2 Pipeline Routes Source: FEMA2011 a. ConstructionROWwouldbe80feetwide. b. The portion of the northern route within the storage study area is analyzed using a range of reasonable hypothetical end-of-pipeline routes as presentedin the DraftEIS (see Section3.0for further discussion). This table presents the most conservative acreagesfrom that analysis. c. Includes 0.9 acre of floodplains located within additional easement areas outside of the primary construction ROW that would be required to facilitate construction equipment and activitiesatareasof trenchless drilling or boring. CO2 = carbon dioxide; ROW = right-of-way The temporary presence of construction equipment and soil piles in floodplains, however, could cause a minor temporary direct impact. By placing construction materials withinthe floodplain, flood flows could be impeded if a flooding event occurred during construction. It is not expected that this impact would reach a level of endangering human health or property or conflict with any state, local, or federal floodplain ordinances. Equipment and soil piles would be contained within the construction ROW and would represent relatively small obstructions for a short duration. As described earlier in this chapter, in order to avoid impacts from foreseeable flood events, the construction contractor would monitor official statements issued by the National Weather Service regarding flood potential in the project area. If such conditions are anticipated, the contractor would, to the extent possible, cease operations and move all equipment out of the floodplain priortoanyfloodoccurrences. Following installation of the pipeline, excavated soils would be backfilled and all disturbed land areas would be returned to their original grade, to the extent practicable. Exposed soil areas would be reseeded withnative vegetation. Although the pipeline itself would be buried, aboveground features would include meter stations and the launcher and receivers (start and end of the pipeline). Other aboveground features of the pipeline system would include: • Pipelinemarkers atall crossings; • Mainline blockvalve shelters; • Cathodic protectionstationmarkers; and • Temporaryzinc anode site markers. As stated in Chapter 2, mainline block valves would be placed along the pipeline to isolate and contain any line leak. The Alliance’s current conceptual design assumes that there would be one mainline block valve at the beginning of the pipeline (at the Meredosia Energy Center), one at the end of the pipeline (at the injection well site), and two in between (i.e., 10 miles apart along the approximately 30-mile pipeline). While the exact number and location of the mainline block valves will be determined after additional hydraulic analysis, the Alliance committed to a maximum distance of 10 miles between mainline block valves; therefore, the impact analysis in the Final EIS addresses the 10-mile maximum spacing. The Alliance indicated that the mainline block valves would be located on high ground outside of floodplains to the extent possible. The Alliance also indicated that the mainline block valves would be placed adjacent to existingroadways to the extent possible, to facilitate accessibilityand avoidthe needto construct access roads. Final placement of each mainline block valve and the need for access roads, if any, will not be determined until final design and siting are complete. Any aboveground features associated with the proposed pipeline would be small and widely-spaced along the operational ROW. If any aboveground features would be constructed in a floodplain, they would be constructed in accordance with the IAC and Morgan County Floodplain Ordinance as described in Section 3.7.1.5. This would minimize the potential for these structures to impede flood flows or reduce the beneficial value of these floodplains. Overall, minor impacts would be expected if structures are ultimately built within 100-year floodplains. The IDNR, Office of Water Resources, requires permits for various construction activities that occur in floodplains or floodways, under the Rivers, Lakes, and Streams Act. Depending on the types and locations of proposed construction activities, the Alliance may be required to obtain either a Statewide Permit #6 (Minor, Non-Obstructive Floodway Construction Activities), Statewide Permit #8 (Underground Pipeline and Utility Crossings), or Statewide Permit #13 (Temporary Construction Activities)fromIDNRprior toanyconstruction activities. For both the southern route and northern route, the CO2 pipeline would cross underneath the portion of Coon Run that has been diked with a flood control levee. Prior to construction, the Alliance would obtain permission from the USACE for this crossing. To obtain permission for the crossing, the Alliance would provide a construction plan, site layout plan, project schedule, communication plan, safety procedures, emergency procedures, company experience record, contingency plan, and drilling fluid management plan to the USACE. The dike and the creek would be crossed usinghorizontal directional drilling and no direct impacts to the waterway would occur. However, it is important to ensure that construction beneath the dike does not adversely impact the stability of the dike. If the integrity of the dike were undermined, it could create a substantial flood hazard to the surrounding area. Should the Alliance receive USACE approval demonstrating adequate planning and design measures, negligible to minor impacts on flood hazards would be expected. In the event that the Alliance finds it necessary for the pipeline route to deviate from either the southern or northern pipeline routes, it is expected that impacts would be consistent with those addressed in this section, since the same sitingcriteria would be followed. In the event thatthe final pipeline routing results in additional impacts to floodplains, such impacts would be similar to those addressed above since any aboveground features associated with the proposed pipeline would be small and widely-spaced along the operational ROW. This section analyzed the impacts of the southern and northern pipeline routes, which end at the western border of the CO2 storage study area. The route that the pipeline would take across the CO2 storage study area depends upon the final siting of the CO2 injection wells. Impacts related to these end-of-pipeline routes (spurs)tothe injection wells are addressed inthe next section,CO2 Storage Study Area. CO2 Storage Study Area In the Draft EIS, DOE analyzed a dual-site injection well scenario, which would involve two injection well sites with one vertical injection well at each site. During the preparation of the Draft EIS, the Alliance modified its injection well design. The Alliance now proposes a single-site injection well scenario, which consists of one injection well site containing four horizontal injection wellslocatedwithinonewell pad. Under the single-site scenario currently proposed by the Alliance, only one building would be required to be constructed at the injection well site. This building, known as the site control and maintenance building, would house the well annulus maintenance and monitoring system equipment. Other features of the surface facilities would include meters, surface piping, and piping-related equipment such as pig launchers. The conceptual layout for the injection well site includes a gravel well pad, the site control and maintenance building, and a parking lot connected to Beilschmidt Road by two access roads. Refer to Figure 2-20 for the proposed location of the single-site scenario injectionwells andsurface facilities. The updated design for the single-site scenario would affect up to 15 acres for construction of the injection wells and associated facilities, and up to 4 acres for the access roads. An additional 24 acres would be affected during staging and construction of the monitoring well network, which would include monitoring wells located within the plume radius (see Figure 2-26). For the dual-site scenario analyzed in the Draft EIS which is no longer being considered by the Alliance, construction activities would affect up to 28 acres for the injection and monitoring wells and associatedfacilities; and up to 64 acres for staging and construction of access roads. Wetlands Table 3.7-3 and Figure 3.7-5 identify the types, locations, and extents of NWI-mapped wetlands within the CO2 storage study area. For a more-detailed view of NWI wetlands, types, and locations, also refer to Figure C-6 in Appendix C, Map Views of Pipeline. Approximately 67.5 acres of wetlands are located within the 6,800-acre CO2 storage study area, representing less than 1 percent of this area. The majority of these wetlands are located immediately along Indian Creek on the north side of the study area, as well as along portions of Indian Creek’slargest tributaries. Following the siting criteria detailed in Section 2.5.2.1, the Alliance would avoid regulated wetlands and waters of the U.S. during the formal design process of these proposed project components. Given the large area available within the study area compared to the relatively small size of proposed components, avoidance is feasible. Since no direct impact would occur to wetlands or waters of the U.S., no USACE wetland permitting would be required. While wetlands and waters of the U.S. would be avoided, it is possible that land-disturbing activities could occur near wetland areas. This could result in minor short-term indirect impacts of increased sedimentation to these features. Neither the USACE nor the state of Illinois regulates wetland buffer areas (i.e., those areas immediatelyadjacent to wetlands). Such indirect effects would be minimized through the implementation of a SWPPP required for NPDES permitting, which would include BMPs to control eroded sediments(e.g., useof filter fencing).  The currently proposed location for the siting of the injection wells under the single-site scenario (the Alliance’s proposed option) is depicted in Figure 2-20. The Alliance indicated that the intermittent stream (an unnamed tributary to Indian Creek) and adjacent wooded area in the southwest corner of the proposed impact area would not be disturbed during construction and operation; therefore, no direct impacts to wetlands or waters of the U.S. would occur under this option. However, a final decision aboutthelocationof the injectionwells has not yet been made. Floodplains There are approximately 238 acres of FEMA-mapped 100-year floodplains within the CO2 storage study area as identified in Table 3.7-4 and Figure 3.7-5. The majority of these floodplains are locatedalongand immediatelyadjacentto Indian Creekinthe northern portion ofthe studyarea. Following the siting criteria detailed in Section 2.5.2.1, the Alliance would avoid mapped floodplains during the formal design process of these proposed project components. The criteria stipulate that the entire proposed injection well site(s) must be above the floodplain to ensure low potential for flood damage to the well infrastructure. Given the large area available within the study area compared to the relatively small size and footprint of the proposed components, avoidance is feasible. Therefore, no impacts to floodplains would occur. The unnamed tributary to Indian Creek, located at the proposed injection well site (Figure 2-20) does not have any FEMA-mapped floodplains associated with it; therefore, no floodplain impacts would occur under this option. However, a final decision about the location of the injection wells has not yet beenmade. Educational Facilities As discussed in Section 2.5.3, the specific locations of the educational facilities are currently unknown, but would be located in the Jacksonville area. This proposed component would require approximately 3.5 acres of land and could involve new construction, rehabilitation of existing structures, or a combination of both types of construction activities. If development of the educational facilities involves new construction, it would most likely occur on previously disturbed land with existing utility connections. As such, it is unlikely that wetlands or floodplains would be present or affected. In the event that the educational facilities would require new construction, a wetland delineation and an analysis of floodplains on the proposed site would be conducted prior to construction. Since the location of the educational facilities is flexible within Jacksonville, it is anticipated that wetlandsand floodplains would be avoided. As described in Sections 2.5.3 and 3.0, since the release of the Draft EIS, discussions between the Alliance and Jacksonville civic authorities have focused on a potential site in Jacksonville for the educational facilities. Because the locations of the educational facilities currently remain unknown, DOE cannot address corresponding impacts to wetlands or floodplains, if any, at this time related to the siting of the educationalfacilities. 3.7.3.2 Operational Impacts Meredosia Energy Center This section discusses potential effects to wetlands and floodplains that would occur during operation of the proposed project atandin the vicinityof the Meredosia EnergyCenter. Wetlands Operation of the proposed oxy-combustion facility would not require the placement of fill material in or other disturbances to onsite wetland areas. Therefore, no effects to wetlands would be expected. Potential stormwater flows through onsite wetlands have been addressed in Section 3.7.3.1. These effects would be minor and could be beneficialto onsite wetlands. During operation and on lands it controls, the Alliance would permanently preserve onsite, delineated wetland areas with fencing and signage so that these areas are not inadvertently disturbed, mowed, or clearedof vegetation. Floodplains Operation of the oxy-combustion facility would not result in any additional floodplain effects beyond those discussed in Section 3.7.3.1. Therefore, no additional effects to floodplains would be expected. Over the operational life of the proposed project, the stormwater detention area could result in a slight reduction of potential flood hazards, as the basin’s purpose would be to infiltrate onsite stormwater and reduce surface water runoffenteringthe river. This impact would be considered positive orbeneficial. CO2 Pipeline Wetlands Over the operational life of the proposed project, impacts to wetlands would be minimal. Minimal wetland impacts would result from maintenance activities, such as mowing, in close proximity to wetland areas. No mowing would be performed in wetland areas that occur within the operational ROW for the pipeline. Table 3.7-7 identifies wetlands that are located within the operational ROWs associated with the southern and northern CO2 pipeline routes. The wetland acreage presented for the southern pipeline route is based upon the delineation conducted by the Alliance; the acreage presented for the northern route is based solely on NWI mapping. Table 3.7-7. Wetlands within the Operational Right-of-Way for CO2 Pipeline Routes Source: USFWS 2012a a. Operational ROW would be 50feetwide. b. Includes both NWI-mapped wetlands and wetlands identified during delineation of the southern route conducted by the Alliance in spring 2013.

This table presents the most conservative acreages fromthat analysis for each resource. e. Only includes ‘open water’ wetlandtype identified by NWI mapping. CO2 = carbon dioxide; NWI = National Wetland Inventory; ROW = right-of-way In the event that the Alliance finds it necessary for the pipeline route to deviate from its proposed southern pipeline route, it is expected that impacts would be consistent with those addressed in this section,since the same sitingcriteria wouldbe followed.  However, the Alliance also indicated that trenching may occur in any wetland area(s) encountered within agricultural lands within the ROW. Although the presence and extent of such areas are anticipated to be minimal and are not expected to be considered jurisdictional, these areas would be re-contoured to their pre-construction states after construction activities were completed, and subsequently replanted with preexisting crops. Therefore, wetlands affected during construction would continue to exist as functioning wetlands during the operational life of the proposed project (i.e., they would not be filled). The Alliance indicated that maintenance activities within the operational ROW, such as mowing, would not be conducted in wetland areas. Therefore, no operationalimpacts would occur. Based on current NWI mapping, the results of the wetland delineation conducted by the Alliance, and the proposed trenchless construction techniques to be utilized, 0.5 acre of wetlands would be avoided along the proposed southern pipeline route, and approximately 0.2 acre of open water would be avoided via horizontal directional drilling along the northern pipeline route. As stated earlier, the Alliance indicated that maintenance activities within the operational ROW, such as mowing, would not be conducted in wetland areas. Therefore, no operationalimpacts would occur. Though not anticipated, if any wetlands are impacted by the final pipeline route, wetland mitigation may be required. Wetland mitigation is often required by USACE to allow activities to be performed in waters of the U.S. as part of the permitting process. Wetland mitigation offsets the loss of the benefits and functions of wetlands by providing an equivalent increase in benefits and functions in another area. There are five types of wetland mitigation: creation, restoration, enhancement, preservation, and the purchase of wetland mitigation credits from a wetland mitigation bank. If wetland mitigation is required, the magnitude and form of mitigation would be determined during the permitting process by USACE. Wetland mitigation would follow the USACE Rock Island District Compensatory Mitigation Policy for Illinois and would be determined through coordination with the USACE Rock Island District and St. Louis District, as needed and applicable. In the event that a pipeline in a wetland required maintenance that necessitated excavation to expose the pipe, wetland impacts would be minor and the same as those described for construction (see Section 3.7.3.1). Floodplains Over the operational life of the proposed project, impacts to floodplains would be negligible within the 50-foot wide operational ROW. Table 3.7-8 identifies floodplains that are located within the operational ROWs associated with thesouthern and northern routes. Table 3.7-8. Floodplains within the Operational Right-of-Way for CO2 Pipeline Routes a. OperationalROWwouldbe50feet wide. b. The portion of the northern route within the storage study area is analyzed using a range of reasonable hypothetical end-of-pipeline routes as presentedin the DraftEIS (see Section3.0for further discussion). This table presents the most conservative acreagesfrom that analysisfor eachresource. CO2 = carbon dioxide; ROW = right-of-way Following construction, floodplain areas disturbed during pipeline installation would be restored to their original grades to the extent practicable. As identified in Section 3.7.3.1, if any aboveground features would be constructed in a floodplain, they would be constructed in accordance with the IAC and Morgan County Floodplain Ordinance as described in Section 3.7.1.5. As such, these features would result in negligiblefloodplain effects over the operational life of the proposed project. CO2 Storage Study Area No additional impacts to wetlands or floodplains, beyond those addressed in Section 3.7.3.1, would be anticipated during the operation ofthe pipelineacrossthe CO2 storage studyarea to the injection wells. Wetlands No additional operational effects to wetlands beyond those discussed in Section 3.7.3.1 would be anticipated. Depending upon final siting of the proposed well site(s), it is possible that the movement of vehicles on access roads and in parking areas in the immediate vicinity could impact adjacent wetlands. This activity would result in minimal amounts of additional sedimentation to wetlands if they occur nearby. Should they occur, these potential indirect impactswould be negligible. Floodplains No additional operational effects to floodplains beyond those discussed in Section 3.7.3.1 would be anticipated. Educational Facilities No additional operational effects to wetlands or floodplains beyond those discussed in Section 3.7.3.1 would beanticipated. 3.7.4 Impacts of the No Action Alternative Under the no action alternative, DOE would not provide cost-shared funding for the FutureGen 2.0 Project. Although the Alliance may still elect to construct and operate the project in the absence of DOE cost-shared funding, for the purposes of the analysis in this EIS, DOE assumed the no action alternative is equivalent to the no-build alternative. Therefore, the project would not be constructed and there would be no change to wetlands or floodplains. INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK 3.8 BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES 3.8.1 Introduction This section describesthebiologicalresources potentially affected by the construction and operation of all components of the proposed FutureGen 2.0 Project. This section also analyzes the potential direct and indirect effects of this project onthese resources. 3.8.1.1 Region of Influence The ROI for biological resources includes the areas within Morgan County potentially affected by the construction and operation of the proposed project. These areas include the Meredosia Energy Center, the CO2 pipeline, the injection wells, and the educational facilities. The ROI defines the extent of the areas where direct effects from construction and operation may be experienced, and it encompasses the areas where indirecteffects fromthe proposed project wouldmost likelyoccur. 3.8.1.2 Method of Analysis and Factors Considered DOE reviewed a number of references to obtain information on the types of terrestrial and aquatic habitats and associated biological resources that could be affected by the proposed project. These included USFWS and state of Illinois lists and databases of protected species and habitats and state of Illinois ecological reports. In addition, DOE made observations of biological resources conditions at the Meredosia Energy Center and its vicinity during site visits in May 2011. DOE used this information to provide a description of the biological resources within the ROI in terms of the species and habitats present. DOE calculated quantitative estimates of potential direct terrestrial habitat loss utilizing GIS and land cover data. DOE made qualitative assessments of the overall direct and indirect effects to biological resources based on each component of the proposed project. DOE assessedthe potentialfor impactsbased on whetherthe proposed project would: • Cause displacement ofterrestrial oraquatic communities orloss of habitat; • Diminish the valueof habitat for wildlife or plants; • Cause adecline in native wildlife populations; • Interfere with the movement of native resident or migratorywildlife species; • Conflict with applicable management plans for terrestrial, avian, and aquatic species and their habitat; • Cause the introductionof noxious orinvasive plant species; • Diminish the value of habitat for fish species (including altering drainage patterns causing displacement offish species orinterferingwithmovement of native residentfishspecies); • Cause adecline in native fish populations; • Affect or displace endangered,threatened, or other special status species; or • Cause encroachment onoraffectdesignatedcritical habitat of a federally-listedspecies. 3.8.1.3 Regulatory Framework Certain species, designated as threatened or endangered, are protected by the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973, under the purview of the USFWS or NOAA Fisheries Service. While both agencies work to protect designated species, NOAA Fisheries Service has jurisdiction over marine resources within the United States’ Exclusive Economic Zone (i.e., water 3 to 200 miles offshore) (NOAA Fisheries Service 2012). Due to the nature and location of the proposed project, no marine offshore species would be affected. Any protected species present within the ROI would fall under the jurisdiction of the USFWS, and for this reason, DOE did not consult withNOAA Fisheries Service regardingthis proposed project. The ESA prohibits the unauthorized “take” (i.e., harassment, harm, pursuit, hunting, shooting, wounding, killing, trapping, capture, collection, or the attempt to engage in any such conduct) of federally-protected species. Section 7 of the ESA requires all federal agencies to ensure that any action authorized, funded, or carried out by them is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a federally-protected species or adverselymodify its Critical habitat is defined by the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as follows: a geographic designated “critical habitat.” Federally-protected species fall area that contains features essential for the underone of two classifications: conservation of a threatened or endangered species that may require special management • Endangered, including species, subspecies, or varieties and protection. These areas are delineated by in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant the USFWS and National Oceanic and portion oftheirrange; and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries Service with appropriate public review and notification in • Threatened, including species, subspecies, or varieties the Federal Register. likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future. In addition, a species can be designated as “proposed” or “candidate.” This means that the species is being considered for protection as either endangered or threatened under the ESA. A proposed endangered or threatened species is one for which a proposed regulation, but not a final rule, has been published in the FR. A candidate species is one being considered for listing as endangered or threatened, but a proposed regulation has not yet been published in the FR. Until a final rule is published, a species designated as either proposed orcandidateis not afforded any legalprotection. To comply with Section 7 of the ESA, DOE sent a consultation letter to the USFWS Marion Illinois Ecological Services Office to request information on federally-listed species and their critical habitats within the ROI and to solicit comments on the proposed project. The USFWS responded with a letter dated August 16, 2011 and provided information about federally-listed species potentially occurring in Morgan, Christian, and Douglas counties that could be affected by the FutureGen 2.0 Project (see Appendix B, Consultation Letters). Both the Allianceand DOE have continued dialogue with the USFWS regarding the proposed projectand itspotential effect on protected species. The Alliance also discussed the project with the IDNR to aid in project siting, determining the potential impacts to state-protected species, and determining the need to perform species-specific surveys. As all discussions between the Alliance and IDNR have been considered informal, Appendix B, Consultation Letters, does not include anyconsultationletters fromthis state agency. Under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act of 1940, both species are afforded certain protections. Should any bald eagle nests be found within the ROI during pre-construction nesting surveys, the Alliance and DOE would adhere to thefollowing guidelines established by the USFWS (USFWS 2010): • Maintain a buffer between proposed construction activities and active bald eagle nests. If the proposed construction includes the emplacement of linear utilities (e.g., the proposed pipeline) and the nest is visible from the site, this buffer should be at least 660 feet wide. This buffer should be at least 330 feet wide if the nest is not visible from the site. If a similar activity is currently ongoing within the preferred buffer distance, the proposed construction may maintain a similarbufferastheexisting, tolerated activity. • Should construction occur within the recommended 660-or 330-foot wide buffer due to the existing presence of a similar activity, all clearing, construction, and landscaping would be limited to outside of the bald eagle nesting season (i.e., such activities should occur betweenearly August and mid-July). • Maintain an establishedlandscape buffer toscreenan active nestfromthe proposed project. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 provides protection to approximately 1,017 migratory bird species. Migratory birds are defined as any bird species that lives, reproduces, or migrates within or across international borders during its annual life cycle. As such, migratory birds are present within the ROI at various periods throughout the year. The act prohibits the taking (i.e., hunting, wounding, killing, possessing, or transporting) of any migratory bird, their eggs, feathers, or nests (USFWS 2012b). The Illinois Endangered Species Protection Act of 1972 provides protection to species that are either in danger of becoming extinct in the state (designated as “endangered”) or are likely to become a state-endangered species (designated as “threatened”) as determined by the Illinois Endangered Species Protection Board. Species designated as threatened or endangered are noted as being on the “Illinois List.” The Illinois Endangered Species Protection Actmakes it unlawfulto: • Possess, take (i.e., harm, hunt, shoot, pursue, lure, wound, kill, destroy, harass, spear, ensnare, trap, capture, collect, or attempt to engage in such conduct), transport, sell, offer for sale, give, or otherwise dispose of any animal, or the product of any animal, species that occurs on the Illinois List; • Deliver, receive, carry, transport, or ship in interstate or foreign commerce and plant species listed as endangered by thefederal government without an appropriate permit; or • Take (i.e., collect, pick, cut, dig up, kill, destroy, bury, crush, or harm in any manner) plants on the Illinois List without the express written permission of the landowner; or sell or offer for sale plants or plant products of endangered species on the Illinois List. 3.8.2 Affected Environment All components of the FutureGen 2.0 Project (i.e., the Meredosia Energy Center, CO2 pipeline corridor, CO2 storage study area, and the educational facilities) occur within the Interior River Valleys and Hills and the Central Corn Belt Plains Level III Ecoregions1 (Woods et al. 2006a; represented respectively by numbers 72 and 54 in Figure 3.8-1). The Interior River Valleys and Hills Level III Ecoregion consists of many wide, flat-bottomed terraced valleys, forested valleyslopes,and dissected glacial till plains. Prior to settlement as a U.S. territory in the 1800s, bottomland forests, prairies, and marshes were common in the alluvial plain and the river channel, while mixed oak and oak-hickory forests occupied the upland areas. Currently, the natural vegetation has largely been replaced by agriculture. Corn (Zea mays) and soybeans (Glycine max)arethe major cropsin thisarea (Woodset al. 2006b; USEPA 2010g). 1 Designed to serve as a spatial framework for research assessment and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components, ecoregions denote areas within which lands and aquatic areas, vegetation communities, and habitats (and the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources) are generally similar. For the purposesofthisEIS, Omernik’s ecoregion classifications are used. This hierarchical system, also used by the USEPA, identifies distinct ecoregions on the basis of “the spatial patterns of both the living and non-living components of the region, such as geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife water quality, and hydrology” (National Atlas of the United States 2012). Phenomena generally used to make these differentiations between ecoregions include geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. Different levels have been developed to describe ecoregions at varying scales. A Roman numeral classification scheme distinguishes between these levels. Level I is the broadest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions; Level II divides the continent into 50 levels; and Level III divides the continent into 85 levels. For most ofthe United States, the ecoregionshave beenfurther subdivided to LevelIV, whichincludeshundredsoflevels. Source: Woods et al. 2006a Figure 3.8-1. Illinois Level III and IV Ecoregions Historically, the Central Corn Belt Plains Level III Ecoregion included extensive prairie communities intermixed with oak-hickory forests; however, European settlers replaced most of the native prairies with agricultural land. Extensive corn and soybean farms now dominate the dark, fertile soils of the Central Corn Belt Plains. Farms in this region also raise cattle, sheep, poultry, and especially hogs. Agricultural activities negatively affect stream chemistry, turbidity, and habitat throughout the area (Woods et al. 2006b). The ROIincludes portions of four different Level IV Ecoregions. Moving fromwest to east,these include the Upper Mississippi Alluvial Plain, River Hills, Western Dissected Illinoian Till Plain, and Illinois/Indiana Prairies (Woods et al. 2006a; see Figure 3.8-1). The presence of multiple Level IV Ecoregions in western and central Morgan County is primarily driven by proximity to the Illinois River, which is a major waterway with a large influence on the surrounding landscape. The following provides a brief description ofeach Level IV Ecoregion: • The Upper Mississippi Alluvial Plain Level IV Ecoregion (Ecoregion 72d in Figure 3.8-1) encompasses the broad floodplains and low river terraces of the Mississippi River and its major tributaries upstream of the Mississippi’s confluence with the Missouri River, including much of the Illinois River. Both the alluvial plain and the river channel have been heavily modified in the last 100 years. Prior to 1800, bottomland forests, prairies, and marshes were common. Agricultural land useshave nowlargelyreplaced the natural vegetation (Woodset al. 2006b). • The River Hills Level IVEcoregion (Ecoregion 72f in Figure 3.8-1) flanks the floodplains ofthe Mississippi, Illinois, and lower Sangamon Rivers in west central Illinoison dissected and forested hills, bluffs,cliffs,andravines. Floodplain forests grow on bottomlands(Woodset al. 2006b). • The Western Dissected Illinoian Till Plain Level IV Ecoregion (Ecoregion 72i in Figure 3.8-1) is a well-dissected till plain with broad, nearly level ridges, and many forested slopes, ravines, and floodplains. In the early 1800s, forests covered well-drained slopes and sites capable of holding moderate amounts of moisture. Prairies were found on nearly level ridges. Marshes and wet prairie also occurred, but were not common. Agricultural land uses have now almost entirely replaced the native prairies. Steep slopes and ravines remain largely wooded, but forested acreage is considerablyless thanitwas atthetime of European settlement (Woodset al. 2006b). • The Illinois/Indiana Prairies Level IV Ecoregion (Ecoregion 54a in Figure 3.8-1) includes flat to rolling plains formed during the Wisconsinan glaciation. Naturally poorly drained, this area supported many ponds and swamps prior to European settlement. Settlers tiled, ditched, and drained the landscape todevelop cropland. As dark, fertile soils characterize this ecoregion, farms flourished. Currently, croplands growing corn and soybeans and pastures supporting cattle, sheep, poultry, and hogs dominate the landscape (Woods et al. 2006b). Specific habitats occurring within the ROI includeterrestrial and aquatic habitats. 3.8.2.1 Terrestrial Habitat Terrestrial habitats include agricultural land (including cropland and pastureland), developed land, forests (including deciduous forest and forested wetlands), and grassland. Agricultural Land Agricultural land is typically managed to support stands of a single plant species and is generally considered low-quality habitat. The lack of vegetative diversity leads to a lack of diversity in the species that inhabit these areas. Typical species encountered in agricultural areas include the following (IDNR 1997; IDNR 2001): • Vegetation: The inherent management of agricultural land precludes the establishment of native vegetation within cultivated areas. Native plants may still exist infence rows, drainage ditches, or isolated forestislands. • Mammals: Mammal species found in such areas are generally limited to raccoon (Procyon lotor), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), coyote (Canis latrans), red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and various rodents. • Amphibians and Reptiles: Some amphibians (i.e., smallmouth salamander [Ambystoma texanum], American toad [Bufo americanus], western chorus frog [Pseudacris triseriata], and bullfrog [Rana catesbeiana]) can be found in agricultural areas if adequate breeding sites (e.g., ditches and flooded fields) are present. In addition, some reptile species, such as common gartersnake (Thamnophis sirtalis),and fox snake (Elaphe vulpina), mayalso be present. • Birds: Agricultural land is generally considered poor-quality habitat for bird species, and such areas are generally utilized by many invasive species, including rock dove (Columba livia) and European starling (Sturnus vulgaris). A few native grassland species utilize agricultural land, including horned lark (Eremophila alpestris) and American crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos). Agricultural lands offer very little in terms of stopover habitat for migratory birds, but during migration and winter, a few species (e.g., American pipit [Anthus rubescens] and snow bunting [Plectrophenax nivalis]) forage over some fields. Developed Land Developed land, including “barren land,” predominates in areas disturbed by human action. The existing landscape, potentially including topography and vegetative communities, has been altered so that it no longer maintains its natural characteristics. Typical species found in developed areas include the following (IDNR 2001): • Vegetation: Plant species found in developed areas are typically those able to withstand human disturbance. These generally include weed species or invasive species, which provide low-quality habitat for animal species. • Mammals: The general low-quality nature of developed areas provides habitat for more common wildlife species that are capable of surviving near human activities and disturbances. Mammal species typically present in developed habitats include white-tailed deer, gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis), and raccoon; common smaller mammal species include house mouse (Mus musculus) and eastern mole (Scalopus aquaticus). Certain bat species (e.g., big brown [Eptesicus fuscus] and little brown [Myotis lucifugus]) often roost in buildings and some can be present in developed habitats, foraging in areas with concentrations of flying insects (e.g., over stormwater drainage ditches). • Amphibians and Reptiles: Relatively few reptile and amphibian species are present in developed landscapes. Amphibians present could include western chorus frog, if adequate breeding sites are located in the area (e.g., ditches or other wet areas), and Fowler’s toad (Bufo fowleri). Reptile species present could include brown snake (Storeria dekayi) or others that can tolerate a widerange of ecological conditions. • Birds: Developed areas typically contain a mix of bird species due to artificial food sources provided by property owners and the overall variety of habitats that birds can exploit (e.g., maintained vegetation and buildings). Native bird species in developed areas include American crow, chipping sparrow (Spizella passerina), chimney swift (Chaetura pelagica), killdeer(Charadrius vociferus), and barn swallow (Hirundo rustica). Forests Forests typically provide diverse habitats for wildlife. Many species require forests to meet survival and breeding requirements. Overall, forests are the most biologically diverse terrestrial habitats in the ROI, particularly floodplain or wetland forests that offer nearby aquatic habitat. Examples of the types of wildlife generally associated with central Illinois forests include the following (IDNR 1997; IDNR 2000; IDNR 2001): • Vegetation: The plant species composition of each forest community is primarily driven by the soil moisture content, often related to relative elevation in the landscape and soil characteristics. Forested areas in the ROI, including deciduous forest and forested wetlands, contain a variety of tree species, such as: eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides), elm (Ulmus spp.), ash (Fraxinus spp.), silver maple (Acer saccharinum), northern catalpa (Catalpa speciosa), red mulberry (Morus rubra), blacklocust(Robinia pseudoacacia), blackoak(Quercus velutina), and sassafrass (Sassafras albidum). The understory, or shrubbery, of the forested areas contains species such as dogwood (Cornus spp.), multiflora rose (Rosa multiflora), and honeysuckle (Lonicera spp.). Herbaceous groundcover within the forested areas consists of species such as Virginia creeper (Parthenocissus quinquefolia), catchweed bedstraw (Galium aparine), giant ragweed (Ambrosia trifida), common pokeweed (Phytolacca americana), poison ivy (Toxicodendron radicans), and greenbrier(Smilax spp.). • Mammals: Mammal species found in the ROI's forests include eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus), southern flying squirrel (Glaucomys volans), woodland vole (Microtus pinetorum), gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), gray squirrel, white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), raccoon, and white-tailed deer. Many bat species forage in forested habitats (e.g., little brown bat) and some roost underloose tree bark or in tree cavities (e.g., hoary bat [Lasiurus cinereus]). • Amphibians and reptiles: Amphibian and reptile species present in forested areas include slimy salamander (Plethodon glutinosus), eastern gray treefrog (Hyla versicolor), spring peeper (Pseudacris crucifer), ground skink (Scincella lateralis), racer (Coluber constrictor), rat snake (Elaphe obsoleta), brown snake, and eastern hognose snake (Heterodon platirhinos). Most amphibians alsorequire aquatic habitats for breeding. • Birds: Overall, forest habitats are very important for migratory birds. For example, large concentrations of migratory birds may gather in forest habitats when bad weather forces them to stop in the area. Migrant bird species potentially encountered in forested areas include American woodcock (Scolopax minor), yellow-billed cuckoo (Coccyzus americanus), ruby-throated hummingbird (Archilochus colubris), great crested flycatcher (Myiarchus crinitus), red-eyed vireo (Vireo olivaceus), brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater), wood thrush (Hylocichla mustelina), blue-gray gnatcatcher (Polioptila caerulea), and Kentucky warbler (Oporornis formosus). Resident bird species typically found in forested areas include blue jay (Cyanocitta cristata), black-capped chickadee (Poecile atricapillus), tufted titmouse (Baeolophus bicolor), Carolina wren (Thryothorus ludovicianus), and northern cardinal(Cardinalis cardinalis). Grasslands Grassland habitats typically consist of warm-season grasses, with tree species providing 10 percent cover or less. The majority of the existing grasslands represent disturbed areas; few remnants of original grassland habitat remain. Disturbance in these areas includes the alternation of the natural fire regime and fragmentation, which leads to increased susceptibility to invasion by exotic species, habitat degradation, and smallisolated populations ofnative species (IDNR 2001). • Vegetation: Grassland/herbaceous (“open”) areas contain numerous species. Grasses consist mainly of Carex and Panicum species. Wildflower species present include false aster (Boltonia asteroides), Ohio spiderwort (Tradescantia ohiensis), violet (Viola spp.), goatsbeard (Tragopogon pratensis), and purple vetch (Vicia americana). Other herbaceous vegetation present in these areas includes species such as chive (Allium schoenoprasum), prickly pear cactus (Opuntia humifusa), common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia), and milkweed (Asclepias spp.). • Mammals: Typical mammal species found in grassland habitats include the prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster), woodland vole (Microtus pinetorum), and meadow jumping mouse (Zapus hudsonius). • Amphibians and reptiles: Amphibian and reptile species that typically inhabit grasslands include the prairie kingsnake (Lampropeltis calligaster), tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum), and gophersnake (Pituophis menanoleucus). • Birds: A number of non-native bird species may utilize grasslands, such as European starling and rock dove. Native species include northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), field sparrow (Spizella pusilla), grasshopper sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum), and northern harrier (Circus cyaneus). 3.8.2.2 Aquatic Habitat Wetlands, defined by the USACE as “those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions” (40 CFR 230), occur within the ROI. Specifically, a wetland delineation performed in 2011 identified two wetlands at the Meredosia Energy Center. Section 3.7, Wetlands and Floodplains, is dedicated to the discussion of wetlands and floodplains and provides additional details and analysis of these aquatic features within the ROI. The Illinois River is the largest surface water feature in the ROI, and lies adjacent to the northwest of the Meredosia Energy Center. The Illinois River begins at the point where the Des Plaines and Kankakee Rivers converge near the Will County and Grundy County lines in Illinois. The Illinois River flows for a distance of 273 miles, ultimately entering the Mississippi River at Grafton, Illinois, approximately 40 miles north of St. Louis, Missouri. TheMeredosia EnergyCenter is located between river miles 70 and 71 (i.e., between 70 and 71 miles from where the Illinois River meets the Mississippi River). The Illinois River isthelargest tributaryto theMississippi River above the mouth oftheMissouri River. Historically, waterways in the Illinois River Basin (or Illinois River watershed) have experienced loss of ecological integrity due to sedimentation of backwaters and side channels; degradation of tributary streams; increased water level fluctuations partially due to the operation of locks and dams; reduction of floodplain and tributary habitat and connectivity; and other adverse impacts caused by human activities. A dramatic loss in productive Illinois River Basin backwaters, side channels, and channel border areas due to excessive sedimentation is limiting ecological health and altering the character of the overall river system. In particular, the Illinois River has lost much of its critical spawning, nursery, and overwintering areas for fish; habitat for waterfowl and aquatic species; and backwater aquatic plant communities, limiting ecological health and altering the floodplain river system (USACE 2007). Section 303(d) of the CWA requires that states identify all waters where required pollution controls are not sufficient to attain or maintain applicable water quality standards and intended water uses, then implement appropriate measures to improve the water quality. As of 2012, the IEPA has identified 10 segments of the Illinois River (i.e., approximately 285 river miles) as impaired under Section 303(d). The USEPA approved each of these 10 impairments. One of these listed segments is the same portion of the IllinoisRiverthat forms the western boundary of Morgan County and isincluded in the ROI. Specifically, this river segment does not meet water quality standards for mercury, PCBs, and fecal coliform, rendering it unsuitable for fish consumption or primary contact recreation (IEPA 2012a). Refer to Section 3.6, Surface Water, for additional information regarding Section 303(d) waterways and the condition of this segment of the Illinois River. Despite this damage and degradation, the ecology of the Illinois River system remains relatively diverse and biologically productive. Fish diversity is relatively high, with 115 fish species present. Ninety-five (95) percent of these fish species are native. Many of these fish species require both riverine and backwaterhabitatsas part of their lifecycle (USACE2007). The most abundant fish species in the Illinois River mainstem in the general vicinity of the Meredosia Energy Center are gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum) and emerald shiner (Notropis atherinoides). Several sport or commercially fished species are present, such as white bass (Morone chrysops), largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), and channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus). In addition, several non-native fish species are present, which have the potential to outcompete native fishes for resources. Examples of such non-native species include silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis), collectively referred to as “Asian carp”, as well as white perch (Morone americana) (Thomas 1999). A survey of mussel species in the Illinois River from 1993 to 1995, identified a total of 23 different species of Unionids (Family), as compared to 49 species present in the early 1900s. The most abundant species were threeridge (Amblema plicata), mapleleaf (Quadrula quadrula), deertoe (Truncilla truncata), fragile papershell (Leptodea fragilis), threehorn wartyback (Obliquaria reflexa), and giant floater (Pyganodon grandis). In addition, two non-native mussels were found between 1993 and 1995: zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) and Asian clam (Corbicula fluminea) (Whitney et al. 1997). Zebra mussel infestations have played a large role in declining native mussel populations. However, these infestationshave subsided considerably since1995 (USACE 2007). Other aquatic macroinvertebrate species of the Illinois River include mayflies (Order Ephemeroptera), fingernail clams (Pisidium spp.), midges (Family Chironomidae), and worms. Fingernail clams are a major food source for larger vertebrates (e.g., diving ducks). Fingernail clams suffered substantial population declines in the Illinois River in the 1950s (USACE 2007). Surface waters in the ROI support a large diversity of aquatic biota. Habitats range in size from small headwater streams to large lakes or reservoirs artificially created through impounding. Fish species may be specific to certain habitat types (e.g., small headwater streams). However, many fish species can be found in a variety of aquatic habitats, particularly fish species common in standing water (e.g., lakes and ponds). Examples of common aquatic species in the ROI (i.e., central Illinois) include the following (IDNR 1997; IDNR 2000; IDNR 2001): • Fish (streams) – creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus), sand shiner (Notropis ludibundus), bluntnose minnow (Pimephales notatus), johnny darter (Etheostoma nigrum), and central stoneroller(Campostoma anomalum); • Fish (rivers) – channel catfish, bullhead minnow (Pimephales vigilax), gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum), smallmouth buffalo (Ictiobus bubalus), and freshwater drum (Aplodinotus grunniens); • Fish (standing water) – largemouth bass, bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), black bullhead (Ameiurus melas), green sunfish (Lepomis cyanellus), and white crappie(Pomoxis annularis); • Mussels – pimpleback (Quadrula pustulosa), plain pocketbook (Lampsilis cardium), fragile papershell, mapleleaf,andwhiteheelsplitter(Lasmigona complanata); • Crustaceans – virile crayfish (Orconectes virilis), Caecidotea intermedia (isopod), and Hyalella azteca (amphipod); and • Other Macroinvertebrates – segmented worms (e.g., Aeolosoma hemprichi), leeches (e.g., Helobdella stagnalis), mayflies (e.g., Acentrella ampla), damselflies (e.g., Hetaerina titia), and snails (e.g., Micromenetus dilatatus). Aquatic habitats offer an important landscape feature for several species of birds – open, permanent water with a near-shore shallow water area (littoral zone). Species such as great blue heron (Ardea herodias), Canada goose (Branta canadensis), mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), and wood duck (Aix sponsa) often nest along forested streams and rivers. Species such as common grackle (Quiscalus quiscula), red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus), and song sparrow (Melospiza melodia) often nest on the shores of lakes and ponds. Species such as barn swallow and belted kingfisher (Ceryle alcyon) often forage over lakes and ponds. Overall, the most important role of lakes, ponds, and impoundments for birds are as resting habitat for migratorywater birds(IDNR 1997; IDNR 2000; IDNR 2001). The Illinois River is a major component of the internationally significant Mississippi River Flyway, a route followed by migratory birds between Canada and the Gulf Coast. The Mississippi River Flyway is utilized by 40 percent of all North American waterfowl and nearly half of all North American bird species (Audubon Society 2012). While not classified as an Audubon Important Bird Area, a survey conducted in the fall of 1994 found that 81 percent of the fall waterfowl migration in the Mississippi River Flyway utilizedtheIllinoisRiver(USACE2007). The USFWS established a refuge in 1973 to provide habitat andprotectiontomigratory birds utilizingthe Mississippi River Flyway, and specificallythe Illinois River. The 3,582-acre Meredosia National Wildlife Refuge is located approximately 2 miles north of the Meredosia Energy Center and, when complete, will provide arange of vital habitats, including seasonal wetlands and permanent marsh (USFWS 2012c). 3.8.2.3 Protected Species Table 3.8-1 provides a summary of the federally-and state-protected species identified as potentially occurring in the ROI. As noted above, DOE determined these species using USFWS and IDNR county distribution lists, and the results of ongoing consultations with these agencies (USFWS 2012d; IDNR 2011). As requested by the IDNR, information regarding the specific locations of state-listed protected speciesis not includedinthisEIS. Four federally-listed species potentially occur in Morgan County: decurrent false aster (Boltonia decurrens), eastern prairie fringed orchid (Platanthera leucophaea), Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis), and sheepnose mussel (Plethobasus cyphyus) (USFWS 2012d). Each of these four federally-listed species receives its protected status from the USFWS based on the effects of habitat conversion. The decurrent false aster naturally inhabits wet prairies along the Illinois and Mississippi rivers, but wetlands in these areas are being drained and modified to serve agricultural purposes (53 FR 45858). The eastern prairie fringed orchid thrives in natural prairie habitat, but much of the species’ native range has been converted for crop fields or grazing, drained, or modified to reduce the risk of fires (54 FR 39857). The Indiana bat typically roosts under the loose bark of dead or dying trees and forage along edges of forested areas. Reasons for the bat's decline include disturbance of colonies by human beings, pesticide use and loss of summer habitat resulting from the clearing of forest cover (72 FR 19015). The sheepnose mussel has suffered a 67 percent decline in occupied rivers as many stretches of large river habitat has been impounded in recent years. Small remaining populations are now isolated from each other, leaving all sheepnose mussels at risk of extinction (USFWS 2012e). However, no critical habitat for these federally-listed species has been identified within Morgan County. Thirteen additional species protected under the Illinois Endangered Species Protection Act, listed by the IllinoisEndangered Species Protection Board and included in the Illinois Natural Heritage Database, have been identified in Morgan County: blue hearts (Buchnera americana), bunchflower (Melanthium virginicum), ebonyshell (Fusconaia ebena), Hall’s bulrush (Schoenoplectus hallii), Illinois chorus frog (Pseudacris streckeri illinoensis), lined snake (Tropidoclonion lineatum), loggerhead shrike (Lanius ludovicianus), ottoe skipper (Hesperia ottoe), pale false foxglove (Agalinis skinneriana), pink milkwort (Polygala incarnata), regal fritillary, starhead topminnow (Fundulus dispar), and upland sandpiper (Bartramia longicauda) (IDNR 2011; see Table 3.8-1). In addition to the species listed above, the state-endangered bent milkvetch (Astragalus distortus) is listed as occurring in some Illinois counties, but not currently within Morgan County. A qualified biologist identified a population of bent milkvetch at the Meredosia Energy Center during a field survey for other species. This population has been flagged, brought to the attention of the IDNR, and included in Table3.8-1. Table 3.8-1.

The project ROI includes the entire 263-acre property. As described in the Draft EIS, the Alliance originally anticipated the need to disturb 164 acres of the property for construction of the proposed oxycombustion facility, including approximately 33 acres of forested area. The Alliance undertook steps to reduce potential impacts onforested areasof the property. Through ongoing refinements in site plans, the Alliance reduced the anticipated area of disturbance to 114 acres total, including up to 9 acres of forested area, as described in this Final EIS. Table 3.8-2, as updated to show changes for the Final EIS, provides a summary of the land cover types in the potential disturbance areas at the Meredosia Energy Center based on recent aerial photographs and data provided by the USDA/NRCS (2001). Land cover types typically indicate the habitat in the area and thus the wildlife or plant communities potentially present. Based on these data, the areas of proposed disturbance at the Meredosia Energy Center are primarily developed land or grasslands. Figure 3.8-2 depicts the land cover types for the areas of anticipated disturbance based on the Alliance’s refinements to site plans for the Final EIS. For comparison, Figure 3.8-3 depicts the land cover types for the areas of anticipated disturbance as presented in the Draft EIS, which as described in Section 2.4.3, servestorepresent the upper boundof potential impacts. Terrestrial Habitats The Meredosia Energy Center and its vicinity are located entirely within the Upper Mississippi Alluvial Plain Level IV Ecoregion (Woods et al. 2006a; see Figure 3.8-1). As described in Section 3.8.2, this Level IV Ecoregion encompasses the broad floodplains and low river terraces of the Mississippi River and its major tributaries above the Mississippi’s confluence with the Missouri River, including much of the Illinois River. The terrestrial habitats of the Meredosia Energy Center and its vicinity consist of developed industrial land for the energy center infrastructure with areas of maintained grasslands and non-contiguous forested “islands” (see Figure 3.8-2). Table 3.8-2. Land Cover Types within Potential Areas of Disturbance at the Meredosia Energy Center Draft EIS Final EIS Land Cover Type (Acres)a (Acres)b Source: USDA/NRCS 2001 a. Represents the most conservative upper bound for impacts, asreflected in Figure 3.8-3. b. Represents the Alliance’s current plansfor impacts, as reflectedin Figure 3.8-2. c. A wetland delineation conducted at the Meredosia Energy Center did not identify any surface water features, including wetlands, within the impact area (see Figure 3.8-2). This delineation encompassed only the Meredosia Energy Center; no delineation has yet been performed along the proposed CO2 pipeline corridor or at the proposed CO2 storage study area. See Section 3.7,Wetlandsand Floodplains, for more information. CO2 = carbon dioxide Aquatic Habitat While no natural aquatic features are present on the 263-acre Meredosia Energy Center property, a man-made bottom ash pond and a man-made fly ash pond exist along the western site boundary. The ponds were associated with energy center operations prior to the suspension of operations in 2011. Due to their man-made and industrial nature, coupled with regular disturbance, these aquatic features provide lowhabitat values. A wetland delineation performed in May 2011 identified two wetlands along the eastern property boundary of the Meredosia Energy Center (see Figure 3.7-1). As discussed in Section 3.7, Wetlands and Floodplains, these two wetlands encompass approximately 0.37 acre and 0.26 acre, respectively, and, though not currently classified, would be described as scrub-shrub or shallow marsh or wet meadow by the IWI. A Jurisdictional Determination conducted by the USACE in August 2011 confirmed the results of this delineation and declared these two wetlands as waters of the U.S., subject to USACE jurisdiction under Section 404 of the CWA. However, these two identified wetlands do not lie within the updated potential impact area at the Meredosia Energy Center and would not be affected by the proposed action. No other wetlands were identified within the potential impact areas at the energy center. Refer to Section 3.7, Wetlands and Floodplains, foradditionalinformationregardingwetlands. In 2002, a mussel survey identified four mussel beds in the Illinois River in the area of the Meredosia Energy Center (IDOT 2011). In addition, the Illinois Natural Areas Inventory identifies five areas in the Illinois River within approximately 2 miles downstream of the Meredosia Energy Center that are classified as Category VI natural areas. Category VI denotes areas of “unusual concentrations of flora or fauna” (IDNR 2009b). Presumably, in this case, this designation identifies mussel beds. It is important to note that the federally-listed sheepnose mussel is extirpated from the Illinois River and the Category VI designationdoes notrelate toprotected species or specificallyhigh-qualityhabitats. Figure 3.8-2. Land Cover at the Meredosia Energy Center in Areas of Disturbance (Final EIS) Figure 3.8-3. Land Cover at the Meredosia Energy Center in Areas of Disturbance (Draft EIS) Protected Species Based on existing habitats and consultation with the USFWS, bald eagle, decurrent false aster, and Indiana bat are the only federally-protected species with the potential to occur at the Meredosia Energy Center. Similar habitat analyses and consultation with the IDNR identified that the bent milkvetch, Illinois chorus frog, regal fritillary, and ebonyshell are the only state-protected species with the potential to occur at the Meredosia Energy Center or within the adjacent segment of the Illinois River (Battelle 2011a; IDOT 2011). Refer to Table 3.8-1 for more information regarding protected species. The list belowsummarizes the federally- and state-listedspecies with the potentialtooccur at the energycenter. • Bald eagle – federally protected. Although no longer protected by the USFWS under the ESA (USFWS 2012d), the bald eagle is still federally protected under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act of 1940 (see Section 3.8.1.3). The bald eagle has been documented perching in trees alongthe Illinois River in the area of the Meredosia EnergyCenter (IDOT 2011; Ong 2012). Bald eagles typically nest in larger trees within 0.5 mile of a body of water with an unobstructed view of the water, primarily in undeveloped areas with little human activity. Bald eagles feed on fish primarily and nest near waterbodies (USFWS 2011b). As such, while no bald eagle nests have yet been observed inthe area, the baldeagle may be present at or near the Meredosia Energy Center. • Bent milkvetch – state endangered. The IDNR identifies bent milkvetch as a state-endangered plant species protected by the Illinois Endangered Species Protection Act. This species has been observed on the grounds of the Meredosia Energy Center site in a survey conducted by the Alliance. The areas containing the observed plants have been flagged and reported to Ameren; no additional bent milkvetch populations have currently been identified within the ROI (see Appendix E, Biological Surveys [E2]). • Decurrent false aster – federally threatened and state threatened. Decurrent false asters may be present to the west of the Meredosia Energy Center site in an area that is periodically submerged within the Illinois River channel. During a March 2012 site visit, several asters were observed in this area; however, the specimens were dead and dried and could not be identified to the species level. It is unknown if these specimens were decurrent false asters. During a site visit in May 2011, several false asters (Boltonia asteroides), a non-listed, common species, were observed in the same general area. This may indicate that the dead specimens were the same common species and not the federally-listed species. However, this is not known, and this species may be present to the west of the Meredosia Energy Center. • Ebonyshell – state threatened. While not located within the proposed barge unloading area, ebonyshell have been identified within the Illinois River. This species may be present in one of the five mussel beds identified within 2 miles downstream of the energy center in 2002 (IDOT 2011). Although this species has not been found onsite, it may occur within the immediate vicinity. • Illinois chorus frog – state threatened. During a site visit in May 2011, DOE personnel delineated two relatively small wetland areas in a low area near the site boundary along Old Naples Road containing standing water at the surface (see Figure 3.8-2). These small wetland areas could provide Illinois chorus frog breeding habitat, as the Illinois chorus frog has been documented at a larger wetland located directly across Old Naples Road to the east (IDOT 2011). Considering the close proximity to the documented occurrence, it is possible that Illinois chorus frog may occur in these small, onsite wetland areas. While no Illinois chorus frogs were found on the site during a spring 2012 survey of the potential impact areas, there is still potential that they could be present on the site(see Appendix E, Biological Surveys [E1]). It is important to note that the lack of observations could also be a result of the unusually high temperatures and drought conditions presentduring the 2012 survey period.  Indiana bat – federally threatened. Although not listed by the USFWS as occurring in Morgan County, the Alliance consulted with the USFWS and determined that suitable summer habitat may exist within the ROI. The USDA/NRCS identified approximately 35 acres of forested land cover at the Meredosia Energy Center in 2001. Indiana bats roost under the loose bark of dead or dying trees and forage along edges of forested areas. As such, though no Indiana bats have yet been observed in the area, individuals may be encountered in the forested areas at the Meredosia Energy Center.  Regal fritillary – state threatened. Onsite grasslands could provide habitat for the regal fritillary butterfly. Regal fritillaries require large numbers of violet plants (on the order of hundreds of plants per square yard) for population viability as violets serve as the sole food plants for regal fritillary larvae. DOE performed a survey for violet plants and regal fritillaries in potential disturbance areas at the Meredosia Energy Center in the spring of 2012. The state-threatened butterfly and its habitat were both identified onsite during this survey (see Appendix E, Biological Surveys [E2]). 3.8.2.5 CO2 Pipeline The ROI associated with the CO2 pipeline includes the entire CO2 pipeline corridor, which includes approximately 69,380 acres in Morgan County, Illinois. The CO2 pipeline corridor includes portions of three different Level IV Ecoregions, including the Upper Mississippi Alluvial Plain, River Hills, and Western Dissected Illinoian Till Plain (Woods et al. 2006a). Refer to Section 3.8.2 for a discussion of each of these ecoregions. This section provides a general summary of the land cover occurring within this corridor based on data provided by the USDA/NRCS (see Table 3.8-3). As this data dates from 2001, the specific acreages of each land cover type may have changed over time. Table 3.8-3. Land Cover Types within the CO2 Pipeline Corridor and CO2 Storage Study Area Land Cover Type  CO2 Pipeline Corridor (acres)a  CO2 Storage Study Areab (acres)a      Grassland  51 (0.01%)  0     Source: USDA/NRCS 2001 a. Percentage values are approximations due to rounding. b. The CO2 storage study area was originally analyzed in the Draft EIS as a 5,300-acre area. Since the Draft EIS was completed, the Alliance expanded the study area to approximately 6,800 acres to account for additional flexibility for CO2 injection. Refer to Section 2.5.2 for additional details about the CO2 storage study area. This table reflects the acreages and percentages based on the expanded storage study area. CO2 = carbon dioxide; % = percent Terrestrial Habitat Agricultural Land The majority (74 percent) of the terrestrial landscape within the CO2 pipeline corridor is agricultural, comprised of cropland and pastureland. Primary cropscultivated in this area include corn and soybeans. Forests Forested lands comprise approximately 17 percent of the CO2 pipeline corridor. Most forested habitats within the ROIexist alongstreams and rivers where the terrainis toosteepto plow or in areas set aside by government agencies for conservationandrecreation. Aquatic Habitat Aquatic habitats, including herbaceous wetlands and open water, comprise approximately 3 percent of the CO2 pipeline corridor. Aquatic habitats in the ROI include several surface waters, the most prominent of which include: Willow Creek, Coon Run, Spring Run, Mud Creek, Indian Creek, Lick Branch, Snake Creek, Conover Branch, and an upper tributary to Indian Creek (Battelle 2011a). Refer to Section 3.6, Surface Water, for additional information regarding surface water features within the proposed CO2 pipeline corridor. Protected Species Federally-and state-listed species known to occur or potentially occurring within the CO2 pipeline corridor include the following (Battelle 2011a; see Table 3.8-1 and Appendix E, Biological Surveys [E2]): • Indiana bat – federally endangered. While the Indiana bat is not known to occur in Morgan County, potential habitat for this species includes wooded riparian areas within the CO2 pipeline corridor (Battelle 2011a). As such, this special has potential to occur within the ROI. • Decurrent false aster – federally threatened. According to the IDNR, this species is known to occur approximately 1.5miles northwest and approximately 2.5 miles south of the proposed southern pipeline route (Battelle 2011a). No other populations of this species have been identified within the CO2 pipeline corridor (i.e., no decurrent false asters have been observed within the proposed southern or northern pipeline routes). However, this species has potential to occur on streambanks and lake shores inthe ROI. • Eastern prairie fringed orchid – federally threatened. It is possible that this species could occur in lowland or wetland areas in the ROI. The primary habitat of the eastern prairie fringed orchid consists of moist towet prairies and meadows. Based on land cover data, relatively limited grassland/herbaceous and emergent herbaceous wetland land cover exists within the CO2 pipeline corridor (see Table 3.8-3). However, this species has potential to occur in lowland or wetland areas in the ROI. • Pale false foxglove – state threatened. This plant species has been found by IDNR approximately 0.75 mile north of the proposed southern pipeline route in the vicinity of the Northeast Meredosia Nature Preserve (Battelle 2011a). This sighting represents the only known occurrence of this species within the CO2 pipeline corridor. However, this species has potentialto occur in moist to wet sandy prairiesand on loess hill prairies in the ROI. • Regal fritillary – state threatened. This species is known to occur approximately 2 to 3.5 miles from the proposed southern pipeline route, according to the IDNR (Battelle 2011a). A survey for individuals and habitat performed in spring 2012 identified 14 populations of violets, this species' sole larval food source, within the CO2 pipeline corridor. In addition, emergent male and female adult regal fritillary butterflies were observed within the CO2 pipeline corridor during the 2012 survey(see Appendix E, Biological Surveys [E2]). • Illinois chorus frog – state threatened. While past surveys observed this species adjacent to the proposed southern pipeline route, a more recent survey, conducted in March 2012, did not identify any Illinois chorus frogs in the ROI (see Appendix E, Biological Surveys [E1]). However,this species has potential to occur in wetlandareas in the ROI. • Loggerhead shrike – state endangered. This bird has been observed in the northern portion of the CO2 pipeline corridor, approximately 1.3 miles from the southern pipeline route. There have been no additional reported occurrences in the ROI. However, this species has potential to nest in scatteredshrubs and trees in the ROI. 3.8.2.6 CO2 Storage Study Area The approximately 6,800-acre CO2 storage study area is entirely located within the Western Dissected Illinoian Till Plain Level IV Ecoregion (Woods et al. 2006a). Refer to Section 3.8.2 for a description of this ecoregion and a list of the land cover types (including associated flora and fauna) expected to occur there. Table 3.8-3 presents a summary of land cover types within the CO2 storage study area, which is dominated (91 percent) by agricultural lands. There are no known occurrences of federally-or state-protected species in the CO2 storage study area (Battelle2011a). The Alliance performed site-specific surveys for federally-and state-protected species to support development of the stratigraphic well. These surveys identified no federally-or state-protected species or their habitats in the area (see Appendix E, Biological Surveys [E4]). The Alliance also conducted a survey for federally-and state-protected species at the preliminary locations for soil gas monitoring within the CO2 storage study area (see Appendix E, Biological Surveys [E3]). This survey was limited to seven monitoring sites comprising less than 50 square feet in total, all of which were located adjacent to county roads. No federally-or state-protected species were observed during this investigation. No other biological surveys have been conducted elsewhere on theCO2 storage studyarea. 3.8.2.7 Educational Facilities Educational facilities are proposed to be located in or near Jacksonville, Morgan County, Illinois on approximately 2 acres of land. Land cover in Jacksonville consists primarily of developed land, while the majority of the surrounding area consists of agricultural land with small, interspersed areas of forests, mostly around surface waters. The developed lands within Jacksonville and nearby agricultural lands offer limited habitat for wildlife, while wooded riparian areas likely offer the highest quality and most diverse habitat. There are numerous streams in the area, including Mauvaise Terre Creek and Big Sandy Creek, which feed Mauvaise Terre Lake and Lake Jacksonville, respectively. Generalized descriptions of terrestrial and aquatic habitats and the types of species anticipated to be present are described in Section 3.8.2. 3.8.3 Impacts of Proposed Action DOE updated this section to reflect refinements that have been made to the project design since the Draft EISwas published. Agricultural land would experience the greatest impact from the proposed project. However, with the exception of the acreage permanently dedicated for the siting of the injection and monitoring wells and associated infrastructure, all agricultural lands could be returned to their current, productive use after construction. The following subsections discuss potential impacts to land cover types and the species that inhabitthem foreach ofthe project components. Table 3.8-4, as included in the Draft EIS, presents the likelihood of the proposed project to affect federally-and state-protected species potentially occurring within the ROI.

DOE plans to continue consultation with the IDNR regarding state-listed species. DOE is currently preparing a Biological Assessment for submission to the USFWS that addresses the three federally-listed species for which suitable habitat occurs in the project area: the Indiana bat, decurrent false aster, and eastern prairie fringed orchid. In the spring and summer of 2013, Indiana bat habitat assessment surveys were completed at the Meredosia Energy Center, along the current southern pipeline route, and at the proposed injection site. These bat surveys were conducted according to methods outlined in the 2013 Indiana Bat Summer SurveyGuidance Overview (USFWS 2013). Decurrent false aster surveys were conducted during flowering in late summer 2013 where potential habitat was identified in the project area. DOE oversaw an initial survey in November 2011 for the eastern prairie fringed orchid in the project area where potential habitat was identified. The soil types found in this area are not suitable for this species, and no individuals were found. Appendix E, Biological Surveys, has been updated to include the status of surveys completed since the Draft EIS was published. The Biological Assessment was not yet completed for inclusion in the Final EIS. However, DOE is responsible under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act to determine whether the proposed action may adversely affect listed species. Based on the progressof the Biological Assessment at publication of the Final EIS, DOE believes that the proposed action is not likely to adversely affect any of the listed species. The Biological Assessment, when submitted to the USFWS, will provide DOE’s final determinations for each species and will identify measures as appropriate to minimize impacts to federally-listed species. The Biological Assessment would also support the USFWS in issuing its Biological Opinion for the project, if one is needed. The Alliance and DOE will also continue informal consultation with the IDNR regarding potential impacts to state-protectedspecies andthe needfor species-specific surveys. 3.8.3.1 Construction Impacts Meredosia Energy Center This section analyzes impacts of the construction of the proposed project at the Meredosia Energy Center. Since publication of the Draft EIS, the Alliance undertook steps to reduce potential impacts on forested areas of the Meredosia Energy Center property. Through ongoing refinementsin site plans by the Alliance, DOE determined that the potential loss of forested land would be reduced from the 33 acres described in the Draft EIS to a current estimate of approximately 9 acres or less (see Figures 3.8-2 and 3.8-3). If it is determined that any special status species or their habitat could be affected by the proposed project, the Alliance and DOE would work with IDNR and USFWS to develop and implement appropriate conservation measures to minimize potentialimpacts tothese species. Vegetation and Habitats – Meredosia Energy Center Table 3.8-5, as updated for the Final EIS, identifies the amount of each land cover type that could be either temporarily disturbed or permanently displaced with implementation of the proposed project at the Meredosia Energy Center. As shown in that table, implementation of the proposed project could disturb approximately 9 acres of forested habitat, which would effectively be permanently lost due to the long period required for regeneration of the forested habitat. Construction would also temporarily disturb approximately 35 acres of grassland vegetation and permanently impact 19 acres of grassland (USDA/NRCS 2001). Refer to Figure 3.8-2, which has been updated for the Final EIS, for the current locations of theseland cover types atthe Meredosia EnergyCenter. Within permanent impact areas, vegetation and habitats would be permanently converted to a non-vegetated state (i.e., industrial facilities, pavement, etc.). Within temporary disturbance areas, vegetation would be removed during construction, but the areas would be revegetated with native grassland species following construction. Table 3.8-5. Potential Land Cover Lost within the Disturbed Areas of the Energy Center and Pipeline Routes Source: USDA/NRCS2001 a. The acreages for the Meredosia Energy Center presented in this table have been revised based on refinements to the preliminary design and site plan since the publication of the Draft EIS as explained in Section 3.8.2.4. The upper bound for potential areas of disturbance are reflected in the DraftEIS values shown in Table 3.8-2. b. Since the release of the Draft EIS, the Alliance identified a location for the injection wells (see Section 2.5.2.3) and established the pipeline routing within the CO2 storage study area for the southern route to the proposed injection well site. This table reflects the pipeline impacts for the southern route based on the currently proposed pipeline alignment from the energy center to the injection well site. C. The Alliance would use trenchless pipe-boring techniques (i.e., jack and bore and horizontal directional drilling techniques) under sensitive natural resources. By implementing these underground boring techniques, the Alliance would avoid impacting sensitive resources at the surface, including wetlands and forested habitats. The numbers in this table present the actual acreages that would be lostand therefore do not include the areas for which boring is proposed. d. The portion of the northern route within the storage study area is analyzed using a range of reasonable hypothetical end-of-pipeline routes as presented in the Draft EIS (see Section 3.0 for further discussion). This table presents the most conservative acreages from that analysis for each resource. e. Since publication of the Draft EIS, the Alliance reduced the impact to forested area along the pipeline route to an approximate total forested area loss of 6.0 acres compared to the upper bound of 8.0 acres described in the Draft EIS. In all cases, the small areas of forest thatwould be affected are partoflarger swaths of available forested habitat. f. Due to the long regeneration time of trees, any forested habitat disturbed by short-term construction or long-term operation activities associated with the proposed action would effectively be permanently lost. CO2=carbon dioxide Overall, potential impacts to vegetation and wildlife habitats within the boundaries of the Meredosia Energy Center site would be minor. This area is a heavily developed, industrial landscape that provides low-quality wildlife habitat. During earth-disturbing activities, some smaller, less-mobile species, such as rodents, may perish, most likely due to collisions with equipment. However, these species are common, and losses would not be expected ata magnitude that would havepopulation-leveleffects. Vegetation and Habitats – Immediate Vicinity The temporary barge unloading facility that would be used during construction, would be located near the eastern bank of the Illinois River, to the north of the Meredosia Energy Center site. The Draft EIS evaluated two options for barge unloading operations: (1) using mooring dolphins, or (2) grounding the barges on the river bottom. Both options would require disturbance to the riverbed. Section 3.6, Surface Water, describes the potential impacts of these options on local aquatic conditions. The use of mooring dolphins would require installation of support piles driven into the riverbed. This would consist of a single disturbance during installation of three to five mooring dolphins (pilings) no greater than 48 inches in diameter (less than 100 square feet of disturbance in total). All mooring dolphins emplaced during this process would be removed after all modules have been delivered to the Meredosia Energy Center, expected to occur in early 2016. The emplacement and subsequent removal of mooring dolphins would disturb the riverbed and cause a slight increase in downstream sedimentation. The use of mooring dolphins could result in potential indirect, less-than-significant adverse effectsto biologicalresources. Grounding the barges on the river bottom would result in greater disturbance to the riverbed. Approximately 18,360 square feet (0.4 acre) of riverbed would be directly affected duringeach grounding and unloading event. The river bottom would be prepared by removing any large objects that may puncture the barge. If necessary, rip-rap or other suitable material would be placed on the river bottom to provide a foundation for the barge, prevent damage, and minimize riverbed impacts. All rip-rap emplaced during this process would be removed after all modules have been delivered to the Meredosia Energy Center. The emplacement and removal of rip-rap would disturb the Illinois River riverbed and increase downstream sedimentation. While the sedimentation in and of itself would be considered a minor impact, this segment of the Illinois River has been designated as impaired under Section 303(d) of the CWA (seeSection 3.6, Surface Water). The impaired designation is due, in part, to the presence of heavy metals (i.e., mercury and PCBs). When released into water, such heavy metals settle out of the water column and into the riverbed sediments. The emplacement or removal of rip-rap or grounding of a barge could disturb these contaminated sediments and re-suspend heavy metals into the water column. The re-suspension of mercury and PCBs could result in an indirect adverse impact to biological resources. The concentrations of buried contaminants within the sediment and the area potentially affected by re-suspension remain unknown at this time. However, increased exposure to or intake of these contaminants could result in a moderate adverse impact to local species within the in-water construction area. Re-suspended contaminants would disperse and dilute after entering the water column, possibly resulting in minor adverse effects downstream. The Alliance and DOE would coordinate with the USFWS, IDNR, and USACE to determine the potential extent of such impacts; develop and implement appropriate conservation measures; and determine the permits required to perform this work. Through this consultation and the implementation of appropriate conservation measures, potential adverse effects could be furtherreduced. More mobile species (e.g., fish) would likely avoid the area of impact as barges approach, although it is possible that fish species could incur inadvertent mortality as barges are grounded. Adverse mortality impacts to other less-mobile aquatic species would be expected to be minor, considering that a relatively small area would be disturbed over a short period of time and that the Alliance and DOE would survey the affected length of the Illinois River and local downstream areas to ensure no protected species are present. The Alliance is also evaluating options for unloading equipment from barges that would avoid potential impacts by using a combination of on-shore equipment, tugs, and temporary ramps so that there would be no disturbance to the bank or bottom of the Illinois River. The Alliance is evaluating the use of a temporary ramp that might extend 20 feet from the shoreline. Under this scenario, there would be no need for filling, dredging, or modifications to the shoreline since river currents at the boat ramp area are usually mild. Heavy equipment or haul trucks parked above the boat ramp area could be used as temporary mooring devices for the barges. However, these plans are still under development and being reviewed for their feasibility. Because the Alliance has not thoroughly determined the feasibility of this alternative scenario or developed a preliminary design, theFinal EIS considers the impacts presented in the Draft EIS as representing appropriate, upper bounds for the barge unloading operations during construction of the oxy-combustion facility. Overall, proposed construction activities at and in the vicinity of the Meredosia Energy Center would increase the potential for sedimentation in the Illinois River. In accordance with NPDES construction permitting requirements, the Alliance would develop and implement appropriate erosion controls and stormwater management plans to minimize the potential for erosion and sedimentation, reducing the potential for adverse impacts to aquatic species during construction activities (see Section 3.6, Surface Water). Protected Species As discussed in Section 3.8.2.4, and shown in Table 3.8-4, special status species may occur at the Meredosia Energy Center or within the immediate vicinity. Section 3.8.3 discusses the status of consultations with USFWS and IDNR, surveys, the Biological Assessment, and the potential for the proposed projectto affectthese species. While not a special status species currently identified as occurring in Morgan County, bent milkvetch is listed as a state-endangered plant species in four Illinois counties. Individuals of this species have been observed, mapped, and flagged within a proposed permanent impact area on the grounds of the Meredosia Energy Center site. However, Ameren Transmission Company of Illinois is planning to purchase this portion of the Meredosia Energy Center and construct an electrical substation and overhead electrical transmission lines. Ameren is aware of these plants and has agreed to make every feasible effort to avoid impacts to the protectedbent milkvetch. Should avoidance not be feasible, Ameren would coordinate with the IDNR to mitigate impacts as needed through the incidental take permitting regulatory process. Regardless of the plans of a future landowner, implementation of the proposed project by the Alliance would have noadverse impactsto bentmilkvetch.  Forested areas in the vicinity of the Illinois River would be disturbed for construction. Such areas could provide nesting habitat for federally-protected bald eagles, although there are no documented nest sites on the Meredosia Energy Center. DOE conducted bald eagle surveys on the Meredosia Energy Center in June 2013 and found no nesting bald eagles onsite. These results have been communicated verbally to USFWS and will be documented in the Biological Assessment as part of the Section 7 consultations. DOE and the Alliance would comply with the guidelines established by the USFWS (see Section 3.8.1.3), thereby minimizingpotentialadverse effects to bald eagles. Migratory Birds In order to comply with the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (see Section 3.8.1.3), the Alliance would perform initial land clearing activities between September and February to avoid disturbing nesting migratory birds. As discussed in Appendix I, Public Comments on the Draft EIS, the forested acreage to be disturbed would be substantially less than estimated in the Draft EIS. Based on the revised estimate of affected forested lands in the Final EIS, and because only 9 acres of forested habitat would be affected, a small area in relation to the total available habitat in the region, DOE determined that USDOI’s recommendation for a conservation plan to restore and enhance migratory bird habitat inthe vicinity of the projectarea is no longer warranted. As such, no impacts to migratory birds or their nests or eggs would be anticipated, and no violations ofthe Act would occur. CO2 Pipeline Since publication of the Draft EIS, the Alliance identified a location for the injection wells (see Section 2.5.2) and established the pipeline routing within the CO2 storage study area for the southern route to the proposed injection well site. The Alliance has not identified a final routing within the storage study area for the northern route to the injection well site because the Alliance does not intend to use the northern route. As a result, the Final EIS addresses the pipeline impacts for the Alliance’s proposed southern route, based on the currently proposed pipeline alignment from the energy center to the injection wells including refinements to the alignment as discussed in Section 2.5.1.1. This section addresses the pipeline impacts for the northern route based on the analysis presented in the Draft EIS using hypothetical end-of-pipeline spurs as discussed in Section 3.0. Construction of the proposed CO2 pipeline would require the clearing of vegetation within the 80-foot wide construction ROW. This clearing would temporarily remove vegetated habitats from use by wildlife in the construction ROW and permanently remove up to 22 acres of forested land within the 50-foot operational ROW for the alternative northern pipeline route or up to 6 acres of forested land for the proposedsouthern route.This would resultin minorbiologicalresourceseffects. In the event that the Alliance finds it necessary for the pipeline route to deviate from either the southern or northern pipeline routes analyzed in this EIS, it is expected that impacts would be consistent with those addressed in this section, since the same siting criteria would be followed. In the event that the final pipeline routing results in additional impacts to biological resources, the Alliance would continue to consult with regulatory agencies, including the USFWS and IDNR, to develop appropriate conservation measures to minimize impact to species and habitats. As a result, impacts to biological resources along thefinal pipeline route areexpected to be minor. The construction ROW would generally be 80 feet wide, but a 100-foot wide construction ROW may be required under certain circumstances, such as for pipe transportation in wooded hilly terrain (seeSection 2.5.1.3). Following construction, the temporarily disturbed land areas (i.e., the portions of the construction ROW outside of the 50-foot operational ROW) would be re-contoured and re-seeded with native plants appropriate to the area in order to restore the lands to their previous conditions; lands previously in agricultural production could return to agricultural production. The Alliance would implement measures to avoid the spread of invasive plants, such as washing construction equipment prior to its delivery to the construction site to minimize the potential for introduction of invasive seeds that may have been picked up at other locations. Disturbed agricultural land would be returned to agricultural production within the entire ROW (see Section 2.5.1.4), such that no long-term loss of agricultural lands would be anticipated. Table 3.8-5 presents the extent of each land cover type within both the proposed CO2 pipeline southern route and northern route. Terrestrial Habitat As shown in Table 3.8-5, the vast majority of affected land areas (91 percent along the proposed southern route and 86 percent along the northern route) consist of agricultural land, including cropland and pastureland. As noted above, no long-term loss of agricultural lands would be anticipated. These areas provide low-quality habitat for wildlife. Higher-quality habitats, providing overall greater biodiversity, include wetlands and forested areas, which mainly occur adjacent to stream corridors and other surface waters. During construction in areas where horizontal directional or jack and bore drilling is not utilized, habitats within the proposed construction ROW would be disturbed. Clearing of forested areas within the proposed construction ROW would cause a small degree of habitat fragmentation. Although the cleared ROW would not necessarily create an impassable barrier to wildlife movement, some species may not cross a location because the area was disturbed and the habitat altered. However, these effects would be localized and minor as there is relatively little forested habitat in the proposed construction ROWs (approximately 6 acres along the proposed southern route and 22 acres along the northern route). Accidental mortality of wildlife could occur due to collisions with construction vehiclesand equipment. Impacts to forested areas and associated wildlife habitat along either the proposed southern route or northern route would be minor. The Alliance plans to reduce potential impacts to forested areas through implementation of trenchless boring techniques. By using jack and bore or horizontal directional drilling, the pipeline could be installed under streams, wetlands, and road crossings without impacting sensitive natural resources on the surface. The southern pipeline route was selected to avoid additional habitat fragmentation by skirting the edges of forest patches and by minimizing the crossing distance at linear forested areas. As stated above, approximately 6 acres of forested habitat would be disturbed within the southern pipeline route. However, the Alliance would avoid impacts to an additional 7 acres of forest since these areas would be bored under to avoid wetland areas collocated within the forests. Because the forested areas are scattered along the route, the impact at each area would be small and range from about 0.03 acre to 1.7 acres. In all cases, the small areas of forest that would be affected are part of larger swaths of available forested habitat. Aquatic Habitat For either of the potential routes, the CO2 pipeline would cross several streams (see Section 3.6, Surface Water, for more detailed information on water crossings). To avoid or reduce potential adverse impacts to wildlife habitat (i.e., especially to the high-quality habitats of wetlands and surface waters), the Alliance committed to adhering to a SWPPP (see Section 3.6, Surface Water) and performing trenchless drilling beneath all perennial surface water features without disturbing the bed or banks. Sedimentation could occur from construction activities in the general area of surface waters; however, this would likely be at small magnitudes and cause negligible, short-term impacts. Section 3.6, Surface Water, describes the horizontal directional and jack and bore drilling techniques in detail; based on that description, this process would not disturbthe surface waterfeature beingcrossed. Trenching could be employed for crossing narrow intermittent and ephemeral stream channels that were devoid of water at the time of construction, such as when a stream feature is seasonally dry or is frozen to the bottom. A field assessment would be made prior to construction at each crossing to determine the presence of water, and weather forecasts would be monitored to evaluate the potential for precipitation events that could lead to temporary water flow within the stream channel. Dry trenching would consist of excavating a trench through the stream channel, laying the pipe down, and then burying the pipe with the spoils removed during trench excavation. The pipeline crossing would be as nearly perpendicular to the stream channel as possible to minimize overall linear disturbance to the stream channel. Aquatic habitat, including streambanks and streambed substrate, would be restored to original grade following trenching activities. Streambanks would be restored using appropriate stabilization measures and revegetated following specifications outlined in Section 404 permitting. Aquatic habitats would likely recover shortly after construction activities, resulting in short-term, minor adverse impacts. Section 3.6, Surface Water, further discusses BMPs used during construction for protection of surface waters and required construction permitting. Disturbance of the dry stream channels could cause some degree of temporary downstream sedimentation when flow returns to the channel, which could have negative effects to aquatic life primarily because the sediments can fill in open spaces within the steam bed that provide habitat for aquatic macroinvertebrates (e.g., insects). Therefore, construction activities across dry stream channels could cause a localized and temporary decline in insect populations downstream of the crossing, reducing available food resources for larger species (e.g., fish) within the affected segment of the stream. Since the stream channel would be stabilized and revegetated immediately following construction, these types of impacts would be significantly reduced and only minor impactsto aquatic species would beexpected. Protected Species As discussed in Section 3.8.2.5 and shown in Table 3.8-4, multiple protected species may potentially occur within the CO2 pipeline corridor. The status of consultations with USFWS and IDNR, surveys, the Biological Assessment, and the potential for the proposed project to affect these species are discussed in Section 3.8.3. Conservation measures that would or could be implemented are described in Section 4.2, Measures toMitigate Adverse Impacts. Migratory Birds In order to avoid violating the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the Alliance would perform initial land clearing activities between September and February to avoid disturbing nesting migratory birds. As discussed in Appendix I, Public Comments on the Draft EIS, the forested land to be disturbed would be approximately 9 acres, substantially less than the estimated 33 acres described in the Draft EIS. Based on the revised estimate of affected forested lands in the Final EIS, and because only a small amount of forested habitat would be affected in relation to the available habitat in the region, DOE believes that USDOI’s recommendation for a conservation plan to restore and enhance migratory bird habitat in the vicinity of project area is no longer warranted. As such, no impacts to migratory birds or their nests or eggs would be anticipated, and no violations of the Act would occur. CO2 Storage Study Area Terrestrial and Aquatic Habitats Construction of the CO2 injection well site(s) would have temporary and permanent impacts on biological resources within the CO2 storage study area. Table 3.8-3 presents the land cover types within the approximately 6,800-acre CO2 storage study area. Minor terrestrial and no aquatic habitat effects would beanticipated. For the dual-site scenario analyzed in the Draft EIS, but no longer under consideration by the Alliance, construction of the injection and monitoring wells and access roads would require up to 92 acres. Operation of the proposed facilities and roads would require up to 25 acres. The updated design for the single-site scenario currently proposed by the Alliance would require approximately 42 acres for construction of the injection and monitoring wells, associated facilities, and access roads;operation of these injectionand monitoring facilities wouldrequire upto 14 acres. Since publication of the Draft EIS, the Alliance identified a proposed 10-acre location for the injection well site as described in Section 2.5.2.1 and illustrated in Figure 2-20. The 10-acre site (referred to as the single-site scenario, and depicted in Figure 2-20) includes a forestedwetland area along the western border and a cluster of trees in the southeastern corner collectively comprising approximately 2 acres. The Alliance intends to avoid impacts on the forested wetland by boring under it for the final CO2 pipeline segment. The Alliance also plans to preserve existing trees onthe site to the extent practicable by incorporating them into the site plan. The Alliance plans to lease an adjoining parcel to the north of the site for construction staging, which is almost entirely cultivated cropland. Approximately 4 acres of additional land area would be required for monitoring wells and access roads. The monitoring well network is depicted in Figure 2-26, but the locations are approximate and subject to landowner approval. Construction at the CO2 injection well site would disturb mostly agricultural land. Impacts to biological resources during construction activities would result from clearing of vegetation during construction of the injection wells and surface facilities, equipment movement, and construction equipment laydown. Once construction is completed, the areas not used for the wells and surface facilities would be regraded and revegetated to the extent practicable, with temporary and minor impacts to biological resources. Arrangements would be made with landowners to reduce the longterm impacts on agricultural land or other activities around the facilities. Potential impacts to prime farmland are discussed in Section 3.3, Physiography and Soils. To reduce impacts on agricultural land, the Alliance would adhere to mitigative actions specified in construction standards and policies set forth in an Agricultural Impact Mitigation agreement with the IDOA (seeSection3.3, Physiography and Soils). Protected Species Because the Alliance intends to follow its established siting criteria (see Section 2.5) to avoid protected species, no federally-or state-protected species would be affected by the construction of the proposed injection or monitoring wells. While loggerhead shrikes may forage in agricultural lands, this species nests in shrubs or small trees. Such areas would not be affected by proposed injection or monitoring well development. Educational Facilities The Alliance anticipates that the visitor, research, and trainingfacilities wouldbe locatedinor near Jacksonville, Illinois. The Alliance is working with local stakeholders to identify the locations that would best serve the functions of these facilities, as discussed in Sections 2.5.3 and 3.0. The facilities may be co-located, or there may be one location for the visitor and research center and another for the training facility. It is expected that they would be located in an existing building or occupy an area that has been previously disturbed and has existing utility connections onsite or immediately adjacent. Once the Alliance identifies a potential site, pre-construction surveys would be conducted to verify that no protected species would be impactedbythe development of thefacilities. As described in Sections 2.5.3 and 3.0, since the release of the Draft EIS, discussions between the Alliance and Jacksonville civic authorities have focused on a potential site in Jacksonville for the educational facilities. Because the locations of the educational facilities currently remain unknown, DOE cannotcharacterize the existingbiological resources. It is likely that any habitat affected by the construction of the educational facilities would be in a developed setting and of low quality for wildlife use. Overall, minor habitat loss could occur during construction of this proposed project component and is not expected to adversely affect any federally-or state-listed species. 3.8.3.2 Operational Impacts Meredosia Energy Center Overall, minor biological resources impacts would be expected from the operation of the oxy-combustion facility. Any potential habitat losses arising from the FutureGen 2.0 Project would be incurred during the construction phase. The site is located within a disturbed industrial setting with high levels of human activity offering low-quality wildlife habitat. No additional long-term noise, light, glare, or air quality impacts to biologicalresources would be anticipatedas compared to existing conditions. As described in Section 3.6, Surface Water, the Meredosia Energy Center would use the existing intake to withdraw water from the Illinois River at a maximum velocity of 0.5 feet per second. This rate represents a reduced rate compared to that used prior to the suspension of facility operations at the end of 2011. At a withdrawal rate of 0.5 feet per second, most fish would be able to swim away from the intake structure without becoming trapped within the intake current, pinned against intake screens, and ultimately dying. Such a low velocity would also reduce the risk to fish eggs and newly-hatched fish. None of the species potentially affected by the intake structure are likely to be protected at either the state or the federal level, as the most proximate protected aquatic species (the ebonyshell) may occur two miles downstream from the Meredosia Energy Center (see Section 3.8.2.4). As such, operation of the intake structure under the FutureGen 2.0 Project would only have a minor adverse effect on aquatic life in the immediate vicinity. The Meredosia Energy Center would utilize existing outfalls for the discharge of approximately 10.6 mgd of treated effluent and cooling water to the Illinois River. Of this, approximately 9.9 mgd would be thermal discharges from the cooling towers. Depending on the amount and temperature, the discharge of artificially-warmed water to the Illinois River could result in reduced levels of dissolved oxygen, increased algal growth, or a change in the composition of the local fish community, including a potential increase in non-native species (USEPA 2011m). As operations at the Meredosia Energy Center were suspended at the end of 2011, the discharge rate proposed under the FutureGen 2.0 Project represents an increase over current levels. However, the proposed discharge represents an approximately 94 percent reduction in both overall and thermal discharges to the Illinois River over the historical operation of the energy center. As a result, operation of the Meredosia Energy Center under the proposed project would result in fewer adverse impacts to biological resources within the Illinois River than operation of the facilityprior to suspension of the energy center’s operations, reducing impacts to a minor level. However, the thermal discharge rates would increase in comparison to the current conditions where there is no discharge to the Illinois River. No appreciable effect on overall habitat quality of the Illinois River would be expected. Refer to Section 3.6, Surface Water, for additional details regardingproposed discharges and potential impactstotheIllinoisRiver. No impacts related to the temporary barge unloading facility would occur during operations, as the area would bereturned to itspre-existing condition following construction. CO2 Pipeline During operations, impacts to biological resources within the final pipeline ROW would be limited to permanent habitat conversions during construction, potentially removing these areas as viable habitat for species utilizingthe pre-existing land covers. These impacts would occur during construction as described in Section 3.8.3.1, but would persist in currently forested areas within the operational ROW throughout the life of the project. Agricultural lands would be returned to agricultural production following construction, including within the operational ROW. As such, no long-term loss of agricultural lands would beanticipated. Table 3.8-5 presents the land cover types within the proposed operational ROWs of the southern and northern pipeline routes from the Meredosia Energy Center to the western border of the CO2 storage study area. Agricultural land accounts for the vast majority of potentially affected land covers. However, some natural forested habitat and developed or barren areas would be affected. The proposed southern route would result in the loss of up to 6 acres of forested lands (see Table 3.8-4). The northern route would resultin theloss of up to 22 acres of forested lands within theoperational ROW.  Throughout the life of the project, the 50-foot wide operational ROW would be kept free of woody vegetation to permit access for inspection and maintenance activities. This would leave the vegetation in the operational ROW in a persistent herbaceous state, creating a long-term (during the life of the project) habitat conversion in areas that were previously forested. Clearing of forested areas would cause a small degree of habitat fragmentation. Although the clearedcorridor would not necessarily create an impassable barrier to wildlife movement, some species may not cross a location because the area was disturbed and habitat altered. The vast majority of potentially affected land areas consist of agricultural land, including cropland and pastureland. Affected agricultural lands would be returned to agricultural uses following construction of the proposed CO2 pipeline route. It is anticipated that the proposed project would have no long-term impact onagricultural land. Vegetation maintenance (e.g., mowing and herbicide treatments) would be performed outside of the migratory bird nesting season (April 1 to July 31) in order to avoid potential long-term impacts to migratory birdsand violating the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (see Section 3.8.1.3). As identified in Section 3.8.1.3, bald eagles receive protection under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act of 1940 and the conservation measures recommended by the USFWS (2010b). The Alliance would comply with these guidelines; therefore, no impacts to bald eagles are anticipated as a result ofthe operation of the proposed project. The potential release of CO2 from the pipeline as a result of either a puncture or rupture is considered to be highly unlikely. If a leak or rupture of the proposed CO2 pipeline were to occur, respiratory effects to biota due to increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations would be limited to the immediate vicinity where the rupture or leak occurred. Refer to Section 3.17, Human Health and Safety, for additional information aboutthepotential for pipeline leakage or rupture. Should the CO2 be released into a stream or waterbody, it would dissolve in the water up to its solubility, given the pH, total dissolved solids, and temperature of the water at the time of the release. The CO2 concentration in the water is unlikely to reach 2 percent (which is when injuries to aquatic life can occur), since the solubility of CO2 at typical atmospheric conditions would keep the concentration less than approximately 0.2 percent. Under normal operating conditions, the temperature of the CO2 being transported through the pipeline would be approximately 90°F at the pipeline point of entry at the Meredosia Energy Center; the maximum temperature could be up to 110°F. The temperature would drop to approximately 72°F at the CO2 injection site. While the presence of the pipeline could cause some degree of warming of the surrounding soils, particularly during the winter months, the pipeline would be placed at least 5 feet beneath the ground surface in agricultural areas in accordance with IDOA pipeline construction standards and policies and the Agricultural Impact Mitigation Agreement signed by the Alliance (see Section 2.5.1.3 and Appendix H, Agricultural Mitigation). At this depth, the proposed pipeline would have little effect on the root zone temperature of agricultural crops. The U.S. Department of State conducted a study of the effects of soil temperature increases as a result of pipeline operations for the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline. In the Pipeline Temperature Effects Study, included in Appendix L of the Keystone XL Draft EIS, the pipeline temperature was expected to be warmer than the proposed CO2 pipeline (i.e., approximately 95°F to 130°F). The study modeled anticipated heat flux to the surrounding ground, studied the existing literature, and consulted land management experts to determine potential effects to vegetation and crops. The study concluded that positive effects on vegetation and crops have been documented in terms of spring emergence and plant growth, while negative aspects on plant growth have not been documented for the potential temperature range associated with the pipeline (U.S. Department ofState 2011). DOE received a scoping comment asking if the proposed “warm” pipeline could cause mold or insects to proliferate during the winter months. DOE researched the issue and was unable to find any literature regarding potential growth of mold or insects, although it appears unlikely that such impacts would result. Although the Pipeline Temperature Effects Study included from the Keystone XL Draft EIS did not specifically address the potential effects of molds and insects, the study identified that temperature fluxes would be directed downward and, in the winter, root zone temperatures would be affected by the ambient temperature as opposed to the proposed pipeline (U.S. Department of State 2011). Soil molds and insects would most likely occur near the plant root zone and close to the ground surface. Considering the many miles of existing pipelines in the United States, studies regarding the ecological impacts of pipeline development, and the lack of literature on effects of molds, insects, or other pests due to pipeline-caused thermal variations, there is no evidence that the operation of the proposed pipeline could result in the potential issues raised by the commentor. Thus, DOE has no reason to conclude that thermal impacts to vegetation or cropsdueto operation ofthe proposed pipeline would occur. CO2 Storage Study Area Overall, minor impacts to biological resources would be expected during operation of the injection and monitoring well sites as any potential habitat losses resulting from the proposed project would occur during the construction phase. It is important to note that, for the injection and monitoring well sites, agricultural lands are the most likely to be affected, and these are generally considered low-quality wildlifehabitat. Following construction, as many as 25 acres would be permanently converted to developed uses due to placement of facilities and infrastructure. Under the dual-site scenario, which is no longer under consideration by the Alliance, the permanent operational footprint of the CO2 injection wells and supporting facilities would occupy approximately 10 acres, while up to 15 acres would be occupied by access roads to the injection well sites. Under the single-site scenario currently proposed by the Alliance, the CO2 injection wells and supporting facilities would occupy approximately 10 acres for the permanent operational footprint and approximately 4 acres for access roads to the monitoring wells. Operation of the proposed wells would generate noise, light, and glare, which may cause avoidance of the area by wildlife. Should there be any surface waters in the immediate vicinity of the selected well sites, it is possible that surface disturbances, such as vehicular movements, could indirectly contribute small amounts of sedimentation to those waterways, which would cause negligible aquatic habitat degradation. However, these potential effects would likely be avoided with implementation of BMPs (see Section 3.6, Surface Water) and adherence to the Alliance’s well sitingcriteria. The driving force behind siting the injection wells is suitable geology, which includes the presence of a suitable impermeable caprock to prevent the upward migration of CO2 to the surface. Thus, it is highly unlikely that the injected CO2 would migrate to the surface and cause any impacts to aquatic or terrestrial habitats. The injection of CO2 into the deep subsurface has the potential to affect subsurface organisms within the approximately 4,000-acre CO2 plume radius. Microbial life in the deep subsurface was discovered approximately 20 years ago. Until recently, the deep subsurface has been considered a place where only single-celled organisms could exist due to temperature, energy, oxygen, and space constraints. However, species of multicellular roundworms (phylum Nematoda) have been discovered in South Africa, from water at a depth of approximately 2 miles (Borgonie et al. 2011). In general, these subsurface biological communitiesare poorly understood and may be more complex than previously thought. DOE/NETL is funding a study with the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign at a carbon capture and storage project near Decatur, Illinois in order to improve the understanding of subsurface ecology and impacts of CO2 storage. The study is being performed in the Mt. Simon Formation and includes identifying sets of subsurface microbes before and after CO2 injection. The total set of observations would allow characterization of the subsurface microbial community in a CO2 storage reservoir in the context of the local reservoir environmental conditions, sedimentary substrate, and pore-water environment (NETL 2010b). Although this study is in the preliminary stages, results would likely further aid in the understanding of the effects of CO2 injection on subsurface microbial communities in the general area of the proposed injection well site(s) (DOE 2011b). DOE continues to monitor this study and will apply new informationfrom this study to the FutureGen 2.0 Project, if warranted. In general, microbial communities and activity can be influenced by changes in pH value, pressure, temperature, salinity, and other factors, which can all be influenced by CO2 injection into the deep subsurface. A study in Germany analyzed the response of the microbial community to CO2 storage in a saline aquifer. The study revealed a shift in the microbial community composition following CO2 injection; however, after 5 months of CO2 storage, enhanced activity of the microbes indicated that the community was ableto adapt to the changed conditions (Morozova et al. 2010). Until further research has been conducted, the effects of CO2 storage on microbial communities remain uncertain. It is also unclear how widespread multicellular organisms, such as roundworms, may be in the deep subsurface and how they may be affected by CO2 storage. Operation of the CO2 injection wells would likely affect subsurface organisms; however, whether those effects would be considered adverse and the magnitude of impact is currently unknown (DOE 2011b). Educational Facilities Because the proposed educational facilities would occupy existing structures or be constructed within previously developed areas, the operation of thisproposed project componentis not expected to cause any adverse impacts to biological resources. Any minor habitat losses related to the educational facilities would be incurred during the construction phase and are not likely to cause long-term effects. Due to the proposed disturbed nature of the potential location for facilities, no federally-or state-listed species would experience long-termimpacts duringoperation of these facilities. 3.8.4 Impacts of the No Action Alternative Under the no action alternative, DOE would not provide cost-shared funding for the FutureGen 2.0 Project. Although the Alliance may still elect to construct and operate the project in the absence of DOE cost-shared funding, for the purposes of the analysis in this EIS, DOE assumed the no action alternative is equivalent to the no-build alternative. The project would not be constructed, and there would be no change to biological resources. INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK 3.9 CULTURAL RESOURCES 3.9.1 Introduction This section describes cultural resources potentially affected by the construction and operation of the FutureGen 2.0 Project as well as the potential direct and indirect effects of the proposed project on these resources. 3.9.1.1 Region of Influence The ROI for cultural resources is the Meredosia Energy Center, a 4-mile wide corridor for the CO2 pipeline, and a 6,800-acre ROI for the CO2 storage study area. The ROI was used to identify areas containingcultural resources and to help guide the siting process. The Area of Potential Effect (APE) is a smaller geographic area The Area of Potential Effect is the within which an undertaking may directly or indirectly cause geographic area or areas within which an alterations in the character or use of historic properties. Adverse undertaking may directly or indirectly cause alterations in the character or use of effects to archaeological, paleontological, and cemetery resources historic properties, if such properties exist are generally the result of direct impacts from ground disturbing (36 CFR 800.16[d]). activities. The APE for such resources therefore coincides with those areas where direct impacts from the construction and operation of the proposed facility would occur. Adverse effects to historic resources (i.e., standing structures) may occur through direct impacts that could change the character of a property’s use or the physical features within a property’s setting that contribute to its historic significance, or through indirect impacts that could introduce visual, atmospheric, or audible elements that diminish the integrity of the property’s significant historic features. Traditional cultural properties may be subject to both direct and indirect impacts. Project APEs for the different project components would be defined in an iterative process involving DOE, SHPO, and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) as needed, pursuant to a Programmatic Agreement (see Appendix B, Cultural Resources Consultation [B3]). Because the proposed project involves potential effects to historic properties on a regional scale, which cannot be fully determined prior to approval, a Programmatic Agreement has been developed in accordance with 36 CFR 800.14(b). The Programmatic Agreement is discussed further in Section 3.9.1.3. 3.9.1.2 Method of Analysis and Factors Considered To determine the extent to which archaeological and historic resources are known to exist or may exist within the ROI for this project, DOE reviewed the Illinois Archaeological Survey site files and the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency’s Historic Architectural and Archaeology Resources Geographic Information System. In addition, Phase I Cultural Resources Surveys (see Table 3.9-1) were prepared for the CO2 storage study area (see Appendix F, Cultural Surveys [F1]), the Meredosia Energy Center1 (see Appendix F, Cultural Surveys [F2]), the Bluff Area segment located within the CO2 pipeline corridor (see Appendix F, Cultural Surveys [F3]), and the soil gas monitoring locations located within the CO2 storage study area (see Appendix F, Cultural Surveys [F4]). APEs were defined for these studies and are described further in Section 3.9.2. These studies served as reconnaissance level research to gain a better understanding of cultural resources in the ROI and to guide the siting process. Table 3.9-1 presents all studies conducted thus far and their SHPO concurrence status. Further studies would be necessary once the exact locations of the various project components are decided. The Programmatic Agreement, which has been finalized since publication of the Draft EIS, outlines additional steps to be taken by the appropriate parties to identify, evaluate, and treat historic properties in the context of the proposed project. 1 The Phase I Cultural Resources Survey at the Meredosia Energy Center surveyed the area planned for impact, which amounted to 147 acresofthe263-acre energy centerproperty. Table 3.9-1.

However, to determine whether any federally-recognized tribes have a cultural or historic affiliation with the proposed project site, DOE contacted several tribal organizations after reviewing the National Park Service’s Native American Consultation Database of tribes to be contacted in conformance with the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act. In addition, the SHPO and the IDOT provided input into which tribes to contract. DOE contacted the followingtribal organizations: • CitizenPotawatomi Nation • Delaware Nation,Oklahoma • EasternShawnee Tribe ofOklahoma • Forest County Potawatomi Community • Hannahville Indian Community • Ho-Chunk Nation ofWisconsin • Iowa Tribe of Kansas & Nebraska • Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma • Kaw Nation • Kickapoo Traditional Tribe of Texas • Kickapoo Tribe of Indians of the Kickapoo Reservation inKansas • Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma • Match-e-be-nash-she-wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians of Michigan • Miami Tribe of Oklahoma • Nottawaseppi Huron Band of the Potawatomi, Michigan • Osage Nation • Peoria Tribeof IndiansofOklahoma • Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians • Prairie Band ofthe Potawatomi Nation • Sac and Fox NationofMissouri inKansas andNebraska • Sac and Fox Nation of Oklahoma • Sac and Fox TribeoftheMississippi in Iowa • Shawnee Tribe • Shawnee Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma Copies of the letters sent by DOE, which conveyed information about the proposed FutureGen 2.0Project and invited the tribes to request additional information, are included in Appendix B, Consultation Letters. Two tribal organizations, the Kickapoo Traditional Tribe of Texas and the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma, responded to thelettersand did not have anycomments or concerns regardingthe project. DOE assessed the potential for impacts based on whether the proposed FutureGen 2.0 Project would causethe loss,isolation,oralteration of: • Archaeologicalresources listed or eligiblefor NRHPlisting; • Historic sites or structures listed or eligible for NRHP listing, either directly or by introducing visual, audible,oratmospheric elements thatwouldadverselyaffect the historicresource; • Native American resources, including graves, remains, and funerary objects, either directly or by introducing visual, audible, or atmospheric elements that would adversely affect the resource’s use; • Paleontological resources listedor eligibleforlistingasaNational Natural Landmark; or • Cemeteries. 3.9.1.3 Regulatory Framework Section 106 of the NationalHistoric Preservation Act (NHPA) and its The National Historic Preservation implementing regulations at 36 CFR 800 (incorporating amendments Act of 1966 (16 USC 470), as amended, effective August 5, 2004) require federal agencies to take into establishes a program for the account the effects of their undertakings on historic properties, and to preservation of historic properties throughout the nation. afford the ACHP a reasonable opportunity to comment on such undertakings. Under NHPA Section 106, a historic property is any prehistoric or historic district, site, building, structure, or object included in, or eligible for inclusion in, the NRHP maintained by the Secretary of the Interior. Historic properties can include artifacts, records, and remains related to and located within such properties. Properties of traditional religious and cultural importance to a Native American tribe or Native Hawaiian organizationthat meet NRHP criteria (36 CFR 800.16[l][1]) are alsohistoricproperties. For purposes of this EIS, cultural resources are the following: • Archaeologicalresources,includingprehistoric and historic archaeological sites; • Historic resources,includingextant standingstructures; • Cultural orhistoriclandscapes or viewsheds; • Native American resources, including Traditional Cultural Properties important to Native Americantribes; and • Otherculturalresources,includingextant cemeteries and paleontologicalresources. 36 CFR 800 outlines procedures to comply with NHPA Section 106. Under 36 CFR 800(a), federal agencies are encouraged to coordinate NHPA Section 106 compliance with any steps taken to meet the requirements of NEPA, and to coordinate their public participation, review, and analysis in such a way that they can meet the purposes and requirements of both the NEPA and the NHPA in a timely and efficient manner. The Section 106 process has been initiated for the FutureGen 2.0 Project with the intent of coordinatingthat processwithDOE’s obligations under NEPA regardingcultural resources. Participants in the Section 106 process include an agency official with jurisdiction over the undertaking, the ACHP, consulting parties, and the public. Consulting parties include the SHPO; Indian tribes; representatives of local government; applicants for federal assistance, permits, licenses, and other approvals; and additional consulting parties that include individuals and organizations with a demonstrated interest in an undertaking due to the nature of their legal or economic relation to the undertaking or affected properties, or their concern with the effects of the undertakings on historic properties. In Illinois, the Director of Historic Preservation within the Illinois Historic Preservation Agencyserves as the SHPO. The NHPA Section 106 process is conducted in parallel with the Illinois Section 707 process. The Section 707 process is embodied in the Illinois State Agency Historic Resources Preservation Act (20 Illinois Compiled Statutes (ILCS) 3420) governing projects under the direct or indirect jurisdiction of a state agency, or licensed or assisted by a state agency. The Illinois Archaeological and Paleontological Resources Protection Act (20 ILCS 3435) applies to all public lands in Illinois and contains criminal sanctions for those who disturb burial mounds, human remains, shipwrecks, and other archaeological resources or fossils on public lands. Human burials are afforded additional protection under the Illinois Human Skeletal Remains Protection Act (20 ILCS 3440), which forbids disturbance of human skeletal remains and grave markers in unregistered cemeteries, including isolated graves and burial mounds, that are at least 100 years old. Younger graves and registered cemeteries are protected under the Illinois Cemetery Protection Act (765 ILCS 835). Under the Illinois Historic Preservation Act (20 ILCS 3410), a Comprehensive Statewide Historic Preservation Plan was prepared in 1995, and updated in 2012, that broadly outlines a framework for historicpreservationinthe state. As described in Section 3.9.1.1, because the proposed project involves potential effects to historic properties on a regional scale, which cannot be fully determined prior to approval, the Illinois SHPO suggested that DOE work with the Alliance to draft a Programmatic Agreement in accordance with 36 CFR 800.14(b). This agreement would cover the scope of the entire DOE action for the FutureGen 2.0 Project and implementation of NHPA Section 106 throughout the course of the proposed project. The SHPO suggested the following signatories for this Programmatic Agreement: ACHP, SHPO, DOE, and the Alliance. The SHPO asked DOE and the Alliance to take the lead on drafting the Programmatic Agreement for SHPO review. On January 26, 2012, DOE sent a letter to the SHPO notifying them that they would be contacting them regarding enteringinto a Programmatic Agreement. A draft Programmatic Agreement was submitted to the SHPO on August 28, 2012 (see Appendix B, Cultural Resources Consultation [B3]). The Programmatic Agreement outlines steps to be taken by the appropriate parties to identify, evaluate, and treat historic properties in the context of the proposed project. The goal of the Programmatic Agreement is to implement a consistent approach to the identification, evaluation, and treatment of historic properties throughoutthe project’s various elements (Battelle2011b). In support of Section 106 Consultation activities, DOE met with the SHPO on March 31, 2011, June 24, 2011, December 6, 2011, May 9, 2013, and June 20, 2013 to discuss the project and specific project areas of concern. A letter was received from the SHPO on May 30, 2013 stating that they concurred with the findings of the Draft EIS and that a Programmatic Agreement would be implemented to mitigate any adverse impacts to cultural resources.On June 12, 2013, a letterwas sent to the ACHP formally inviting them to participatein the Section106 processfor the project. To date, no response has been received. On August 5, 2013, the DOE and IHPA formalized the Programmatic Agreement and the Alliance signed as a concurring party. The signed Programmatic Agreement is included in Appendix B, Cultural Resources Consultation [B3]. Communication and consultation with the SHPO is ongoing. 3.9.2 Affected Environment 3.9.2.1 Regional Cultural Context Humans have inhabited the state of Illinois for at least 12,000 years (Battelle 2011b). Paleo-Indians appeared after the retreat of the last glacier. The archaeological record indicates prehistoric occupation of the state as follows: Paleo-Indian (10,000 B.C. to 8000 B.C.), Archaic (8000 B.C. to 800 B.C.), Woodland (800 B.C. to 1100 A.D.), and Mississippian (900 A.D. to 1500 A.D.). Illinois’ prehistoric sites document the interaction of small foraging band societies and the evolution of tribal and chiefdom societies. Throughout prehistory, west central Illinois, where portions of the FutureGen 2.0 Project are located, was one ofthemost intensivelyoccupiedregions in the midwestern United States. The eastern floodplain of the Illinois River in Scott, Cass, and Morgan counties near Meredosia possesses a particularly rich archaeological record (Battelle 2011b). The Meredosia Lake drainage includes more than 100 prehistoric and historic sites. Archaeological material found at the sites contains records of how specific cultural groups—from the Archaic Period through the Mississippian Period—used this specific area and howsettlement and subsistence strategies changedover time. Beginning in the 1600s, when American Indians first came into contact with Europeans, the Illinois (or Illiniwek) Nation, a group of 12 tribes, occupied most of what today forms the state of Illinois (Battelle2011b). In the 1700s and 1800s, the Illinois Nation’sterritory shrank and other tribes moved into the state. Five main tribes survived into the 1700s. Only two, the Kakaskia and Peoria, existed in the early 1800s, and by the mid-1800s they had ceded their lands to the U.S. Government. No federally-recognized tribe occupies thestate of Illinois today. In 1673, French explorers, Father Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet, became the first Europeans to explore Illinois (Battelle 2011b). Rene-Robert Cavalier, Sieur de La Salle arrived in 1679, and claimed the entire Mississippi River Basin for France. This led to the French establishing colonial missions and outposts in the state. In 1717, Illinois became part of the French colony of Louisiana and in 1783, became United States territory through the Treatyof Paris. The first European settlers came to the Morgan County area inapproximately 1823. 3.9.2.2 History of the Meredosia Energy Center and the Central Illinois Public Service Company The Meredosia Energy Center was constructed in the 1940s and was operated by the Central Illinois Public Service Company (CIPSCO). As a private business enterprise, CIPSCO began in 1902, as the Mattoon City Railway Company, which was organized to provide streetcar service in Mattoon, Illinois. Between 1903 and 1904, Mattoon City Railway quickly diversified its services and assets to include an electric generating plantand distribution system supplying both Mattoon and the surrounding region. By 1914, CIPSCO was operating 8 generating stations and serving 232 communities, including over 100,000 electric customers (see Appendix F, Cultural Surveys [F2]). In addition to its electric, gas, and heat utility businesses, the company’s service included supplying water, selling ice wholesale to some communities, and operating retail ice businesses in select cities. Business expanded rapidly in the 1920s, and in spite of the impending national Great Depression, CIPSCO continued acquiring minor electric and ice properties and extended both electric and gas service to previously un-served communities and rural areas during the late 1920s. By 1931, however, the impact of the economic decline brought on by the Depression resulted in significant reductions in profit, and CIPSCO reduced most classes of service to its customers(see Appendix F, Cultural Surveys [F2]). In 1941, preliminary construction began on a steam electric generating plant on the Illinois River south of the village of Meredosia in Morgan County, Illinois (see Appendix F, Cultural Surveys [F2]). However, due to the United States entering into World War II, construction was brought to a quick halt in 1942 by a directive of the War Production Board. As a matter of national safety, the War Production Board effectively suspended all construction at facilities not vital to the war effort, including the Meredosia EnergyCenter. Construction materials originally intended for the energycenter were redirected to support America’s militaryneeds.Specifically,the turbo-generator and relatedequipment initiallydestinedfor the energy center were shipped by the War Production Board to assist the United States’ World War II ally, Russia. Construction resumed at Meredosia Energy Center following the war, and the station's first generating unit was completed in 1946, and went into service in 1948 (see Appendix F, Cultural Surveys [F2]). CIPSCO continued operating and expanding the energy center through the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. In 1995, shareholders of CIPSCO and the Union Electric Company approved the merger of the two companies, which were combined as Ameren Corporation. Ameren continued power generation at Meredosia Energy Center until operations were suspended at the end of 2011. 3.9.2.3 Meredosia Energy Center As described in Section 3.9.1.2, various studies were completed as reconnaissance level research to identify cultural resources within the ROI. The Phase I Cultural Resource Survey -147-acre FutureGen 2.0 Power Plant Site Near the Village of Meredosia (see Appendix F, Cultural Surveys [F2]) was conducted to identify cultural resources on the Meredosia Energy Center site. The APE was defined as 100 acres of previously disturbed and developed areas, 18 acres of woods, 24 acres of agricultural areas, and 5 acres of grassy or fallow areas on the Meredosia Energy Center site. This study included an examination of historicalmaps andatlases pertinenttothe subject property, a computer database search of the archaeological site files maintained by the Illinois State Museum, a review of the NRHP, and a review of the Illinois Register of Historic Sites maintained by the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency (see Appendix F, Cultural Surveys [F2]). In addition to archival records and database examination, the subject property was examined by archaeologists utilizing shovel-probe reconnaissance at approximately 50-foot (15-meter) intervals within wooded areas and pedestrian reconnaissance at approximately 16-foot (5meter) intervals withinagriculturalfieldsandgrassyor fallow areas. The records review revealed that a portion of the project area was previously surveyed by the Center for American Archaeology in 1991 (see Appendix F, Cultural Surveys [F2]). The records review also indicated that an unknown survey was conducted in the southern portion of the project area. One site, 11Mg473, was reported within the northeast portion of the project area. Archeological site 11Mg473 represents the subsurface remains of the extant Meredosia Train Depot. The site was reported in 2010. The site database indicates that 60 artifacts were recovered from the site and date from 1850 through the 1870s. Currently, the site is situated in a public park and includes the remains of a circa 1850s cut-stone bridge pier, a small tracksegment, a late 19thto early 20th century caboose, and the late 19th century depot. The depot is located adjacent to the Northern Cross Railroad line, one of the first rail lines constructed in the state of Illinois duringthe late1830s. A second site, 11Mg22, was reported by A. Berkson in 1976. Dating to the Early Woodland (circa 1000 B.C.) based on temporally-diagnostic artifacts, the site was described as a light density artifact scatter exposed along the cutbank of the Illinois River and adjacent to the developed portion of the Meredosia Energy Center. Collected from the eroded shoreline, a total of four artifacts, including a chert blade, a small dart point fragment, and two small and eroded pottery shards were recovered. The vertical extent of the archaeological site is unknown; however, the archaeologist who identified the site suspected that up to 90 percentofthe site mayhave beencompromised byconstructionanduse of the energycenter. The shovel-probe reconnaissance revealed that the entire campus has experienced dramatic ground disturbance due to construction and continued operation and expansion over the last 60 years. Investigations failed to identify the presence of archaeological resources. In addition, examination of the standing structures occupying the facility did not document any existing structures greater than 50 years in age that areof architectural orhistorical merit. 3.9.2.4 CO2 Pipeline Seven cultural resource surveys have been conducted within close proximity to the southern and northern pipeline routes. These studies were evaluated to better determine the presence of cultural resources within the ROI. A larger portion of the southern route has been examined previously due to its path traversing the proposed expansion of US-67. This highway corridor was surveyed by the Center for American Archaeology in 1996. Survey #3411 was a 40-mile electrical transmission line survey conducted in 1990 by the Center for American Archaeology (Prairie Archaeology & Research 2012a). The survey corridor ran south out of Meredosia along Old Grace Road. No cultural, archaeological, or historical resources were identified withinthe pipelineROW during this survey. Survey #10129 extended east at the intersection of Old Grace Road and Yeck Road and continued northward away from the pipeline corridor (Prairie Archaeology & Research 2012a). It ran parallel and within close proximity to the proposed pipeline routes but did not actually intersect the routes at any point. This survey was conducted in 2000 by American Resources Group for the construction of Yeck Road. No cultural, archaeological, or historical resources were identified within the pipeline ROW by this survey. Survey #972 is a flood control study survey conducted in 1985 by the Center for American Archaeology (Prairie Archaeology & Research 2012a). The survey area consisted of numerous noncontiguous land tracts throughout the Illinois River valley floodplain in Scott, Cass, and Morgan counties. The southern and northern routes intersect a portion of this survey just southeast of Meredosia along the eastbound section of Yeck Road asitcurves northbound. In total, thissurvey identified 57 prehistoric and 52 historic sites. None of the identified sites were within the surveyed portion intersecting the proposed pipeline corridor. Survey #9344 is the US-67 survey conducted in 1996 by the Center for American Archaeology (Prairie Archaeology & Research 2012a). As mentioned earlier, the southern route follows this survey from its entrance near the bluffs to its departure approximately 3.5 miles to the southeast. The northern route intersects a very small portion of this survey as it crosses US-67 near the bluffs. As the southern and northern routes meet up to the east, the routes would again intersect the portion of this survey located south of Concord and west of Joy Lane. The over 10,000-acre survey identified 174 prehistoric and 163 historic sites. Over 100sites were recommended for Phase IIinvestigations. IDOT is in the process of completing the Phase II investigations for these sites. Site 11Mg281, an early historic site dating to the late 1800s, was identified during this survey. Remains of structures, a well, and a cistern were noted at this location as well as piles of brick. The site is within the proximity of a 19th century school appearing on historicalatlases. The school was reported to have burned down in 1905. Further evaluation of the bluff area was determined necessary through discussions with the SHPO and the Phase I Cultural Resources Survey -FutureGen Industrial Alliance, Inc. Bluff Area Pipeline Right-of-Way Segment was conducted in January 2012 (see Appendix F, Cultural Surveys [F3]). The APE was composed of a 75-foot wide corridor approximately 3,250 linear feet (990 linear meters) in length in wooded, grassy, and fallow areas, just south of the intersection of IL-100 and IL-104. Due to the APE’s location along the bluff and uplands of Morgan County, deep burial of cultural deposits or remains were deemed unlikely. Survey #17765 represents a corridor survey intersected by the northern route (Prairie Archaeology & Research 2012a). This survey was conducted by the Illinois Transportation Archaeological Research Program in 1999 for IL-78. The northern route would intersect perpendicularly to the survey corridor and thus encounter only a very small portion. No cultural, archaeological, or historical resources were identifiedwithinthepipeline ROW by this survey. Survey #18092 is a corridor survey covering various roadways in rural Morgan County (Prairie Archaeology & Research 2012a). Both routes would cross perpendicularly to this survey. No cultural, archaeological,orhistorical resources were identifiedwithin the pipeline ROW by this survey. 3.9.2.5 CO2 Storage Study Area Two Phase I Cultural Resources Surveys have been conducted within the CO2 storage study area to identify cultural resources within the ROI, the Phase I Cultural Resources Survey-FutureGen Industrial Alliance, Inc. Site Characterization Locale (see Appendix F, Cultural Surveys [F1]) and the Phase I Cultural Resources Survey -FutureGen Industrial Alliance, Inc. Soil Gas Monitoring Locations (see Appendix F, Cultural Surveys [F4]). The Alliance conducted a detailed geological stratigraphic analysis to characterize and verify the viability of the proposed CO2 storage study area. In support of this analysis, the Phase I Cultural Resources Survey -FutureGen Industrial Alliance, Inc. Site Characterization Locale was completed for the CO2 storage study area in April 2011 (see Appendix F, Cultural Surveys [F1]). The APE consisted of approximately15.3acres ofagricultural fields within the CO2 storage studyarea. This inventory was completed to identify cultural resources within the ROI and included an examination of historical maps and atlases pertinent to the subject property, a computer database search of the archaeological site files maintained by the Illinois State Museum, reviews of the NRHP and Illinois Register of Historic Sites, and field investigations utilizing a pedestrian reconnaissance at approximately 16-foot (5-meter) intervals (see Appendix F, Cultural Surveys [F1]). Based on the results of field investigations and information collected during archival and background research, the area that was surveyed for the stratigraphic well contained no significant historic, architectural, and archaeological resources. The Phase I Cultural Resources Survey -FutureGen Industrial Alliance, Inc. Soil Gas Monitoring Locations (see Appendix F, Cultural Surveys [F4]) was completed within the CO2 storage study area in November 2011. The APE for this study included 5 acres of agricultural fields and 1 acre of fallow fields within the CO2 storage study area. The same resources were evaluated as for the Site Characterization Locale. Based on the results of field investigations and information collected during archival and background research, the area that was surveyed for the stratigraphic well contained no significant historic, architectural, and archaeological resources. 3.9.2.6 Educational Facilities The location of the educational facilities in Jacksonville, Illinois has not yet been determined. Once the locations are selected, and prior to construction, stepsdescribed in the Programmatic Agreement would be undertaken to characterize the presence of cultural resources in areas that have not been disturbed or surveyed previously, as well as to assess and resolve adverse effects tohistoric properties, if necessary. 3.9.3 Impacts of Proposed Action 3.9.3.1 Construction Impacts Meredosia Energy Center As described in Section 3.9.2.3, the entire Meredosia Energy Center has experienced extensive ground disturbance during construction, continued operations, and expansion over the last 60 years. No cultural resources were identified directly on the site; however, as described in Section 3.9.2.3, the Phase I Cultural Resource Survey -147-acre FutureGen 2.0 Power Plant Site Near the Village of Meredosia identified two archeological sites in close proximity to the Meredosia Energy Center, 11Mg473 (the Meredosia Train Depot)and 11Mg22 (alight density lithic scatter)(see Table 3.9-2). As currently conceptualized, the proposed project would not result in an adverse impact to cultural deposits that may be present at archaeological site 11Mg473 (the Meredosia Train Depot), nor would this archeological site likely contain sufficient integrity with potential to yield significant scientific or historical information to be considered eligible for inclusion on the NRHP. Currently, the existing energy center is adjacent to the physical boundaries of site 11Mg473 and is visible from the resource. As such, the proposed project would not result in an adverse visual intrusion to the setting or viewshed of any extant structures (such as the depot, caboose, rail track segment, or bridge pier) that may contain sufficient historical, architectural, or engineering value which would render such structure as eligible for inclusion on the NRHP. With regard to site 11Mg22 (a light density lithic scatter), construction, use, and repeated land modifications associatedwiththeenergycenter has not only compromised theintegrity of the site butalso removed any evidence that archaeological site 11Mg22 extended into the project’s APE. Archaeological investigations in the vicinity of site 11Mg22 failed to produce evidence of intact cultural deposits, failed to generate artifacts, and failed to provide scientific information regarding prehistoric use by past inhabitants at the site. The current investigation has demonstrated that prehistoric archaeological site 11Mg22 lacks a degree of significance and a level of integrity that would render the site eligible for nomination or listing on the NRHP. Investigations have demonstrated that the proposed activities would not result in an adverse impact to a significant resource and that archaeological site 11Mg22 is ineligible for nomination to the NRHP.  In addition, the shovel-probe reconnaissance for the Phase I Cultural Resources Survey (completed on a 147-acre portion of the Meredosia Energy Center) failed to identify the presence of archaeological resources. Examination of the standing structures occupying the facility did not document any existing structures greaterthan50 years inage that are of architectural orhistorical merit. Based on the findings included in the Phase I Cultural Resource Survey -147-acre FutureGen 2.0 Power Plant Site Near the Village of Meredosia, additional cultural resource investigations are neither warranted nor recommended. No impact to historic resources is anticipated as a result of construction for the oxycombustion facility. To date, the SHPO has not concurred with these findings. Prior to construction, the SHPO must concur with these findings. In addition, steps described in the Programmatic Agreement would be undertaken to characterize, assess, and resolve any adverse effects to cultural resources that have not been disturbed orsurveyed previously. CO2 Pipeline As described in Section 3.9.2.4, seven cultural resource surveys have been conducted in areas along the southern and northern pipeline routes. Review of the surveys conducted in the area identified one historic site, 11Mg281, in close proximity to a portion of the southern route (see Table 3.9-2). This site is currently being mitigated by IDOT for a roadway-widening project. Therefore, it is not anticipated that the southern route would have an adverse effect onthis resource. The cultural resources survey for the Phase I Cultural Resources Survey -FutureGen Industrial Alliance, Inc. Bluff Area Pipeline Right-of-Way Segment did not identify any cultural resources within the APE for the study. Due to the APE’s location along the bluff and uplands of Morgan County, deep burial of cultural deposits orremains were deemed unlikely. To date, SHPO concurrencehas notbeenreceived. Many areas along the southern and northern pipeline routes have not been surveyed. Therefore, the potential for the discovery or disturbance of an unknown cultural resource during construction on either the southern or northern route exists, particularly in areas where there has been no prior land disturbance. Although the Alliance selected the southern route as the proposed route since publication of the Draft EIS, the pipeline route could deviate slightly within the identified corridor as a result of final project design and coordination with landowners; however, the steps outlined in the Programmatic Agreement (see Appendix B, Cultural Resources Consultation [B3]) would be implemented and the same siting criteria would be followed. Additionally, prior to construction, steps described in the Programmatic Agreement would be undertaken to characterize the presence of cultural resources in areas that have not been disturbed or surveyed previously and assess and resolve any adverse effects to cultural resources, if necessary. In addition, procedures are in place should cultural resources be discovered inadvertently during construction (inadvertent discovery procedures). Where possible, the CO2 pipeline would follow existing road and utility ROWs to reduce impacts to cultural resources. Impacts would be consistentwith those addressedin this section. Table 3.9-2. Cultural Resources Identified within the Region of Influence Impacted as a Result Site Project Resource Type Description of the Project Number Component (Yes or No) Meredosia Archeological 11Mg22 Light density artifact scatter No Energy Center Site CO2 Storage Study Area As described in Section 2.5.2.1, since the publication of the Draft EIS, the Alliance identified a proposed propertyfor the injectionwell site based on the geotechnical evaluations of the subsurface and negotiations with the landowners. This property contains an abandoned house within the APE. The landowners are willing to let the Alliance demolish the house to provide sufficient space for the injection wells while minimizing the reduction in farmable land.The Alliance believes that the standing structure is greater than 50 years in age. This one-story structure was used as a rural residence and, based on an assessment of available archival information, was constructed between 1959 and 1963.This structure is not unique in the region and rural residences of similar age are ubiquitous throughout the Morgan County rural countryside. In addition to the recent age of the building and the absence of unique architectural or historical significance, the building appears to lackthe necessary degree of architectural integrity to be considered as potentially eligible for listing on the NRHP due to factors such as the significant alterations of the original fabric of the residential structure including modernization of windows, exterior siding, and roofing materials, and the recent additions at the side and rear elevations of the original structure. Further, the structure appears to contain little historical relevance or any semblance of architectural merit that would render the building potentially significant under criterions A, B, or C of the NRHP's criteria for historical,architectural, or engineering significance. As described in Section 3.9.2.5, the area surveyed for the stratigraphic well does not contain evidence for the presence of archaeological, historical, or cultural resources, sites, areas, or artifacts. The SHPO concurred with the findings of the Phase I Cultural Resources Survey -FutureGen Industrial Alliance, Inc. Site Characterization Locale in a letter dated June 1, 2011 (IHPA 2011a). Therefore, should the CO2 injection wells and monitoring wells be located in this previously surveyed area, no impacts to cultural resources would beanticipated. The area surveyed for the soil gas monitoring locations also does not contain evidence for the presence of archaeological, historical, or cultural resources, sites, areas, or artifacts. The SHPO concurred with the findings of the Phase I Cultural Resources Survey -FutureGen Industrial Alliance, Inc. Soil Gas Monitoring Locations in a letter dated November 29, 2011 (IHPA 2011b). Therefore, should the CO2 injection wells and monitoring wells be located in this previously surveyed area, no impacts to cultural resources would beanticipated. The potential for the discovery or disturbance of an unknown cultural resource during construction exists in areas where there has been no prior land disturbance. Prior to construction, steps described in the Programmatic Agreement would be undertaken to characterize the presence of cultural resources in areas that have not been disturbed or surveyed previously as well as to assess and resolve adverse effects to historic properties. Educational Facilities As described in Sections 2.5.3 and 3.0, since the release of the Draft EIS, discussions between the Alliance and Jacksonville civic authorities have focused on a potential site in Jacksonville for the educational facilities, but the sites currently remain unknown. The potential for the discovery or disturbance of an unknown cultural resource during construction exists, particularly in areas where there has been no prior land disturbance. Prior to construction, steps described in the Programmatic Agreement would be undertaken to characterize the presence of cultural resources in areas that have not been disturbed or surveyed previouslyas wellas to assess andresolve adverse effects to historic properties. 3.9.3.2 Operational Impacts Once the FutureGen 2.0 Project is operating, there would be no additional subsurface disturbance, other than for occasional pipeline repairs, which would limit the potential to disturb or harm buried cultural resources. The oxy-combustion facility would be located on the existing Meredosia Energy Center property and would not introduce new operational noise or stack emissions that would represent substantial changes to the activities historically conducted at the site. Therefore, impacts to cultural resources during the project’s operational phase would be negligible to minor. The Alliance would implement BMPs, includinginadvertent discoveryprocedures. 3.9.4 Impacts of the No Action Alternative Under the no action alternative, DOE would not provide cost-shared funding for the FutureGen 2.0 Project. Although the Alliance may still elect to construct and operate the project in the absence of DOE cost-shared funding, for the purposes of the analysis in this EIS, DOE assumed that the no action alternative is equivalent to a no-build alternative. Therefore, the project would not be constructed and there would be no impactto culturalresourcesas a result ofthe noaction alternative. INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK 3.10 LAND USE 3.10.1 Introduction This section describes existing land use within the proposed project’s ROI. Additionally, this section analyzes the potential direct and indirect effects of the construction and operation of the proposed project on the existing land uses and addresses the compatibility of the proposed project with current and future land uses inthe ROI.  3.10.1.1 Region of Influence The ROI for land use includes the areas proposed for the construction and operation of the proposed project (direct effects) and their adjacent properties (indirect effects), including the Meredosia Energy Center, the CO2 pipeline, the CO2 injectionwells, and the educational facilities. 3.10.1.2 Method of Analysis and Factors Considered In order to describe the affected environment for land use and analyze potential impacts, DOE considered current and future plans for land use based on available county and city zoning ordinances, GIS data, comprehensive plans, and interviews with county and city officials (e.g., the Morgan County Regional Planning Commission, city of Jacksonville). DOE obtained further details about site-specific land use characteristics from USDA/NRCS land cover data and information gathered during site visits. DOE used such information to supplement existing land use dataforMorgan County. For the purposes of this analysis, DOE used the following land use groupings: • Agricultural Land – Includes farmland, cropland, pasture/hay, and land used for cultivated crop and livestock production. • Developed Land – Includes urban areas (cities or towns) as well as rural developments including farm-related residential properties, rural commercial and industrial facilities, cultural and recreational facilities,barren land, and other structuresand developed uses. • Vegetated Land – Includes forests (deciduous, evergreen, and mixed forest), scrub-shrub, and grasslands. • Water Features – Includes open water such as permanent surface waterbodies including lakes, rivers, reservoirs, ditches, and permanent and intermittently exposed open water areas. Wetlands include bogs, marshes, and fens characterized by a high water table, standing or slow-moving water, and hydrophyticvegetation. DOE assessedthe potentialimpacts onlanduse basedonwhetherthe proposedproject would: • Be compatible with land use adjacent to the Meredosia Energy Center and within and adjacent to the CO2 pipeline corridor, CO2 storage studyarea, and associated components and facilities; • Result inland use restrictions onadjacent properties; or • Conflict with regionalorlocalland useplans and zoning. 3.10.1.3 Regulatory Framework Based on information obtained from the Morgan County Regional Planning Commission, the unincorporated county does not have zoning information or current land use plans (Douglas 2011). The city of Jacksonville has a comprehensive plan, but it is not applicable to areas of Morgan County outside of Jacksonville city limits. The Illinois Pollution Control Board’s 35 IAC 901 Appendix B, Land-Based Classification Standards and Corresponding Land Classes includes classifications of land according to use, which are applied to noise emissions regulations (IPCB 2007). The Code categorizes land use into Land Classes A, B, and C depending on type (i.e., developed, agricultural, vegetated, etc.). See Section 3.14, Noise and Vibration, for additional details. DOE used GIS data, obtained from the County GIS Coordinator in combination with the county online parcel website, to evaluate land use types and land ownership information to inferthe currentland uses in the ROI. The Federal Farmland Protection Policy Act (7 USC 4201 et seq.) established guidelines to minimize the extent to which federal programs contribute to the unnecessary conversion of farmland to nonagricultural uses. The Act assures that federal programs are administered in a manner that, to the extent practicable, would be compatible with state, local, and private efforts to protect farmland. Additionally, the IDOA reviews federal agency programs, projects, and activities for compliance with the Farmland Preservation Act (8 IAC 700) and the Federal Farmland Protection Policy Act. See Section 3.3, Physiography and Soils, for additionaldetails aboutthe Farmland ProtectionPolicyAct andthe IDOArequirements. 3.10.2 Affected Environment The FutureGen 2.0 Project would be located in west central Illinois in Morgan County. Regional land use is largely agricultural and rural with small areas of developed land. Theexisting Meredosia Energy Center is located south of the village of Meredosia, which has a population of approximately 1,044 (USCB 2010b). The most heavily developed land in Morgan County is within the city of Jacksonville, approximately 17 miles southeast of the energy center. Jacksonville encompasses approximately 10 square miles of low, medium, and high-density developed land and has a population of 19,446 (USCB 2010c). The land outside of the city of Jacksonville in Morgan County is predominantly agricultural. Morgan County encompasses approximately 366,617 acres, of which 279,840 acres or 76 percent are agricultural. The balance ofland inMorgan Countyis mainlyvegetated. Table 3.10-1 provides a detailed breakdown of the existing land use acreages in Morgan County and the state of Illinois, based on the land use groupings identified in Section 3.10.1.2. Acreage data is based on USDA/NRCS land cover data. Table 3.10-1. Land Use Acreage by Type Agricultural Developed Vegetated Water Features Total Land Affected Area (acres)a (acres)a (acres)a (acres)a (acres)b 25,019,220 4,178,294 5,819,236 2,217,849 Illinois 37,234,599 (67%) (11%) (16%) (6%) Source: USDA/NRCS 2001 a. Percentagevaluesareapproximationsdueto rounding. b. Totalpercentageis100percent. % = percent Land use in Morgan County is generally consistent with state-wide land use, which is dominated by agricultural land. Comparatively, Morgan County has a greater percentage of agricultural land and subsequentlya lesser percentage oftheotherland usetypes than theremainder ofthe state. 3.10.2.1 Meredosia Energy Center The Meredosia Energy Center property is a heavily developed industrial site, typical of a coal-fired power plant. This property includes generating units, cooling towers, a coal barge unloading area, storage areas for coal and coal combustion by-products, chimneys (stacks), substations, and multiple warehouse buildings (see Chapter 2 for further details). Additionally, there are fields and open space areas (e.g., trees and grassyareas) within the property. Table 3.10-2, as updated to show changes for the Final EIS, provides a summary of the land use types in the potential disturbance areas at the Meredosia Energy Center based on recent aerial photographs and dataprovided by the USDA/NRCS (2001). Table 3.10-2. Land Use Types within Potential Areas of Disturbance at the Meredosia Energy Center Source: USDA/NRCS 2001 a. Represents the most conservative upper bound for impacts, as presented in the Draft EIS and reflected in Figure 2-14. b. Represents the Alliance’s current plansfor impacts, as reflectedin Figure 2-15. At the end of 2011, operations were suspended at the Meredosia Energy Center. Although all operational activities stopped (e.g., no coal consumption or energy generation), the existing land use remains unchanged. The Meredosia Energy Center is surrounded by a variety of land uses, including developed land (i.e., residential and manufacturing facilities) and agricultural land. Adjacent to the northern border of the property is a wooded area with an access road (Front Street) leading to a public boat ramp area that includes two boat ramps, which are owned and controlled by the village of Meredosia. An area beyond the boatramps was usedas a small campingarea in previous years but isno longer in use(Salinger 2013). The area north of the boat ramps is occupied by the Cargill, Inc. (Cargill) grain elevator facility and the Meredosia Bridge. The bridge (IL-104) provides a connection between Pike County and Morgan County. North of the Meredosia Energy Center is the village of Meredosia, which is predominantly surrounded by agriculturalland. Old Naples Road borders the eastern boundary of the Meredosia Energy Center. Properties to the east of Old Naples Road consist of mostly developed residential properties but also include a few parcels of land that involve industrialactivities. The adjoining land to the south of the Meredosia Energy Center is occupied by the Celanese Emulsions (National Starch & Chemical) plant and Norfolk & Western Railway. Additional chemical plant facilities, including TA Terminals Inc. and Agrium Inc., lie to the east of the Celanese Emulsions plant, generally southeast of the Meredosia EnergyCenter. The Illinois River borders the western boundary of the Meredosia Energy Center. Pike County is located across the Illinois River to the west of Morgan County. Land use in Pike County is also mostly agricultural, but Pike County has a higher proportion of vegetated land (28 percent) compared to nearby counties, including Morgan County. 3.10.2.2 CO2 Pipeline The FutureGen 2.0 Project would include a CO2 pipeline and CO2 injection wells centrally located in Illinois and entirely within Morgan County. The Alliance identified two possible pipeline routes from the Meredosia EnergyCenter to the CO2 storage study area. The two pipelineroute options are located within the 4-mile wide corridor shown in Figure 2-17. Table 3.10-3 provides a detailed breakdown of land use acreage by project component, based on the land use groupings identified in Section 3.10.1.2. Acreage data is based on USDA/NRCS land cover data. Table 3.10-3.

Since the Draft EIS was released, the Alliance expanded the study area to approximately 6,800 acres to account for additional flexibility for CO2 injection. Refer to section 2.5.2 for additional details about the CO2 storage study area. This table reflects the acreages and percentages based on the updated 6,800-acre storage study area. CO2 = carbon dioxide; % = percent Agricultural land is the most abundant land use type found within the ROI. Substantially smaller areas of vegetated and developedlandare also present. The CO2 pipeline route options from the Meredosia Energy Center to the CO2 injection wells traverse approximately 30 miles west to east within the northern portion of Morgan County. As the land between the Meredosia Energy Center and the storage study area is not owned by the Alliance, legal ROW easements must be obtained from land owners when a route is finalized. The pipeline would be sited in accordance with applicable federal and state regulations, including 49 CFR 195.210; 49 CFR 195.210 states that pipeline ROWs would avoid, to the extent practicable, areas containing private dwellings, industrial buildings, and places of public assembly. Additionally, regulations require CO2 pipelines to be located no closer than 50 feet fromresidences. The Alliance proposes to locate the pipeline no closer than 150 feet from residences. It is possiblethat a distance less than 150 feet would be needed in order to avoid a sensitive environmental resource or at the request of an affected landowner but the distance would not be lessthan the50 feet required by federal regulations. The 4-mile wide pipeline corridor avoids the city limits of Jacksonville and includes predominantly agricultural land (74 percent). Other land use types within the corridor consist of vegetated land (17 percent), water features (3 percent), and small areas of developed land such as farm-related residential properties and residential neighborhoods (6 percent), including areas near the villages of Concord and Meredosia. 3.10.2.3 CO2 Storage Study Area The CO2 injection and monitoring wells and associated surface facilities would be located on up to 25 acres within the CO2 storage study area in the northeastern portion of Morgan County (see Figure 2-17). As shown in Table 3.10-3, the CO2 storage study area is predominantly agricultural land. The 6,800acre storage study area consists of approximately 6,201 acres of agricultural land, 357 acres of vegetated land, and 4 acres of water features. During early project planning, the Alliance selectedthe CO2 storage study area to avoid developed areas to the extent practicable. Farm-related properties account for the majority ofthe 223 acres of developed land withinthe 6,800-acre CO2 storage studyarea. 3.10.2.4 Educational Facilities The Alliance anticipates that the educational facilities would be located in or near Jacksonville, Illinois. The Alliance is working with local stakeholders to identify the locations that would best serve the functions of thesefacilities. The cityof Jacksonville is an approximately 10-square mile area that includesavariety of land uses. Land uses in the city of Jacksonville include developed land ranging from open space to high-density development, open water and wetlands such as the Mauvaise Terre Lake and Lake Jacksonville, and agricultural lands surrounding the city. Jacksonville has a comprehensive plan and zoning ordinance that delineates boundaries for land use within the city. The zoning ordinance applies to all land within the corporate limits of Jacksonville and contiguous territory within 1.5 miles beyond the corporate limits (City of Jacksonville 2012b). The comprehensive plan includes a future land use plan (City of Jacksonville 2002). Additionally, the Jacksonville Regional Economic Development Corporation provides economic development services that focus on businessretention, expansion, and attraction. 3.10.3 Impacts of Proposed Action 3.10.3.1 Construction Impacts Meredosia Energy Center Construction of the oxy-combustion facility at the Meredosia Energy Center would have negligible to minor short-term impacts on land use. Initial design, as presented in the Draft EIS, estimated that approximately 164 acres could be impacted during construction at the energy center (see Table 3.10-2). However, the current design at the energy center could reduce the area of disturbance to approximately 114 acres during construction (see Section 2.4.3 for further discussion on estimated impact areas). The vast majority of construction of the oxy-combustion facility would occur on the Meredosia Energy Center property, although additional land area outside of the energy center would be needed for construction staging and equipment laydown. Construction of the proposed oxy-combustion facility would not conflict with any designated zoning plans, sincethere is no local or county-wide zoning ordinance that applies to the energy center. The Meredosia Energy Center is characterized as previously disturbed, industrial land use, with areas of open space (i.e., grass areas). Construction activities at the Meredosia Energy Center would be consistent with the industrial nature of the property and would not result in conversion of land use within the energy center property; therefore, impacts would be negligible. Adjacent properties are mostly occupied by industrial land uses, but a few residential properties are located to the east and north. The nearest residences are located approximately 1,300 feet from the proposed location of the oxy-combustion facility. Construction of the oxy-combustion facility would have a short-term, minor impact on land use compatibility in the immediate area and on neighboring property owners due to temporary increases in traffic and noise levels. Potential impacts to nearby residential and other properties during construction of the oxy-combustion facility are further described in Section 3.11, Aesthetics; Section 3.13, Traffic and Transportation; and Section 3.14, Noise and Vibration. Construction staging would primarily occur on the Meredosia Energy Center property, but a few parcels of vacant and/or industrial land outside of the energy center would be utilized for additional laydown areas. The parcels outside of the Meredosia Energy Center being considered for use during construction includethefollowing (USDA/NRCS 2001; Beacon 2013): • Approximately 28 acres of land to the southeast of the energy center based on the original configuration analyzed in the Draft EIS; and approximately 25 acres of land based on the current configuration: This land is owned by the Norfolk & Western Railway Company and is primarily agricultural cropland with a segment of ROW for a rail line. It would be used as a staging area, which would result in a temporary loss of this area from agricultural use during the duration ofconstruction. • Approximately 1.5 acres of land to the east of the energy center: This land is a gravel parking areaowned byCelanese Ltd, which would be used forparking during the construction period. • Approximately 3.4 acres of open space to the north of the energy center: This land is undeveloped city-owned ROW. Construction activities would utilize the ROW for temporary parking and would revert back to its original use upon completion ofthe construction phase. The areas for construction staging would primarily experience temporary impacts. Although the land would not be available to the owners during the construction period, once proposed construction is completed, the land would revert back to its original use. Additionally, the properties adjacent to the potential construction staging areas are mostly industrial and, therefore, construction staging would not have a substantiallanduseimpact onthese properties and would not conflict with surrounding land uses. The existing public boat ramp area located northeast of the Meredosia Energy Center would be used as a temporary facility for unloading barges delivering modules of oxy-combustion equipment during construction. The boat ramp area has two boat ramps and is owned by the village of Meredosia. It is not anticipated that both of the boat ramps would be shut down during barge unloading since only one ramp would be needed to offload the materials; however, additional phases of project engineering and coordination with the village of Meredosia would be required to determine further access arrangements. It is anticipated that impacts to the boat ramp area would be short term, lasting between 1 to 3 months during each of several construction unloading timeframes. Properties adjacent to the temporary barge unloading facility include ROW and developed residential properties. Impacts to the adjacent properties due to barge unloading activities would be minor and primarily associated with noise and visual impacts (see Section 3.11, Aesthetics, and Section 3.14, Noise and Vibration). Such activities would be short term and similar to activities at other nearby properties that are industrial in nature (e.g., the Cargill grain elevator to the north oftheboatramp area and theMeredosia Energy Center to the south). The use of the boat ramp area to support barge unloading operations would result in a temporary shutdown or closure of oneof the boat ramps during offloading activities, which could resultin temporary impacts to the boat ramp area. Even though it is not anticipated that public access to the river would be blocked by barge unloading activities, there is the potential to cause a temporary increase in residential and boat travel at alternate facilities. Details about the temporary barge unloading facility are provided in Section 2.4.3.2. Permanent impact areas would be limited to land within the Meredosia Energy Center boundaries and would not change the current industrial land use. In general, impacts to the energy center and adjacent properties during construction would be negligible to minor and temporary, as no major conflicts to land use compatibility areexpected to occur. CO2 Pipeline Construction of the pipeline would involve land clearing and trenching within the 80-foot wide construction ROW for approximately 30 miles to the injection wells within the CO2 storage study area. These activities would have both short-term and potentially long-term impacts on land use. All impacts on land use during construction of the pipeline would be minor. Short-term impacts would result from temporarily restricting access and disrupting the ability to use the land for existing purposes (e.g., agricultural crops); land would be returned to its original condition after construction to the extent practicable. Long-term impacts could result from land cover changes to small areas of vegetated land (i.e., forests) due to land-clearing activities during construction and in situations that require the conversion of vegetated land to permanent 50-foot wide ROWs and access roads. To reduce land use impacts, access to construction ROWs would be provided from existing roads crossing the pipeline route to the extent practicable. Because the pipeline would be installed underground, the aboveground ROWs could be restored to their prior uses after construction with minimal aboveground features (i.e., pipeline markers at crossings and mainline block valve shelters). This would result in negligible to minor impacts on adjacentlands. To the extent practicable, the pipeline would be located along existing ROWs. In such cases, there would be short-term and negligible impacts, because land use within the original easement would remain the same. For example, approximately 2 miles of the pipeline for the southern route to the injection wells would be located within an existing US-67 ROW, which would not change the land use within the ROW. For portions of the pipeline that would be unable to return to existing conditions (i.e., forested land), impacts would be long term and permanent. Impacts would be reduced by using trenchless pipe-boring techniques such as horizontal directional drilling or jack and bore technology to bury the pipeline beneath landswithout disturbingthe land directlyabove the pipeline.The Alliance plans to use such technology where sensitive areas have been identified along the pipeline (i.e., wetlands and forested areas), as practicable. See the map views in Appendix C, Map Views of Pipeline, which include the boring locations. For the portion of the pipeline traversing through the CO2 storage study area, impact analysis in the Draft EIS used hypothetical end-of-pipeline routes (spurs) to evaluate a range of reasonable siting scenarios(see Section 3.0). Since the release of the Draft EIS, the Alliance identifieda location for the injection wells (see Section 2.5.2.1) and established the pipeline routing within the CO2 storage study area for the southern route to the proposed injection well site. The pipeline route could ultimately deviate as a result of final project design and coordination with landowners; however, the same siting criteria would be followed and impacts would be consistent with those addressed in this section. Since the Alliance does not plan to move forward with the northern pipeline route, final routing within the storage study area was not identified for the northern route to the injection wells. As a result, DOE addressed the pipeline impacts for the southern route based on the currently proposed pipeline alignment from the energy center to the injection wells and addressed the pipeline impacts for the northern route based on the analysis presented in the Draft EIS using hypothetical end-of-pipeline spurs. Table 3.10-4 presents the potential land use acreages temporarily and permanently lost as a result of construction of the pipeline route options from the Meredosia Energy Center to the injection wells. The two CO2 pipeline route options from the energy center to the injection wells would require similar acreage for construction ROW (approximately 249 acres). As discussed in Section 3.10.2, agricultural land is the most prevalent land use in the ROI. Therefore, agricultural land would be encountered most frequently during construction. Agricultural land accounts for an average of approximately 90 percent of land use within the construction ROW of the two pipeline route options. Agricultural land affected by construction of the pipeline would be temporarily unavailable and then restored after construction, resulting in no permanent loss of agricultural land. While the soils within the construction ROW could be returned to production if farmed, they may be less productive in the short term due to increased compaction and some loss from soil erosion. To help preserve the integrity of any agricultural land that would be impacted by pipeline construction, the Alliance would adhere to mitigative actions specified in construction standards and policies set forth in an Agricultural Impact Mitigation agreement with the IDOA; this agreement is discussed in greater detail in Section 3.3, Physiography and Soils, and AppendixH, Agricultural Mitigation. The construction ROW would involve a minimal amount of developed land. The northern route would result in a greater amount of developed land temporarily lost (approximately 6 acres) as compared to the southern route (approximately 1 acre) (see Table 3.10-4). However, most of this is open land associated with ruraldevelopment (e.g., farm-relatedproperties). Although farm-related residential properties (i.e., developed land) are located within the 4-mile wide pipeline corridor, it is unlikely that residential structures would be directly impacted by the route selected for the proposed project. Regulations require CO2 pipelines to be located no closer than 50 feet from residences (49 CFR 195). The Alliance proposes to locate the pipeline at least 150 feet from residences. It is possible that a shorter distance would be deemed necessary in order to avoid a sensitive environmental resource or at the request of an affected landowner, but the distance would not be less than the 50 feet required by federal regulations. The Alliance is in the process of securing easements for both temporary (for construction) and permanent (for operation and maintenance) ROWs on private lands. If it is necessary for the pipeline to bisect a private property, the design would include a suitable crossing of the pipeline to support vehicle access by the property owner throughout construction. Conformance to pipeline siting regulations would reduce potential impacts to nearby residences. It is expected that construction of the pipeline would not place any restrictions on a landowner’s ability to sell or transfer ownership of a property during or after construction. In general, construction impacts to developed (i.e., rural residential) land use would be driven by concerns related to temporary impacts from dust, aesthetics, traffic, and noise (see Section 3.1, Air Quality; Section 3.11, Aesthetics; Section 3.13, Traffic and Transportation; and Section 3.14, Noise and Vibration). Table 3.10-4. Potential Pipeline Route Construction Disturbances to Land Use Source: USDA/NRCS 2001 a. Acreages presented in this table represent the pipeline right-of-way. The Alliance would use trenchless pipe-boring techniques such as jackand bore techniques and horizontal directional drilling under sensitive natural resources. The numbers in this table present the actual acreage thatwould be lost, and therefore do notinclude the areas thatwouldbe bored underto avoidimpacts. b. Since the release of the Draft EIS, the Alliance identified a location for the injection wells (see Section 2.5.2.1) and established the pipeline routing within the CO2 storage study area for the southern route to the proposed injection well site. This table reflects the pipeline impacts for the southern route based on the currently proposed pipeline alignment from the energy center to the injection wells. c. The portion of the northernroute within the storage study area is analyzed using a range of reasonable hypothetical end-of-pipeline spurs as presented in the Draft EIS(see Section 3.0 for further discussion). This table presents the most conservative acreages from that analysisfor eachresource. d. Since publication of the Draft EIS, the Alliance reduced the impact to forested area along the pipeline route to anapproximate total forested arealossof 6.0acres comparedto the upper boundof 8.0 acres describedin the Draft EIS. CO2 = carbon dioxide If necessary, and only after receiving a certificate of authority from the Illinois Commerce Commission for the CO2 pipeline, the Alliance could use the right of eminent domain under Illinois law to obtain ROWs and temporary work areas in the event that an easement could not be negotiated with the affected landowner. As would be the case for all landowners, the Alliance would compensate the landowner for the ROW and for any damages incurred during construction; however, the level of compensation may be determined by thecourt. Construction for pipeline crossings of roads and railroads would be accomplished using horizontal directional drilling or jack and bore technology, which allows for portions of the pipeline to be buried beneath lands without disturbing the surface directly above the pipeline. Any potential traffic lane closures to roadways would be temporary; safety measures such as the use of flaggers and signage would be used to minimize traffic delays and hazards. Therefore, impacts to traffic flow during pipeline construction are expected to be minor (see Section 3.13, Traffic and Transportation). There are no major recreational areas along either pipeline route; therefore, access restrictions to public areas are not expected to occur during construction. In the event that the Alliance finds it necessary for the pipeline route to deviate from the routes analyzed in this EIS, DOE expects that impacts would be consistent with those addressed in this section, since the same siting criteria would be followed. In the event that the final pipeline routing results in additional impacts to land use resources, the following potential impacts would apply. In cases where existing ROW is unavailable and the land is unable to revert back to original use (i.e., vegetated), long-term impacts would result from conversion ofland to operational ROW. Agriculturalland impacted during construction would be managed in accordance with the Agricultural Impact Mitigation agreement with the IDOA and would result in short-term impacts (see Appendix H, Agricultural Mitigation). As a result, construction impacts to land along thefinal pipeline route are expected to be minor. CO2 Storage Study Area Construction of the CO2 injection well site(s) would have temporary and permanent impacts on land use within the CO2 storage study area. The Alliance identified the location of the proposed injection well site (referred to as the single-site scenario and shown in Figure 2-20) using results of plume modeling, characterization activities, and the siting criteria detailed in Section 2.5.2.1, such that they would not conflict with zoning requirements, if applicable. The Alliance entered into agreements with landowners within the 6,800-acre CO2 storage study area to acquire the subsurface pore space and aboveground land area needed for the injection wells, monitoring wells, and surface facilities. The geologic formations considered for CO2 injection are not used for any other purposes and contain no minerals and no water suitable for drinking or irrigation. Other than on the specific sites for wells and aboveground facilities, landowners would be able to use their surface property for existing purposes, such as agriculture. Referto Section 3.4, Geology, and Section 3.5, Groundwater, for additional details. For the dual-site scenario analyzed in the Draft EIS, which is no longer under consideration by the Alliance, construction activities would affect up to 28 acres for the injection and monitoring wells and associated facilities; and up to 64 acres for the staging and construction of access roads. The updated design for the single-site scenario would affect approximately 15 acres for construction of the injection wells and associated facilities, and up to 4 acres for the access roads. An additional 24 acres would be affected during staging and construction of the monitoring well network, which would involve monitoring wells located at the injection wells and within the plume radius (see Figure 2-26). See Figure 2-20 for the proposed location of the injection wells under the single-site scenario, including the parcel to be purchased for injection wells and surface facilities, and the parcel to be leased for staging and laydown during construction. The property proposed for the single-site scenario includes mostly agricultural land but also a vacant house and wooded areas. The Alliance would demolish the existing vacant house for construction of surface facilities but would avoid disturbing the forested area associated with the unnamed tributary to Indian Creek along the western edge of the parcels. The Alliance also intends to preserve trees around the existing housesite to the extent practicable inthe site plan. Impacts on land use during construction activities would result from clearing of vegetation, construction of the injection wells and surface facilities, equipment movement, and construction equipment laydown. Once construction is completed, the areas not used for the wells and surface facilities would be regraded and revegetated to the extent practicable, with temporary and minor land use impacts. Arrangements would be made with landowners to reduce the long-term impacts on agricultural land use or other activities around the facilities, and the parcel leased for construction staging and laydown would be returned to availability for agricultural use. Potential impacts to prime farmland are discussed in Section 3.3, Physiography and Soils. To reduce impacts on agricultural land,the Alliance would adhere to mitigative actions specified in construction standards and policies set forth in an Agricultural Impact Mitigation agreement with the IDOA (see Section 3.3, Physiography and Soils, and Appendix H, Agricultural Mitigation). Educational Facilities Construction of the educational facilities would have short-term, negligible impacts. The site or sites for the educational facilities would be in areas that have been previously disturbed. This proposed component would require approximately 3.5 acres of land and could involve new construction, rehabilitation of existing structures, or a combination of both types of construction activities. The Alliance would abide by stipulations of the Jacksonville Zoning Ordinance that applies to all land within the corporate limits of Jacksonville and contiguous territory within 1.5 miles beyond. Additionally, the Jacksonville comprehensive plan and future land use plans would be used during site coordination and selection, and the Alliance would coordinate with the Jacksonville Regional Economic Development Corporation during the site identification process. Since the facilities would be constructed on previously disturbed and/or developed land, construction impacts to land use are anticipated to be negligible. As described in Sections 2.5.3 and 3.0, since the release of the Draft EIS, discussions between the Alliance and Jacksonville civic authorities have focused on a potential site in Jacksonville, but the specific locations of the educationalfacilities currently remain unknown. 3.10.3.2 Operational Impacts Meredosia Energy Center The operation of the oxy-combustion facility would have a negligible impact on the previously developed, industrial land use within the Meredosia Energy Center as it would not change the existing industrial use of the energy center. Since there are no land use and zoning plans for unincorporated Morgan County, no impacts to zoning would be anticipated. The proposed oxy-combustion facility represents a return to the former land use and would be compatible with land use of the industrial facilities adjacent to the energy center. Since the oxy-combustion facility would be consistent with the current land use at the energy center, nearby residential properties would not be substantiallyimpacted by operation of the facility. Adjacent offsite properties used for construction staging would be converted back to their original use; therefore, no operational land use impacts are anticipated for these adjacent properties. Potential land use compatibility impacts on nearby residential properties would result from changes to the viewshed and increased traffic and noise levels during operation and are described in Section 3.11, Aesthetics; Section 3.13, Traffic and Transportation; and Section 3.14, Noise and Vibration, respectively. CO2 Pipeline Long-term impacts to land use along the pipeline ROW would occur from the permanent conversion of land cover, including vegetated land (i.e., forests), to permanent pipeline ROW. As shown in Table3.10-4, the amount of land permanently lost due to the pipeline would vary according to which pipeline route option would be selected (southern or northern). As such, the impact analysis focuses on the comparison ofthetwo pipeline route options. Any potential impacts to agricultural land would be mitigated by restoring the land to its original condition to the extent practicable and allowing the current land use to resume after construction. Adherence to ROW restrictions would be required to allow access for maintenance and limit construction of permanent structures within the permanent pipeline easement. Impacts on potential crop production would be further minimized if maintenance activities within the pipeline ROWs could be performed outside the planting and growing seasons. Therefore, operation of the pipeline would have negligible to minor long-termimpacts on agricultural land use. To further reduce impacts on agricultural land, the Alliance would adhere to mitigative actions specified in construction standards and policies set forth in an Agricultural Impact Mitigation agreement with the IDOA (see Section 3.3, Physiography and Soils, and Appendix H, Agricultural Mitigation). Per the Agricultural Impact Mitigation agreement, the Alliance would provide a monitoring and remediation period of no less than two years immediately following initial operation of the pipeline or the completion of initial ROW restoration, whichever occurs last. The two-year period would allow for the effects of climate cycles, trench settling, crop growth, drainage, soil erosion, etc. to be identified through monitoring. Essentially, this period would be used to identify any remaining impacts associated with the pipeline construction that would need correction and follow-up restoration, and would allow time for the Alliancetoeffect necessaryrestoration(see AppendixH, Agricultural Mitigation). Pipeline construction that coincides with existing ROWs would have no long-term impacts on land use since the land would remain as operational ROW. DOE estimates there would be approximately 167 acres of surface disturbance associated with the operational ROW for the southern pipeline route. Most of the surface disturbance would occur on agricultural land which would revert to its original use during operations and as previously discussed, would result in negligible to minor long-term impacts. Areas of vegetated land (e.g., forested) permanently impacted by the pipeline would account for 6 acres of land along the southern route and 22 acres along the northern route. Vegetated land in the operational ROW would be cleared, and the new ROW would be subject to restrictions within the pipeline easement regarding allowable vegetation. New ROW that would be created would have a minor long-term impact. In cases where a new pipeline would bisect a property, impacts may occur if the pipeline would obstruct current or future access within the property (i.e., road crossings and vehicle access). This impact would be avoided as the pipeline would be placed underground and engineered to withstand the weight of typical rural or residential vehicles (i.e., cars, trucks, tractors). The northern route would impact a greater amount of developed land than the southern route; potentially, there could be a permanent loss of approximately 9 acres of developed land in the northern route and approximately 2 acres in the southern route (see Table 3.10-4). However, most of this is open land associated with rural development (e.g., farm-relatedproperties). Since the Alliance proposes to locate the pipeline at least 150 feet from the nearest residences, and the land would revert back to its original use, it is unlikelythat residential land or residential structures would be directly impacted; therefore, impacts would be negligible. Potential public safety impacts to residential land use during operations are discussed in Section 3.17, Human Health and Safety. CO2 Storage Study Area Operation of the CO2 injection well site(s) could permanently remove some agricultural land from existing use. Specifically, the CO2 injection wells and supporting facilities for the dual-site scenario, which is no longer under consideration by the Alliance, would occupy approximately 10 acres for the permanent operational footprint of the injection and monitoring wells and associated infrastructure and buildings, and up to 15 acres for access roads to the well sites. The CO2 injection wells and supporting facilities for the single-site scenario currently proposed by the Alliance would occupy approximately 10 acres for the permanent operational footprint of the injection wells and associated infrastructure and buildings, and approximately 4 acres for access roads to the monitoring wells. Arrangements would be made with landowners to reduce the long-term impacts on agricultural land use or other activities around the proposed facilities. To the extent practicable, the Alliance would avoid net reductions in agricultural land. This would include designating land that is currently not farmed for use as agricultural land to replace acreages of land that would be removed from agricultural use because of the project. Land potentially placed into new agricultural use would be in the immediate vicinity of land taken out of agricultural use. Potential impacts to prime farmland are discussed in Section 3.3, Physiography and Soils, and Appendix H, Agricultural Mitigation. The CO2 storage study area includes predominantly agricultural land but also includes areas of vegetated land that could be permanently lostif it were used for the CO2 injection and monitoring wells, related facilities, and roads. The footprint for the proposed injection well site (single-site scenario) would impact approximately 14 acres whichprimarilyconsistsof agricultural land, thus creatinglong-term, minor impacts. Immediately adjacent land surrounding the CO2 injection well site would remain unchanged and current uses would continue. For instance, agricultural activities would continue up to the fence line of the CO2 injection well site; therefore, no impacts to land use adjacent to the proposed facilities would occur. The 14-acre area required for the CO2 injection and monitoring wells and associated facilities for the single-site scenario would be owned by the Alliance, which would include the surface and deep subsurface mineral rights. Because the Alliance would own the surface and deep subsurface mineral rights of the CO2 injection well site, it is unlikely that future drilling of wells for water, oil, or gas would occur in theoperational area. Given the small area involved, this would be a negligible impact. Additionally, the Alliance would own the deep pore space (about 4,000 feet underground) for the CO2 plume radius (approximately 4,000 acres), which would be contained within the 6,800-acre CO2 storage study area. As discussed in Section 3.4, Geology, the Alliance identified a preliminary 25-square mile survey area centered on the proposed injection site. The AoR contains a variety of existing wells, including oil and gas wells, shallow water wells, and a few deep wells (three wells at 1,000 feet bgs); however, since gas, oil, and water are relatively close to the surface (e.g., groundwater at approximately 200 feet), drilling for those resources would not be precluded by the presence of CO2 stored in the Mt. Simon Formation within the CO2 storage study area. Therefore, the mineral rights for the adjacent land with respect to the shallow well horizon (i.e., water, oil, and gas) at similar depth to existing wells in the area wouldnot be impacted. Since no zoning plans or ordinances exist in unincorporated Morgan County, there would be no impacts to zoning. Land use adjacent to the CO2 injection well site(s) would not change, and would remain in agriculturaluse. Educational Facilities Operation of the educational facilities would have negligible or no impacts on land use, because it is anticipated that these proposed facilities would be located in areas already zoned for these types of uses. As discussed in Section 3.10.3.1, the Alliance would abide by requirements of the Jacksonville Zoning Ordinance and Comprehensive Plan. Refer, also, to Sections 2.5.3 and 3.0 for additional discussions of the educational facilitiessitingefforts. 3.10.4 Impacts of the No Action Alternative Under the no action alternative, DOE would not provide cost-shared funding for the proposed FutureGen 2.0 Project. Although the Alliance may still elect to construct and operate the project in the absence of DOE cost-shared funding, for the purposes of the analysis in this EIS, DOE assumed the no action alternative is equivalent to the no-build alternative. Therefore, the project would not be constructed and there would be no change to existinglanduse. 3.11 AESTHETICS 3.11.1 Introduction This section describes existing aesthetic resources in the area that may be affected by implementation of the FutureGen 2.0 Project and the corresponding direct and indirect impacts that would occur. Aesthetic resources are considered to have inherent natural or man-made scenic properties that give a landscape its character and value as an environmental factor. For the purpose of this analysis, aesthetic resources include scenic areas such as public lands (e.g., national parks or forests), nature preserves, viewsheds (i.e., the land, water, cultural, and other aesthetic elements that are visible from a fixed vantage point), and other resources preserved and managed by federal, state, and local governments. Aesthetic resources can be affected by changes in the visual landscape, increased glares or lighting, elevated noise levels, or other factorsdiminishing the physical value ofthese resources. Existing conditions that may also affect aesthetic qualities are addressed in other chapters of this document, such as Section 3.1, Air Quality; Section 3.9, Cultural Resources; Section 3.10, Land Use; Section 3.13, Traffic and Transportation; and Section 3.14, Noise and Vibration. 3.11.1.1 Region of Influence The ROI for aesthetic resources includes the areas that would be impacted from construction and operation of the Meredosia Energy Center, CO2 pipeline, storage study area, and supporting facilities (i.e., access roads and the educational facilities). Generally, the ROI would extend to the distances from which the project components are visible and would thus impact the viewshed. Because of the relatively flat topography, it is anticipated that the new energy center emissions stack, cooling towers, and associated emissions plumes would be visible from several miles away. For the purposes of this assessment, the ROI for the energy center is defined as a fixed 5-mile radius around the center point of the Meredosia Energy Center (39.8224° North, 90.5643° West). DOE assumed a ROI for the pipeline routes and injection wells to be a 0.5-mile distance from the border of the pipeline ROW and a 1-mile radius from the injection wells. The ROI for the educational facilities is defined generally as the town identifiedfor potential sitingof the facilities,as specific sites have not yet been selected. The oxy-combustion facility would be constructed and operated at the existing, but now suspended, Meredosia Energy Center site co-located with other industrial facilities. The CO2 pipeline and injection well site(s) would be constructed and operated in a rural, primarily flat portion of central Illinois (see Figure 3.11-1). The landscape is predominately row-crop farmland (i.e., corn and soybeans) during the growing season, and barren, fallow fields during the remainder of the year. Additional features within the viewshed include minor streamdrainages characterizedbydense deciduous forest cover andshrubbery,as well as other waterbodies (e.g., ponds, lakes, and rivers). Small towns are located throughout the region, as are scattered single-family homes and agricultural structures (e.g., grain silos). Small portions of the region, specifically within the proposed CO2 pipeline corridor and storage study area, include vistas of varied topography with scattered patches of thickets and forest, and rolling open farmland characterized by visibility ranging from a few feet to many miles in all directions. On the horizon, widely spaced infrastructure is visible, including industrial grain elevators located at rail access points and other groupings of buildings. See Section 3.10, Land Use, for further discussion ofland use in the region. Because of the rural nature of the landscape and associated lack of large urban centers in close proximity, light pollution is minimal throughout the region in which the proposed project would occur. The nighttime views include very widely spaced outdoor lights at farms and more significant light domes associated with small towns within the horizon. Fromsome vantage points along the pipeline corridor and within the storage study area, the light domes of Jacksonville and Springfield are visible over the horizon. DOE is not aware of any currentlight pollutionregulations inthe affectedareas. Figure 3.11-1. Typical Regional Landscape 3.11.1.2 Method of Analysis and Factors Considered Aesthetic resources in the ROI were identified through aerial photography, zoning maps, site visits, and a review of local published resources (i.e., county zoning maps, aerial photography, land use cover maps, county and town comprehensive plans). The evaluation ofpotentialimpacts to aesthetic resources considered whetherthe proposed project would: • Block or degrade a scenic vista or viewshed; • Degrade or diminisha federal,state, or local scenic resource; • Change the area’s visualresources; • Create glare orillumination that would be obtrusive or incompatible with existing land use; or • Create visual intrusions or visual contrasts affecting the quality of alandscape. Specifically, these impacts were considered relative to the proximity of sensitive receptors (e.g., residences). 3.11.1.3 Regulatory Framework 49 CFR 195.210 (“Pipeline Location”) specifies that pipeline ROWs should be sited to avoid, as far as practicable, areas containing private dwellings, industrial buildings, and places of public assembly. In addition, pipelines should not be sited within 50 feet of any private dwelling, industrial building, or place of public assembly in which persons work, congregate, or assemble, unless the pipeline is provided with at least 12 inches of soil cover in addition to that prescribed in 49 CFR 195.248 (“Cover Over Buried Pipeline”). No applicable regulations have been identified that would restrict the height of the proposed project. Regulations regarding the opacity and visibility of emissions are discussed in Section 3.1, Air Quality. Regulations pertainingtonoise are discussed in Section 3.14, Noise andVibration. 3.11.2 Affected Environment 3.11.2.1 Meredosia Energy Center The Meredosia Energy Center is located in an industrial area typical of power plants and consists of aboveground storage tanks, chimney stacks, transmission lines, barge unloading facilities, and various operational buildings. Nearby industrial facilities include the adjoining property to the south of the energy center site, which is developed and occupied by the Celanese Emulsions (National Starch & Chemical) plant and Norfolk & Western Railway. Additional chemical plant facilities, including TA Terminals Inc. and Agrium Inc., lie to the east of the Celanese Emulsions plant, essentially southeast of the Meredosia Energy Center. These facilities utilize similar industrial structures (e.g., aboveground storage tanks). A 526-foot chimney stack at the Meredosia Energy Center is the tallest visible structure within a 5-mile radius of the energy center. Additional structures include two smaller chimney stacks measuring 301 feet and 184 feet in height, components of the oxy-combustion facility buildings ranging in height from 24 to 209 feet, and various transmission towers. Blinking aviation beacon lights on the stack are visible during nighttime hours. Historically, during operations of the energy center, a water vapor plume emanated from the facility and was visible from several miles depending on weather conditions. At the end of 2011, operations at the Meredosia Energy Center were suspended. All major structures remain in place; however, no emissions or vapor plumes emanate from the stacks. In addition, the energy center has a limited staff and traffic and noise are minimal (see Section 3.13, Traffic and Transportation; and Section 3.14, Noise and Vibration, respectively). The area surrounding the Meredosia Energy Center has a landscape similar to the overall region. The village of Meredosia is located directly north of the energy center. The village has a population of approximately 1,044 and is of moderate density. Views of the Meredosia Energy Center from within the village are partially obstructed by existing buildings from certain vantage points. The tallest structures in Meredosia include a grain elevator and the IL-104 Bridge over the Illinois River, which has been determined eligible for listing on the NRHP. Height for the grain elevator is unavailable, but would be equivalent to that of a four story building (Hull 2012a). There are multiple tree lines in the vicinity of the Meredosia Energy Center, many of which block the oxy-combustion facility structures from outside visibility. The Illinois River is located directly west of the Meredosia Energy Center and is used for fishing, boating, canoeing, and other recreational activities (IDNR 2012). Nearby public lands or potentially scenic areas include the Meredosia National Wildlife Refuge located approximately 1 mile north of the energy center, and the Meredosia Hill Prairie Nature Preserve located approximately 5 miles to the northeast. Boyd Park, a small recreationarea,is alsolocatedwithin the village of Meredosia. Figure 3.11-2 depicts the surroundingarea withthe MeredosiaEnergyCenter in the background. 3.11.2.2 CO2 Pipeline The CO2 pipeline corridor would begin in Meredosia and traverse a portion of northern Morgan County. The Alliance originally identified two possible pipeline routes from the Meredosia Energy Center to the injection wells in Morgan County. The two pipeline route options (i.e., the southern and northern route) are located within the 4-mile wide corridor shown in Figure 2-17. The corridor has a similar landscape to the overall region (see Figure 3.11-2) and encompasses the small communities of Concord and Sinclair. Thereare no national parks, state parks, forests, recreation areas, or wildliferefuges within the corridor. 3.11.2.3 CO2 Storage Study Area The CO2 storage study area has a similar agricultural landscape to the overall region. There are no existing communities, national parks, state parks, forests, recreation areas, or wildlife refuges within the proposed area. Figure 3.11-3 depicts a typical viewshed withinthe storage studyarea. 3.11.2.4 Educational Facilities The visitor, research, and training facilities are expected to be located in a city or town near the CO2 storage study area. The Alliance is working with local stakeholders to identify the locations that would best serve the functions of the facilities. The facilities are expected to be located in or near Jacksonville, Illinois, which is the county seat and largest city in Morgan County. Jacksonville has a large historic district with well-preserved architecture, in addition to multiple historic sites listed on the NRHP (see Section 3.9, Cultural Resources). Public parks and potentially scenic areas within Jacksonville include Duncan Park, Central Plaza Park, Barr Park, Kiwanis Park, Foreman Park, Nichols Park, and the Jacksonville Community Park. The Jacksonville Municipal Airport is located approximately 3 miles north of the citycenter. Figure 3.11-2. Surrounding Area with Meredosia Energy Center in Background Figure 3.11-3. Morgan County CO2 Storage Study Area View from North 3.11.3 Impacts of Proposed Action 3.11.3.1 Construction Impacts Meredosia Energy Center During construction, neighboring properties would have a partial or unobstructed view of the construction site and equipment. Figure 2-14 shows the original temporary and permanent impact areas analyzed in the Draft EIS within the Meredosia Energy Center property. Through ongoing modifications in site plans, the Alliance significantly reduced the anticipated area of disturbance. Figure 2-15 shows the updatedtemporary and permanentimpactareas at the MeredosiaEnergy Center. Temporary impact areas are those that would be restored to their original condition to the extent practicable after construction of a project is completed. This restoration could take place in the near term or years after the areas are initially impacted, depending on the nature of the impact. Permanent impact areas are those that would be changed permanently from their prior conditions as needed for oxycombustion facility infrastructure. The barge impact area may have shorter temporary impact durations, withimpacts toaestheticsoccurringonlyduringperiods of barge unloadingactivities. Aesthetic impacts to the estimated 27 residences located directly adjacent to the northeast of the energy center and laydown areas would be greatest, mainly attributable to fugitive dust and noise (see Section 3.1, Air Quality; and Section 3.14, Noise and Vibration) during construction. Sensitive receptors with a direct view of the construction would experience temporary, minor adverse impacts as a result of increased visibility of construction operations. However, the site is in an existing industrial area, and construction of the proposed project would not represent a significant change in current aesthetic conditions or land use (see Section 3.10, Land Use). The majority of residents within the ROI would experience negligible impacts, as views of theMeredosia Energy Center would be obstructed by tree lines and existing structures. Certain tree lines may be temporarily deforested, which would increase visibility of construction activities. To the extent practicable, deforested areas along the site boundary would be reforested following construction; however, it may take considerable time for the vegetation to reach existing density and height (see Section 3.8, Biological Resources, for further discussion on vegetative impacts). Other wooded areas may be permanently deforested,specifically on thesouthern end of the site, whichcouldincrease visibilityof the energycenter to sensitive receptors. An increase in truck traffic would occur during construction, resulting in temporary minor adverse impacts to aesthetics for the residences along the truck routes (see Section 3.13, Traffic and Transportation). The temporary barge unloading facility would be located directly adjacent to and completely visible to an estimated nine residences. During construction, increased visibility of construction activities, noise, and increases in truck and barge traffic would adversely affect the aesthetics of the region (see Section 3.13, Traffic and Transportation; and Section 3.14, Noise and Vibration); however, these impacts would be short term and minor as the barge unloading facility would be decommissioned following the completion of the construction phase. Other nearby public lands or potentially scenic areas would experience negligibleimpacts. CO2 Pipeline Aesthetic impacts from construction activity along the pipeline ROW would be related to increased fugitive dust, truck traffic, and noise (see Section 3.1, Air Quality; Section 3.13, Traffic and Transportation; and Section 3.14, Noise and Vibration, respectively). Temporary visual impacts from increased visibility of construction equipment and activity would occur to sensitive receptors located adjacent to the CO2 pipeline route, as this activity would represent a considerable change from primary current agricultural uses. The alternative pipeline routes (i.e., southern and northern) were both sited to maximize the use of existing ROWs. The southern pipeline route was sited to address constructability criteria such as terrain, location criteria such as maintaining a minimum distance from residences and other occupied buildings, and environmental criteria such as avoiding sensitive environmental features. In addition, the southern pipeline route has been sited at a minimum distance of 150 feet from occupied structures to the extent practicable, which is 100 feet further than what is federally mandated under 49 CFR 195.210. It is possible that a distance less than 150 feet would be needed in order to avoid a sensitive environmental resource or at the request of an affected landowner; however, the distance would not be less than the 50 feet required by federal regulations. This would further reduce aesthetic impacts from construction noise and traffic and the visible impact of pipeline construction along the southern route. Overall, minor temporary impacts to adjacent property owners would be anticipated during construction activities. In the early stages of the FutureGen 2.0 Project, the Alliance identified the northern route for initial cost-estimating purposes. Based on subsequent investigations and field work, the Alliance identified the southern route as the proposed pipeline route. In the event that the final pipeline route deviates from the route options discussed in the EIS, the same siting criteria discussed in this section and in Section 2.5.1.1 would beutilized. CO2 Storage Study Area Impacts from construction activity at the injection well site(s) would be related to fugitive dust, truck traffic, and noise(see Section 3.1, Air Quality; Section3.13, Traffic and Transportation; and Section 3.14, Noise and Vibration, respectively). Following publication of the Draft EIS, the Alliance selected a proposed location for the injection well site within the CO2 storage study area, and is currently entering into agreementswith property owners regarding the use of, and appropriate compensation for, surfaceland and subsurface pore space. Construction activities would require construction of surface facilities and land clearing. Once construction is complete, the areas not used for the wells and surface facilities would be regraded and revegetated to the extent practicable, with temporary minor aesthetic impacts to sensitive receptors located near the CO2 injection well site(s). Traffic increases would adversely impact the viewshed with additional vehicles on the roads and associated engine noise; however, the Alliance would install pullouts and provide other upgrades to transportation infrastructure to reduce traffic congestion in the area and thereby reduce the adverse aesthetic impacts along the transportation routes (see Section 3.13, Traffic and Transportation). Drilling of the injection wells would occur 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. DOE assumes the injection wells would have noise mitigation measures similar to those used at the stratigraphic well, which is currently surrounded by an earthen berm that mitigates the visual impacts and noise permeation (see Section 3.14, Noise and Vibration). The drill rig operation would be illuminated by bright lights 24 hours per day. Typical nighttime construction is depicted in Figure 2-28. Use of earthen berms and other lighting BMPs would reduce the amount of direct light visible to the nearest residence; however, it is likely that a small light dome would be visible to those residences closest to the injection well site(s), resultingintemporarymoderateimpacts to these receptors. In addition to the injection wells, the Alliance expects to construct monitoring wells for the MVA program (see Section 2.5.2.2). Related aesthetic impacts would be similar to those described for the construction of the injection wells. If electrical poles are required to bring electricity to the injection and monitoring well sites (seeSection 3.15, Utilities), aesthetic impacts would occur during construction activities from equipment and noise. The Alliance would place the poles along existing or new access roads to the extent practicable. The overall construction impacts to aesthetic resources at the injection well site(s) property would be temporary and moderate; however, the property is isolated from sensitive receptors such that these impacts would be mitigateddue todistance. Educational Facilities The educational facilities would be located in or near Jacksonville. The site or sites for the educational facilities would be in areas that have been previously disturbed. The project may involve new construction, rehabilitation of existing structures, or a combination of both activities. Impacts from construction activity would be related to fugitive dust, truck traffic, and construction noise (seeSection 3.1, Air Quality; Section 3.13, Traffic and Transportation; and Section 3.14, Noise and Vibration, respectively). Although a specific site has not been selected, it is assumed that temporary visual impacts would occur to sensitive receptors located adjacent to the educational facilities as a result of increased visibility of construction operations. As Jacksonville contains a number of cultural resources, including a historic district (see Section 3.9, Cultural Resources), any new construction would be coordinated with the local government to best incorporate building design within the existing features of the city. In addition, oncethe locations are selected,and prior to construction, steps described in the Programmatic Agreement would be undertaken to assess and resolve adverse effects on historic properties, if necessary. Impacts from the construction of the educational facilities would be temporary and minor. As described in Sections 2.5.3 and 3.0, since the release of the Draft EIS, discussions between the Alliance and Jacksonville civic authorities have recently focused on a potential site in Jacksonville, but the specific locations of the educationalfacilities currently remain undecided. 3.11.3.2 Operational Impacts Meredosia Energy Center Long-term direct effects to existing viewsheds would occur from the introduction of new industrial structures at the Meredosia Energy Center. New features to the viewshed would include a stack no taller than 450 feet, a 180-foot oxy-combustion boiler building, and various other structures ranging in height from 58 feet to 139 feet. The existing onsite transmission towers would be demolished; in addition, four new towers of comparable height would be constructed to re-route the existing transmission lines. While some of these structures would be visible within a 5-mile radius, existing structures at the energy center exceed the height of the proposed tallest structures (i.e., the existing 526-foot stack). Moreover, the new structures would be consistent with the current infrastructure at the energy center. Large structures are also located within the village of Meredosia (e.g., grain elevator). Overall, the introduction of new structures to the viewshed would not considerably alter existing aesthetic conditions. The new stack and cooling towers would emit plume clouds that could be visible (potentially beyond the ROI) depending on weather conditions. The stack would have aviation beacon lighting, including two levels of three medium intensity strobe lights that would be visible at night. The lighting would not result in significant adverse impacts from light pollution, even when combined with the existing lighting infrastructure on the 526-foot stack. Operational truck traffic would increase due to increased hauling of feedstock (mainly coal and limestone) and wastes (mainly fly ash and bottom ash); however, truck traffic would be routed to avoid the village of Meredosia and most sensitive receptors. This would result in minor aesthetic impacts to nearbyresidences alongthetruckroutes (see Section3.13, Traffic and Transportation). CO2 Pipeline The CO2 pipeline would be located underground and thus not visible from the surface; however, the 50-foot wide operational ROW would be permanently maintained free of woody vegetation to preserve access for inspection and maintenance activities; agricultural crops could continue to be grown within the pipeline ROW in agricultural areas. The areas outside the operational ROW, but that were disturbed as part of the 80-to 100-foot wide construction ROWs, would be replanted after construction to reestablish pre-existing conditions to the extent practicable. It would take time for these plants to grow to their prior heights and densities, particularly in forested areas (see Section 3.8, Biological Resources, for further discussion on the vegetative impacts in the ROWs). Removal and disposal of trees and brush would be consistent with the IDOA Agricultural Impact Mitigation Agreement, including consultation with the landownerto determine whether there are trees of value to the landowner that should beretained. Along the operational ROW, there would be aboveground pipeline-related structures visible to receptors in close proximity. These structures would include meter stations, launchers and receivers (i.e., the start and end of the pipeline), pipeline markers at all crossings, mainline block valve shelters, cathodic protection station markers, and temporary zinc anode site markers (see Section 2.5.1.2 for further discussion of these structures). These structures would be close to the ground and thus not expected to significantlyaltertheviewshed ofanysensitive receptors. As discussed in Section 3.11.3.1, pipeline routes have been sited to avoid major population areas, cultural resources, and public lands, and would utilize existing clearings and highway ROWs to the extent practicable. The pipeline would be located approximately 150 feet from residences (rather than the minimum 50-foot distance required under 49 CFR 195) to the extent practicable. This would reduce aesthetic impacts maintenance activities or other visible impacts of pipeline operations. Overall impacts from operation ofthe CO2 pipeline would be minor. CO2 Storage Study Area The CO2 injection well site(s) would consist of surface facilities (e.g., the site control and maintenance building) and the injectionand monitoring wells. These structures would not exceed one story and would be designed with surface components to blend in with the surrounding area. Yard lighting would be provided by 158-watt LED fixtures equipped with motion sensors; light fixtures would be selected to minimize offsite glare and illumination. Lighting would be mounted on 25-foot poles that would be hinged to permit the fixtures to be lowered for maintenance. Six-foot high fencing would be installed around the injection well site(s). Depending on the monitoring layout and site requirements, fencing would also enclose some monitoring sites (see Section 2.5.2.2). The Alliance would also seek local landowner viewpoints on the final exterior design of surface facilities. The Alliance intends to incorporate low-height vegetatedberms intheirlandscapingtolessenthe visual impact of the facilities. In the original scenario analyzed in the Draft EIS, if electrical poles are required to bring electricity to the well sites (see Section, 3.15 Utilities), the Alliance would place the poles along existing or new access roads, to the extent practicable. Under this scenario, less than 1 mile of new line would be constructed. For low voltage rural lines, pole spacing of 320 feet can be assumed. With 320-foot pole spacing, approximately 17 wooden single poles would be placed. Since completion of the Draft EIS, the Alliance updated its design and if needed, new poles and wires would be placed along Martin Road from Negus Road to the site, a distance of one mile. Assuming 300-foot pole spacing for a three-phase line, approximately 18 wooden single poles would be placed along the road. Pole height has not been determined; however, poles would be permanently visible from a short distance and would thus impact the viewshed for nearby sensitive receptors. Existing electrical poles are present along most major roadsinthe area andthe placement of new poles would result inminorimpacts tothe viewshed. Impacts at the injection well site(s) from traffic and noise would be negligible to minor (refer to Section 3.13, Traffic and Transportation; and Section 3.14, Noise and Vibration). Overall, aesthetic impacts from operations of the injection wells would be minor. Impacts related to aesthetics resulting from operation ofthe monitoring wells would be similar to those discussed for theinjection wells. Educational Facilities The educational facilities would be located in or near Jacksonville. The Alliance originally assumed that the visitor center and research functions would be housed in a separate building from the training function. Since the completion of the Draft EIS, the Alliance modified its plans such that the current conceptual design assumes that the visitor, research, and training facilities would potentially be housed in a single building, rather than two separate buildings. Specific locations for these facilities have not yet been determined; however, it is expected that they would be located in existing buildings or occupy areas that have been previously disturbed. If the facilities were sited within existingstructures, impactsto aesthetics would be negligible.If the Alliance constructs new buildings, the facilities would be one story and not significantly impact existing viewsheds. Increased traffic would occuras a result of patrons visitingthe centers (see Section 3.13, Traffic and Transportation), whereby the impacts from traffic would depend on the pre-existing conditions of the chosen sites, though they are not anticipated to be any greater than negligible. Refer, also, to Sections 2.5.3 and 3.0 for additional discussions of theeducationalfacilities sitingefforts. 3.11.4 Impacts of the No Action Alternative Under the no action alternative, DOE would not provide cost-shared funding for the FutureGen 2.0 Project. Although the Alliance may still elect to construct and operate the project in the absence of DOE cost-shared funding, for the purposes of the analysis in this EIS, DOE assumed the no action alternative is equivalent to the no-build alternative. Therefore, the project would not be constructed and land use would remain consistent with its current conditions, existing vistas and viewsheds would be preserved, and the aesthetic qualities of the ROIwould remainastheyare. INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK 3.12 MATERIALS AND WASTE MANAGEMENT 3.12.1 Introduction This section describes the materials and wastes historically associated with the Meredosia Energy Center prior to suspension of operations at the end of 2011. The section also presents potential direct and indirect impacts related to the materials that would be consumed and wastes that would be generated during the construction and operationof the proposed project. 3.12.1.1 Region of Influence The ROI includes waste management facilities; industries that could use the FutureGen 2.0 Project byproducts; and the suppliers of construction materials, coal, fuel oil, and process chemicals used in the construction and operation of the proposed FutureGen 2.0 Project. The extent of the ROI varies by material and waste type. The ROI for construction material suppliers and process chemical suppliers is small (within approximately 50 miles of the Meredosia Energy Center), because these types of resources are widely available and the large volumes of materials needed and wastes generated are costly to transport over large distances. Municipal landfills with adequate available capacity are present in Illinois within a distance of 100 miles from the energy center; therefore, the ROI for the disposal of nonhazardous waste is 100 miles. Treatment and disposal facilities for hazardous wastes are less common; hence, the associated ROI includes a multi-state (Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, and Michigan) area extending 100 to 400 miles from the Meredosia Energy Center. The ROI for coal includes the states of Illinoisand Wyoming (theproposed suppliersforcoalto operatethe oxy-combustion facility). 3.12.1.2 Method of Analysis and Factors Considered DOE evaluated impacts by comparing the demands posed by construction and operation of facilities for the FutureGen 2.0 Project to the capacities of material suppliers and waste management facilities within the ROI. The analysis also addressed regional demand and access to markets for fly ash and bottom ash. DOE assessed the potentialforimpacts based on whether the proposed FutureGen 2.0 Project would: • Cause new sources of construction materials and operational supplies to be developed, such as new mining areas, processing plants, orfabrication plants; • Affectthe capacityof existing materialsuppliers and industries in the region; • Create wastesfor which there are nocommerciallyavailable disposal or treatment technologies; • Create the need for a hazardous wastetreatment, storage, or disposal permit for the project; • Affectthe capacityof waste collection services andtreatment, storage,anddisposal facilities; • Create reasonably foreseeable conditions that would increase the risk of a hazardous waste release; or • Create reasonably foreseeable conditions that would increase the risk of a hazardous material release. The specific quantities of materials and wastes that would be generated from the construction and operation of the energy center has been estimated based on preliminary design data for the FutureGen 2.0 Project. The impact analysis in this section uses the maximum estimated value for the materials required andwaste generated bythe project. 3.12.1.3 Regulatory Framework The handling and storage of raw materials and the management of solid (non-hazardous) and hazardous wastes in Illinois are regulated by the IEPA (35 IAC) and by the USEPA (RCRA regulations in 40 CFR). There are several in-state and out-of-state facilities that provide for the storage, treatment, recycling, and transportation of solidandhazardous waste that would be available to the FutureGen 2.0 Project. The primary raw materials used at coal power plants are coal, water, wastewater treatment chemicals, natural gas, and backup fuel sources (e.g., fuel oil). Wastes generated at coal power plants primarily consist of coal combustion residuals. These residuals include: • Fly ash, consisting of fine particles that are collected by the electrostatic precipitators or filter fabric baghousesfromflue gasses prior to exitto the atmosphere; • Bottomash, or coarse particlesthat fall bygravitytothebottomof theboiler; and • Boiler slag, which is molten bottom ash that when quenched with water forms uniform-sized pellets. Coal combustion residuals are among the largest waste streams generated in the United States. According to the American Coal Ash Association's Coal Combustion Product Production & Use Survey Report, more than 136 million tons of these residuals were generated in 2008 (USEPA 2011n). Some coal combustion residuals are beneficially reused (e.g., fly and bottom ash are used in concrete production); however, when reuse is not feasible these residuals are typically placed in permitted ponds or landfills. Coal combustion residuals typically contain a broad range of metals, including arsenic, selenium, and cadmium; however, the leach test levels rarely reach the RCRA hazardous waste characteristic levels (USEPA 2011n). Coal combustion residuals are not currently regulated as RCRA hazardous waste under an amendment to RCRA.  Federal regulations governing the disposal of coal combustion residuals may become more stringent in the future. On June 21, 2010, USEPA proposed to regulate coal combustion residuals to address the risks from the disposal of the wastes generated by electric utilities and independent power producers. Under this proposal, USEPA is considering two possible options for the management of coal combustion residuals. Under the first option, USEPA would list these residuals as special wastes subject to regulation under subtitle C of RCRA, when destined for disposal in landfills or surface impoundments. For the second option, USEPA would regulate coal combustion residuals under subtitle D of RCRA, the section for non-hazardous wastes. USEPA has not issued a final ruling at the time this EIS was prepared. USEPA is proposing to retain the exemption from regulation for beneficial uses of coal combustion residuals (e.g., asphalt, cement,concrete). Withinthe state of Illinois,coal combustion residuals are regulatedas non-RCRA special waste unless the generator of these residuals certifies that the waste meets certain requirements to be declassified as a special waste (DOE 2006; IEPA 2012b). Special waste is defined by the IEPA as any potentially infectious medical waste, hazardous waste, pollution control waste, or industrial process waste and is regulated under 35 IAC, Subtitle G. Any non-hazardous industrial process waste or pollution control waste maybe declassifiedif the generator certifies thatthe waste: • Is not hazardous; • Is not a liquid; • Is not regulated asbestos-containing materialas defined in 40 CFR 61.141; • Does not contain PCBs regulated in accordance with 40 CFR 761; • Is not formerlyhazardous waste rendered non-hazardous; and • Does not result fromshreddingrecyclable metals; Declassified special waste coal combustion residuals can be disposed of in any permitted commercial solid waste landfill in the state. Coal combustion residuals may also be disposed of in onsite, captive landfills or surface impoundments. Captive disposal facilities do not need permits, but they must meet design standardsforlandfills and theycan only receive coal combustion residualwaste that was generated onsite. Pollution control waste (e.g., dust collected from baghouses on air emissions control equipment) and wastewater are other wastes typically generated in large quantities at power plants. In Illinois, pollution control waste is regulated as a special waste. As discussed above, a special waste that has been declassified can be disposed of in a municipal landfill; otherwise, it must be disposed of in landfills permitted to receive special waste. Wastewater at power plants is typically treated onsite and discharged under a state-regulated wastewater discharge permit (see Section 3.6, Surface Water). Typical hazardous waste generated at coal power plants is generally limited to spent cleaners and solvents from maintenance and unused or spent wastewatertreatment chemicals. 3.12.2 Affected Environment Solid (Non-hazardous) Waste Landfills As of 2011, Illinois had 40 active landfills (IEPA 2012c). The Illinois Nonhazardous Solid Waste Management and Landfill CapacityReport (IEPA 2012c), organizes these landfills into seven regions and provides the locations and life expectancies of each landfill. Table 3.12-1 lists the landfills within a 100mile radius of the Meredosia Energy Center and their remaining disposal capacities. In addition to these and other landfills located in Illinois, there are available landfills in adjoining states. However, out-ofstate landfills are not expectedtobe utilized based onthe available in-state capacity. Illinois landfills within a 100-mile radius of the Meredosia Energy Center are located in Illinois Regions Three, Four, Five, and Six (IEPA 2012c). Region Three includes the Peoria and Quad Cities area and is a 14-county region that includes landfills located in counties north of the Meredosia Energy Center. Region Three landfills within the ROI have an estimated combined remaining capacity of 62.6 million cubic yards. Region Four includes 19 counties to the east of the Meredosia Energy Center. Three landfills in this region are within the ROI, with an estimated capacity of 49.7 million cubic yards. Region Five is a 17-county region that includes Morgan County and has four active landfills, all within the project ROI. There are no landfills in Morgan County; the closest landfill to the Meredosia Energy Center is the Hickory Ridge Landfill located approximately 20 miles west of the Meredosia Energy Center. Region Five landfills have approximately 36.1 million cubic yards of remaining capacity. Finally, Region Six consists of nine counties to the south of the Meredosia Energy Center. Two landfills in this region are within the ROI, with an estimated capacity of 30.8 million cubic yards. Hazardous Waste Treatment, Storage, Disposal and Recycling Facilities Hazardous waste generated in Illinois may be managed both at the site of generation and at commercial facilities located within and outside of the state (IEPA 2011e). The FutureGen 2.0 Project would utilize one or more offsite facilities forhazardous waste management; onsite treatment ofhazardous waste would not take place. There are several in-state options for storage, treatment, recycling, incinerating, processing, and transporting hazardous waste. The vast majority of in-state hazardous waste management consists oftreatment and recycling (IEPA 2011e). Within Illinois, there are a total of 18hazardous waste treatment, storage, disposal, and recyclingfacilities (ENVCAP 2011). Within the states immediately bordering Illinois (Iowa, Wisconsin, Missouri, Kentucky, and Indiana) there are 45 additional hazardous waste treatment, storage, disposal, and recyclingfacilities (ENVCAP2011). Table 3.12-1.

As of June 1, 2011, an affidavit for certification of completion of closure (Log 2011-250) has been submitted to IEPA for review. Once approved, the permitted landfill capacitywill be zero. Asof Dec. 31, 2011, the affidavitwas under review. IEPA = Illinois Environmental Protection Agency 3.12.2.1 Meredosia Energy Center A review of various regulatory databases indicates that the Meredosia Energy Center property is not associated with voluntary cleanup for leaking underground storage tanks. There are no known Superfund sites within a 50-mileradiusoftheproperty(USEPA 2012f). The Meredosia Energy Center is regulated under RCRA for activities associated with the handling, storage, and disposal of hazardous and solid waste. The facility is regulated as a small-quantity generator of hazardous waste, meaningthe facility may generate more than 220 pounds, but less than 2,200 pounds, of hazardous waste per month. The Meredosia Energy Center has numerous aboveground storage tanks, warehouse buildings, and storage areas. In addition, the energy center maintains two ponds historically used for the disposal of fly ash and bottom ash generated onsite prior to the suspension of operations at the end of 2011. A description of the main process-related raw materials used for current operations is provided below. Process-Related Materials The primary process-related materials historically used (prior to the suspension of operations at the end of 2011) include IL No. 6 and Powder River Basin coal, fuel oil, natural gas, and process water treatment chemicals. The storage and use of each of these materials is discussed below. Table 3.12-2 lists the historical quantities ofcoaland fuel oil delivered to the energy center each year. Table 3.12-2.

IL= Illinois; PRB = Powder River Basin; tpy = tonsper year Coal Supply. Historically, the Meredosia Energy Center used sub-bituminous coal from the Powder River Basinin Wyoming and bituminous coalfrom Illinois(Illinois No. 6 coal) to fuel Unit 3(Boiler 5). Units 1 and 2 (Boilers 1 through 4) were typically supplied with Illinois No. 6 coal; operation of these units is currently suspended, though they could be reactivated in the future. The typical burn rate of Boilers 1 through 4 of bituminous coal was approximately 180 tons per hour at full load. The burn rate for Unit 3 (Boiler 5) was approximately 108 tons per hour of bituminous coal or 125 tons per hour of Powder River Basincoal. Coal was deliveredbybarge and truck, andstored in onsite storage piles. Fuel Oil and Natural Gas. Boiler 6 operated on fuel oil that was stored in two 4.6 million-gallon aboveground storage tanks. Distillate fuel oil was used as auxiliary fuel for Boilers 1 through 6, to power onsite mobile power equipment (scraper dozers, etc.) and to operate stationary equipment. Distillate fuel was stored in eight 14,000-gallon aboveground storage tanks. Natural gas was provided via an underground pipeline (see Section 3.15, Utilities) and used for warmup and ignition of Boiler 6 and to fuel a smallboiler to heat the molten sulfur tank when steam was not available from the main boilers. Process Water Treatment Chemicals. The process chemicals used by the energy center, prior to the suspension of operations at the end of 2011, were common water treatment and conditioning chemicals that are widely used in industry. Sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide were used to regenerate the ion exchange resin in the demineralizer, where deep well water was treated for use as boiler makeup water. Sulfuric acid was also used to control pH in the fly ash pond effluent. Sulfuric acid was stored in a 10,000-gallon aboveground storage tank; sodium hydroxide was stored in a 22,600-gallon aboveground storage tank and in a 10,000-gallon day tank. Boiler 6 utilized hydrazine and ammonium hydroxide for all-volatile treatment of boiler feed water, whereas Units 1, 2, and 3 utilized hydrazine and phosphate treatment. Hydrazine and ammonium hydroxide used in the boiler treatment chemical feed program were stored in aboveground storage tanks or smaller containers (e.g., 55-gallon drums). Disodium phosphate and trisodium phosphate were stored dry in bags or covered plastic barrels at the location of final use. Since the energy center suspended operations, no water treatment and conditioning chemicals have been delivered to the energycenter. Process-Related Waste Fly Ash and Bottom Ash. The main process-related wastes historically generated at the Meredosia Energy Center were fly ash and bottom ash. Table 3.12-3 shows the annual generation of coal combustion residuals atthe Meredosia EnergyCenter. Table 3.12-3. Historical Coal Combustion Residuals Generation CCR =coal combustion residuals; tpy = tonsper year Fly ash and bottom ash generated at the Meredosia Energy Center were historically disposed of in two onsite ash ponds (note that any ash generated in the future from operation of the proposed oxycombustion facility would not be disposed of in these ponds). The fly ash pond was commissioned in 1968, is 34 acres in area, and has a total storage capacity of 620 acre-feet. The bottom ash pond was commissioned in 1972, is 11 acres in area, and has a total storage capacity of 186 acre-feet. There has been one incident within the past 10 years, which occurred in 2006, when water from the fly ash pond was released to the land(less than 500 gallons). In response, the pond was modified and the energy center adopted internal procedures to prevent a recurrence. No other spills or releases from the ash ponds have occurred. The IEPA reports that there are 24 power plants in Illinois with a total of 68 active ash impoundments and 15 inactive ash impoundments that are regulated under Illinois’ NPDES permit program. IEPA identified the Meredosia Energy Center surface impoundments as one of 10 “Priority 1” surface impoundments, for its high potential for aquifer recharge that could have an impact on existing or future potable water uses (IEPA 2011e). Priority 1 facilities were requested to install groundwater monitoring wells, implement a monitoring program, and submit electronic compliance reports to IEPA because a groundwater monitoring system was not already in place at these facilities. According to the IEPA, initial groundwater monitoring results have been submitted and reviewed for Priority 1 facilities (IEPA 2011c). IEPA analyzed groundwater flow direction based on the initial sampling event at the Meredosia Energy Center and determined that groundwater flows towards the river, which would not affect any of the potable water supply wells identified near the ash ponds. IEPA sent a letter to Ameren stating that if elevated levels of contaminants were identified, further investigation and appropriate remedial activities would be required where necessary. It should be noted that the existing ash ponds at the Meredosia Energy Center will remain the responsibilityof Ameren and would not be used for the FutureGen 2.0 Project. Other Hazardous and Solid (Non-Hazardous) Waste. The Meredosia Energy Center used nearby solid waste management facilities for the offsite disposal of its solid waste (other than coal combustion residual waste, which was placed in onsite ponds as discussed above). Hazardous waste was disposed of at an offsite treatment facility. Table 3.12-4 shows historical quantities of hazardous waste generated by the facility. Solid waste typically consisted of sanitary waste, general and bulk trash; scrap metal was also collected and sent to metalrecyclers. Table 3.12-5 shows the approximate annual quantities of solid waste generated bythe facility. Table 3.12-4.

These quantities are calculated assuming that containers were full at the time of each pickup. 3.12.2.2 CO2 Pipeline The region around the proposed pipeline corridor from the Meredosia Energy Center to the CO2 storage study area consists mainly of agricultural land, scattered small communities (i.e., Concord and Sinclair), and the larger city of Jacksonville. There are no known structures or material storage areas located along the proposed CO2 pipeline corridor. Further, there are no known areas of historical or current contamination fromhazardous materials or wastes present along the proposed pipeline corridor. 3.12.2.3 CO2 Storage Study Area There are no material storage areas located at the proposed CO2 storage study area. Further, there are no known areas of historical or current contamination fromhazardous materials or wastes. Since publication of the Draft EIS, the Alliance identified a potential site within the CO2 storage study area for constructing the CO2 injection wells. There is an unoccupied residential structure located within the boundaries of the proposed construction site. The house was built between 1959 and 1963 and, while no studies have been conducted, it is possible that toxic substances such as lead and asbestos may be present due to the age of the structure. In addition, there is a potential for residential heating oil storage tanks to be presenton the property. 3.12.2.4 Educational Facilities The visitor, research, and training facilities are expected to be located in or near Jacksonville, Illinois. The Alliance is working with local stakeholders to identify the locations that would best serve the functions of the facilities. Because the locations of the educational facilities are unknown, DOE cannot characterize the existingenvironment specifically; however, it is likely that the facilities would be located in a semi-urban to urban area. The city of Jacksonville and its vicinity has ample access to material supplies and waste disposal services. As described in Sections 2.5.3 and 3.0, since the release of the Draft EIS, discussions between the Alliance and Jacksonville civic authorities have focused on a potential site in Jacksonville, but the specific locations of the educational facilities currently remain unknown. 3.12.3 Impacts of Proposed Action 3.12.3.1 Construction Impacts Meredosia Energy Center Standard construction materials for the oxy-combustion facility at the Meredosia Energy Center would include structural steel members, steel and other metallic and non-metallic piping and tubing, tanks, valves, concrete, ductwork, insulation, electrical cable, sand, paint, fasteners, mechanical and electrical fittings, adhesives, and lumber for the proposed facilities and temporary structures (e.g., fencing and scaffolding). Components of the facilities would also include lighting fixtures, small electrical generators, transformers, and other miscellaneous electrical equipment. These materials are typical construction-related materials and would be available from local suppliers within the region. It is expected that the materials needed would be readily available, and the quantities required for construction at the energy center would not result in any adverse impacts on regional supplies. There would be larger electrical components and specialty materials needed for the project that would likely be obtained from national or international suppliers. Waste from construction at the energy center and supporting infrastructure would include demolition materials from the removal of existing structures, excess materials, and miscellaneous materials such as pallets, crates, and other packing materials. Demolition materials would be segregated by materials that can be reused or recycled (e.g., scrap metal) from waste materials that would be disposed of in offsite demolition waste landfills. Regulated wastes such as asbestos or lead-based paint, if generated during construction activities, would be managed and disposed of in accordance with applicable regulations. Excess supplies of new materials would be returned to vendors or be retained for future use. Surplus paint, partial spools of electrical cable, and similar leftover materials would also be retained for possible future use in maintenance, repairs, and modifications. Scrap metal would be sold to scrap dealers. Packaging material (e.g., wooden pallets and crates), support cradles used for shipping large vessels and heavy components, and cardboard and plastic packaging would be collected in dumpsters and periodically transported offsite for recycling or disposal. Organic debris (e.g., dirt, brush) would be generated from clearing and grading, although the majority of the area is free of vegetation. Organic debris would be used as fill on thesite when feasible or disposed of at an offsitefacility. Construction equipment would include cranes, forklifts, air compressors, welding machines, trucks, and trailers. Operation of heavy equipment would require fuel, oils, lubricants, and coolants. These materials may be stored onsite in aboveground storage tanks, 55-gallon drums, or smaller containers. Vehicle maintenance could be contracted either onsite or offsite. All liquid hazardous material storage would be equipped with secondary containment to prevent a release of these liquids to the environment. Should any of these liquids require disposal, they would be appropriately managed in accordance with Illinois and federal regulationsby the construction contractor. The available solid waste disposal capacity in the region is summarized in Table 3.12-1. Because the quantity of waste from construction of the oxy-combustion facility at the Meredosia Energy Center would be small in comparison to the landfill capacity and waste quantities routinely handled, the impact to waste collection and disposal services within the ROI would be negligible. CO2 Pipeline During the construction of the CO2 pipeline, removal and disposal of trees, brush, etc. would be consistent with the IDOA Impact Mitigation Agreement (see Appendix H, Agricultural Mitigation), including consultation with landowners to determine whether there are trees of commercial or other value to the landowner that should be retained. Construction-related debris would be used as fill along the pipeline whenever feasible and allowed by state regulation; other construction waste would be removed and disposed of atan offsite facility. Additional raw materials (e.g., pipeline materials, fuel for equipment) would be required for pipeline construction. The quantities and types of materials required for the project are expected to be readily availablewithintheregion and nationally. CO2 Storage Study Area As described in the Draft EIS, the Alliance evaluated several different injectionwell configurations, using both horizontal and vertical wells at one or two sites, and selectedthe single-site scenariowith four horizontal injection wells as the proposed option. However, DOE considered and analyzed both scenarios (i.e., single-site and dual-site) in the Draft EIS, to develop a reasonable upper bound for impacts with respect to materials and waste. The dual-site scenario is no longer under consideration by the Alliance; in addition, since publication of the Draft EIS, the Alliance updated and refined the proposed design for the injection wells and surface facilities (see Sections 2.5.2.2 and 2.5.2.3 for a discussion of these changes as well as the current design). However, it is not expected that these changes would have a significant effect on materials use or waste generation from construction of the injection wells and surface facilities. Therefore, DOE believes that the analysis of impactspresented inthe Draft EIS is still valid and has retained it for the Final EIS. Construction materials for the surface facilities would consist primarily of structural steel beams and steel piping, tanks, valves, sand, paint, and lumber for the proposed facilities and temporary structures (e.g., fencing and scaffolding). Other materials needed would include concrete, ductwork, insulation, electrical cable, lighting fixtures, generators, and transformers. These materials are typical construction-related materialsandwouldbeavailablefromlocal supplierswithin the region. Other components to be constructed at the CO2 injection well site(s) would be the injection wells, monitoring wells, any piping associated with the wells, and access roads. The materials needed for well components would include piping and concrete for seaming. The construction of the pipeline would require metal, as well as joining and welding materials including compressed gases. Construction of the injection wells would require materials to operate and maintain construction equipment, including engine oil, hydraulic oil, diesel fuel, gasoline, antifreeze, and drilling fluids. Fuel would be stored in aboveground storage tanks equipped with secondary containment. Double-wall tanks would be preferred, but lined dikes with a capacity of 1.5 times the volume of the storage tank(s) could also be used. Sources for these construction materials are well established both regionally and nationally, and the quantities of materials required to construct the pipeline would have a negligible impact on the supply and demand for these materials. Wastes generated during well construction would include drill cuttings, drilling fluid, and fluid removed from subsurface formations. It is anticipated that up to approximately 1,100 cubic yards of drill cutting waste would be generated. These wastes would be transported offsite by a licensed waste hauler for treatment anddisposal at permittedfacilities. All construction materials would be ordered in the correct sizes and quantities, resulting in small amounts of excess material that could be saved for future use and very small amounts of waste to be disposed in a permitted landfill. Heavy equipment would be used that requires fuel, oils, lubricants, and coolants. Should any of these hazardous materials require disposal, they would likely be regulated as special waste or hazardous waste and would be appropriately managed (e.g., recycled or treatedand disposed of offsite) by the construction contractor. Precautions would be taken to minimize the potential for spills; any releases would be immediately cleaned up. Personnel would be trained and equipped to respond to spills when they occur. There would be no impact to waste collection services or disposal capacity. As previouslydiscussed, there is adequate solid waste disposal capacityinthe region and adequate hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities available within theregion and nationally. The existing residential structure within the proposed injection well site would be demolished prior to starting construction activities. The property would be examined for the presence of hazardous materials prior to demolition and if any hazardous materials are found to bepresent, they would be segregated andmanagedin accordancewith allapplicablelocal, state, andfederalregulations. Educational Facilities The visitor, research, and training facilities would be located in or near Jacksonville, Illinois. Nonhazardous and hazardous or special waste generated from the construction of the educational facilities would be similar tothose described above for the surface facilities at the injection wells. The construction of the educational facilities would generate approximately 82 tons of waste. As discussed earlier, the specific locations of the educational facilities are currently unknown, but they would be located in the Jacksonville area. The site or sites for the educational facilities would be in areas that have adequate access to sources of construction materials and waste disposal facilities. Therefore, impacts to materials availabilityand waste disposal would be negligible. 3.12.3.2 Operational Impacts Meredosia Energy Center Process-Related Materials Similar raw materials as previously used at the Meredosia Energy Center would be required for the FutureGen 2.0 Project, namely coal, fuel oil, natural gas, and water treatment chemicals. Table 3.12-6 provides the estimated quantities of coal, trona, and hydrated lime that would be used. These values have been updated to reflect the most current design, which involves slightly increased quantities of process-related materials. DOE has revisited the impact analysis presented in the Draft EIS and concluded that the impacts remainconsistentwiththose reported inthe Draft EIS. Table 3.12-6. Estimated Process Material Requirements for the Oxy-Combustion Facility Sub-bituminous Coal (Powder River Basin) 816 297,840 (40 percent) Hydrated Lime 186.9 68,219 Trona 8.9 3,241 a. Estimated values in this table have been updated to reflect project design changes since publication of the Draft EIS. IL = Illinois; tpd = tonsper day; tpy = tonsper year Coal Supply. Coal would be delivered to the Meredosia Energy Center site by barge or truck and would be stored in the existing coal pile, which has the capacity to handle coal for the proposed FutureGen 2.0 Project. Table 3.12-6 lists the quantities and types of coal that the oxy-combustion facility would use. The quantities required would be lower than the amounts historically used by the Ameren facility, and would have a negligible impact on national supplies of coal. Hydrated Lime and Trona. The estimated consumption of hydrated lime and trona is presented in Table 3.12-6. Hydrated lime and trona would be delivered to the energy center by truck and stored onsite. The required quantities of these materials would have a negligible effect on supply, compared to regional and national availability. Fuel Oil and Natural Gas. The estimated consumption of natural gas is not known. The estimated consumption of fuel oil by stationary sources would be up to 877,000 gallons per year, depending upon the number of warm and cold startups the system may experience. Fuel oil would be stored in aboveground storage tanks, while a natural gas pipeline already serves the Meredosia Energy Center (see Section 3.15, Utilities). Fuel oil and natural gas are commonly used in industrial facilities and are widely available fromsuppliers. Water and Wastewater Treatment Chemicals. The estimated consumption of process chemicals by the oxy-combustion facility is not presently known. Water treatment chemicals expected to be used are commonly used in industrial facilities and are widely available from national suppliers. The materials needed in the largest quantities would be sulfuric acid, sodium hydroxide, and lime. The polymers, antiscalants, and stabilizers needed for the cooling tower, makeup water, and wastewater systems are not specified atthis time; however, a variety of products are available fromregionalandnationalsuppliers. Process-Related Waste Table 2-6 provides the estimated quantities of fly ash and bottom ash that would be generated from the operation of the oxy-combustion facility, while Table 3.12-7 provides the estimated quantities of other wastes that would be generatedat the MeredosiaEnergyCenter. The primary waste stream anticipated from the operation of the oxy-combustion facility would consist of fly ash and bottom ash. The facility would generate in excess of 200,000 tons of fly ash and bottom ash per year. These wastes would be disposed of at an offsite facility; the two onsite ponds that historically accepted fly ash and bottom ash would not be used for disposal offly ash or bottom ash for the FutureGen 2.0 Project. Fly ash and bottom ash would be stored onsite before being transferred into trucks that would transport these wastes to an offsite facility. See Section 2.4.4.2 for further information. Per IEPA regulations, coal combustion residuals (including fly ash and bottom ash) are considered special wastes (see Section 3.12.1.3) and may only be disposed of in landfills permitted to receive special waste. However, generators of special waste may request IEPA to declassify their waste if the waste meets certain criteria; if declassified, the waste can be disposed of in any permitted landfill. Coal combustion residuals are typically eligible for declassification based on the criteria established by IEPA (IEPA 2012b). If declassified, the fly ash and bottom ash generated by the FutureGen 2.0 Project would be disposed of in any available, permitted landfills; otherwise, they would be disposed of in landfills permitted toreceive specialwaste. In addition, the bottom ash and fly ash generated would be beneficially reused whenever possible, to reduce the volumes requiring disposal. If there is not a demand for the ash by-product, disposal of the bottom ash and fly ash at a commercial landfill could potentially shorten the lifespan of landfills selected for the project, due to the large quantity of ash that would be disposed. This could have a minor to moderate negative impact on the availabilityof disposal options for businesses andcommunities. Table 3.12-7.

At the time of this EIS, these rules have not been finalized. If the USEPA finalizes these rules in the future, the FutureGen 2.0 Project would comply with them, as applicable. Per USEPA’s current proposed rule, beneficial use of coal combustion residuals would continueto be exempted from regulation. In addition to the waste previously described, the facility may generate hazardous waste such as solvents and paints from maintenance activities. If operations at the energy center generate enough hazardous waste to meet the threshold for a large quantity generator of hazardous waste as defined by USEPA (greater than 2,200 pounds of hazardous waste generated per month), the facility would be operated in compliance with all requirements applicable to large quantity generators. Hazardous waste would be managed in accordance with federal and state hazardous waste regulations, including providing secondary containment where necessary. All hazardous waste would be transferred offsite to a hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposalfacility. Chemical waste would be generated by periodic cleaning of the steam generator and turbines. This waste would consist of alkaline and acidic cleaning solutions mixed with wash water, and is likely to contain heavy metals. Chemical cleaning would be performed by outside contractors who would be responsible forthe removal of associated waste products fromthe site. Cleaning waste would be characterized prior to disposal and, if determined to be hazardous, would be managed and tracked appropriately; however, based on available information, it is not expected that this waste stream would be considered hazardous waste. Precautions would be taken to prevent releases by providing spill containment for tankers used to store cleaningsolutions andwaste. Other wastes generated would include solids generated by water and wastewater treatment systems, such as activated carbon. Water from the Illinois River would serve as the process water supply for the oxycombustion facility. The water supply would have to be treated to decrease the concentrations of dissolved solids and constituentssuch as sodium and potassium to levels consistent with the process water design parameters for the oxy-combustion facility. Waste generated by the water treatment facility would include sludge and spent filter media that would be transported offsite for disposal in a municipal landfill approved for disposal ofspecial waste. Wastewater from the CO2 compression and purification unit would be pH-adjusted and treated to remove mercury, prior to discharge. Spent mercury polishing media and mercury polishing system backwash would be transferred offsite for disposal. This waste would be characterized prior to disposal and, if determined to be hazardous, would be managed accordingly. Wastewater from other Unit 4 processes would be treated to meet all applicable water quality standards found in 35 IAC 302 (Water Quality Standards) and applicable state and federal effluent limits. Wastewater contaminated with oil would be routed through oil-water separators before being sent to the wastewater treatment systems. Oil-water separator waste (i.e., oily water) would be collected in a storage reservoir integrated into each oil-water separator, and would be pumped out periodically for transport and disposal offsite. It is expected that separator waste would be transferred directlyfromthe separators into a truck and would be removed from the facility on the same day; however, it is possible that the waste may be transferred to an intermediate tank with secondary containment prior to shipment offsite. Such an arrangement, if used, would be described in the SPCC plan along with procedures for preventing spills during transfers. Dewatered sludge from the wastewater treatment systems would be transported offsite for disposal in a municipal specialwaste landfill. DOE estimates that the quantities of general (i.e., municipal) solid waste and hazardous waste generated would be comparable to the historical rates discussed in Section 3.12.2.1. Given the small amount of sanitary and hazardous waste (e.g., paints and solvents) that would be generated and the availability of commercial treatment and disposal facilities, the impact of disposal of generated waste would be negligible. CO2 Pipeline Operation of the CO2 pipeline would require periodic inspections and maintenance activities, including vegetation clearing along the pipeline ROW. Small amounts of organic land clearing debris would be generated as a result of these activities, and would be disposed of in an offsite disposal facility. No other solid or hazardous wasteswould be generated as aresult of pipeline operations. CO2 Storage Study Area As described in the Draft EIS, the Alliance evaluated several different injectionwell configurations, using both horizontal and vertical wells at one or two sites, and selected the single-site scenariowith four horizontal injection wells as the proposed option. However, DOE considered and analyzed both scenarios (i.e., single-site and dual-site) in the Draft EIS to develop a reasonable upper bound for impacts with respect to materials and waste. The dual-site scenario is no longer under consideration by the Alliance; in addition, since publication of the Draft EIS, the Alliance updated and refined the proposed design for the injection wells and surface facilities (see Sections 2.5.2.2 and 2.5.2.3 for a discussion of these changes as well as the current design). However, it is not expected that these changes would have a significant effect on materials use or waste generation from operation of the injection wells and surface facilities. Therefore, DOE believes that the analysis ofimpactspresented inthe Draft EIS is still valid and has retaineditfor the Final EIS. During normal operations at the injection wells, minimal waste would be generated from routine maintenance. The waste could be special or hazardous (e.g., lubricants and oils) and sanitary waste (e.g., packaging and food waste). The expected minimal waste quantities would not impact disposal capacities of area landfills and waste collection services.Diesel fuel used to operate the emergency diesel generator would be stored in an aboveground storage tank; the tank would be equipped with secondary containment to preventspills. Periodic injection well maintenance (or well workover) may result in the generation of wastes such as brine fluids and sand. Acid may be employed to remove scaling, in which case acid and scaling residue would be generated. The rigs used for well workover would also generate wastes including hydraulic fluids, rigwash, spent solvents, and used lubricating oil and filters. The frequency of workover operations would depend on datafrom well monitoring, butexternal mechanical integrity tests are planned at not less than 5-year intervals and workover activity would likely coincide with those activities. Solid waste materials would be transported in dump trucks and would be disposed in permitted landfills. The workover liquid waste would be collected and transported in vacuum tanker trucks and hauled to a wastewater treatment plant. The volume of waste material generated during a well workover would depend on pipe and equipment degradation. While the volume would vary greatly from well to well, it is expected that less than 40 liquid hauling trucks with capacities of up to 3,000 gallons each would be required for liquid wastes, and less than 20, 20-cubic yard roll-offs for solid wastes would be required for each workover. The volume and frequency of well workover waste generation would be low enough that impacts on waste treatment and disposal capacity in the region would be negligible. The updated injection well design would likely result in a smaller amount of waste being generated as a result of injection well maintenance. However, DOE believes that the analysis of impacts presented in the Draft EIS is still valid, and has retained it as a conservative, upper-bound estimate of impacts resultingfrominjection well maintenance activities. The Alliance is reviewinga series of monitoringactivities, which willbe finalizedinthe MVAofthe UIC Class VIpermits. No waste would be generated from monitoringactivities. The surface facilities at the injection wells would contain equipment to supply the well with fluid to maintain annulus pressurization. No chemicals would be required to operate or maintain the well maintenance and monitoringsystem building, and no wastes would be generated. Educational Facilities Operation of the educational facilities would require minor amounts of materials for maintenance, and would result in the generation of primarily sanitary waste and solid waste (e.g., food containers and office trash) along with small amounts of hazardous and special wastes from facility operations and maintenance. Operation of the educational facilities would have negligible impacts to materials and waste management, since there is adequate access to required materials and to sanitary and hazardous waste disposal facilities in the Jacksonville area. 3.12.4 Impacts of the No Action Alternative Under the no action alternative, DOE would not provide cost-shared funding for the FutureGen 2.0 Project. Although the Alliance may still elect to construct and operate the project in the absence of DOE cost-shared funding, for the purposes of the analysis in this EIS, DOE assumed that the no action alternative is equivalent to the no-build alternative. Therefore, the project would not be constructed and there would be no changes to material useand waste generation. 3.13 TRAFFIC AND TRANSPORTATION 3.13.1 Introduction This section describes traffic and transportation systems potentially affected by the construction and operation of the FutureGen 2.0 Project and analyzes the potential direct and indirect effects from this project on these systems. This section discusses the existing roadways and other transportation infrastructure that would be used during construction and operation of the oxy-combustion facility, CO2 pipeline, CO2 injection wells, and educational facilities. This analysis focuses on the potential short-and long-term effects that may occur along existing maintained state and county roadways in the area. Specifically, it analyzes the abilityof existing traffic and transportation infrastructure to meet the needs of the project while continuingto meet the needs of otherusers. 3.13.1.1 Region of Influence The ROI for the transportation analysis consists of the primary roads most likely used for worker commute and delivery of materials. The ROI is easily accessible using different transportation modes, including roadways, rail, aircraft, and watercraft. Because the proposed project would primarily result in changes to roadway traffic, it is the main focus of the transportation resource section. The ROI includes the roadway network within 40 miles of the Meredosia Energy Center, along the pipeline corridor, and adjacent to the CO2 storage study area. Since the proposed oxy-combustion facility, CO2 pipeline, and CO2 injection wells would be the focus of the transportation-based activities (e.g., vehicle traffic), indirect effects outside the ROIwould be less thanthose describedherein. 3.13.1.2 Method of Analysis and Factors Considered Components of the projectthat would impact transportation resources include thenumber of personnel, as well as the volume of trucks transporting materials and wastes, during the construction and operation phases. The impact analysis was limited to major roadway segments leading to the project areas from nearby population centers (e.g., Jacksonville) as these would represent major transportation corridors for workers commuting to the site. The vehicular transport of materials and equipment is also expected to occur mainly on these roadways. DOE analyzed impacts on the roadway network within the ROI based on thefollowing: • Baseline traffic volumes andlevel of service (LOS); • Geographicdistributionoftravel patterns of workers and trucktransport of materials; • No-buildtraffic volumes (i.e., projectedfuture traffic volumes withoutthe project); and • Proposed project traffic volumes (i.e., “Build” scenario or projected future traffic volumes with the project). DOE assessed the potential impacts on transportation resources based on whether the proposed project would: • Substantially increase daily vehicular traffic on key roadway segments and thereby degrading the LOStoexceedtraffic-handlingcapacity; • Substantially increase daily barge traffic on the Illinois River to exceed capacity and interfere with other users; or • Conflict with regional or local transportation improvement plans. The number of vehicles that travel along a route in a 24-hour period is the average daily traffic, which is not adjusted for trucks or seasonal variations. The average annual daily traffic includes adjustments for seasonal, weekly, daily, and hourly variations and is calculated as the number of vehicles traveling along a roadway in a year, divided by 365 days. For this project, the 2011 levels were obtained from IDOT. One-way peak hour volume is the number of vehicles using the primary travel lane during the busiest hour of the day, normally the morning or afternoon rush hour. The Highway Capacity Manual establishes a scale for the LOS of a road or intersection, which consists of six levels. This scale qualitatively measures the operational conditions within a traffic flow and the perception of these conditions by motorists. The six levels are given letter designations ranging from A to F, with “A” representing the best operating conditions (free flow, little delay) and “F” the worst (congestion, long delays). Various factors influence the operation of a roadway or intersection, including speed, delay, travel time, freedom to maneuver, traffic interruptions, comfort, convenience, and safety. LOS designations of A, B, or C are typically considered good operating conditions, in which motorists experience minor or tolerable delays. DOE used the highest average annual daily traffic, and subsequently the highest peak hourly traffic, for theroad segments withinthe corridortoreflect worst-case baseline conditions. DOE reviewed 2011 average annual daily traffic volumes obtained from the IDOT. DOE also estimated the number of vehicle trips generated during the peak construction period (2015) and first full year of operation (2017) based on project information provided by the Alliance and Ameren. This information included the anticipated total number of personnel during construction and operation, the projected truck volumes during construction and operation, and the proposed transport of feedstock and wastes that would occur at the Meredosia Energy Center during operation. Employee and truck traffic from the proposed project was distributed on roadways near the Meredosia Energy Center that would be affected by the FutureGen 2.0 Project. DOE used the volume-to-capacity ratio to determine the LOS of roadway segments in the ROI and to determine the level of effects. DOE assumed that the maximum one-way distance that a worker would drive is 40 miles, and the traffic distributed on roadways based on the population of each destination town. To assess potential effects to the Illinois River, DOE compared the change in daily barge traffic during both construction and operation of the oxy-combustion facility and pipeline to existing conditions. Further, DOE assessed the ability of the existing water-base transportation infrastructure to accommodate the increased barge volume. An adverse effect would be created by any changes to barge traffic that would cause delays, exceed capacity along the waterways inthe region, or affectother waterway traffic in the region. Since road and barges would be the primary modes of transportation, only a cursory review of air, rail, and publictransitresources was performed. 3.13.2 Affected Environment 3.13.2.1 Regional and Local Roadway System The ROI can be accessed from the north and south by I-55 from Chicago to Missouri, and from the east and west by I-70 and I-72 from Indiana to Missouri. The closest interstate is I-72, which is approximately 10 miles south of Meredosia. US-67 is the principal north-south highway serving western Illinois. IL-104 is the main regional route into Meredosia and to the energy center site. From IL-104, Washington Street and Old Naples Road provide direct access to Cips Drive, the main entrance to the Meredosia Energy Center. Historically, trucks accessing the energy center used a bypass road from IL-104 to access the energy center from the south and avoid traveling through residential areas of Meredosia. Other routes in the project area include IL-100, IL-125, IL-99, IL-123, IL-78, and IL-107, many of which cross US-67. Figure 3.13-1 presents a map of the primary roadways within 40 miles of the Meredosia Energy Center. Listed below arethefunctions and classifications of the major routes in the ROI: • US-67. US-67 extends over 200 miles from I-280 at Rock Island to I-270 south of Alton. US-67 is predominately two lanes except from Macomb to Monmouth, and the Alton and Jacksonville Bypasses (IDOT 2002). IDOT is currently going through the process of improving this alignment along its entire length. Many sections of the corridor have been placed on IDOT’s multi-year program with the intent to develop it into a multilane divided highway configuration over most of itslength. In May 2002, IDOT published the Final EIS for this project. • IL-104. IL-104 is a two-lane roadway that connects with US-67 to the east of Meredosia and IL-99 to the west. IL-104 serves as Meredosia's main street through its business district, and crosses the Illinois River at the west end of the town. IDOT conducted an Environmental Assessment on the proposed infrastructure upgrades project from US-67 to IL-99 (Morgan and Pike counties), which includes plans to improve the Meredosia Bridge; in October 2011, IDOT published a Finding of No Significant Impact for its Environmental Assessment of the bridge project (IDOT 2011). • I-72/US-36. I-72 is a four-lane roadway that travels from Indianapolis, Indiana to Kansas City, Missouri. It has served as amajorinterregionaltransportation route since 1919. • IL-100. IL-100 is a two-lane roadway that originates near Alton and travels in a northerly direction to IL-136 near Havana. IL-100 is coterminous with US-67 between Meredosia and Beardstown. • IL-125. IL-125 is atwo-lane roadway thattravels fromBeardstownto Springfield. • IL-99. IL-99 is a two-lane roadway traveling from IL-104 in Meredosia to Brooklyn. The IL-104/IL-99 link between US-67 and US-24 provides a shortcut for regional traffic between Jacksonville/Springfield and Quincy. IL-99 is also an alternateroute to Rushville via US-24. • IL-107. IL-107 is a two-lane roadway that connects Mount Sterling and Griggsville. IL-107 becomes US-54 as it traverses I-72 just north of Pittsfield. • IL-123. IL-123 is a two-lane roadway that connects Ashland to I-72, which runs adjacent to the CO2 storage studyarea. • IL-78. IL-78 is a two-lane roadway that connects Virginia to Jacksonville and transects the pipelinecorridor. IDOT’s proposed Highway Improvement Program lists the roadway improvements scheduled for years 2007-2012. Table 3.13-1 lists proposed improvements within the projectarea byroute. Table 3.13-1.

Primary products transported by rail include grain, granulated fertilizer, and potash (IDOT 2006; IDOT 2002). There are approximately 15 trains traveling along this rail segment each day. As stated in Section 2.4.1.4, the energy center previously had a rail spur for coal delivery, which has been removed. The closest Amtrak station providing passenger service is approximately 50 miles west of Meredosia in Quincy. This station has limited routes with service to Chicago. There is also a Springfield station approximately 60 miles east of Meredosia with several connections, including high-speed rail service from St. Louis, Missouri to Dwight, Illinois(IDOT 2012c). The Jacksonville Municipal Airport is located 18 miles east of the site and has 52 operations per day. The closestinternational airportis Lambert-St. Louis International approximately 70 miles south of the project area with an average of 512 daily operations. Within the project area, there are four smaller public airports and four private airstrips within 20 miles of the MeredosiaEnergyCenter(FAA2012). None of the communities within the study area has a public transit (bus or rail) system. Jacksonville, Pittsfield, and Mount Sterling have bus service for seniors with limited service by appointment (West CentralMass Transit 2012). 3.13.2.3 Meredosia Energy Center Existing Traffic and Level of Service Table 3.13-2 lists the 2011 average annual daily traffic and estimated LOS for the primary roadway segments as presented in Figure 3.13-1, connecting population centers within 40 miles to the Meredosia Energy Center. As indicated by the average annual daily traffic levels, most of the roadways near the Meredosia Energy Center operate with little or no congestion due to the rural characteristic of the region and, consequently, operate within capacity (i.e., LOS C or better). Roadways estimated with LOS ratings of D are primarily roadways that travel through more urban areas, which are subject to higher traffic volumes during peak travel hours. Table 3.13-2 highlights the segments along each roadway with the highest traffic volume during peak periods. These roadways would operate at or better than these LOS on segments withlowertrafficvolumes, and duringtimes other than peak traffic periods. Historically, the majority of trucks accessing the Meredosia Energy Center were used to transport coal and fuel oil. The energy center used both bituminous coal from Illinois sources and Powder River Basin sub-bituminous coal from Wyoming. The bituminous coal was delivered by truck, while the Powder River Basin coal was delivered by barge. Although coal has been exclusively transported via barge over the past few years, prior to 2009 the annual number of trucks used to transport coal varied between 5,000 and 26,000. Approximately 8,000 trucks were used in 2008; the last year coal was delivered by truck. The number of trucks used to deliver fuel oil over the past several years ranged between 15 and 90 trucks per year. An average total of approximately 30 roundtrips per day were generated by the energy center in recent years. Trona and hydrated lime were not historically used at the Meredosia Energy Center. Ash disposal wasconducted onsite and, therefore, did not generate any vehicle trips. Separate barge unloading facilities at the Meredosia Energy Center are located on the Illinois River along the northwestern border of the Meredosia Energy Center site for Powder River Basin coal and for fuel oil deliveries. Historically, Powder River Basin coal was delivered by barge (from St. Louis, Missouri, where it was delivered from Wyoming via rail). Coal deliveries by barge over the past several years ranged from approximately 140 to 500 deliveries per year; annual fuel oil deliveries by barge were sparse, ranging from zero to two over the past several years. Water freight transport is an important part of the transportation system in the project area. The area from Beardstown to Naples on the Illinois River is an agri-business transportation center for west central Illinois. Truck traffic uses US-67 to reach these terminals to transfer shipments (IDOT 2002). 3.13.2.4 CO2 Pipeline and CO2 Storage Study Area Existing Traffic and Level of Service Table 3.13-3 lists primary state roadway segments within the pipeline corridor and adjacent to the CO2 storage study area along with their average annual daily traffic and estimated LOS. As indicated by the average annual daily traffic levels, all roadway segments within the pipeline corridor and adjacent to the CO2 storage study area operate with little or no congestion and within roadway capacity (i.e., LOS A or B). Table 3.13-3 highlights the segments along each roadway with the highest traffic volume during peak periods. These roadways would operate at or better than these LOS on segments with lower traffic volumes, and during times other than peak traffic period. Table 3.13-2.

The Alliance is working with local stakeholders to identify the locations that would best serve the functions of these facilities.Because the locations of the educationalfacilities are unknown, DOE cannot characterize the existing environment specifically; however, roadways around Jacksonville are typical for a semi-urban setting, and are free flowing most of the day with some congestion during peak traffic periods. As described in Sections 2.5.3 and 3.0, since the release of the Draft EIS, discussions between the Alliance and Jacksonville civic authorities have focused on a potential site in Jacksonville, but the specificlocations of the educationalfacilities currentlyremain unknown. LOS = level of service Figure 3.13-1.

Construction would cause temporary and localized congestion, particularly on roadways close to the facility. However, construction would be temporary, and all roadways in the area have the capacity for all traffic associated with the construction of the oxycombustion facility and the pipeline. Additional barge traffic and offloading would have minor adverse effects. All vehicles associated with the transportation of material and equipment to and from the site would comply with IDOT and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) weight and permitting regulations. Most trucks delivering equipment and supplies, including drilling equipment, would be less than 80,000 pounds gross vehicle weight with standard axle spacing; therefore, they would not be considered overweight by criteria outlined in either IDOT or federal regulations (625 ILCS 5 Chapter 15, Article 1; 23 CFR 658.17). However, depending on the exact nature of the delivery, some trucks may require an overweight permit, a non-divisible load permit, or both. Traffic and Level of Service As a reasonable worst-case scenario, DOE assumed that the peak construction year for both the Meredosia Energy Center and the pipeline would coincide in 2015, and all traffic would depart from and return to the Meredosia Energy Center and adjacent areas. Assuming that the construction of the pipeline would overlap with that of the oxy-combustion facility, the total traffic volumes used in the analysis were those from the Meredosia Energy Center and pipeline construction combined. As pipeline construction would move further away from the oxy-combustion facility, the effects would be less than those shown herein. The number of construction and craft workers at the Meredosia Energy Center would range from 450 to 500 during peak construction activities. Construction of the oxy-combustion facility would occur six days per week between 2014 and 2017, and peakconstruction would occur between 2015 and 2016. During the peak of pipeline construction, there would be 300 workers who would generate 270 roundtrips per day assuming a 10 percent carpool rate. Pipeline construction trucks would generate approximately 53 roundtrips per day, which would be distributed throughout the workday. On average, there would be 150 pipeline construction workers who would generate 135 roundtrips per day assuming a 10 percent carpool rate. Table 3.13-4 outlines the number of additional daily vehicles due to construction of the oxycombustion facilityand pipeline combined. Table 3.13-4. Additional Daily Trips from Construction at the Meredosia Energy Center and CO2 Pipeline a. Estimation oftripsduetotheproposed project isbasedonthebest availableinformation. Smallvariationsintheamount oftripsmayoccur throughout the construction and operation of the project components. b. Assumes a carpool rate of 10 percent. CO2 = carbon dioxide; vpd = vehicles per day Table 3.13-5 lists the average annual daily traffic and estimated LOS with the construction traffic from the proposed energy center and pipeline for main roadways connecting to population centers within the ROI. Most roadways within the ROI would operate with little or no congestion (i.e., LOS A though C) during construction. Table 3.13-5 highlights the segments along each roadway with the highest traffic volume during peak periods. These roadways would operate at or better than these LOS on segments with lowertraffic volumes, and during times other than peak traffic periods. The pipeline would extend primarily throughout rural areas where the roadways are free flowing and well below design capacity. DOE performed a review of the roads that might be affected along the pipeline routes, and none of the major roads within the pipeline corridor are near capacity (i.e., very high average annual daily traffic levels or LOS D through F) (Table 3.13-3). All roadways in the pipeline corridor have the capacity for all construction traffic associated with the proposed project. As traffic would occur at different times and be distributed throughout the area, these effects would lessen on roadways further from the pipeline corridor. However, due to the limited number of worker trips during the peak of construction, these worker trips would have a minor adverse effect on transportation resources, particularlynear the construction sites. For comparison, Table 3.13-6 lists the estimated LOS for the existing (2011), no-build (2015), construction (2015), and operational conditions. Effects attributable to operations are discussed in Section 3.13.3.2. The LOS would degrade from LOS A to LOS B on Washington Street adjacent to the Meredosia Energy Center during peak construction at the energy center and the pipeline. Although traffic on Washington Street would increase by approximately 50 percent above current levels, it is estimated that the roadway would be able to handle the additional traffic. There may be some queuing at nearby intersections during peak traffic periods due to commuting workers. As traffic disperses, effects would lessen at roadways furtherfrom the construction site(s). The LOS would remain unchanged at all other roadways analyzed with the proposed project when compared to future conditions without the proposed energy center and pipeline construction. Adding increases to background traffic from anticipated natural growth, the busiest portions of IL-267 would likely change from a LOS D to LOS E (i.e., from bad to worse) in the next few years, with or without the proposed project. Although IL-99, US-67, and IL-267 roadways would have LOS D or E under either the existing or the no build conditions, traffic associated with the proposed construction would not be sufficient to change the LOS on these roadways either initially or in the future. Although traffic conditions would be indistinguishable from those without the proposed project, the project would cause an incremental increase intraffic onthese alreadycongested roadways. These effects would be minor. Table 3.13-5. Level of Service on Nearby Roadways -During Peak Construction (2015) DOE/EIS-0460 FUTUREGEN 2.0 PROJECT FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT 3.

At certain locations where traffic or road-use restrictions would affect the construction schedule, construction would proceed during late evening hours. Equipment would not be fixed in one location for long durations but would progress along the construction ROW. Trenching and pipe-laying related traffic would be temporary and would subside at any particular location as construction progresses to subsequent segments of the pipeline. Parking may be a concern among some portions of the pipeline corridor. However, adverse parking conditions would subside at any particular location as construction progresses to subsequentsegments of the pipelineand would end upon itscompletion. Barge Traffic The Alliance plans to use the existing public boat ramp area located southwest of Meredosia (and north of the Meredosia Energy Center) to unload large modules for the oxy-combustion facility (see Figure 2-14 and Figure 2-15). The existing boat ramp area is owned by the village of Meredosia. Additional phases of project engineering and coordination with the village of Meredosia would determine accessibility decisions. It is anticipated that any changes to the boat ramp area would be temporary and would be for barge unloading only. Twelve barge deliveries are expected during the construction phase to deliver equipment (see Section 2.4.3.4). Because the number of barge deliveries would be relatively low, the added barge volume is not expected to exceed the capacity of the Illinois River or interfere with other local uses. These effects would be minor. Rail, Air, and Public Transportation Construction of the oxy-combustion facility at the Meredosia Energy Center, the CO2 pipeline, injection wells, and educational facilities would not change the operations for any airports, rail segments, or public transportationfacilities. CO2 Storage Study Area Construction within the CO2 storage study area would have short-term minor adverse effects. Construction at the well sites could cause temporary and localized congestion, particularly where access roadsintersect county and state roadways. However, due to the limited work force, delays to traffic would be minor. Drilling activities would cause temporary increases in traffic near each of the well sites. Construction is estimated to last 100 to 120 days of drilling per injection well, and between 3 and 100 days for the monitoring wells depending on depth. Once drilling is initiated, drilling would generally occur 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. The schedule would consist of two 12-hour shifts with 14 construction workers each shift, generating a total of 28 roundtrips per day. Construction and deliverytrucks would generate an additional12 roundtrips per day, which would bedistributed throughoutthe workday. Construction of the surface facilities at the injection wells would take less than a year to complete and require approximately 41 construction workers, generating 82 roundtrips per day for the dual-site scenario analyzed in the Draft EIS and no longer under consideration by the Alliance. The updated single-site scenario currently proposed by the Alliance would require approximately 21 constructionworkers. The CO2 storage study area is a rural area where the roadways are free flowing and well below design capacity. DOE completed a review of the roads that might be affected by the injection well site(s), and none is near capacity (i.e., none has very high average annual daily traffic levels or LOS D through F) (Table 3.13-3). All roadways within and adjacent to the CO2 storage study area have the capacity for all construction traffic associated with the proposed project. As traffic would occur at different times and be distributed throughout the area, these effects would lessen on roadways further from the CO2 injection well site(s). Due to the limited number of worker trips during the development of the CO2 injection well site(s), these worker trips would have a negligible adverse effect on transportation resources. Additionally, truck trips would be distributed throughout the day and not be focused during the peak traffic hour; therefore, truck traffic at the CO2 storage study area would have a negligible adverse effect on transportation resources. Educational Facilities Construction of the educational facilities would have short-term minor adverse effects. Construction would cause temporary and localized congestion, particularly where access roads to the construction sites intersect county and state roadways. However, due to the limited workforce, delays to traffic would be minor. Construction of the educational facilities is estimated to last 52 weeks, and would likely occur in or near Jacksonville, away from the Meredosia Energy Center, CO2 pipeline corridor, and CO2 storage study area. The schedule would primarily be limited to daytime hours, and staff would consist of approximately 70 to 80 construction workers generating one roundtrip per day each for the two-building scenario. The updated one-building scenario would require approximately 47 design and construction employees. There would be a limited number (i.e., two per day) of delivery trucks throughout the workday.  The traffic associated with the construction of the educational facilities would be substantially less than that associated with the construction of the oxy-combustion facility and pipeline. The nature of effects would be similar to, but somewhat less than, those outlined for the construction of the oxy-combustion facility and CO2 pipeline. It is unlikely that construction of these facilities would overlap appreciably with that of the pipeline and injection well site(s) as it would occur towards the end of the total construction period. Therefore, these effects wouldbe short term and minor. 3.13.3.2 Operational Impacts Meredosia Energy Center Operation of the oxy-combustion facility at the Meredosia Energy Center would have long-term minor adverse effects on transportation resources resulting from increased truck traffic transporting feedstock and waste. Operation would cause long-term but localized congestion, particularly on roadways close to the facility. Minor adverse effects due to additional barge traffic transporting coal would be expected. However, all roadways and waterways in the area would have the capacity for all traffic associated with operations. Traffic and Level of Service Operation of the oxy-combustion facility at the energy center is scheduled to begin in 2017. The primary vehicles that would contribute to additional daily traffic are trucks transporting feedstock (mainly coal and hydrated lime) and removing wastes (mainly fly ash and bottom ash) (for details on the transportation of materials and wastes to and from the energycenter see Sections 2.4.4.1 and 2.4.4.2). The number of daily vehiclesfrom the operation of the oxy-combustion facilityatthe energycenter is outlined in Table 3.13-7. This would be in addition to existing traffic. As indicated in the table, the volume of additional truck traffic would total approximately 88 daily roundtrips. This represents almost 50 additional roundtrips per day when compared to historic truck traffic volumes. For analysis purposes, employee and truck traffic from operations at the energy center was distributed on roadways near the energycenter (see Figure 3.13-1). Table 3.13-7. Daily Trips from Operations a. Estimation oftripsduetotheproposed project isbasedonthebest availableinformation. Smallvariationsintheamount oftripsmayoccur throughout the construction and operation of the project components. b. Assumes a carpool rate of 10percent. c. Since publication of the Draft EIS, the Alliance updated the project design. Under the current design, truck traffic is expected to decrease to 77 vehiclesper day, which iswithin the conditionsanalyzedinthissection. vpd = vehicles per day Table 3.13-8 lists the 2011 average annual daily traffic and estimated LOS with the operational traffic from the proposed energy center facilities for roadways connecting to population centers within 40 miles of the Meredosia Energy Center. Most roadways within the area would operate with little or no congestion (i.e., LOS A though C). Roadways that would have LOS ratings of D or E are primarily roadways that travel through more urban areas, which are subject to higher traffic volumes during peak travel hours. Table 3.13-8 highlights the segments along each roadway with the highest traffic volumes during peak period. These roadways would operate at or better than these LOS on segments with lower traffic volumes and during times other than the peak traffic period. For comparison, Table 3.13-6 (see previous) lists the estimated LOS for the existing (2011), no-build (2015), construction (2015), and operational conditions. After construction ends, the conditions on Washington Street would return to LOS A. Although the roadway would operate at LOS A, there may be some queuing at nearby intersections during peak traffic periods. Adding increases to background traffic from anticipated natural growth, the busiest portions of IL-267 would likely change from LOS D to LOS E in the next few years with or without the proposed project. Although IL-99, US-67, and IL-267 roadways have LOS D or E under either the existing or the no-build conditions, traffic associated withthe operation of the oxy-combustion facility at the Meredosia Energy Center would not be sufficient to change LOS on theseroadways eitherinitiallyor inthe future. Although traffic conditions would be indistinguishable from those without the FutureGen 2.0 Project, the project would constitute an incremental increase in traffic on these already congested roadways. Additionally, trucks transporting materials and wastes would be routed around the village of Meredosia by accessing the bypass road into the proposed facility. Therefore,impacts duringoperations are expected to belong term and minor. Barge Traffic The project design analyzed in the Draft EIS anticipated that Powder River Basin sub-bituminous coal would be the only material delivered by barge, which would require approximately 180 barge trips per year. Based on ongoing refinements in the project design since the release of the Draft EIS, the Alliance may decide to have the Illinois No. 6 bituminous coal and the Powder River Basin coal blended by an existing commercial coal handling facility in St. Louis, Missouri, with the entire volume delivered by barge. The barge would be unloaded via an existing unloading facility at the energy center. If elected, this option would require approximately 451 barge deliveries per year to transport blended coal to the energy center (see Section 2.4.4.1), resulting in one to two barge deliveries on a daily basis. Historically, the number of annual barge deliveries ranged between 140 and 500 over the past several years. Therefore, waterway capacity would be sufficient for the operation of the facility, andimpacts are expectedto be negligible. Rail, Air, and Public Transportation Operation of the oxy-combustion facility at the Meredosia Energy Center, the CO2 pipeline, injection wells, and educational facilities would not change the operations for any airports, rail segments, or public transportationfacilities. CO2 Pipeline Operation and maintenance of the CO2 pipeline would have negligible adverse effects. Pipeline patrolling would be by road, foot, and helicopter, contracted to specialist companies. These visual surveys would be conducted every two weeks and would look for signs of leaks and potential infrastructure concerns. The activities would be sparse and would extend primarily throughout rural areas where the roadways are free flowing and well below designed capacity. DOE reviewed the roads that might be affected, and none of the major roads within the pipeline corridor is near capacity (i.e., none has very high average annual daily traffic or LOS D through F) (Table 3.13-3). All would be able to handle the limited additional traffic from operation and maintenance activities. Traffic associated with operation and maintenance of the CO2 pipeline would constitute less than 1 percent of the total traffic on any roadway in the pipeline corridor. Therefore, these activitieswould have long-termnegligible adverse effects. CO2 Storage Study Area Operation of the CO2 injection well site(s) would have long-term negligible adverse effects. The operations phase, with active injection and monitoring, would begin in 2017, and end in 2022; however, commercial operations could continue beyond this period. The post-injection monitoring phase would begin in 2022 and continue in accordance with the UIC permits. Under the dual-site scenario analyzed in the Draft EIS, approximately 20 employees would work at the surface facilities at the injection wells on a daily basis during normal shifts. The updated single-site design currently proposed by the Alliance would require up to 15 operational employees at the surface facilities. In addition, there would be two staff personnel (3 shifts per day, 7 days per week) onsite managing and monitoring pipeline operations and continually monitoring injection operations. All of these activities would cause some amount of traffic. In addition, the truck traffic from well maintenance would consist of approximately 20 vehicles associated with the maintenance rig, and there would be less than 40 liquid hauling trucks and up to 20, 20-yard roll-off dumpsters for each maintenance operation, as analyzed in the Draft EIS for the dual-site scenario. It is anticipated that the current single-site scenario would require less than 20 liquid hauling trucks and 10 roll-offs for each workover. Periodic well maintenance would involve actions to ensure proper functioning of the wells, and could include replacing and repairing tubing, packer, valves andsensors,repairingcorrodedcasing, and remedial cementing. These activities would be infrequent and extend primarily throughout rural areas where the roadways are free flowing and well below designed capacity. Traffic at the CO2 injection well site(s) would constitute less than 1 percent of the total traffic on adjacent roadways. All roadways adjacent to the storage study area would have the capacity for all traffic associated with the operation of the CO2 injection well site(s). These effects would be negligible. If necessary, pull-offs would be installed and other upgrades would be provided to roads accessing the injection wells, to further reduce traffic congestionin the area. All local and IDOT requirements would be met for design and construction of pull-offs or other improvements to existing roadways within the CO2 storage studyarea. Educational Facilities Operation of the educational facilities would have long-term negligible adverse effects. For the two-building design analyzed in the Draft EIS, the visitor and research center would be open 6 days per week for 9 hours per day and would employ 7 full-time employees, and approximately 10 outside researchers could be accommodated at a time. There would be between 10,000 and 20,000 annual visitors with a significant percentage being local students arriving in buses. This would equate to approximately 20 cars and/or 1 bus per day. The training facility would be open 12 hours per day, 6 days per week and would employ 15 full-time staff. The updated one-building design would locate the visitor, research, and training facility at one building and would involve visitors, researchers, and operational personnel that would be similar to the two-building design analyzed in the Draft EIS. All of these activities would cause some amount of traffic. However, traffic at the educational facilities would constitute less than 1 percent of the total traffic on any individual roadway in the area. The nature of effects would be similar to, but substantially less than, those outlined for the operation of the oxycombustion facility, pipeline, or CO2 injection wells. These effects would be negligible. 3.13.4 Impacts of the No Action Alternative Under the no action alternative, DOE would not provide cost-shared funding for the FutureGen 2.0 Project. Although the Alliance may still elect to construct and operate the project in the absence of DOE cost-shared funding, for the purposes of the analysis in this EIS, DOE assumed the no action alternative is equivalent to the no-build alternative. Therefore, the project would not be constructed and there would be no change to transportation systems. INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK 3.14 NOISE AND VIBRATION 3.14.1 Introduction This section describes techniques used to analyze noise and vibration, and identifies current levels in the vicinity of the proposed project locations. This section also analyzes potential noise and vibration impacts on localreceptorsresultingfrom the construction and operation of the FutureGen 2.0 Project. 3.14.1.1 Region of Influence The ROIfor the noise environment of the FutureGen 2.0 Project was based on the estimated magnitude of noise generated bythe project andbaseline noise levels, which would affect howfar awaythe noise might be heard. The ROI includes the areas within 0.5 mile (2,640 feet) of the Meredosia Energy Center, within 1,000 feet of the construction equipment and new stationary sources related to the pipeline and injection wells, and areasthrough which project-related vehicular traffic wouldpass (Cowan 1994). 3.14.1.2 Method of Analysis and Factors Considered DOE analyzed noise levels generated by stationary and mobile sources for potential impacts to sensitive noise receptors. Noise levels were calculated basedonwidely-accepted noise principles andreferences,as described in this section. DOE assessed the potential for impacts to sensitive receptors based on whether the oxy-combustion facility, CO2 pipeline, CO2 injectionwells, and educationalfacilities would: • Conflict with anystateorlocalnoise ordinances; • Cause perceptible increases in ambient noise levels at sensitive receptors during construction of the oxy-combustion facility, proposed pipeline and ROW, injection wells, and educational facilities—from either mobileor stationary sources; • Cause long-term perceptible increases in ambient noise levels at sensitive receptors during operation of the proposed oxy-combustion facility, pipeline and ROW, injection wells, and educationalfacilities—from either mobile or stationary sources; or • Cause excessive ground-borne vibration to persons orproperty. Noise Principles Noise is defined as any unwanted sound. The human ear experiences sound as a result of pressure variations in the air. The physical intensity or loudness level of noise sources is expressed quantitatively as the sound pressure level. Sound pressure levels are defined in terms of decibels (dB), which are measured on a logarithmic scale. Sound can be quantified in terms of its amplitude (loudness) and frequency (pitch). Frequency is measured in hertz, which is the number of cycles per second. The typical human ear can hear frequencies ranging from approximately 20 hertz to 20,000 hertz. Typically, the human ear is most sensitive to sounds in the middle frequencies (1,000 to 8,000 hertz) and is less sensitive to sounds in the low and high frequencies. Since the human ear cannot perceive all pitches or frequencies equally, measured noise levels in dB will not reflect the actual human perception of the loudness of the noise. Thus, the sound measures can be adjusted or weighted to correspond to a scale appropriate for human hearing. This adjusted scale, known as the A-weighted sound level in decibels (dBA), is useful for gauging and comparing the subjective loudness of sounds to humans. As shown in Table 3.14-1, the threshold of perception of the human ear is approximately 3 dB, a 5-dB change is considered to be clearly noticeable to the ear, and a 10-dB change is perceived as an approximate doubling (or halving) of the noise level (MPCA 1999). Sounds encountered in daily life and their approximate levelsin dBAare provided in Table 3.14-2. Table 3.14-1. Perceived Change in Decibel Level Change in Sound Level Perceived Change to the Human Ear ± 1 dB  Not perceptible  ± 3 dB  Threshold of perception  ± 5 dB  Clearly noticeable  ± 10 dB  Twice (or half) as loud  ± 20 dB  Fourfold (4x) change  Source: MPCA1999 dB =decibel Table 3.14-2. Sound Level and Loudness of Typical Noises Noise Level (dBA) Description Typical Sources 140  Threshold of pain  ---  125  Uncomfortably Loud  Automobile assembly line  120  Uncomfortably Loud  Jet aircraft  100  Very Loud  Diesel truck  80  Moderately Loud  Motor bus  60  Moderate  Low conversation  40  Quiet  Quiet room  20 Very Quiet Leaves rustling Source: Liu and Lipták 1997 dBA = A-weighted sound level in decibels Ambient or background noise is a combination of various sources heard simultaneously. Noise levels for combinations of sounds are not combined by simple addition, but instead are based on the logarithmic scale (HUD 1985). As a result, the addition of two noises, such as a garbage truck (100 dBA) and a lawn mower (95 dBA), would result in a cumulative sound level of 101.2 dBA, not 195 dBA. Noise levels decrease (attenuate) with distance from the source. The decrease in sound level from any single noise source normallyfollows the “inverse square law.” That is, the sound level change is inversely proportional to the square distance from the sound source. A generally accepted rule is that the sound level from a stationary source would drop approximately 6 dB each time the distance from the sound source is doubled. Sound level from a moving “line” source (e.g., a train or a roadway) would drop 3 dB each time the distance from the source is doubled. Noise levels may be further reduced by natural factors such as temperature and climate and are reduced by barriers, both man-made (e.g., sound walls) and natural(e.g., forested areas,hills,etc.)(FTA 2006). The dBA noise metric describes steady noise levels; however, very few noises are, in fact, constant. Therefore, a noise metric, equivalent sound level (Leq), has been developed. Leq represents the average sound energy over a given period presented in dB. There are a variety of measures used to describe the noise environment that take into account changes in noise levels over time, the time of day the noise is occurring, as well as the percentage of time noise is at a particular level. For example, Leq(h) is the equivalent sound level over 1 hour, day-night sound level (Ldn or DNL) is the 24-hour Leq but with a 10 dB penalty added to nighttime noise levels (10 p.m. to 7 a.m.) to reflect the greater intrusiveness of noise experienced during this time, and L50 and L90 represent the levels exceeded50 or 90 percent ofthe time,respectively. Stationary Noise Sources Stationary noise sources include construction-related equipment and any noise-generating equipment used for normal operations. DOE estimated potential noise levels at sensitive receptor locations resulting from stationary sources during construction and normal operations by identifying sound levels from dominant noise-producing equipment, summing anticipated equipment noise contributions, and applying fundamental noiseattenuation principles (FTA2006; Lamancusa 2009). DOE did not consider the effects of meteorology, terrain, vegetation, or structures that can affect sound propagation (i.e., reduce sound levels) as these would be highly variable for each receptor location. Therefore, the results presented may be conservatively higher predictions of noise impacts. However, in the caseoftheinjectionwell drill rigs,the mitigatingprincipalsof anoise-mitigation bermare discussed. Mobile Noise Sources (Traffic Noise) Mobile noise sources include light-duty vehicles (i.e., cars, pickup trucks, and sport utility vehicles), medium trucks (i.e., 2-axle, 6-wheel trucks), and heavy trucks (i.e., 3 or more axles) transporting workers and materials and wastes during the construction and operational phases. The level of highway traffic noise depends on numerous factors. Generally, the loudness of traffic noise is increased by heavier traffic volumes, inclined roads, higher speeds, and greater numbers of trucks. In addition, there are other, more complicated factors that affect the loudness or attenuation of traffic noise, such as distance, terrain, vegetation, and natural and man-made obstacles. 3.14.1.3 Regulatory Framework Noise Regulatory Framework In 1974, the USEPA provided information suggesting that continuous and long-term noise levels in excess of Ldn 65 dBA are normally unacceptable for noise-sensitive land uses such as residences, schools, churches, and hospitals (USEPA 1974). Similarly, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) established65 dBA as a threshold for unacceptable noise levels forresidentialareas. HUD’s guidelines, shown in Table 3.14-3, categorize noiselevels for proposed residentialdevelopment as acceptable,normallyunacceptable,and unacceptable (HUD 1985). Table 3.14-3. U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Guidelines for Evaluating Sound Level Impacts on Residential Properties Source: HUD 1985 dBA = A-weighted sound level in decibels Construction activities on this project are not governed by either federal or state regulations; however, there are Illinois noise level standards pertaining to operational activities. The applicable IEPA regulations are set forth by the Illinois Pollution Control Board as noise limits for commercial and industrial noise sources and provide guidance for assessing compliance. The regulations are defined in the 35 IAC, Subtitle H, Chapter I, 901 Sound Emissions Standards and Limitations for Property-Line Noise-Sources (IPCB 2007). The IAC specifically lists the limits that different classifications of land can allowably experience based upon their land use.The three landclasses are definedas follows: • IAC Class A properties (residences) are considered the most sensitive property use. • IAC Class Bproperties (businesses andservices) are considered of mixed use. • IAC Class C properties (utilities, manufacturing, industrial, and agricultural) are considered the least sensitive. The Meredosia Energy Center is defined as Class C. The pipeline corridor passesthrough areas definedas Class A, Class B, andClassC. The injection wellsite(s) are considered Class Cproperties. Noise is broken down into specific frequency bands (octave bands) that characterize the nature of the sound and identify which frequencies contain the most energy. Regulatory limits are established for each octave band. Furthermore, limits are established for both daytime and nighttime, with nighttime being more restrictive thandaytime. Table 3.14-4 presents the un-weighted dB permissible sound levels during day and nighttimes for sound emanating from a Class C land (the Meredosia Energy Center and the CO2 injection well site(s)) to a receiving Class A land (nearby residential neighborhoods). Emanating sound levels at a residence are considered to be in compliance if theyare below the regulatorythresholds for the frequencies listed inthis table. There are no limits set for sound emanating from a Class C land onto a receiving Class C land. Per the Illinois Pollution Control Board Section 901.107, the permissible sound levels do not apply to equipment being used for construction. Table 3.14-4. Permissible Sound Levels for Class C Land to Class A Land Octave Band Center Frequency Daytime Sound Levela Nighttime Sounda Level (hertz) (decibel) (decibel) Source: IPCB 2007 a. The Illinois Pollution Control Board states that no measurement of sound pressure levels shall be made less than 25 feet from a propertyline-noise-source. For assessment of traffic noise impacts the FHWA and IDOT use the Leq(h) descriptor to estimate the degree of nuisance or annoyance arising from changes in traffic noise. IDOT and FHWA established noise abatement criteria (NAC) that provide a benchmark to assess the level at which noise becomes a clear source of annoyance for different land uses (see Table 3.14-5) (FHWA 1995). Category B, which represents moderately sensitive land uses, best describes the majority of the receptors around the energy center, along the pipeline corridor, and within the storage study area. The NAC for residential use (category B) is 67 dBA. As defined in the IDOT and FHWA noiseabatement policies, traffic noise effects can occur under two separate conditions: (1) when noise levels are unacceptably high, or (2) when a proposed highway project would substantially increase the existing noise environment. Specifically, a traffic noise effect occurs when the predictedlevels equal or approach the NAC (e.g., greaterthan 66 dBA for category B), or when predicted traffic noise levels exceed the existing noise levels by greater than 10 dBA. The level of impact (i.e., negligible, minor, moderate, or significant) is determined on the basis of the total number of receptors affected,and therelative increase in noise for identifiedreceptors. Table 3.14-5.

Vibration can be caused by operating heavy farm or construction machinery, ground-breaking construction activities (e.g., drilling or excavating), trains on railways, operating equipment indoors, or slamming doors. Similar to noise, the sensitive receptors to outdoor vibrations include nearby residences, schools, hospitals, nursing home facilities, and recreational areas. Typically, the effects of vibration range from feeling the floor shake and rumbling sounds to minor structural damage. Vibration is often expressedin terms of the peakparticle velocity, as inches per second or millimeters persecond,whenusedtoevaluate human annoyance and building damage impacts. There are no federal standards for vibrations, however, various researchers and organizations have published guidelines. Table 3.14-6 presents guidelines to assess human perception and annoyance, and Table 3.14-7 presents guidelines for vibration damage to buildings. Table 3.14-6. Guidelines for Potential Vibration Annoyance Source: Jones and Stokes 2004 a. Transient sources create a single isolated vibration event, such as blasting or drop balls. Continuous/frequent/intermittent sources include impact pile drivers, pogo-stick compactors, crack-and-seat equipment, vibratory pile drivers, and vibratory compaction equipment. DOE assumesthat trenchless boring operations would be categorized as continuous/frequent/intermittent sources. PPV = peak particle velocity Table 3.14-7.

DOE assumes that trenchless boring operations would be categorized as continuous/frequent/intermittent sources. PPV = peak particle velocity The DOT Federal Transit Administration (FTA) published guidelines to perform vibration impact assessments for proposed projects that may involve transit activities. The methodology applies a screening approach based on the distance between sensitive receptors and the source of vibration. Accordingto the FTA, if the distance between source and receptoris greater than 200 feet,it isreasonable to concludethat no furtheranalysis of vibrationimpacts is necessary(FTA 2006). 3.14.2 Affected Environment 3.14.2.1 Meredosia Energy Center As shown in Figure 3.14-1, the Meredosia Energy Center property and surrounding areas are predominantly classified as IAC Classes A, B, and C. The nearest Class A land is the residential area of Meredosia to the north and east of the proposed facility. The land designated as Class B, found mainly to the north of the energy center property, includes warehouses, general sales or services, the boat launch and recreational areas, the campground, and a potentially historic train depot. Class C land found in the project area includes the roadways, unused railroad ROW, agricultural land, and manufacturing facilities to the east and south of the energycenter. Also, the Meredosia EnergyCenter itself and properties in Pike County located to the west (across the Illinois River) are consistent with Class C land. The Meredosia EnergyCenter can becharacterized as a developed,industrial site. Existing dominant noise sources in the vicinity of the Meredosia Energy Center mainly consist of equipment and vehicle noise related to the operations of the energy center; noise associated with the adjacent grain elevator operations at the Cargill facility located to the north of the energy center site; vehicular traffic on Old Naples Road, South Washington Street, and IL-104; and rail traffic on the Norfolk Southern rail line providing access to the industrial sites to the south of the Meredosia Energy Center. Figure 3.14-1 presents the class designations of the properties to the north and east of the energy center. The Meredosia Energy Center site is currently a Class C property. Residences primarily to the east and north of the energy center are considered as Class A. The properties to the south and to the west (across the river) are industrialandthus Class C. Figure 3.14-1. Noise Class Designations for Properties Adjacent to Meredosia Energy Center There are 137 residences within 0.5 mile of the project site. These residences are located to the north and east of the site, primarily within the boundary of the village of Meredosia. No other sensitive receptors (schools or hospitals) have been identified within 0.5 mile of the energy center. There are two schools (the Meredosia-Chambersburg Elementary and High School) 0.5 to 1 mile to the northeast of the site (Beacon 2011), but no hospitals in the general vicinity. The two schools are within 500 feet of IL-104, a major transportation accessroute. DOE measured sound levels at seven sites adjacent to the Meredosia Energy Center and IL-104 in May 2011 (PHE 2011). The noise monitoring sites (Site #1 through Site #7) are described and summarized below in Table 3.14-8. Figure 3.14-2 depicts the locations of the seven noise monitoring sites in relation to the Meredosia Energy Center. Table 3.14-8. Summary of Noise Monitoring Sites Source: PHE 2011 Cargill = Cargill, Inc.; IL-# = Illinois StateRoute;MEC =Meredosia EnergyCenter Sites #1 and #2 are representative of receptors along IL-104. Sites #4 and #5 are representative of the closest houses to the north (Site #4) and east (Site #5). Sites #3 and #6 are approximately 2,500 feet away from the noisy elements at the Meredosia Energy Center and also reflective of traffic noise from South Washington Street (Site #3) or Old Naples Road (Site #6). It is important to note that the Cargill facility, near the center of Meredosia, is the largest noise source at Sites #3, #4, #5, and #6. At Site #3, which is only 350 feeteast of the Cargill noise generators, thenoiseenvironment is totally dominated by Cargill. Figure 3.14-2. Noise Monitoring Sites The Meredosia Energy Center contains a total of six boilers (B-1 through B-6) and four turbine units (Units 1 through 4). Units 1 and 2 (Boilers B-1, B-2, B-3, and B-4) were not operating during the noise monitoring. During thenoise monitoring, the MeredosiaEnergy Center operated in three differentscenarios: Scenario 1: For most of the time, only Unit 3 and the fans associated with it were operational. This is described asthe first scenario, andthe baseloadoperating condition. Scenario 2: Under the second scenario, two dozers were operating on the coal storage pile. During this specialevent, noise levels were monitoredat Site #7. This additional noise was added to the baseload condition of continuous Unit 3 operation. Scenario 3: Under the third scenario, Unit 4 was also operating. During this scenario, noise levels were monitored at Sites #4, #5, and #6. This additional noise was added to the baseload condition of continuous Unit 3 operation. Table 3.14-9 presents the range of Leq measured at the noise monitoring sites, and the scenarios and time periods under which they were monitored. Subsequent to the noise monitoring that occurred in May 2011, the Meredosia Energy Center suspended operation (at the end of 2011). The noise monitoring results presented herein serve to describe the historical conditions; however, after suspension of operations at the Meredosia Energy Center, the ambient noise would not include the activities under the three scenarios listed above. The nighttime noise monitoring was conducted at the three monitoring sites adjacent to the Meredosia Energy Center: Site #4 at Railroad Street, Site #5 at South Washington Street, and Site #6 at Old Naples Road. There were numerous instances of noise levels exceeding the state code limits for particular octave bands (hertz levels) at each of these locations (PHE 2011). The following three nighttime noise locations and conditions were monitored: • Site #4 was representative of the homes to the north of the Meredosia Energy Center on Railroad and Pearl streets. At Site #4 the dominant noise source was Cargill. Other noise sources were the Meredosia Energy Center and occasional traffic on Railroad and Pearl streets, along with environmental noise such as rustling leaves. • Site #5 was representative of noise levels at the homes east of the Meredosia Energy Center. This location was quieter than Site #4 since it is further from Cargill, though Cargill was still the dominant noise source at this site, with cricket noise also constantly present. Other sources included the intermittent traffic on South Washington Street and theMeredosia Energy Center. • Site #6 was the noisiest of the three sites during the overnight monitoring. While crickets provided a source of continuous noise, numerous extraneous noises were also observed, including a train, barking dogs, heavy truck, etc. The daytime noise monitoring was conducted at all seven monitoring sites (#1 through #7) under a variety of scenarios and times of day (see Table 3.14-9). There were numerous instances of noise levels exceeding the state code limits for particular octave bands (hertz levels) at each of these locations (PHE 2011). Thefollowing five daytime noiselocations and conditions were monitored: • Site #3 was located near the intersection of IL-104 and South Washington Street, and diagonally across the street from the Meredosia Post Office on South Washington Street. The largest sound source, by a significant margin, was the Cargill grain facility. The Cargill facility routinely exceeded the standards for 250; 500; 1,000; 2,000; and 4,000 hertz, with occasional additional exceedancesin 125and 8,000 hertz ranges. Table 3.14-9. Existing Ambient Sound Levels at the Monitoring Sites dBA= A-weighted sound level in decibels; Leq = equivalent sound level • Site #4 was located north of the Meredosia Energy Center, near the homes on Railroad and Pearl streets. Monitoring was conducted during time periods when the Unit 4 fans were in operation and during time periods when Unit 4 fans were not in operation. The Meredosia Energy Center was noticeably louder when Unit 4 was in operation, with the largest increases observed in the deeper octaves (31.5 to 250 hertz). The exceedances noted in the 4,000 hertz octave band were due to Cargill, not the Meredosia Energy Center. When Unit 4 was not in operation, Cargill was the loudest noise source. When Unit 4 was in operation, the Meredosia Energy Center became verynearlyas loud as Cargill. • Site #5 was located to the east of the Meredosia Energy Center. Monitoring was conducted during time periods when the Unit 4 fans were in operation and when the Unit 4 fans were not in operation. Cargill was a more apparent continuous noise source than the Meredosia Energy Center during all monitored time periods. The widely scattered exceedances in the 1,000 and 2,000 hertz octave bands were caused by a combination of Cargill and heavy truck pass-bys, not the Meredosia EnergyCenter. • Site #6 was located to the southeast of the Meredosia Energy Center. Monitoring was conducted during time periods when Unit 4 fans were in operation and when Unit 4 fans were not in operation. Cargill was a more apparent continuous noise source than the Meredosia Energy Center during all monitored time periods. The widely scattered exceedances in the 1,000 and 2,000 hertz octave bands were caused by a combination of heavy truck pass-bys and Cargill. • Site #7 was located closest to the storage piles, on the Meredosia Energy Center property. This site was monitored to evaluate typical energy center operational noise associated with two bulldozers moving coal on the coal storage pile. The monitoring session was divided into three parts reflecting a low, average, and high amount of activity on the coal pile. There were various octave band exceedances during the monitoring session, though all these exceedances were in the octave bands that the Cargill facility dominates. At the adjacent property lines, the coal pile activitydid not contributeto any noise exceedances. Sites #1 and #2 were located along the IL-104 corridor in Meredosia. The following were the only two sites that were not influencedbyCargill: • Site #1, located 25 feet off IL-104 on the south side of the roadway, is representative of receptors along IL-104 outside the village of Meredosia. Variations in noise levels were primarily caused by the changing volumes of heavy trucks. • Site #2 was located on the lower speed portion of IL-104 in the village of Meredosia. It was positioned at the set-back of the Meredosia Elementary School. The even wider variations in noise levels were caused by changing levels of activity in the school yard, fluctuating volumes of heavy trucks, and variations in community noise adjacentto the site,suchaslawnmowers. 3.14.2.2 CO2 Pipeline The potential pipeline route from the energy center to the injection wells would pass primarily through rural sparsely-populated land, which has relatively quiet noise levels. The route would, however, cross state and local highways that pass through or border rural communities, which introduce additional sources of noise, at least intermittent peaks, above those expected in rural environments. Noise measurements were conducted as part of the assessment of potential impacts associated with improvements to US-67 between Jacksonville and Macomb, Illinois, which crossed the proposed pipeline corridor to the injection wells. Existing noise levels ranged from 44 to 67 dBA along the proposed highway route (IDOT 2002). Along the highways, periodic noise levels could spike to 86 dBA due to heavy trucks passing at 55 miles perhour (Cowan 1994). 3.14.2.3 CO2 Storage Study Area The storage study area is located in an agricultural area in the northeastern corner of Morgan County. As such, the site is classified as a Class C property per the state of Illinois noise control regulations. The Alliance contracted with Patrick Engineering, Inc. to conduct an assessment to determine the potential for noise and vibration impacts to surrounding receptors at the location of the stratigraphic well. The report, which was limited to the construction of the well pad and drilling of the well, documents ambient noise levels at nearby receptor locations. Ambient nighttime noise levels were determined to be 38 dBA, averaged over 1 hour on the night of April 27, 2011. The maximum noise level was 58 dBA and the minimum was 31 dBA (Patrick 2011). The nearest sensitive receptor to the stratigraphic well site is approximately 1,570 feet away. 3.14.2.4 Educational Facilities The Alliance anticipates that the visitor, research, and training facilities would be located in or near Jacksonville, Illinois. The Alliance is working with local stakeholders to identify the locations that would best serve the functions of these facilities.Because the locations of the educationalfacilities are unknown, DOE cannot characterize the existing noise environment specifically. However, it is likely that the facilities would be located in a semi-urban to urban area, near a road with existing traffic, surrounded by other businesses and services that generate moderate levels of urban noise,likelywithin the range of 46 to 55 dBA. 3.14.2.5 Existing Traffic Noise (for All Project Components) The maximum design year peak-hour Leq traffic noise levels expected in the vicinity of the project were predicted using FHWA’s Traffic Noise Model 2.5. Predicted noise levels for the maximum analysis year and current noise levels were compared to determine if traffic noise impacts can be expected from the proposed project (FHWA 2004). Notably, peak traffic does not always equate to peak noise, but it is the best available information at the time of the analysis and the assumption is reasonable given the predicted LOS. Noise from the roadways within the study area would neither (1) equal or exceed the NAC, nor (2)exceed the existing noise levels by 10 dBA. Table 3.14-10 lists the Leq(h) during the peak travel period adjacent to state roadways connecting population centers within 40 miles to the Meredosia Energy Center. The highest annual average daily traffic and subsequently the highest Leq(h) along each segment were used to reflect worst-case baseline conditions. All roadways within the pipeline corridor operate with sound levels below the NAC. All segments would operate at or below these levels on portions with lower traffic volumes, at distances further than 100 feetfrom the centerline, and attimes outside of the peak traffic period. Table 3.14-10.

The construction phase for the oxy-combustion facility, including initial demolition, is estimated to occur over a period of approximately 42 months beginning in 2014, and extending through the middle of 2017. However, construction would be substantially completed within 30 months, and the last 12 months of construction would overlap with a 1-year commissioning and startupeffort. During construction, various mixes of construction equipment would be used and would thus generate different noise levels. The USEPA derived average noise levels for various phases of industrial construction projects, including ground clearing, excavation and grading, foundations, building construction, and finishing work. These construction activities are based on the number of each type of equipment typically present, and the combined average noise levels during construction activities (Bolt etal. 1971). Table 3.14-11 presents these common noise levels that would be associated with the construction of the projectcomponents attheMeredosia Energy Center. Table 3.14-11. Common Noise Levels Associated with Outdoor Construction Typical Noise Level Noise Level Noise Level Equipment at 50 feet at 500 feet at 1,000 feet (dBA) (dBA) (dBA) 58 64 84 Ground Clearing Excavation, Grading 89 69 63 Foundations 78 58 52 Building Construction 85 65 59 Finishing 89 69 63 Rock Drilling (Pipeline Only) 98 78 72 Source: Bolt et al. 1971 dBA = A-weighted sound level in decibels According to the estimated noise levels presented in Table 3.14-11, the loudest average levels during normal industrial construction activities would range from 78 to 89 dBA (at 50 feet) depending on the stage ofconstruction, and would dissipate with distance. If two ofthese activitiesoccurredsimultaneously (e.g., grading of the stormwater management system and building construction of the oxy-combustion facility), the cumulative noise level could be approximately 90.5 dBA (at 50 feet). Although the temporary impact areas during construction could briefly extend to the fence lines of the nearest residential properties (as shown in Figure 2-14 and Figure 2-15), DOE assumed the closest residences are approximately 900 feet from the main energy center noise sources (see Noise Monitoring Site #4 in Table 3.14-9). At 900 feet distance, the construction noise level for simultaneous activities could be heard at 65.4 dBA, which is slightly above the level deemed as acceptable for residences by HUD (65 dBA) (see Table 3.14-3), and below the NAC benchline level of 67 dBA for residences (see Table 3.14-5). Construction of the new roadway to the barge unloading area, as well as barge unloading events, would generate noise levels similar to those presented in Table 3.14-11, thus impacting the few residences in close proximity to the barge unloading area and access road (see Section 2.4.3.2 for further discussion of the barge unloading activities). These construction noises could have a minor to moderate impact on the few nearest residences; however, due to the nature of construction, the noise would be intermittent and temporary untiltheconstruction phaseis over. The majority of construction activities would occur during daytime hours Monday through Saturday, with occasional additional construction hours if required to complete critical construction activities. Although construction noise is exempt from Illinois Pollution Control Board noise regulations, to the extent practicable, the Alliance would make efforts to minimize the impacts from construction noise by using proper machinery operation techniques and properly maintaining machinery. DOE anticipates negligible vibration impacts to sensitive receptors, since no residences are located within 200 feet of the proposed construction activities. According to the FTA, if the distance between source and receptor is greater than 200 feet, it is reasonable to conclude that no further analysis of vibration impacts is necessary(FTA2006). CO2 Pipeline Construction of the potential pipeline would consist of site clearing, excavation, trenching, pipe laying, and finishing work. These activities would require the use of heavy-duty construction equipment (e.g., trenching equipment, trucks, graders, backhoes, excavators, and portable generators). Use of this equipment would likely result in moderate impacts with temporary increases in ambient noise levels in the immediate area of the construction sites. The sound levels resulting from linear facility construction activities would vary greatly depending on such factors as the types of activities being performed and equipment being used. The USEPA derived average noise levels from typical public works, sewer, and trenches construction activities based on the number of each type of equipment typically present and the combined average noise levels during construction activities (Bolt et al. 1971). Table 3.14-11 presents these estimated noise levels that would be associated with pipeline construction, which would include ground clearing, excavation and grading, and potentially rock drilling. The loudest average levels during normal pipeline construction (excluding rock drilling) would range from approximately 84 to 89 dBA at 50 feet. Noise levels would range from64 to 69 dBA at 500 feet and 58 to 63 dBA at 1,000 feet from the construction site. Trenchless pipe-boring techniques such as jack and bore techniques and horizontal directional drilling may be required to construct pipeline under water features, roadways, and other obstacles. Use of rock drills for these techniques could result in sound levels around 78 and 72 dBA at 500 and 1,000 feet, respectively. Noise generated by construction activities of the pipeline would be naturally attenuated (reduced) by trees and vegetation or masked by noise from other man-made activities, such as traffic on adjacent roadways. Therefore, actual noise levels may be lowerthan predicted. DOE analyzed two routes (the southern route and the northern route)forthe pipeline to the injection wells (see Figure 2-18). Table 3.14-12 presents the number of sensitive receptors that could be impacted from the pipeline construction. As explained in Sections 2.5.1.1 and 3.0, the Alliance identified the southern pipeline route as the proposed route, and is no longer considering the northern route alternative; however, DOE carries through the impact analysis from the Draft EIS, presenting both routes for comparison purposes. Further, the Alliance subsequently identified the location of the injection well site (as discussed in Section 2.5.2.1) and established pipeline routing for the entire southern route to the proposed location of the injection wells. Because the northern route is no longer being considered, DOE maintains the Draft EIS analysis for the northern pipeline route using hypothetical end-of-pipelinealignments through the storage study area. As shown in Table 3.14-12, there are 20 residences within 500feet of the southern route; there are 21 residences, 2 cemeteries, and no churches within 1,000 feet of the southern route. Within 500 feet of the northern route, thereare 15 residences, 1 cemetery, and 1 church. Table 3.14-12.

The number of sensitivereceptorswithin 1,000 feet includes the sensitive receptorswithin500feet. d. Between the distance of 500 to 1,000 feet of the southern route, there are two cemeteries: New Salem and Tippet William. The Ebenezer church and cemetery, discussed in the Draft EIS, are now farther than 1,000 feet due to recent proposed route realignments. e. Within 500 feet of the northern route, there is one cemetery (Grace Cemetery) and one church (St. Paul Lutheran Church). The portion of the northern route within the storage study area is analyzed using a range of reasonable hypothetical end-of-pipeline spurs as presented in the Draft EIS (see Section 3.0 for further discussion). This table includes the most conservative numbers from that analysis. The majority of the construction is expected to occur during a period of 4 to 5 months with 10-hour workdays Monday through Saturday. There would be approximately 150 to 300 construction workers required for the pipeline construction. The use of trenchless pipe-boring techniques at various locations along the proposed pipeline route would produce louder, non-typical construction noise impacts. The Alliance intends to use either jack and bore techniques or horizontal directional drilling to install the pipeline under roads, railroads, waterbodies, and water-sensitive areas (e.g., wetlands) to minimize impacts. Jack and bore operations require anexcavation on each side of the bore, which serve as jacking and receiving pits for the boring equipment. Horizontal directional drilling is a steerable trenchless method of installing pipeline using a surface-launched drilling rig, with minimal impact on the surrounding area. The Alliance intends to use trenchless pipe-boring techniquesin 37locationsalongthe southern route(some borings cross multiple surface features). Using these trenchless pipe-boring techniques under roads and railroads would allow the roads and railroad tracks to remain operational during construction of the pipeline. This operation is anticipated to take less than 12 hours to install the pipeline at each of the proposed road locations. The use of jack and bore techniques or horizontal directional drilling for pipeline construction under wetlands and perennial streams would eliminate the need for earth-moving activities and thus protect the sensitive eco-systems from construction impacts. Trenching may still be used to cross dry stream channels. Where horizontal directional drilling is required, the hole drilling machinery may operate continuously (24 hours per day) for approximately 1 to 4 days depending on the distance. Continuous operation would be necessary in order to maintain hole stability and to prevent damage to the specialized equipment. Any adverse effects that would occur would be of a temporary nature and cease with completion of the jack and bore or horizontaldirectional drillingactivities. The predicted dBA levels both without and with trenchless techniques would be 69 and 78 dBA, respectively, for receptors located 500 feet from the construction site. The predicted dBA levels would be 63 and 72 dBA, respectively, for receptors located 1,000 feet away. Due to the linear nature of pipeline construction, the location of the construction site would be transient as the pipe-laying progresses. The noise impacts from construction would be moderate, shortterm,andintermittent. Not accounting for natural attenuation, receptors at distances greater than approximately 830 feet during typical pipeline construction, or approximately 2,330 feet during trenchless boring activities, would hear the construction noise at levels below 65 dBA, which is the limit deemed normally acceptable to residentialreceptors (see Table 3.14-3) (HUD 1985). Vibration created by trenchless drilling operations would be below 0.2 inches per second and could be perceptible to residents depending on the distance of the residents to the construction site. However, vibration levels would be belowlimits for potential structural damage (Jonesand Stokes 2004). CO2 Storage Study Area Since publication of the Draft EIS, the Alliance identified the location of the injection well site (as discussed in Section 2.5.2.1). Primary sources of noise during construction of the injection well facilities would be from site preparation activities and a drill rig with supporting equipment (e.g., compressors, boosters, pumps, and diesel engines). The general construction of the drill pad, buildings and associated infrastructure, and access roads could generate noise levels that would range from 78 to 89 dBA (at 50 feet) due to construction equipment noises listed in Table 3.14-11.  The drilling of the injection wells would occur over a continuous, 24-hour duration, 7 days per week, for approximately 100 days per well, and because of the duration, would be the dominant noise source. Noise would be generated from the equipment associated with the drilling as well as the construction vehicle motors and back-up beeps. The Alliance would construct earthen noise berms surrounding three sides ofthe well padto mitigate the noise impact during this period. On October 5, 2011, the Alliance began the drilling of a geological stratigraphic well within the storage study area (not part of the proposed action). This stratigraphic well is intended to provide scientific understanding of the geological conditions within the storage study area, to be used to determine the suitability and capacity of the location for the FutureGen 2.0 Project CO2 injection wells. The construction techniques and drilling equipment used for the stratigraphic well are similar to those that would be used for the injection wells. To mitigate noise impacts from the drilling activities, the Alliance constructed noise mitigation berms to the west and north of the drill rig site. In November 2011, the Alliance conducted a noise study to monitor the noise levels resulting from the drilling operations(Patrick 2011). DOE expects that the noise levels measured during the drilling of the stratigraphic well are representative of noise levels that wouldbe generatedduringconstruction oftheinjection wells. Ambient noise levels were measured in April 2011 at the nearest residence, located 1,570 feet northwest from the stratigraphic well drilling location (Patrick 2011). Table 3.14-13 presents these ambient sound measurements. Table 3.14-13. Ambient Sound Measurements at Nearest Residence to Stratigraphic Well Source: Patrick 2011 a.

The western berm was 10 feet high, located between points #8 and #10; the northern berm was 15 feet high, located between points#7 and #11. dBA = A-weighted sound level in decibels General construction activities prior to drilling are estimated to generate noise levels that can reach approximately 89 dBA at adistance of50 feet,anddrillingactivities for the injection wells could generate 98 dBA at a distance of 50 feet based on typical noise levels for rock drilling (see Table 3.14-11). The distances to the sensitive receptors are currently unknown, as the exact locations of the injection wells have not yet been selected. To evaluate the potential for impacts to sensitive receptors when the site locations are chosen, DOE estimated anticipated noise levels from the construction and drilling activities for distances at 500 and 1,000 feet from the well, with and without noise mitigation berms. The estimates are based on typical rock drilling noise levels as well as proportional estimates based on noise levels measured during the drilling of the stratigraphic well(see Table 3.14-15).  As shown in Table 3.14-15, residences over 1,000 feet away from general non-drilling construction activities (without noise mitigation measures) and from drilling activities (with a noise berm in place) would experience short-term minor to moderate impacts as the noise levels would be above the typical rural ambient level, but still below the acceptable level of 65 dBA, as recommended by HUD for residentialareas(HUD 1985). The noise study data from the drilling of the stratigraphic well indicates that at approximately 1,570 feet from the well, with the noise berms in place, the sound level during drilling activities would be approximately equal to the ambient noise level (36 dBA) as measured at this distance in April 2011 (Patrick 2011). Table 3.14-15.

Values in parentheses are drilling noise levels estimated on a proportional basis from the noise data measured during drilling of the stratigraphic well (see Table 3.14-14). c. According to data measured during the noise study, the berm reduced the noise level at the receptors by over approximately 12.8 dBA (conservativelyrounded down to12 dBA). dBA = A-weighted sound level in decibels; NA = not applicable Ground vibrations from well drilling activities are expected to have negligible impact to nearby structures. A typical value for ground vibrations from drilling activities is 0.089 inches per second, measured at a distance of 25 feet from the source (FTA 2006). The lowest vibration damage threshold for continuous vibrations, applicable to extremely fragile historic buildings, is 0.08 inches per second (seeTable 3.14-7). DOE estimates1 that drilling vibrations would decay to below this threshold at a distance of approximately 30 feet from the source. Therefore, any structures located farther than 30 feet from the drilling activity would not experience damaging levels of ground vibration. Further, using the thresholds presented in Table 3.14-6, for a continuous source, DOE estimates that vibrations from well drilling would be imperceptible to humans beyond a distance of 200 feet from the drilling location. DOE estimates that the nearest dwellings are located at a distance of over 900 feet from the end of the pipeline at the injection well site. Thus, DOE expects negligible impacts to sensitive receptors due to vibrationsfrom the drilling. The Alliance would be required to install monitoring wells as a condition of its UIC permits (seeSection 2.5.2.4). The quantity and location of the monitoring wells would be based on the UIC permitting process and the results of the geologic stratigraphic study. Related noise and vibration impacts would be similar to those described for the construction of the injection wells. Educational Facilities For the worst-case scenario, in which the educational facilities would be newly constructed buildings, construction activities could involve ground clearing, excavation and grading, foundations, building construction, and finishing work. The typical noise levels of these activities could range from 78 to 89 dBA (see Table 3.14-11) (Bolt et al. 1971). With multiple items of equipment operating concurrently, noiselevels could be relatively high during daytime periods at locations within several hundred feet of the active construction sites. The specific locations of the facilities are currently unknown, though they are anticipated to be located in the urban area of Jacksonville. Although construction-related noise would have moderate adverse impacts on nearby sensitive receptors, the effects would be temporary in nature and would end upon completion of the construction. Contractors would typically limit construction to occur primarily during normal weekday business hours, and would properly maintain construction equipment mufflers. If the educational facilities were instead located in renovated buildings, construction noise impacts would be lower. 1 The followingequationwasusedtocalculate vibrationlevels(JonesandStokes2004): PeakParticle Velocity(PPV) = 0.089 *(25/D)1.1, where D is the distance infeet fromthe source to the receptor. Traffic Noise during Construction (For All Project Components) Ambient noise levels along the primary construction traffic routes would likely increase as a result of construction-related vehicles entering or leaving a particular construction site, as well as construction workers commuting to and fromthe construction sites. See Section 3.13, Traffic and Transportation, for a discussion aboutthe number of vehicles accessing the site andimpacts fromtraffic. Short-term negligible adverse effects on the noise environment would be expected due to construction traffic. Each roadway was modeled, assuming no special noise abatement measures would be incorporated, and the roadway sections were assumed to be at-grade. It was assumed that the peak-hour volumes and corresponding speeds for trucks and automobiles would result in the noisiest conditions. Noise predictions of Leq(h) for representative receptors within 328 feet of nearby roadways appear in Table3.14-16.  Table 3.14-16.

Traffic noise levels predicted using FHWA’s Traffic Noise Model 2.5 (FHWA 2004), assuming a distance of 328 feet (100 meters) from centerline. dBA = A-weighted sound level in decibels; FHWA = Federal Highway Administration; I-# = interstate, IL-# = Illinois State Route; Leq(h) = equivalent sound level over 1 hour; US-# = U.S. Highway During construction, there would be only a slight increase in the level of traffic noise for receptors adjacent to nearby roadways when compared tothe noaction alternative. No residences or other land uses identified equal or approach the NAC for category B of 67 dBA, or would have an increase of greater than 10 dBA. These changes in noise would not even be barely perceptible when compared to existing conditions. 3.14.3.2 Operational Impacts Meredosia Energy Center The proposed project would include new sources of noise resulting from the operation of the oxycombustion facility. The project would involve replacing existing Boiler 6 (of Unit 4) with a new oxycombustion boiler (Boiler 7), and adding various other project features including booster fans, compressors, material unloadingareas,etc., as discussed in Section 2.4.1. The new oxy-combustion boiler would utilize some of theexistingenergycenter features, includingexistingnoise sources such as the coal handling systems and the Unit 4 steam turbine and generator. As discussed in Chapter 2, all other boilers of the Meredosia Energy Center have been removed from service. Thus, the operational noise at the Meredosia Energy Center during the proposed project would result from the FutureGen 2.0 Project components, along with other third-party actions occurring on the property as discussed in Section 4.3, Potential Cumulative Impacts, including a new substation run by Ameren Transmission Company of Illinois, and use of the oil storage tanks by SunriseAg Energy, LLC. DOE measured ambient noise levels in 2011 during operation of the Meredosia Energy Center as discussed in Section 3.14.2.1 (PHE 2011). Scenario 3 of the 2011 noise study involved operation of Units 3 and 4, along with two dozers operating on the coal storage pile. DOE assumes that the new operations under the proposed project would be similar to this operational Scenario 3, though smaller in magnitude. This assumption is based on the proposed oxy-combustion facility generating capacity (approximately 168 MWe) being smaller than the previous system operating during the noise monitoring (approximately 369 MWe). Specifically from a noise perspective, the new system would operate one turbine (for Unit 4) instead of two (for Units 3 and 4), and the coal storage pile operations would likely continue to have one to two dozers in use, though the frequency and duration of the dozer usages would change depending on the amount of coalrequired. Sensitive-receptor Sites #4 and #5 (shown in Figure 3.14-2) are representative of the closest residences to the project site, and Site #2 is the location of the nearest elementary school. According to the noise study in 2011, the Cargill facility, near the center of Meredosia, is the most significant contributor to the ambient noise levels at Sites #3, #4, #5, and #6, and the IL-104 is the most significant contributor to noise at Sites #1 and #2. Therefore, considering that noise from the Meredosia Energy Center would either remain the same or be reduced from historical levels, the ambient noise levels at these receptor locations are expected to stay at approximately the same level in comparison to historical levels. Similarly, noise levels are expected to stay at the same level in comparison to ambient conditions after the suspension of the energy center operations at the end of 2011, since local noise levels are and will continue to be dominated by the existing Cargill facility and the highway. There would, however, be an increase in truck noise in the near vicinity of the energy center due to increased usage of trucks for coal delivery under the proposed project, compared to the historical use of barges as the primary means for coal delivery. The volume of truck traffic transporting feedstock (mainly coal and limestone) and removing wastes (mainly fly ash and bottom ash) would total less than 88 daily roundtrips. This represents almost 50 additional roundtrips per day when compared to historic truck traffic volumes. See Section 3.13, Traffic and Transportation, fora discussion of the number of trucks and barges anticipated during operations.Overall, the project would result in minor, long-term noise impactsto noise receptors. Upon final design and selection of equipment for the oxy-combustion and CO2 capture system, potential noise mitigation measures may be incorporated. These could include sound enclosures or sound dampening materials or equipment, asappropriate. DOE anticipates that any increase in vibration due to operation of the oxy-combustion facility would be negligible. CO2 Pipeline The potential pipeline would be buried except where the pipeline would cross a vertical rock outcropping and where it would be necessary to come to the surface for valves and metering. Potential noise impacts from aboveground equipment are anticipated to be negligible during operations. CO2 Storage Study Area Operations at the injection well site(s) would consist of pumping CO2 underground and maintaining the injection wells. The noise-generating equipment at the injection well site(s) under normal operating conditions would be dominated by the well annulus maintenance and monitoring systems and typical heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems. The well annulus maintenance and monitoring system would be located inside the equipment room of the site control and maintenance building, which would attenuate the noise levels. Under emergency conditions, there could also be operation of a backup emergency generator(s) capable of producing 1,111 kW (generating approximately 81 dBA), and emergency exhaust fans. This emergency equipment would be operated rarely and only for short durations. If a conservative level of 81 dBA is assumed, the noise at 500feet away would be heard as 61 dBA, which is below the HUD acceptable level of 65 dBA. Since the nearest sensitive receptors at the injection well site(s) are expected to be farther than 500 feet away, the noise impacts from operational equipment attheinjection well site(s) would be minor. During maintenance, certain activities such as acidizing and swabbing could temporarily increase sound levels equal to or less than those presented in Table 3.14-11 for general construction noise. If conducted, these activities would likely take place during initial drilling activities or annual workover activities. Additionally, the occasional transport of by-products generated during maintenance activities, would also contribute to temporary increases in noise. However, these sources would have a minimal impact on the local noise levels. Due to the temporary nature of the maintenance activities and the small volume of vehicles accessing the sites, noise impacts are considered negligible to moderate, depending on the distance tothe nearestreceptors. Educational Facilities Operational noise from stationary sources attheeducational facilities would be negligible. The onlylikely outdoor source of noise would possibly be the backup generator and the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning units. Traffic Noise during Operations (For All Project Components) Noise would be generated by mobile sources during operations, including employee and truck traffic at the energy center, injection wells, and educational facilities. The primary source of noise from mobile sources during operations of the proposed project would be the trucks transporting feedstock (mainly coal and limestone) and removing wastes (mainly fly ash and bottom ash) from the Meredosia Energy Center. See Section 3.13, Traffic and Transportation, for a discussion about the number of vehicles accessing the project sites andimpacts fromtraffic. DOE anticipates minimal impacts to the noise environment from mobile noise sources due to operations of the proposed project. Table 3.14-16 presents noise predictions of Leq(h) for representative receptors within 328 feet of nearby roadways during energy center operations. There would be only a slight increase in the level of traffic noise for receptors adjacent to nearby roadways when compared to the no action alternative. These changes in noise would be barely perceptible when compared to existing conditions. 3.14.4 Impacts of the No Action Alternative Under the no action alternative, DOE would not provide cost-shared funding for the FutureGen 2.0 Project. Although the Alliance may still elect to construct and operate the project in the absence of DOE cost-shared funding, for the purposes of the analysis in this EIS, DOE assumed that the no action alternative is equivalent to a no-build alternative. Therefore, the project would not be constructed and there would be no change to noise and vibration. 3.15 UTILITIES 3.15.1 Introduction This section describes the existing utility systems that may be affected by the construction and operation of the FutureGen 2.0 Project, including potable and process water supply, wastewater treatment, electricity,andnatural gas,as well as the associated direct and indirect impacts that mayoccur. 3.15.1.1 Region of Influence The ROI for utility systems includes the existing public utility infrastructure and facilities that would provide service to the FutureGen 2.0 Project, including potable and non-potable water, wastewater, electricity, and natural gas. The ROI also includes existing pipelines, transmission lines, and other utility lines that lie within or cross the proposed project areas in Morgan County. Utility systems that may be affected are locatedprimarilyin Morgan County. 3.15.1.2 Method of Analysis and Factors Considered The estimated utility consumption for the FutureGen 2.0 Project was compared to the existing utility demand to determine whether the proposed project would strain any of the existing utility systems. The potential for impacts to utility systems were assessed based on whether the proposed project would directly or indirectly: • Impact the effectiveness ofexistingutilityinfrastructure or cause temporary failure; • Affect the capacity and distribution of local and regional utility suppliers to meet the existing or anticipateddemand;or • Require public utility systemupgrades. 3.15.1.3 Regulatory Framework The Public Utilities Act (220 ILCS 5) and the regulations of the Illinois Commerce Commission regulate public utilities in Illinois. These laws do not apply to utilities run by municipalities or rural electric Co-Ops, which are governed by local ordinances or by their own rules. The service area of the Illinois Rural Electric Cooperative includes the majority of the ROI, including the village of Meredosia, the city of Jacksonville, and the area encompassed by the CO2 pipeline corridor. The service area of the Menard Electric Cooperative includes the area encompassed by the proposed CO2 storage study area. The Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator is the Regional Transmission Organization responsible for reliability coordination and regional planningfor electrical transmission. Illinois regulations state that an entity acting in the capacity of a utility must obtain a permit issued by an officer of the elected governing body before entering a highway ROW (92 IAC 530); and that any entity connecting to a public potable water supplyrequires a permit (35 IAC 174). 3.15.2 Affected Environment 3.15.2.1 Meredosia Energy Center Water Usage According to the Meredosia Water Department, the Meredosia Water Plant serves approximately 450 users within the village of Meredosia. The Meredosia Water Plant pumps approximately 65,000 gpd to its service area and has an overall capacity to provide 500,000 gpd. The Meredosia Water Plant currently operates at 13 percent of its total capacity and has approximately 435,000 gpd of additional capacityfor public watersupply (Hull 2011). The Meredosia Energy Center has historically used well water as its source for drinking water as well as for freeze protection of the bottom ash pond piping during the winter months when necessary. Information on well water usage at the Meredosia Energy Center and surrounding areas is covered in Section 3.5, Groundwater. The energy center has historically utilized city water from the Meredosia Water Plant for fire protection and Unit 4 floor wash. Since the suspension of operations at the end of 2011, the energy center has greatly reduced its well water usage as only minimal amounts of drinking water are required by the few maintenance and security personnel onsite, and city water is only required for general maintenance. Process water was historically supplied to theMeredosia Energy Center froma combination of well water and river water sources. Information on well water usage for process water at the Meredosia Energy Center and surrounding areas is discussed in Section 3.5, Groundwater. Historic demand on the Illinois River for process water at the Meredosia Energy Center is discussed in Section 3.6, Surface Water. Wastewater The village of Meredosia sewer system routes sanitary sewage to three large evaporative settling ponds north of Meredosia. According to the Meredosia Water Department, the settling ponds have sufficient available capacityforfuture demands (Hull 2012b). Historically, the Meredosia Energy Center generated wastewater from both sanitary facilities and industrial processes. Sanitary wastewater was collected and routed to a single point of discharge to the village of Meredosia sewer system. Process wastewater was either recycled as practicable or treated onsite and discharged to the Illinois River. Process wastewater was not discharged to a public wastewater treatment facility. Since the suspension of operations at the Meredosia Energy Center, only a minimal amount of wastewater is generated bythe fewmaintenance and securitypersonnel onsite. Electricity Prior to suspension of operations, the nominal rated generating capacity of the combined four generating units at Meredosia Energy Center was 549 MWe. A portion of this generating capacitywas used to power the energy center facilities. Existing electrical infrastructure is located onsite, including medium and low voltage systems, transmission towers, and substations. Since the suspension of operations at the Meredosia Energy Center, the site has required a limited supply of electricityfor buildingmaintenance. Natural Gas Prior to suspension of operations, Ameren Illinois provided natural gas to the Meredosia Energy Center via a natural gas substation on the north end of the energy center property, which is fed by an existing natural gas pipeline that runs under the Illinois River. The pipeline supplied fuel for Boiler 6 ignition and additional minor plantprocesses. Since the suspension of operations at the Meredosia Energy Center, the site does not require natural gas with the exception of potential use for the back-up generatoratthe microwave tower. 3.15.2.2 CO2 Pipeline, CO2 Storage Study Area, and Educational Facilities Water Usage The North Morgan County Water Co-Op currently supplies water to approximately 520users in the area of the CO2 pipeline and storage study area and pumps approximately 90,000 gpd. The North Morgan County Water Co-Op has the capacity to pump 2 mgd and is currently operatingat 4.5 percentcapacity. The North Morgan County Water Co-Op buys their water from the Jacksonville Water Department, which supplies water to the city of Jacksonville from the Jacksonville Water Plant. The Jacksonville Water Plant currently pumps approximately 3.5 to 4 mgd, has the capacityto pump approximately 9 mgd, and is currently operating at 44 percent capacity (Cole2011). Wastewater The Jacksonville Sewer Plant provides service to residents within Jacksonville. The Jacksonville Sewer Plant has the capacity to process 7.57 mgd, but has the capability of increasing capacity to 15 mgd during wet weather. The Jacksonville Sewer Plant currently processes approximately 5.0 mgd and operates at 66 percent of normal (i.e., dry weather) capacity. The sewer plant serves a residential population of approximately 24,000residents(City ofJacksonville 2012c). There is no public wastewater treatment system serving the rural portions of the ROI that encompass the CO2 pipelinecorridor or storage study area. Septic tanks are primarilyutilizedin these areas. Electricity The service area of the Illinois Rural Electric Cooperative includes the city of Jacksonville and the area encompassed by the CO2 pipeline corridor (Shelby Electric Cooperative 2011). Ameren Illinois also provideselectricity throughout the ROI (JacksonvilleMunicipal Department 2012). Electricity in the vicinity of the CO2 storage study area is currently provided by Menard Electric Cooperative from a three-phase 12.5-kV line running along the west side of Morgan County Road (CR) 123. The nearest Menard Electric Cooperative substation is approximately 3.5 miles east of the CO2 storage studyareaatthe intersectionof RileyRoadandCR18W in western Sangamon County. Natural Gas AmerenIllinois providesnatural gas service withinthe ROI(Jacksonville Municipal Department 2012). 3.15.3 Impacts of Proposed Action 3.15.3.1 Construction Impacts Impacts to public utility systems would occur from increased demand and could potentially impact a utility system’s ability to provide sufficient service for its users. Existing utilities infrastructure could inadvertently be damaged or have service disrupted during construction of the FutureGen 2.0 Project. The potential for accidental damage or service disruption during construction would vary based on proposed construction methods and proximity to existing utility systems, but would be greatest during trenching activities. To minimize the possible interference with existing overhead or underground utility lines, all proposed construction ROWs would have sufficient width to allow for the safe use of construction equipment and installation of proposed project-related infrastructure and facilities. Specifically, crossings of other pipelines (i.e., not the CO2 pipeline) and other underground utilities would require a minimum of 12 inches of separation; the minimum separation may be increased to 24 inches where considered prudent. Existing pipelines would be under-crossed unless over-crossing is specifically permitted by the pipeline owner. The Alliance would ensure that alignments of existing utilities (e.g., electric, telephone, cable, water, gas, and sewer) would be located and demarcated prior to construction, and coordination with affected utility providers would continue throughout final engineering and design. Also, where appropriate, the Alliance would implement measures (e.g. vacuum excavation) to decrease the potential for construction equipment, particularly trenching equipment, to sever or damage existing underground lines. Should a disruption of an existing utility service occur in the event of a construction accident, it is anticipated thatimpacts would beshortterm and minor. Meredosia Energy Center Water Usage During construction, potable water for workers, as well as any water requirements for construction activities, would be provided by either existing wells at the Meredosia Energy Center or water tanks transported onsite via trucks. For purposes of analysis, it is assumed that water for the tanks would be supplied by the Meredosia Water Plant. An estimated average demand of 15 gpd of potable water per employee would be consumed during construction of the oxy-combustion facility. Based on a peak of 500 workers at the height of construction at the Meredosia Energy Center, maximum daily water consumption during construction would be 7,500 gpd. If water tanks supply all potable water needs for construction, the Meredosia Energy Center would require 1.7 percent of the Meredosia Water Plant’s current unused capacity. Water demand would not exceed available capacity of the Meredosia Water Plant andimpacts to potable water providers are expectedto be shortterm and negligible. The Alliance currently does not plan to construct additional water lines; however, in the future, they may extend the existing city water line onsite to provide water needs. This would not adversely impact the villageofMeredosiapublicwater utilities. Wastewater Sanitary wastewater during construction would be generated by workers onsite. Based on typical sanitary wastewater generation rates for construction projects, 15 gpd of sanitary wastewater generation per employee during construction is assumed (Liu and Lipták 1997). Based on a peak of 500 workers at the height of construction, maximum daily sanitary wastewater generation would be 7,500 gpd. Portable toilets and hand-wash stations would be provided for construction workers and serviced regularly. The ultimate sanitary wastewater disposal would be determined during the construction phase; however, it is assumed that the sanitary wastewater would be disposed of at permitted sewage treatment facilities with sufficient capacity, and would not adversely impact local utilities. Impacts to wastewater treatment providers would beshortterm and negligible. The Alliance currently does not plan to construct additional sewer lines; however, in the future, they may re-route the sanitary wastewater piping on the energy center site. This would not adversely impact the village of Meredosia sewer system. Electricity The construction of upgrades to the existing electrical infrastructure at the Meredosia Energy Center would be necessary. New electrical equipment and connections would be installed to provide power to the various components of the oxy-combustion facility. Existing overhead transmission and distribution lines would be re-routed, which would require the demolition of existing towers and construction of new towers. Impacts from the demolition and construction of these electrical structures would occur solely on the project siteand would not disrupt local utilities’ ability to provide service. It is assumed that electricity needs during construction would be provided by the public electrical grid (i.e., a local utility) to be spot supplemented by portable generators. Overall utility impacts from electricityusage duringconstruction would be negligible. Natural Gas The Alliance does not anticipate a need for natural gas during construction nor anyconstruction involving natural gas lines; therefore, no impacts to natural gas providers would occur. CO2 Pipeline, CO2 Storage Study Area, and Educational Facilities Water Usage During construction of the CO2 pipeline, injection wells, and educational facilities, it is assumed that potable water would be provided via water tanks transported to the sites by trucks. For purposes of analysis, DOE assumed that water tanks for construction of the CO2 pipeline and injection well site(s) would be filled by the North Morgan County Water Co-Op (which purchases its water from the Jacksonville Water Department) and directly from the Jacksonville Water Department for construction of the educational facilities. For the dual-site scenario analyzed in the Draft EIS, which is no longer under consideration by the Alliance, construction activities would require up to 355 workers for construction at the CO2 pipeline and injection well sites and 87 workers for the construction of educational facilities. Based on an average of 15 gpd of potable water usage per worker, an estimated 5,325 gpd of potable water would be required from the North Morgan County Water Co-Op for construction at the CO2 pipeline and injection well sites, and an estimated 1,305 gpd of potable water would be required from the Jacksonville Water Department for construction of the educational facilities. This demand would represent less than 1 percent of unused capacity for the North Morgan County Water Co-Op and Jacksonville Water Department. The updated design for the single-site scenario currently proposed by the Alliance would require up to 335 workers for construction at the CO2 pipeline and injection well sites, and 47 workers for construction of the educational facilities. Based on an average of 15 gpd of potable water usage per worker, an estimated 5,025 gpd of potablewaterwould be required from theNorth Morgan County Water Co-Op for construction at the CO2 pipeline and injection well sites, and an estimated 705 gpd of potable water would be required from the Jacksonville Water Department for construction of the educational facilities. This demand would still represent less than 1 percent of unused capacity for the North Morgan County Water Co-Op and Jacksonville Water Department. Therefore, impacts from potable water needs during construction of the CO2 pipeline, injection well site(s), and educationalfacilities wouldbe negligible. The CO2 pipeline would undergo hydrostatic testing prior to operation. Water sources for hydrostatic testing have not been identified; however, if a public utility is utilized, impacts would be temporary (i.e., less than two days). Water would be trucked to the pipeline via tanks and would only be sourced from local utilities with sufficient capacity. Impacts to local water utilities from hydrostatic testing would be temporary and minor. Water would be required for the drilling of the injection and monitoring wells. Volumes needed for construction of the injection wells would be greater than the amount used for drilling the stratigraphic well because of the larger well diameters. For the dual-site scenario analyzed in the Draft EIS, up to 4.8 million gallons of water would be required to drill two vertical injection wells. The updated design for the single-site scenario currently proposed by the Alliance would require four horizontal injection wells to be drilled, and would require up to 8.68 million gallons of water. DOE estimates the maximum volume each injection well would require would be approximately 1,330,000 gallons of water for drilling fluids and cement preparation, and another 840,000 gallons of water to account for zones of lost circulation. Thus, the total water demand per well drilled would be approximately 2.17 million gallons. Assuming a drilling duration of 100 to 120 days, between 18,000 and 21,700 gpd of water would be required to drill each well. The monitoring wells would likely require an amount less than this, since they would be smaller in diameter and shallower than the injection wells. The water for construction of the injection and monitoring wells would be supplied by water trucks using water from the North Morgan County Water Co-Op and from other nearby sources. If the North Morgan County Water Co-Op were tosupplyall water needed, drillingof each injection well would require between 1 and 1.25 percent of its daily un-used capacity. Overall, construction impacts to water utilities would be short term and minor. Wastewater During construction of the CO2 pipeline, injection well site(s), and educational facilities, sanitary wastewater would be generated by construction workers. For the dual-site scenario analyzed in the Draft EIS, a maximum of 442 employees would be employed during the construction phase. Assuming that 15 gpd of sanitary wastewater would be generated per worker, a maximum total of 6,630 gpd of sanitary wastewater would be generated during construction for the CO2 pipeline, injection well site(s), and educational facilities. The updated design for the single-site scenario currently proposed by the Alliance would require a maximum of 382 employees during construction. Assuming the same 15 gpd per worker generation rate for sanitary wastewater, a maximum total of 5,730 gpd of sanitary wastewater would be generated during construction of the CO2 pipeline, injection well site(s), and educationalfacilities. Portable toilets and hand-wash stations would be provided for construction workers. These self-contained portable units would be serviced regularly and the effluent would be collected and hauled to permitted sewage treatment facilities by licensed waste transporters. For purposes of this analysis, DOE assumed that all sanitary wastewater would be trucked offsite to the Jacksonville Sewer Plant. Under this scenario, a demand of less than 1 percent of the Jacksonville Sewer Plant’s available capacity would occur; therefore, negligible impacts would be anticipated. Spent hydrotest water from CO2 pipeline hydrostatic testing would be discharged to local waterways under an NPDES permit from the IEPA or to an existing treatment facility. If hydrotest water is discharged to a treatment facility, a permitted facility with sufficient capacitywould be utilized and impactstolocal utilities would be negligible. During construction of the wells, excess fluids generated during drilling, discarded water used in the cementing process, and spent drilling mud from mud change-outs would be discharged to lined earthen pits at the construction site. For purposes of this analysis, DOE assumed that wastewater would be transported offsite by licensed waste transporters and disposed of at permitted sewage treatment facilities withsufficient capacity, and would not adversely impact local utilities. Electricity Electricity needs during construction for the CO2 pipeline, injection well site(s), and educational facilities would beprovided by portable generatorsand would not impact local utilities. Natural Gas No natural gas would be required for construction; therefore, no impacts to natural gas providers would occur. 3.15.3.2 Operational Impacts Meredosia Energy Center Water Usage Water from the Meredosia Water Plant would be utilized for fire protection and the oxy-combustion boiler floor wash. Approximately 5,000 gpd of Meredosia Water Plant water would be used during operations. The Alliance plans to use onsite wells for drinking water purposes during operation of the FutureGen 2.0 Project at the Meredosia Energy Center, though use of city water may be considered in the future. If city water is used for potable water, the estimated maximum of 115 employees could consume up to 1,725 gpd of water. At a maximum, the use of city water for fire protection, floor wash, and possibly potable water for employees would represent less than 1 percent of the Meredosia Water Plant’s unused capacity, and impacts would benegligible.  Process water would not impact utilities as it would be supplied by a combination of well water and river water sources during operation. Impacts on well water usage are discussed in Section 3.5, Groundwater. River water impacts are discussed in Section3.6, Surface Water. Wastewater Process wastewater would be generated from process contact wastewater, noncontact cooling water (once-through and tower blowdown), backwash from the intake screen, and oily effluent from floor and equipment drains. Process wastewater generated from operation of the oxy-combustion facility at the Meredosia Energy Center would be treated onsite and discharged to the Illinois River and, therefore, would not impact any public wastewater treatment facility. Impacts from treated process wastewater are discussed in Section3.6, Surface Water. Sanitary wastewater would be collected and routed to a single point of discharge to the Meredosia sewer system, which discharges to settling ponds north of the village. An annual average discharge of 5,000 gpd of sanitary wastewater would be anticipated. This daily amount of additional discharge to the settling ponds would have negligible impacts on systemcapacity. Electricity Gross electrical generation from operation of the FutureGen 2.0 Project would be approximately 168 MWe. The proposed auxiliary electric power demand to operate the Meredosia Energy Center would be less than69 MWe. Thiswould resultin anet output of at least 99 MWeofelectricity. No impacts to public electric utility providers are anticipated as a result of operation of the Meredosia EnergyCenter. Natural Gas Natural gas would be required for heating purposes during operations. This would be supplied by the existing natural gas pipeline serving the oxy-combustion facility and would be less than historical levels of natural gas consumption, because natural gas would no longer be utilized for boiler startups. Overall impacts to natural gas utilities wouldbe negligible. CO2 Pipeline, CO2 Storage Study Area, and Educational Facilities Water Usage During operation of the CO2 injection well site(s), potable water for the surface facilities would be supplied by the North Morgan County Water Co-Op via an extension of its 4-inch line along Beilschmidt Road. For the dual-site scenario analyzed in the Draft EIS, which is no longer under consideration by the Alliance, 21 employees per day would be employed at the CO2 injection well site(s), and assuming a 15-gpd consumption rate of potable water, 315 gpd of water would be consumed during operations. This would represent a less than 1 percent increase in the capacity of the North Morgan County Water Co-Op. The updated design for the single-site scenario currently proposed by the Alliance would require up to 15 employees per day. Assuming a similar 15-gpd per worker consumption rate of potable water, 225 gpd of water would be consumed during operations. This would still represent a less than 1 percent increase in the capacity of the North Morgan County Water Co-Op; therefore, impacts to public water utilities would belong term but negligible. Potable water use for the educational facilities is projected at 15 gpd for each employee and 10 gallons per visitor. Under the original design analyzed in theDraft EIS, one buildingwould housethe visitor and research center, while a second building would house the training facility; annual potable water use would be 270,000 gallons, or approximately 740 gpd, for the visitor and research center and 215,000 gallons, or approximately 590 gpd, for the training facility. Thus, the total potable water use by the educational facilities would be 1,330 gpd. Under the current conceptual design, all visitor, research, and training facilities would be housed in one building, and approximately 485,000 gallons of water would be used per year. Regardless of the scenario, potable water would be supplied by the Jacksonville Water Department and would represent less than 1 percent of available capacity; therefore, impacts to water utilities wouldbe long term but negligible. No process water would be required to operate the CO2 injection well site(s) or educational facilities. Hydrostatic testing may be required every 3 to 5 years for maintenance of the CO2 pipeline. Water for hydrostatic testing would be obtained from available sources and trucked to the testing sites with negligibleimpacts on localwaterutilities. Wastewater Sanitary wastewater generated at the CO2 injection well site(s) would be disposed onsite and would not impact localwastewater utilities. The sanitary wastewater generation by the educational facilities is projected at 15 gpd for each employee and 10 gallons per visitor. Under the original design analyzed in the Draft EIS, one building would house the visitor and research center, while a separate building would house the training facility; annual sanitary wastewater generation would be 270,000 gallons, or approximately 740 gpd, for the visitor and research center and 215,000 gallons, or approximately 590 gpd, for the training facility. Thus, total sanitary wastewater generation from the educational facilities would be 1,330 gpd. Under the current conceptual design, all visitor, research, and training facilities would be housed in one building, and approximately 485,000 gallons of sanitary wastewater would be generated per year. Regardless of the scenario, the Alliance intends to site the educational facilities within the service area of the Jacksonville Sewer Plant. The predicted sanitary discharge by the facilities would represent a less than 1 percent demand on the available capacity of Jacksonville Sewer Plant; therefore, impacts to wastewater utilities would be long term but negligible. Electricity Based on electric power availability, valves for the mainline block valves would be operated by electric motor or gas-over-oil hydraulic actuators. A 6-hour uninterruptible power supply for critical instrumentation would be provided for these structures along the CO2 pipeline. Backup power generationwould beprovided incase of longer durationoutages. During operation of the injection wells, meter station data would be transported to the site control building through the SCADA telecommunication network. Utilities for monitoring wells are assumed to be wireless; however, if electrical lines are constructed to reach each monitoring well site, a negligible increase in electricity consumption would occur during operations. An alternative for supplying electricity to monitoring wells would be photovoltaic solar panels with batteries at each monitoring well location. Since publication of the Draft EIS, DOE obtained additional information on changes to existing utility infrastructure that would be needed to supply electricity to the injection site. Surface facilities at the injection wells for the dual-site scenario, which would include the two 710 horsepower booster pumps, would require approximately 1.1 MWe(or approximately 800 MWh per month) of electricity per year. The updated single-site scenario currently proposed by the Alliance would require approximately 9,000 kWh of electricity per year. Menard Electric Cooperative has analyzed the impact to their system to supply electricity to the surface facilities. If the building requires three-phase electrical service, there would be new above-ground wooden poles and wires placed along Martin Road from Negus Road to the site, a distance of one mile. If the building can be served with single-phase electrical service, the service would be from the existing line at the corner of Beilschmidt Road and Martin Road. Under the original scenario of one building housing the visitor and research center and a separate building housing the training facility, the educational facilities would require a total annual energy use of 435,000 kWh and 400,000 kWh, respectively. Under the current conceptual design, all visitor, research, and training facilities would be housed in one building, and approximately 830,000 kWh of electricity per year would be used. Regardless of scenario, preliminary energy modeling shows that the facilities could use less than these amounts. Electricity would be provided by existing sources within Jacksonville and the additional demandis not anticipated toimpact local utilities. Backup power at the surface facilities of the CO2 injection wells would be provided by a diesel generator and would be sufficientto operateall of the surface facility buildings functions. Natural Gas The educational facilities may use natural gas for space and water heating. Under the original scenario of one building housing the visitor and research center and a separate building housing the training facility, the maximumannual usages were projected to be 8,000 therms for the visitor and researchcenter and 2,000 therms for the training facility. Under the current conceptual design, all visitor, research, and training facilities would be housed in one building, and maximum annual usage is projected to be 15,300 therms per year. Regardless of scenario, natural gas would be provided via connections to existing gas pipelines within Jacksonville and would result in long-term but negligible impacts to natural gas utilities. DOE assumes that connections to existing natural gas supply infrastructure would be readily available inand around thecity of Jacksonville. Backup power to the educational facilities would be provided by a natural gas-fueled generator. The capacity of the generatorwould be sufficient to operateall buildingfunctions during an outage. 3.15.4 Impacts of the No Action Alternative Under the no action alternative, DOE would not provide cost-shared funding for the FutureGen 2.0 Project. Although the Alliance may still elect to construct and operate the project in the absence of DOE cost-shared funding, for the purposes of the analysis in this EIS, DOE assumed the no action alternative is equivalent to the no-build alternative. Therefore, the project would not be constructed and there would be no change to utilities. Because the Meredosia Energy Center suspended operations at the end of 2011, the noactionalternative wouldnot restore electrical generatingcapacityat thefacility. INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK 3.16 COMMUNITY SERVICES 3.16.1 Introduction This section describes the community services potentially directly and indirectly affected by the construction and operation of the FutureGen 2.0 Project, including emergency response, lawenforcement, fire protection, healthcare services, and local school systems, as well as the anticipated impacts from the proposed project. 3.16.1.1 Region of Influence The ROI for community services includes Morgan, Brown, Cass, Pike, and Scott counties. These are the counties in which DOE expects almost all construction and operations workers would live, and they are the counties that would primarily provide law enforcement, fire, and emergency services needed as a result of the FutureGen 2.0 Project. The proposed project would occur entirely within Morgan County, which isthe county wherecommunity services would be most affected. Morgan County adjoins Brown, Cass, Pike, and Scott counties. Morgan County is also bordered by Greene, Sangamon, and Macoupin counties; however, these three counties are relatively farther away from the sites of the proposed project; therefore, community services in these three counties are not anticipated to beimpacted by the proposed project andwere not analyzed. 3.16.1.2 Method of Analysis and Factors Considered To evaluate the effects of the FutureGen 2.0 Project on community services, DOE considered the potential impacts of the proposed project on existing service levels, response times, and other performance objectives. Potential impacts were assessed based on whether construction and operation of the proposed project would: • Displace, impede effective access to, or increase demand beyond available capacities of emergency response services, fire protection, law enforcement, healthcare facilities, and school systems in the ROI; or • Conflict with local and regional plans for emergency response services, fire protection, law enforcement, healthcarefacilities,or school systems. 3.16.1.3 Regulatory Framework Community services are generally regulated by county and municipal governments based on state and national standards and guidelines. Local planning commissions (or regional agencies) are responsible for studying the needs and conditions of a region and for developing strategies that enhance the region's community services. Capacities and effective access to community services are addressed in regional plans and municipal ordinances. Local governments also have primary responsibility for response to and recovery from disasters and emergencies. The Morgan County Regional Planning Commission is responsible for regional planning in Morgan County (Morgan County 2012). The IEMA assists local governments when their capabilities are exceeded(IEMA 2011). 3.16.2 Affected Environment 3.16.2.1 Meredosia Energy Center, CO2 Pipeline, CO2 Storage Study Area, and Educational Facilities The Meredosia Energy Center, CO2 pipeline corridor, and the CO2 storage study area are located in Morgan County. The educational facilities are expected to be located in or near Jacksonville, Illinois, which is also in Morgan County. Emergency Response The IEMA is responsible for preparing Illinois for natural, man-made, or technological disasters, hazards, or acts of terrorism, and assists local governments when their capabilitiesareexceeded (IEMA 2011). The IEMA maintains the Illinois Emergency Operations Plan and coordinates the state's disaster mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery programs and activities (IEMA 2010). The IEMA maintains a 24hour Communication Center and State Emergency Operations Center. The State Emergency Operations Center leads crisis/consequence management response and operations to notify, activate, deploy, and employstate resources. The IEMA supports disaster stricken communities, however, historically has not included emergency medical services, fire services, technical rescue, urban search and rescue, or hazardous materials operations teams. The Mutual Aid Box Alarm System works in partnership with the IEMA to mobilize local emergency medical, municipal fire, and special operations assets in order to provide a comprehensive statewide mutual aid response system (MABAS 2011). During an emergency, system alarms provide speed of response by emergency resources. The Mutual Aid Box Alarm System’s emergencyresources include approximately 1,000 ofthe state’s 1,200 fire departments; 35,000 of Illinois’ 40,000 firefighters; more than 1,500 fire stations; 2,495 engine companies; 469 ladder trucks; 1,100 ambulances (mostly paramedic capable); 297 heavy rescue squads; and 788 water tenders (MABAS 2011). An additional 1,000 emergency vehicles are provided by fire/emergency medical services reserve units. The Mutual Aid Box Alarm System also offers 42 specialized operations teams for hazardous materials, as well as certified fire investigators that can be "packaged" as teams for larger incidentsrequiring complicated and time-consumingefforts foranysingle agency. A volunteer ambulance service provides emergency response in Meredosia. Response times average between 5 to 10 minutes. Two ambulance providers operate in the city of Jacksonville (Lifestar and American), as well as paramedic services that operate from Passavant Area Hospital in Jacksonville. Emergency response services in Meredosia and Jacksonville are categorized as sufficient (Werries 2012; Kluge 2012). Fire Protection There are 8 fire departments in Morgan County and a total of 25 fire stations in Brown, Cass, Pike, and Scott counties. The Meredosia Fire Department is located less than 1 mile from the energy center in the village of Meredosia. The city of Jacksonville is served by the Jacksonville Fire Department. The Jacksonville Fire Department also provides fire protection services outside of the city limits to residences or private entities that purchase a rural fire protection contract. For those residences or entities that do not purchase a rural fire protection contract, the nearest volunteer fire department is dispatched to the incident (Kluge 2012). Table 3.16-1 summarizes fire protectionstatisticswithinthe ROI. Table 3.16-1.

There is one hospital located in the adjacent counties, Pittsfield’s Illini Community Hospital, located in Pike County. There are no hospitals in Brown, Cass, or Scott counties (IDPH 2011).

The Draft EIS analyzed the need for up to 942 construction workers for the proposed project, which would be limitedin duration but would likely cause a small influx of temporary residents. The current design of the proposed project would require approximately 882 construction workers. DOE anticipates that most of the potential workers for the construction phase would already reside in the ROI as included in the county labor pools; however, some construction workers with specialized training, and workers employed by contractors from outside the ROI, would be brought into the area. Most workers would be expected to commute to the construction sites on a daily basis, while some would relocate to the area for the duration of the construction period. Section 3.18, Socioeconomics, addresses the potential influx of temporary construction workers and the effects on population and housing. Meredosia Energy Center, CO2 Pipeline, CO2 Storage Study Area, and Educational Facilities Emergency Response Section 3.17, Human Health and Safety, addresses the potential for accidents and injuries during construction for the FutureGen 2.0 Project based on projects comparable in size and scope. Emergencies during construction of the proposed project would not be expected to increase the demand for emergency services beyond current available capacity. As discussed in Section 3.16.2.1, the ROI is served by an adequate emergency staff locally, supplemented by services throughout Illinois that would be available for local response. Therefore, the potential impacts to emergency services during construction of project components would be negligible. Section 3.13, Traffic and Transportation, discusses the potential increase in automobile accidents as a result of increased truck traffic during construction, which could affect the demand for emergency services and response times. The overall impact on emergency response due to increased traffic in the area wouldbe negligible. Fire Protection Construction of the FutureGen 2.0 Project would involve the use of flammable and combustible materials that could pose an increased risk of fire or explosion. However, the probability of a significant fire or explosion during construction is very low, as described in Section 3.17, Human Health and Safety. The Illinois fire departments within the ROI have the capacity and are equipped to respond to a major fire emergency during construction at the Meredosia Energy Center, CO2 pipeline, injection wells, and educational facilities. All fire departments within the ROI are members of the state’s mutual aid agreement, and any of these fire departments would be available to assist in a fire emergency if needed. Any incidents that may occur during construction for the proposed project would not increase the demand for fire protection services beyond the available capacity of currently existing services, nor would construction activities displace any fire protection facilities, conflict with local and regional plans for fire protectionservices, or impede access forfire protectionservices. Thus, potential impacts to fire protection services due to construction of the proposed project would benegligible. Law Enforcement As discussed in Section 3.18, Socioeconomics, construction jobs created by the proposed project could cause a small increase in temporary residents within the ROI; however, most construction workers are expected to be drawn from county labor pools and would already reside within the ROI. An increase in temporary residents would result in additional calls for service. Given the adequate existing capacity, law enforcement services could accommodate the temporary increase in population. Construction for the proposed project would not displace any law enforcement facilities, impact law enforcement access, or conflict with local and regional plans for law enforcement services. Therefore, potential impacts to law enforcement due to construction of the project would be negligible. Healthcare Services The five-county ROI ratio of 1.9 beds per 1,000 residents is lower than the Hill-Burton Act standard of 4.5 hospital beds per 1,000 residents The Hill-Burton Act of 1946 and the state and national averages of 2.5 hospital beds per established the objective standard for the number of hospitals, beds, types 1,000 residents, mainly because Brown, Cass, and Scott counties lack of beds, and medical personnel hospital facilities. However, Morgan County has 3.4 beds per needed for every 1,000 people. The 1,000 residents, which is higher than the state and national averages. Hill-Burton standard is 4.5 beds per Although the project could result in a temporary increase in residents 1,000 residents (E-Notes 2011). possibly requiring medical care, such an increase is not anticipated to adversely affect the existing LOS at local hospitals. It is anticipated that the two nearest hospitals would be capable of meeting the healthcare service needs that would arise during construction. Construction for the FutureGen 2.0 Project also would not displace anyhealthcarefacilities, impactaccess to healthcare, or conflict with local and regional plans for healthcare services. Therefore, potential impacts to healthcare services due to construction of the project would be negligible. Local School System As noted above, DOE anticipates that most of the potential workers for the construction phase would already reside in the ROI as included in the county labor pools. Due to the temporary nature of the construction phase of the proposed project, it is unlikely that construction workers who reside outside of the ROI would permanently relocate their families, including school-age children, to the ROI. It is more likely that temporary workers who permanently reside outside of the ROI would seek short-term lodging for themselves duringthe workweek. In addition, construction of the proposed project would not displace school facilities or conflict with local and regional plans for school system capacity or enrollment. As a result, potential impacts to localschool systems due to construction would benegligible. 3.16.3.2 Operational Impacts Prior to suspension of operations at the end of 2011, the energy center employed approximately 57 personnel. Since the suspension of operations, a few maintenance and security personnel are onsite, as needed. The operations phase of the proposed project analyzed in the Draft EIS would employ approximately 130 to 158 full-time equivalent (FTE) employees (i.e., permanent and contract employees) as described for the oxy-combustion facility, CO2 injection wells, and educational facilities in respective sections of Chapter 2. The current design of the proposed project would employ approximately 124 to 152 FTE employees. Most of these workers would already reside in the ROI, while others would commute or relocate to the ROI. Section 3.18, Socioeconomics, addresses the potential influx of permanent workers and theeffects on population and housing. Meredosia Energy Center, CO2 Pipeline, CO2 Storage Study Area, and Educational Facilities Emergency Response Section 3.17, Human Health and Safety, addresses the potential for accidents and injuries during operation of the FutureGen 2.0 Project based on comparable projects of size and scope. Emergencies during operations would not be expected to increase the demand for emergency services beyond the current available capacities described in Section 3.16.2.1. In addition, a comprehensive statewide mutual aid response systemis in place to notify, activate, and deploy emergency response resources to the ROI in the event of an emergency. The operation of the project would not displace any emergency response facilities, conflict with local and regional plans for emergency response services, or impede access to emergency response services. Therefore, the potential impacts to emergency services during operations would benegligible. Section 3.13, Traffic and Transportation, discusses the potential increase in automobile accidents as a result of increased truck traffic due to operations, which could affect the demand for emergency services and response times. The overall impact on emergency and disaster response due to increased traffic in the area wouldbe negligible. Section 3.17, Human Health and Safety, describes the risks of catastrophic accidents and intentionally destructive acts during operations of the FutureGen 2.0 Project. The risks to public health and safety are considered to be very low, and the emergencyresponse capabilities are expected to be adequate toaddress these risks. Fire Protection Operation of the proposed project would involve the use of flammable and combustible materials that pose an increased risk of fire or explosion at the project site; however, the probability of a significant fire or explosion is very low as described in Section 3.17, Human Health and Safety. Prior to operation of the proposed project, copies of the MSDSs (that provide the information needed to allow the safe handling of hazardous substances) for the process materials and chemicals to be stored and used would be provided to the local fire departments. The Illinois fire departments within the ROI have the capacity and are equipped to respond to a major fire emergency. All fire departments within the ROI are members of the state’s mutual aid agreement and any of these fire departments would be available to assist in a fire emergency if needed. Operation of the proposed project would not displace any fire protection facilities, nor would it conflict with local and regional plans for fire protection services. Any incidents that may occur during operation for the proposed project would not increase the demand on fire protection services beyond the available capacity of existing services. Thus, the potential impact to fire protection services due to operations would be negligible. Law Enforcement A small potential increase in population as a result of operations of the FutureGen 2.0 Project would have a negligible effect on the ratio of law enforcement officers per 1,000 residents. In addition, the average crime rate in the five-county ROI is less than half of the state and national averages, indicating that existing law enforcement services are appropriately staffed and would be capable of handling any small long-term increase in population. Operation of the proposed project would not displace or impede access to any law enforcement facilities, nor would it conflict with local and regional plans for law enforcement services. Therefore, potential impacts to lawenforcement due to operations would be negligible. Healthcare Services Currently, healthcare capacity within the five-county ROI is 1.9 hospital beds per 1,000 residents, which is lower than the Hill-Burton Act standard and state and national averages, mainly because Brown, Cass, and Scott counties lack hospital facilities. However, Morgan County has 3.4 beds per 1,000 residents, which is higher than the state and national averages. Although the project could result in a slight increase in residents possibly requiring medical care, such an increase is not anticipated to adversely affect the existing LOS at local hospitals even if all positions were filled by newcomers to the ROI with their families. Operations for the proposed project would not displace any healthcare facilities or conflict with local or regional plans for healthcare or emergency services. Therefore, potential impacts on healthcare services due to operationswould benegligible. Local School System Operations for the proposed project could result in the permanent relocation of families to the ROI and cause slight increases in the number of school-aged children. Because most workers are expected to be hired fromwithin the labor pool of the ROI, onlya small number of families with school-age children are expected to relocate to the ROI. Existing school facilities within Morgan County would have the capacity to accommodate the anticipated small increase in enrollment that may result from the proposed project, because class sizes in the ROI are currently smaller than the averages in the state and United States as discussed in Section 3.16.2.1. In addition, operation of the proposed project would not displace school facilities or conflict with local and regional plans for school system capacity or enrollment. Therefore, potentialimpacts onlocal schools dueto operations would be negligible. 3.16.4 Impacts of the No Action Alternative Under the no action alternative, DOE would not provide cost-shared funding for the proposed action. Although the Alliance may still elect to construct and operate the project in the absence of DOE cost-shared funding, for the purposes of the analysis in this EIS, DOE assumed that the no action alternative is equivalent to a no-build alternative. Therefore, the proposed action would not be constructed and there would beno changes in demand on community services. 3.17 HUMAN HEALTH AND SAFETY 3.17.1 Introduction This section describes the affected environment as it relates to occupational and human health and safety, and health and safety risks that could be associated with the FutureGen 2.0 Project. The section includes information on health and safety regulations, toxicity characteristics for relevant gases, worker safety and injury data, and data on populations that could potentially be affected. Health and safety risks were estimated based on the current design of the project, applicable DOE Guidance (DOE 2002; DOE 2004), applicable safety and spill prevention regulations, and expected operating procedures. DOE also considered federal, state, and local health and safety regulations, as well as industrial codes and standards that would govern work activities during construction and operation of the project to protect the health and safety of the workersand thepublic. 3.17.1.1 Region of Influence The ROI for human health, safety, accidents, and intentional destructive acts was determined based on maximumreasonably foreseeable accident release scenarios (i.e., the maximum release scenarios) and the area that could potentially be impacted by such releases. The ROI for potential releases from operation of the oxy-combustion facility was estimated to be 2 miles from the Meredosia Energy Center boundary. This distance was determined based on the maximum predicted distance for potential adverse health effects that could result from an accidental release of gases from the site. A distance of 2 miles from the centerline of the Alliance’s proposed pipeline corridor was used as the ROI for the CO2 pipeline, which was considered the distance within which a person could experience any adverse effects from an accidental pipeline release. As indicated in the impact analysis presented in Section 3.17.3, the actual distance at which adverse effects could occur would likely be substantially less than 2 miles. DOE considered an ROI for the injection well site(s) of 2 miles from the wells, representing the expected maximum lateral distance of the underground CO2 plume. The Alliance used data collected from the stratigraphic well to model the CO2 plume in support of the UIC permitting process. DOE used the modeling data to validate the ROI estimate for the maximum release scenarios, which showed that the maximumlateral distance of the plume after 20years of injection and 50 years of post-injection migration would beless than 2miles (Appendix G, Geological Report). 3.17.1.2 Method of Analysis and Factors Considered DOE assessed the potential for impacts to human health and safety, based on whether the FutureGen 2.0 Project would cause: • Worker health risks due to industrial accidents, injuries, or illnesses during construction and normal operating conditions; • Human health risks due to accidental releases of CO2 or other trace gases associated with captured CO2 during transport, active CO2 injection and storage activities, and following closure of the injectionwells; or • Human health risks due to intentional destructiveacts. Potential worker safety impacts were estimated based on national workplace injury, illness, and fatality rates. These rates were obtained from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and are based on similar industry sectors. The rates were applied to the numbers of employees anticipated during construction and operation of the project. From these data, the projected numbers of total recordable cases, lost work day cases, andfatalities were calculated. For chemical hazards, DOE considered a full range of potential accident scenarios, including the maximum release scenario. Potential accident scenarios were considered for each aspect of the oxycombustion facility, the CO2 pipeline, CO2 injection wells, and operational and post-injection releases from the formations used for the injection and storage of CO2. Chemical hazards, as well as other health and safety risk factors, were not considered a concern for the educational facilities based on the nature of activities expected at these facilities. The potential impacts from intentional destructive acts were evaluated based on the analysis ofthe maximumrelease fromthese scenarios. Accidents considered by DOE address concerns related to the potential release of CO2 and trace co-constituents that may be present, and related health effects that could occur from exposure. Each release scenario was carefully reviewed to determine the predicted frequency for which such an event could occur. DOE considered engineering design and controls, as well as available industry safety statistics, when determining the predicted frequency for each type of accident and release. See Section 3.17.1.3 for descriptions of frequencycategories. DOE used modeling results to assess potential health effects that could occur both for workers and the general public. To determine the nature of potential health effects, DOE compared potential exposure concentrations with health criteria published by USEPA, OSHA, and other industry groups (e.g., American Industrial Hygiene Association). See Section 3.17.1.3 for descriptors of health effects and published health criteria. Potential exposure concentrations at receptor locations were calculated by running industry standards or USEPA-approved air quality computer models. Each accident (release) scenario was evaluated through computer modeling to determine exposure concentrations at various distances from the point of release. Dense gases such as the captured CO2 were simulated using the SLAB model (Ermak 1990). The appropriate acute toxicity endpoints (presented in Section 3.17.1.4) were used to identify levels of exposure to chemicals thathave the potentialtoresult in adverse effects as a consequenceoftheexposure. CO2 is heavier than air and can asphyxiate persons located adjacent to a pipeline puncture or rupture, so this scenario would cause an acute health risk. Therefore, the potential for CO2 as a dense gas to accumulate in low areas or subsurface spaces is discussed with respect to the releases evaluated and the setting oftheenergycenter, pipeline, and injectionwells. DOE used the SLAB model (Ermak 1990) and the pipeline-walk methodology to evaluate health effects resulting from potential releases of CO2 and trace co-constituents such as hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, and sulfur trioxide that could be present in the CO2 stream in very low levels from the pipeline and proposed injection wells during operation.1 Under normal operations, the concentrations of the trace gases would be low and below the exposure criteria. However, DOE simulated the release of higher concentrations for the purposes of evaluating maximum release scenarios. DOE also considered various atmospheric (weather) conditions as part of the analysis. For each scenario, DOE used the modeling results and population data (based on 2010 U.S. Census block population densities) for the areas that could be impacted by a release to estimate the number of individuals that could potentially be affected and the types of effects that could occur. Air dispersion modeling was used to predict the concentrations of CO2 and trace gases in air to estimate the potential for exposure and impacts to human receptors. The concentrations of CO2 and trace gas in releases to the atmosphere from the CO2 pipeline and the injection wells were simulated using the SLAB model. The SLAB model simulates both normal and dense gases using thermodynamic properties, including supercritical CO2. The pipeline-walk methodology, developed for and used in a previous DOE project (DOE 2007a; DOE 2007b), was used to evaluate the effects of the gas phase releases along the 1 The CO2 acceptance specification provided by the Alliance indicates that the CO2 stream from the oxycombustion facility into the CO2 pipeline would contain less than 25 parts per million of total sulfur (see Table 3.17-7). For purposes of analysis, total sulfur content was evaluated as sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide based on the ratio of estimated emissions from the oxy-combustion facility. The sulfur dioxide was estimated at 7.9 parts per million and sulfur trioxide as 16.9 parts per million, so that the total was less than 25 parts per million. Under average operating conditions, the sulfur emissions are expected to be less, with negligible sulfur trioxide emissions and lowsulfur dioxide emissions. No detectible amounts ofhydrogen sulfide would be expected. entire length of the pipeline and to calculate the number of individuals hypothetically exposed toCO2 and trace gases from simulated pipeline ruptures and punctures. This method involves incrementally analyzing release points at approximately 1,000-foot segments of the pipeline for the range of meteorological conditions likely to occur at each point. There are five main steps in the pipeline-walk method for pipelinerupture and puncturerelease scenarios: • Step 1. Summarize meteorological conditions that affect vapor plume transport. The meteorological data are used to estimate the proportion of time over a year that each atmospheric state occurs (all combinations of 16 wind directions and 7 stability conditions, for a total of 112 cases). • Step 2. Simulate the area potentially affected by a pipeline release. The SLAB model is used to determine the surface area of the potential impact zone for each of the defined atmospheric states. Separate runs are performed for each potential health-effect level and exposure period for theruptureand puncture scenarios. • Step 3. Estimate population affected for each atmospheric state. The polygons representing the areal extent of eachpredicted exposure zone for each simulationare superimposed onto a map of the population density data at a point along the pipeline route. The population within the estimated vapor (atmospheric) plume area is computed for each census block and then summed if more than one blockcouldbe affected. • Step 4. Determine the expected number of individuals potentially affected at the specified release points. The affected population in each exposure zone is next multiplied by the proportion of the time (relative importance) that exposure to a given zone could occur. This process is repeated for each of the defined atmospheric states (a total of 112 cases to represent all 16 wind directions and 7 stability classes). Since all the atmospheric state cases sum to one, the sum of these products provides the expected number of affected individuals at any selected point along thepipeline. • Step 5. Characterize the potential exposure along the entire pipeline. Tabular and graphical summaries of the expected number of affected individuals at points along the pipeline provide a comprehensive summaryof potential healtheffects froma hypothetical pipeline release. The pipeline-walk routine was repeated for each criteria concentration and exposure duration for the full set of increments at an approximate spacing of 1,000 feet along the entire pipeline route. Separate simulations using the SLAB model were made if the volume in a pipeline segment would change due to a differentlengthbetweenmainline block valves. For potential releases during active injection, the SLAB model was used to estimate the CO2 concentrations in air and the extent of a resulting atmospheric CO2 plume due to a release both from a vertical and a horizontal injection well. Steps 3 through 5 of the pipeline-walk routine were conducted at multiple locations to represent the effects of different well locations and to estimate the expected number of peoplepotentially affected. Human health risks resulting from intentionally destructive acts were addressed in conjunction with the risk analysis described in the following subsection. 3.17.1.3 Risk Analysis To evaluate the risk of each accident scenario, DOE considered both the likelihood of the scenario occurring and the potential consequences for that scenario. The likelihood of each scenario has been characterized in terms of frequency based on available industry data. The consequence of each scenario was characterized in terms of potential health effects based either on physical injury or on effects from chemical exposure using available exposure criteria. The proposed operational period for the FutureGen 2.0 Project is 20 years; however, for risk assessment, DOE assumed a conservative operational period of 30 years. The frequency of an accident is the chance that the accident might occur and is typically discussed in terms of the number of occurrences over a period of time. For example, the frequency of occurrence for an accident that can be expected to happen once every 50 years, or one accident divided by the 50-year period, is 2 x 10-2 per year. DOE classifiedeach accident scenariointofrequencycategories: • Possible: Accidents estimated to occur one or more times in 100 years of facility operations (frequency ≥ 1 x 10-2 per year); • Unlikely: Accidents estimated to occur between once in 100 years and once in 10,000 years of facility operations (frequency from 1 x 10-2 to 1 x 10-4 per year); • Extremely Unlikely: Accidents estimated to occur between once in 10,000 years and once in 1 millionyearsof facilityoperations(frequency from 1 x 10-4 to 1 x 10-6 per year); and • Incredible: Accidents estimated to occur less than once in 1 million years of facility operations (frequency < 1 x 10-6 per year). The potential consequences of an accident are the range of potential health effects that could occur as a resultofthe accident. DOEcharacterized these effectsusingestablished criteria aseither: • Transient and reversible adverse effects: Headache, dizziness, sweating, and/or vague feelings of discomfort; • Irreversible or serious adverse effects: Breathing difficulties, increased heart rate, convulsions, and/or coma; or • Life-threateningeffects. DOE’s Subcommittee on Consequence Actions and Protective Assessments has developed a database of protective action criteria (PAC) to provide criteria for determining the potential health effects from exposure to accidents. The current version of the PAC database is Revision 27 (SCAPA 2012). The criteria for a given chemical are selected in the following order from criteria set by government and industry groups: (1) Acute Exposure Guideline Levels set by the USEPA, (2) Emergency Response Planning Guidelines (ERPG) acute toxicity endpoints set by the American Industrial Hygiene Association, and (3) Temporary Emergency Exposure Limits (TEELs) set by the Subcommittee on Consequence Actions and Protective Assessments. The PACs that correspond to the three levels of health effects (transient adverse, irreversible adverse,or life-threatening) are asfollows: • PAC-1: The maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to 1 hour without experiencing other than mild transient adverse health effects or perceiving a clearly defined objectionable odor. • PAC-2: The maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to 1 hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms that could impair an individual’s ability to take protective action. • PAC-3: The maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to 1 hour without experiencing or developing life-threatening health effects. 3.17.1.4 Potential Health Effects of CO2 (and other captured gas constituents) Table 3.17-1 provides health risk criteria for the public and the workers for exposure to CO2, hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, and sulfur trioxide. Table 3.17-2 provides the concentrations of CO2, hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, and sulfur trioxide that are not likelyto cause adverse effects to humans (including sensitive subgroups) for longer exposure periods (up to a lifetime). Long-term criteria for low levels of CO2 have not been established because CO2 is an acute health hazard,ratherthana chronic health hazard. Studies have found no evidence of any adverse health impact from long-term exposure to low levels (below 1 percent) of CO2 (IPCC 2005). No health effects to the general public, including susceptible individuals, are expected to occur at CO2 concentrations of 5,000 parts per million or less. This concentration represents the “no effect” level (TEEL-0 limit), or the level below which there would be minimal or no risk of adverse effects (DOE 2008a). Health effects from inhalation of concentrations of CO2 gas higher than 5,000 parts per million can range from headache, dizziness, sweating, and vague feelings of discomfort to breathing difficulties, increased heart rate, convulsions, coma, and possibly death. Exposure to a concentration of 5,000 parts per million up to 30,000 parts per million for 1 hour or less, constitutes PAC-1 exposure, possibly resulting in mild, reversible effects. Exposure to concentrations above 30,000 parts per million but less than 50,000 parts per million constitutes PAC-2 exposure, possibly resulting in irreversible adverse effects.2 The PAC-3 level is 50,000 parts per million. These levels are based on TEEL limits, since no Acute Exposure Guideline Levelsor ERPGs have been adopted for CO2. Table 3.17-1.

PACs for H2S and SO2 are based on USEPA’s Acute Exposure Guideline Levels (AEGL) for multipletimeperiodsvarying from 10 minutes up to 8 hours. PACs for SO3 are based on interim AEGLs (USEPA2012g). PAC-1, AEGL-1: The airborne concentration of a substance above which it is predicted that the general population, including susceptible individuals, could experience discomfort, irritation, or certain asymptomatic, non-sensory effects; however, these effects are not disabling and are transient and reversible upon cessation of exposure (SCAPA2012;USEPA 2012g). PAC-2, AEGL-2: The airborne concentration of a substance above which it is predicted that the general population, including susceptible individuals could experience irreversible or other serious, long-lasting, adverse health effects or an impaired ability to escape (SCAPA 2012;USEPA 2012g). PAC-3, AEGL-3: The airborne concentration of a substance above which it is predicted that the general population, including susceptible individuals, could experience life-threateninghealth effects or death (SCAPA2012;USEPA 2012g). c. Permissible exposure limits (PELs) are legally enforceable standards established by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA 2012). Immediately dangerous to life or health (IDLH) levels are recommended criteria established by the National InstituteofSafetyandHealth (NIOSH 2005), designed toallowa worker to escape within 30 minutes. d. Defined by the AIHA, ERPGs provide estimates for concentration ranges ‘below which nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to 1-hour and not experience or develop the stated level of effects as a consequence of exposure to the chemical in question.’ Values obtained from AIHA2011.

The PEL is the legal limit established by OSHA for exposure of an employee, expressed in terms of a time-weighted average, which is the average exposure over a specified period of time. This means that for limited periods a worker may be exposed to concentrations higher than the PEL, so long as the average concentration over 8 hours remains lower. The threshold limit value is a concentration at which it is believed a worker can be exposed day after day for a working lifetime without adverse health effects. The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists’ short-term exposure limit (STEL) is 30,000 parts per million (3 percent in air). The short-term exposure limit is a concentration which is believed workers can be exposed to routinely for a short period of time without suffering significant effects, but it should not occur more than 4 times per day and not longer than 15 minutes each time. There are no 8-hour Acute Exposure Guideline Levels for longer-term exposure to CO2. Therefore, for the pipeline puncture releases, anticipated CO2 concentrations from the modeling were compared to values of 5,000 parts per million (i.e.,the OSHA time-weighted average value for 8 hours); 20,000parts per million; and 40,000 parts per million based on information from the USEPA (2000). The 20,000 and 40,000 parts per million exposure values are based on physiological tolerance times and are used in guidelines for the protection of firefighters that could be exposed to CO2 from fire suppressant systems (USEPA 2000). Exposure to 20,000 parts per million for several hours can result in headache, tiredness, and shortness of breath upon mild exertion, and exposures up to 40,000 parts per million can result in increased blood pressure and dizziness (IPCC 2005). The concentration of 40,000 parts per million is also the immediately dangerous to life or health criterion, which was established to allow workers up to 30 minutes toescape. 3.17.1.5 Relevant Safety Factors and Statistics Occupational Injury Data Occupational injury and fatality data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics are presented in Tables 3.17-3 and 3.17-4. This data provides the injury or illness rates and fatality rates for utility-related construction and natural gas distribution. These rates are expressed in terms of injury or illness per 100 worker-years (or 200,000 hours) for total recordable cases, lost work day cases, and fatalities. Note these rates are used for estimating potential impacts. However, the characteristics and associated pipeline risks are differentfor CO2 and natural gas. Table 3.17-3.

CO2 pipelines have not resulted in any fatalities and injuries are rare; the annual incident frequency is 0.062 per 100 miles per year based on incident data from DOT’s Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS 2012a). The major cause of failure in serious incidents consideringall pipelines is damage (puncture or rupture) during excavation of existing pipelinesfor repair or for new pipelines (OPS 2012b). For CO2 pipelines, weld failures and equipment leaks such as relief valves were the cause of most incidents (OPS 2012c). The incident rate for natural gas pipelines is 0.027 per 100 miles, but unlike CO2 pipelines,fatalities have occurred. Table 3.17-4.

Mileage for types of hazardous liquid pipelines listed separately only through 2010, but used as 2011 mileage for incident calculation.

States also may regulate pipelines under partnership agreements with the Office of Pipeline Safety. The rules are designed to protect the public and the environment by ensuring safety in pipeline design, construction, testing, operation, and maintenance. In pipelines that carry captured CO2 for injection, other gases may be captured and transported as well (e.g., hydrogen sulfide or sulfur dioxide), and could affectrisks posed to human healthand the environment. In 2011, there were 312,290 miles of pipelines in the United States transporting natural gas in onshore transmission and gathering lines and over 2.1 million miles of distribution lines for natural gas (OPS 2012d). Crude oil, other petroleum products, and other hazardous liquids were transported in 179,042 miles of pipelines. There were 4,560 miles of CO2 pipelines in the United States in 2011 (OPS 2012d), of which most were used for enhanced oil recovery projects. The characteristics and pipeline transportation risks for CO2 and natural gas or petroleum products are different. For example, CO2 is expected to be transported by pipeline as a supercritical fluid with a density of approximately 70 to 90 percent of that of liquid water. If a leak develops along a pipeline, a portion of the escaping fluid would quickly expand to a gas, while the remainder would form a solid (i.e., dry-ice snow). CO2 gas is approximately 50 percent heavier than air and would disperse horizontally following the ground contours. In contrast, natural gas in a pipeline is lighter than supercritical CO2 and is more likely to disperse upwards. Natural gas is also highly flammable and poses the risk of explosion, compared to CO2, which is not flammable. DOE used the Office of Pipeline Safety data to estimate CO2 pipeline failure rates and the probabilities of pipeline release incidents for the proposed FutureGen 2.0 Project. Incident data from 1991-2011 from the online library of the Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS 2012a) were used to calculate the frequency and probability of pipeline ruptures and punctures. Six of the 57 incidents that occurred from 1991-2011 with the largest CO2 releases (> 4,000 barrels) were designated as rupture-type releases. Using the total length of CO2 pipelines involved (4,560 miles), the annual rupture failure frequency was calculated as 6.26 x 10-5 (miles-year)-1 . Ten of the next largest releases from the existing CO2 pipelines had losses of CO2 between 300 and 4,000 barrels. The remaining incidents had releases of less than 100 barrels, although three incidents had CO2 losses less than 0.1 barrels and 1 incident had no loss information. The annual puncture failure frequency was calculated as 1.04 x 10-4 (miles-year)-1 . The annual pipeline failure frequencies and the probability of at least one failure over a conservative 30-year operational period were calculated assuming the probability of failure to be exponentially distributed with the hazard rate equal to the product of the failure frequency and thepipeline length. Potential Industrial Hazards The Meredosia Energy Center would store and use certain process chemicals such as ferric chloride, polymer, salt solution, sodium hydroxide, acid, caustic, antiscalant, sodium bisulfate, detergent, and sodium hydroxide. The storage and handling of toxic or flammable materials would be conducted in compliance with USEPA and OSHA regulations and the National Fire Protection Association’s “Guide on Hazardous Materials” (NFPA 2010). The FutureGen 2.0 Project is not expected to store chemicals on the “List of Substances” (40 CFR 68.130) in amounts that would exceed the threshold quantities that would trigger the need for a Risk Management Plan. The oxy-combustion facility is expected to have two liquid oxygen tanks, which are considered to be the features most likely to pose the greatest risks to health and safety from an accident during facility operations. Liquid oxygen is oxygen gas that has been purified and cooled to become a cryogenic liquid. Oxygen is classified as hazardous under OSHA’s Hazard Communication Standard, 29 CFR 1910.1200, but is not listed as a regulated toxic gas or liquid subject to the USEPA Risk Management Program (USEPA 2009c). The potential hazards from contact with liquid oxygen include the following (Air Liquide 2007; Praxair 2007): • Oxygen is a strong oxidizer and is incompatible with organic materials including hydrocarbons (i.e., couldresult ina reaction that causes fire or explosion). • Contact with combustiblematerialscancause fire or explosion. • Oxygen is non-flammable, but can accelerate combustion of other materials including clothing or asphalt. • Contact withskin,eyes,oringestion can result in severe frostbite or freezingoftissues. • Release of liquid oxygen from a tank results in rapid expansion to a large volume of gas, which canallowpressure to build-upifthegas leakoccurs ina confined area. In addition, the air separation unit would have three vents for the discharge of nitrogen gas removed from the air. Nitrogen-rich gas that is depleted of oxygen can present an asphyxiation hazard if the gas is not properly vented and dispersed. 3.17.2 Affected Environment 3.17.2.1 Meredosia Energy Center The ROI for potential releases from operation of the oxy-combustion facility extends 2 miles from the Meredosia Energy Center boundary; the ROI is the distance within which an individual could experience any adverse effects from an accidental release of gases from the site. The eastern portion of this ROI overlaps with the ROI for the pipeline corridor as depicted in Figure 3.17-1. The ROI includes the village of Meredosia within Morgan County, which is part of U.S. Census Tract 9514. The 2-mile radius extends to the west into Pike County (U.S. Census Tract 9524) and to the northwest into Brown County (U.S. Census Tract 9704) (HUD 2010). The 2010 population density by census block for the Meredosia Energy Center ROI, and the western portion ofthe CO2 pipeline,is shown in Figure 3.17-1. Census data including population and sensitive receptor information are presented in Table 3.17-6 from the 2010 U.S. Census. Sensitive receptors include young children, the elderly, and those living in poverty (inadequate access tohealthcare). The numbers of persons belowthefederal poverty levelare provided by census tract, not by specific blocks. One elementary school, a high school, and a technical school are located within the ROI (Schools List 2011). No licensed daycare providers within the ROI for the energy center were identified (Daycare Centers List 2011). The nearest daycare centers are located in nearby townsincluding Beardstown to the north, Jacksonvilleto the east, and Winchester to the southeast. Table 3.17-6.

Meredosia had a population of 1,044 in 2010 (USCB 2011b). There are no other towns or villages within the ROIaround the energy center.

Figures 3.17-1 and 3.17-2 illustrate the Alliance’s ROI for the proposed pipeline route to the storage study area, nearby towns, and population densities in the surrounding areas. Population densities are based on the 2010 Census (USCB 2011a). Portions of the pipeline route could move slightly as a result of final project design and to accommodate landowner requests. However, the final pipeline route would be substantially similar and impacts would be consistent with those addressed in this section. Source: USCB 2011a ROI = Region of Influence Figure 3.17-1. 2010 Population Density in Vicinity of Meredosia Energy Center and Western Part of Pipeline Route to CO2 Storage Study Area Source: USCB 2011a CO2 =carbon dioxide; ROI = Region ofInfluence Figure 3.17-2. 2010 Population Density in Vicinity of Eastern Part of Pipeline Route and CO2 Storage Study Area in Morgan County The town of Chapin and the small town of Concord are both within the ROI. Chapin is located approximately 11.4 miles east-southeast of the Meredosia Energy Center and has a 2010 population of 512. Concord is located approximately 10 miles east of the energy center and has a 2010 population of 167. Jacksonville, which is the closest population center (2010 population of 19,446), is located approximately 21.4 miles east-southeast of the Meredosia Energy Center and 6 miles southwest of the CO2 storage studyarea.Jacksonville is approximately1mile outside of the ROI(see Figure 3.17-2). 3.17.2.3 CO2 Storage Study Area The CO2 storage study area and injection wells are described in detail in Section 2.5.2. As shown in Figure 3.17-2, the nearest town to the storage study area is Jacksonville, located approximately 6 miles to the southwest of the edge of the proposed area. The Alliance evaluated several injection well configurations using both vertical and horizontal wells at one or two injection well sites within the study area. The Alliance’s original configuration was for two vertical injection wells to be located on separate injection well pads located 0.5 to 1 mile apart. The project design originally planned for an annual injectionof 1.2 million tons (1.1 millionmetrictons) of CO2 over a 30-year period. After consideration of site-specific data from the stratigraphic well, the Alliance is currently proposing to construct and operate up to four horizontal injection wells at one injection well site for the annual injection of 1.2 million tons (1.1 million metric tons) of CO2 over a 20-year period (a total of 24 million tons [22 million metrictons]) in the Mt. Simon Formation. All four horizontal wells would originate from a common drilling pad, but would operate independently of each other (i.e., separate wellheads). The injection well pad would also accommodate one ortwo monitoring wells. The maximum subsurface plume size is estimated to be approximately 4,000 acres within the 6,800-acre CO2 storage study area. The expected maximum radius of the CO2 plume from the injection wells would be 2 miles, as determined by the computer modeling completed by the Alliance for the currently proposed injection well configuration of four horizontal wells (see Appendix G, Geological Report). The 2010 population density within the storage study area varies between 2 to 5 people per square mile and 5 to 25 people per square mile. 3.17.2.4 Educational Facilities The educational facilities are expected to be located in or near the city of Jacksonville, Illinois,inMorgan County. The proposed site or sites for the educational facilities would be areas that have been previously disturbed, with utilities (e.g., electricity, telecommunications, water, and sewer) located on or immediately adjacent to the site or sites. These educational facilities could involve new construction, renovation of existing structures, or a combination of new construction and renovation. Although the exact locationiscurrentlyunknown, it is not anticipated that the facilities wouldbe sited in alocation that would potentially impact the human health of workers or the general public from physical or chemical hazards. 3.17.3 Impacts of Proposed Action This section addresses the possible impacts to human health and safety (workers and public) as a result of the construction and operation of the oxy-combustion facility, the CO2 pipeline, the CO2 injection wells, and the educational facilities. The analysis of construction impacts is based on accident statistics for similar industries and the impacts are a function of the number of workers and the duration of the work. The analysis does nottake into account the BMPs, including safety training and procedures, that would be implemented by the Alliance as described in Chapter 2 and in Section 4.2, Measures to Mitigate Adverse Impacts. These practices would be expected to reduce the potential for construction accidents to the fullest extent possible. The analysis of impacts related to the operation of the FutureGen 2.0 Project assumes the maximum potential exposure of workers and members of the public to hazardous materials and CO2 if an accident were to occur. For the oxy-combustion facilityat the Meredosia EnergyCenter, these impacts relate tothe accidental release of liquid oxygen from onsite storage tanks, which is the accident determined to have the greatest potential human health impacts at the energy center. For the CO2 pipeline, potential impacts relate to those resulting from exposure to CO2 and trace gases as a result of a pipeline puncture (such as from the tooth of an excavator) or from a rupture (such as from a faulty weld). For the injection wells, potential impacts relate to exposures from both a small-scale release event, such as a CO2 leak from an unknown well, and a large-scale, catastrophic event (i.e., an immediate, one-time release), such as a well failure or an earthquake. No health and safety impacts would be expected as a result of the operation of the educational facilities. The health and safety analysis recognizes that, absent an accident, the construction and operation of the FutureGen 2.0 Project would not have adverse impacts on human health and safety. Further, with respect to potential accidents, the analysis does not take into account the myriad actions that have been undertaken by the Alliance to discover potential release pathways, such as existing groundwater and oil and gas wells or geologic faults, or protective measures that would be built into the design and operation of the oxy-combustion facility, pipeline, and injection facilities. Such measures, as described in Chapter 2 and Section 4.2, Measures to Mitigate Adverse Impacts, include hydrostatictesting of the pipeline prior to operation, automatic sensors and alarms, warning signs, remotely-operated and manual block valves to stop flow, extensive monitoring activities along the pipeline and at the CO2 injection wells, and safety training and procedures. These measures would be expected not only to reduce the potential for exposure, but also to significantly reduce the volume of hazardous materials and CO2 to which workers and the public could be exposed and the time of exposure if an accident or unexpected event were to occur. The analysis also discussestheverylowprobabilitythat anyof theinitiatingevents may occur. 3.17.3.1 Construction Impacts Meredosia Energy Center, CO2 Pipeline, CO2 Storage Study Area, and Educational Facilities Construction of the proposed project would have minor short-term impacts. The number of construction workers forthe oxy-combustion facilityat the Meredosia EnergyCenter is expected to have a peak of 500 construction and craft workers on any given day in June through December 2015. The incident rate for potential construction accidents was presented in Section 3.17.1.5. Based on incident rates for utility system construction, the number of lost work days during construction of the oxy-combustion facility is estimated to be 2.8 during peak construction and could potentially total to 10.3 days over the entire construction period with no fatalities. Construction of the CO2 pipeline, injection wells, and educational facilities would require a total of approximately 300 to 425 construction workers, and would potentially result in 2.2 lost work days. As a result, a total of 12.5 lost work days could occur over the entire construction period for all project components. No fatalities would be expected. Since publication of the Draft EIS, the Alliance continued to develop its conceptual and preliminary designs for the proposed project. The design changes resulted in a reduction in the number of construction workers required for the CO2 pipeline, injection wells, and educational facilities to approximately 230 to 380 workers. The reduction in construction workers would result in a reduction in the potential lostwork days. 3.17.3.2 Operational Impacts Meredosia Energy Center Potential health and safety impacts during normal operation of the oxy-combustion facility would generally be limited to workers directly involved in facility operation and maintenance, and would be related primarily to worker injuries that are typical of similar industrial facilities. Based on the industry-specific incident data presented in Tables 3.17-3 and 3.17-4, the upper bound for annual total recordable cases would be 1.4 with less than one lost work day for facility workers. In addition, based on these data no fatalities would beexpected to occur over the operating lifeof thefacility. As described in Section 3.1, Air Quality, modeling of air pollutant emissions from the oxy-combustion facility indicates that the emissions would not exceed significant impact levels and are therefore considered de minimis. Therefore, adverse health effects from facility air emissions are not expected to occur. DOE evaluated the potential for accidents at the oxy-combustion facility and determined that the greatest potential for human health impacts could result from an accidental release of liquid oxygen from either of the two onsite storage tanksor releases fromthe three nitrogen vents of the airseparation unit. The nitrogen removed from the air by the air separation unit would be vented to the atmosphere as a gas, which would promote its upward movement and dispersion as it mixes with ambient air. The discharged gas would be expected to be at atmospheric pressure with a temperature range of 32 to 140oF (Air Liquide 2013). As oxygen deficiency or enrichment is a recognized hazard of the air separation process, the air separation unit would be designed to ensure all oxygen-deficient or oxygen-enriched streams vented to the atmosphere are compliant with industry codes. The design would follow guidelines for minimum heights above the ground, basedonthe diameter of the vent, its discharge rate, and pressure and temperature conditions (e.g., AIGA 2010). As a result, air separation unit vents would be directed toward safe locations away from any areas where workers could be present and thereby preventing potential asphyxiation hazards. In addition, workers would be required to wear oxygen monitors and comply with requirementsregardingconfined space entry when working within the airseparation unit. The oxy-combustion facility is expected to have two liquid oxygen tanks, each with a capacity of 236 cubic meters. The liquid oxygen tanks would operate at a pressure of 1-5 psig and temperature of approximately -297oF. As shown in the site diagram (see Figure 2-8), the tanks (cylinders) would be 75 feet long, located approximately 25 feet east ofthelime preparation building. The frequency of an accident involving liquid oxygen tanks is considered to be extremely unlikely (1.4 x 10-6 per year) based on a 1997 survey of 11,760 tank years at production sites, and 712,000 tank years at customer sites for liquid oxygen, nitrogen, and argon tanks in Europe (EIGA 2004). A review of tank failures concluded that ductile tearing is more likely than collapse, corrosion, excessive deformation, or brittle fracture. A tear in the tank is likely to result in a leak, rather than failure of an entire tank wall. Based on actual accidents that have occurred worldwide, the most common cause of releases were refilling operations, where a valve failed or the operator made an error during the refilling process. Eight of the 12 accidents where liquid oxygen leaked occurred during filling operations. Two other accidents involved improper venting, and one involved corrosion of parts of the valve system. Several accidents occurred due to improper procedures during or after the original leak, rather than mechanical failure. Injuries, fatalities, and property damage that occurred were primarily from associated fires following the leak. To evaluate a release from one of the liquid oxygen tanks, DOE reviewed and scaled the results of an existing simulation for a release from a tank with 1,000 metric tons of liquid oxygen. This simulation included a tank leak through a 6-inch nozzle, forming a liquid pool followed by a vapor cloud. By scaling this simulationtotheliquid oxygen tanksize atthe Meredosia EnergyCenter,DOE estimated thata vapor cloud with 25 percent oxygen could extend approximately 150 feet from the release location. Based on the proposed location of the liquid oxygen tanks, a release from either tank would remain within the energy center property. The frequency of an accident at one of two tanks is 2.8 x 10-6 per year and the probability of one accident over a conservative 30-year operational period is 8.4 x 10-5 . It is expected that consequences related to the accidental release of liquid oxygen from the tanks and associated exposure would be limited to workers that are within 150 feet of liquid oxygen tanks, and that no offsite consequences would occur. Under these circumstances, workers within 150 feet of the release could experience minor to serious injuries by exposure to extreme temperatures (e.g., frost bite). Other physical injuries could occur if any oxygen-fueled fires were to ensue after the leak had occurred. No long-term impacts to the public wouldbe expectedfroma tankrelease. Precautions to prevent accidents include the use of appropriate design and materials for liquid oxygen tanks, compliance with OSHA 1910.104 regulations on allowable distances from flammable and combustible materials, proper siting of equipment and signage to alert workers of the potential hazards, and training and equipment to handle oxygen-fueledfires. CO2 Pipeline This section includes a detailed analysis of accidental release scenarios in consideration of the population densities along both the southern and northern pipeline routes. The southern (proposed) route extends to the proposed injection site. The northern route is delineated to the western border of the CO2 storage study area and then analyzed based on hypothetical end-of-pipeline routes (spurs) to the injection wells as described in Section 2.5.1.1. The analysis presented in this section has been updated from the Draft EIS to reflect refinements in the pipeline routes and to evaluate 10-mile pipeline segments for both a nominal12-inch diameter pipe and a nominal 10-inch diameter pipe. DOE assessed the potential impacts of a maximum release scenario byevaluating the release of CO2 with trace gases at the concentration limits set in the Alliance’s minimum CO2 pipeline acceptance specifications (see Table 3.17-7). The total sulfur content was evaluated as sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide based on the ratio of estimated emissions from the oxy-combustion facility. The sulfur dioxide was estimated at 7.9 parts per million and sulfur trioxide as 16.9 parts per million, so that the total was less than 25 parts per million. Under average operating conditions, these components are expected to be significantlylower withless than1part per milliontotal sulfur andnegligible hydrogen sulfide content. Table 3.17-7.

However, no detectible amounts of H2S are expected in the CO2 stream from the Meredosia EnergyCenter. Note: The CO2 stream could contain other trace metals, which would not be known until additional design work is completed. CO2 = carbon dioxide; H2S = hydrogen sulfide; Hg = mercury; lb/mmscf = pounds per million standard cubic feet; O2 = oxygen; ppb =partsperbillion; ppm =partspermillion; SDWA = Safe Drinking Water Act Pipeline Accident Scenarios and Release Simulations Two accidental release scenarios (pipeline rupture and puncture) are considered the most likely type of pipeline accidents that couldcause the release of largervolumes of CO2 and tracecomponents. A pipeline rupture release would occur if the pipeline were completely severed, for example by heavy equipment during excavation activities. A rupture could also result from a longitudinal running fracture of a pipe section or a seam-weld failure. In these cases, the entire contents of the pipeline between the two nearest control valve stations (which are expected to be fitted with automatic and manual shut-off valves) could be discharged from the severed pipeline within minutes. As explained in Section 2.5.1.2, the conceptual design currently proposed by the Alliance assumes there would be one mainline block valve at the Meredosia Energy Center, one at the injection site, and two in between. Therefore, the analysis in the Final EIS assumed a maximum distance of 10 miles between control valve stations. Based on modeling, the duration of the release resulting from a pipeline rupture would be approximately 5 minutesfora nominal 12-inch diameter pipe and 9minutes fora nominal 10-inch diameter pipe. For the purpose oftheanalysis, a pipeline puncture release is definedas a 3-inch by 1-inch hole that could be made by a tooth of an excavator. In such a case, all of the contents in the pipeline between the two nearest control valve stations would discharge into the atmosphere, but the release would occur over a period of several hours, as the opening is small relative to the total volume, and the pressure would decline as the fluid escapes. Based on modeling, the duration of a release from a pipeline puncture would be approximately 3.3 hours for a nominal 12-inch diameter pipe and 3.9 hours for a nominal 10-inch diameterpipe. Captured CO2 may be transported as a supercritical fluid, such that its density resembles a liquid but it expands to fill space like a gas. If CO2 were released from a pipe, it would expand rapidly as a gas and, depending on temperature and pressure, could include both liquid and solid (i.e., dry ice) phases. Supercritical CO2 has a very low viscosity but is denser than air. A potential release of CO2 through an open orifice in the pipeline with a gas moving at the speed of sound is referred to as choked or critical flow (Birdet al. 2006). In the rupture scenario, the escapinggas fromthe pipeline is assumed to escape as a horizontal jet at ground level, which is typically the highest consequence event for heavier-than-air gases (Hanna andDrivas 1987).3 Potential releases to the atmosphere represent the primary exposure pathway considered in the exposure analysis. The receptor groups likely to be exposed by releases from pipelines or aboveground equipment at the energy center or injection wells would be onsite workers and the general public in the immediate vicinity of these sites at the time of an accident. In addition to the potential health effects of a release, which would be dependent on the exposure concentrations and local meteorological conditions at the time of a release, individuals near a ruptured or punctured pipeline or wellhead would likely also be affected bythe physical forces fromthe accident itself,includingthe release of gases at high flow rates and at very high speeds. People involved at the location of an accidental release would be potentially affected, possibly due to a combination of effects, such as physical trauma, asphyxiation (displacement of oxygen in a small confined place), or frostbitefrom therapid expansion of CO2 (e.g., 3,000 psito 15 psi). The SLAB model was used to simulate releases from a rupture and a puncture of the pipeline. The Alliance’s proposed southern pipeline route (see Figure 2-18) was simulated since it is closer to populated areas, and would therefore produce a more conservative analysis than the northern pipeline route option. DOE’s analysis assumes that the control valves would close under an accident scenario, limiting the potential releases to the amount of CO2 contained in the affected pipeline segment. The Alliance is designing the pipeline with either a nominal 12-inch diameter or a nominal 10-inch diameter. The nominal 12-inch diameter pipeline would have an outer diameter of 12.75 inches and an inner diameter of 12.09 inches. The nominal 10-inch diameter pipeline would have an outer diameter of 10.75 inches and an inner diameterof 10.14 inches. The normal operating temperature of the CO2 in the pipeline would vary between the CO2 capture facility and the injection wells from approximately 90°F to 72.2°F. For the nominal 12-inch diameter pipeline, pipeline simulations were conducted using 2,100 psig and 90°F. However, the most recent 3 Studies show that a sudden release from a buried pipeline would more likely escape at roughly a 20 degree angle (McGillivray and Wilday 2009). However, SLAB has the capability of modeling either a horizontal or a vertical release. DOE assumed a horizontal jet for pipeline releases and a vertical jet for injection well releases. Assuming a horizontal jet for a pipeline release introduces another layer ofconservatismto the analysis. design information indicates that the conditions may differ at the delivery station (pressure of 1,874 psig and temperature of 72.2°F), so a sensitivity analysis was performed using these conditions. For the nominal 10-inch diameter pipeline, the case with the highest CO2 density was used for the simulations (i.e., at a pressure of 1,335 psig and temperature of 70°F). The CO2 would be transported in a dense (fluid) state under any of these conditions. If a pipeline release were to occur, part of the dense fluid would be converted to a dry-ice snow form, which would then slowly sublimate (i.e., change from a solid phase directly to a vapor phase). The percent of CO2 released as a vapor is estimated to be 73.7 percent. The transport of the vapor phase in the atmosphere was simulated using SLAB and the results compared toappropriate health criteria. Seven meteorological stability classes, as defined in Table 3.17-8, and all 16 different wind directions were used for the simulations based on local data from the Springfield Capital Airport National Weather Service Station between 2005 and 2009 (IEPA 2011f). As shown in the wind rose diagram (seeFigure 3.2-1), calm conditions occurred approximately 2.1 percent of the time. The predominant wind direction is from the south approximately 12 percent of the time. While the wind blows from all directions, the next most common direction is from the northwest at approximately 7 percent of the time. Wind directions between due north and due east occurred less than 5 percent of the time in any one direction. The average wind speeds used in the SLAB simulations varied from 3 to 39 feet per second as shown in Table 3.17-9. Table 3.17-8.

Maximum exposure concentrations and related distances were determined by modeling a 15-minute period for pipe ruptures because the calculated release duration would be less than 10 minutes. Additional simulations were then conducted for 30-minute and 60-minute time intervals to determine the distances within which exposure criteria concentrations would be exceeded. Distances at which exposure would occur from a pipeline puncture release would be less than those experienced under a pipeline rupture, as the gas would be released more slowly and over a much longer duration. As a result, DOE used the USEPA Acute Exposure Guideline Levels (AEGL) for 8 hours (AEGL-1 to AEGL-3; see Table 3.17-1) for assessing the potential effects related to this release type. Worker guidelinesfor 8 hours were used for CO2, since AEGLs arenotavailable. DOE simulated releases from 10-mile pipeline segments for both a nominal 12-inch diameter pipe and nominal 10-inch diameter pipe. The base casesimulationfor the nominal 12-inch diameter pipe was conducted for the following conditions: pressure at 2,100 psig and temperature at 90oF. A sensitivity case for the nominal 12-inch diameter pipe was simulated using the estimated conditions at the delivery station (pressure of 1,874 psig and temperature of 72.2°F). Under lower pressure and temperature conditions, CO2 would take longer to be released from the pipe and the vapor plume extent would be slightly different; however, these changes had only a limited effect on the simulated number of individuals potentially affected by a release. The simulation for the nominal 10-inch diameter pipe was conducted using a pressure of 1,335 psig and a temperature of 70oF. Table 3.17-10 shows the estimated distances for base case conditions that a given exposure concentration plume could extend out from hypothetical pipeline releases both for a nominal 12inch diameter pipe and for a nominal 10-inchdiameter pipe. Table 3.17-10. Simulated Vapor Plume Transport Distances for Pipeline Releases a. See Section 3.17.1.3 and Table 3.17-1 for description of potential health effects and protective health criteria concentrations. Section 3.17.1.4 also provides information on how the respective criteria and time durations are considered in this analysis. b. Meteorological condition for longest distance case. c. Results for non-calm conditions would extend to distances of about a factor of 5 less than the calm conditions (F1), which occur about 2.1 percent of the time. CO2 = carbon dioxide; H2S = hydrogen sulfide; ppm = parts per million; SO2 = sulfur dioxide; SO3 = sulfur trioxide The potential vapor plume from a pipe rupture or puncture scenario would be small in areal extent, and its position would depend on the wind direction, speed, and stability conditions at the time of the release. The rapid release of high-pressure CO2 from the pipeline would result in a relatively narrow band of CO2 extending laterally in the immediate vicinity of the release point. The rapid decompression of the CO2 would result in extreme cooling at the rupture site, with the rapid formation of CO2 liquids, solids (i.e., dry ice), and gases in the immediate vicinity. In the immediate discharge zone, phase changes would subsequently occur (i.e., from solid or liquid to gas). With distance, the CO2 gas would expand and disperse as the pressure reduced and it mixed with ambient air. A significant amount of noise, similar to a jet engine, would likely be generated by the event and subsequent rapid release of the CO2.  Maximum Reasonably Foreseeable Pipeline Rupture Scenario People in the vicinity of the rupture would be most susceptible to harm due largely to potential physical effects related to high-pressure and the velocity of the release, as well as from exposure to extreme temperature drops that could cause frost-bite. In addition, high concentrations of CO2 would be present in the narrow band of CO2 escaping from the rupture site. Immediate life threatening effects related to asphyxiation from short-term exposure to these high concentrations (i.e., within minutes of exposure to CO2 at concentrations that exceed 100,000 parts per million by volume), could occur within this band up to distances of 267 feet and 314 feet from the rupture for nominal 12-inch diameter and 10-inch diameter pipeline scenarios, respectively. However, people would likely be able to flee the areas with high concentration due to the visual, physical, and audible signs associated with the event. Within a 30minute period workers would likely need to use respiratory protection within 214 feet and 245 feet respectively, the distance within which the National Institute for Safety and Health declares the concentration couldexceedlevels immediatelydangerous to life or health; and workers would likely need other personal protective equipment for freezing conditions near the discharge point. The potential for exposure and risk to the public would primarily occur as the CO2 expands and disperses creating a vapor plume. The potential maximum reasonably foreseeable accident scenario or exposure distances would occur with a pipeline rupture under calm meteorological conditions, as it would take a longer period of time for CO2 concentrations to dissipate under calm conditions. Based on the modeling results presented in Table 3.17-10 and the health effects criteria presented in Table 3.17-1, there would be no adverse effects to the general public from a rupture beyond a distance where CO2 concentrations would exceed 5,000 parts per million. Over a 60-minute time period after a rupture, under calm meteorological conditions, this distance could extend from the rupture to 1,419 feet and 1,769 feet for the release of gases, respectively, from nominal 12-inch diameter and 10-inch diameter pipeline. Transient effects, which include temporary symptoms such as headache, dizziness, sweating, and/or vague feelings of discomfort, could occur within these distances. Irreversible or serious adverse effects could occur within exposure distances of 128 feet and 152 feet, respectively, with the potential for life-threatening effectsfrom exposures within 63 feet or 79feet, respectively, for the nominal 12inch diameter and 10-inch diameter pipeline. Federal regulations (49 CFR 195) require CO2 pipelines to be located no closer than 50 feet from occupied residences. The Alliance pipeline siting criteria includes an intended minimum distance of 150 feet from any occupied structure; but it is possible that a shorter distance wouldbe deemed necessary in order to avoid a sensitive environmental resource or to accommodate the request of an affected landowner. Based on the 1-hour public health criteria (see Table 3.17-1), life-threatening health effects would not occur at a distance greaterthan 150 feet for rupture of either the 10-or 12inch diameter pipelines. However, irreversible adverse health effects could occur for the rupture of the 10-inch diameter pipeline within 152 feet under meteorological condition D12. In addition, the 30-minute worker based health criteria (i.e., Immediate Danger to Life or Health levels) could be exceeded at a distance greater than 150 for the rupture of the 10-inch diameter pipeline under meteorological conditions D10 and D12. Meteorological conditions D10 and D12 only occur 3.6 and 0.7 percent of the time, respectively. Under all other meteorological conditions, the estimated distance withinwhichserious adverse health effects could occur would be less than 150feet. Under normal operating conditions hydrogen sulfide is not expected to be present in measurable concentrations in the pipeline, and no effects would occur from hydrogen sulfide exposure regardless of the distance from a release. However, for purposes of analysis, DOE considered the potential health risks from exposure to releases from a rupture or puncture assuming hydrogen sulfide is present in the CO2 gas at the limit of the Alliance’s CO2 acceptance specification. No health effects from hydrogen sulfide exposure (based on the 1-hour exposure criteria) could occur beyond 4,066 feet (0.77 mile) or 3,691 feet (0.7 mile), respectively, for the nominal 12-inch diameter and 10-inch diameter pipeline scenarios. Irreversible or serious adverse effects from hydrogen sulfide could occur within exposure distances (1-hour) of 155 feet and 375 feet respectively. The potential for life-threatening effects could occur from exposures (1-hour) within 54 feet or 49 feet, respectively. However, the distances for hydrogen sulfide exposure are considered to be very conservative based on the expected absence of hydrogen sulfide in measurable concentrations during normal operations. No healtheffects (for the 1-hour exposure criteria) related to either sulfur dioxide or sulfur trioxide exposure, respectively, would occur beyond 2,822 feet (0.5 mile) or 8,152 feet (1.5 miles) from the release point based on the nominal 12-inch diameter pipeline scenario. These distances are for calm conditions that occur about 2.1 percent of the time; the distances would be less by a factor of about five for all other meteorological conditions. Irreversible or serious adverse effects from sulfur dioxide or sulfur trioxide, respectively, could occur within exposure distances of 1,172 feet and 686 feet based on the nominal 12-inch diameter pipeline scenario. The potential for life-threatening effects could occur from exposures to sulfur dioxide or sulfur trioxide within 20 feet, based on the nominal 10-inch diameter pipeline scenario, or within 12 feet for the 12-inch pipeline scenario. However, the actualsulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide concentrations inthe pipeline would be much lower, under average operating conditions, than the values shown in Table 3.17-7; therefore, concentration plumes would likely notextend as far as predicted. Maximum Reasonably Foreseeable Pipeline Puncture Scenario People in the vicinity of the puncture would be most susceptible to harm due largely to potential physical effects related to high-pressure and the velocity of the release, as well as from exposure to extreme temperature drops which could cause frost-bite. In addition, high concentrations of CO2 would be present in the narrow band of CO2 escaping from the puncture site. Immediate life threatening effects related to asphyxiation from short-term exposure to these high concentrations (i.e., exposure to CO2 at concentrations that exceed 100,000 parts per million by volume) could occur within this band up to distances of approximately 18 or 19 feet for the nominal 12-inch diameter and 10-inch diameter pipeline scenarios, respectively. However, people would likely be able to flee the areas with high concentration due to the visual, physical, and audible signs associated with the event. The potential for exposure and risk to the public would primarily occur as the CO2 expands and disperses creating a vapor plume. The potential maximum reasonably foreseeable accident scenario or exposure distances would occur with a pipeline puncture under calm meteorological conditions as it would take a longer period of time for CO2 concentrations to dissipate under calm conditions. Exposure concentrations and distances would be less for a pipeline puncture than a rupture; however, exposure durations could be longer as the release would occur over a longer period of time (i.e., several hours). Based on the 8-hour exposure criteria, no healtheffects related to CO2 exposure would occur beyond 1,095 feet and 980 feet, respectively, for the nominal 12-inch diameter and 10-inch diameter pipeline scenarios. However, transient adverse effects could occur within these distances. The distance within which life-threatening effects could occur based on worker exposure criteria for CO2 would be 66 feet and 61 feet, respectively, for the nominal 12-inch diameter and 10-inch diameter pipelines scenarios. The Alliance pipeline siting criteria includes an intended minimum distance of 150 feet from any occupied structure, whichis greaterthan the distancefor life-threateningeffects. Potentialtransientadverse health effects relatedtohydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, and sulfur trioxidefor puncture releases from nominal 12-inch diameter or 10-inch diameter pipeline scenarios, respectively, could occurwithin: 1,300 feet and 1,080 feet for hydrogen sulfide; 689 feet and 574 feet for sulfur dioxide; and 1,918 feet and 1,590 feet for sulfur trioxide. Potential irreversible or serious adverse health effects related to hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, and sulfur trioxide for respective releases from nominal 12-inch diameter and 10-inch diameter pipeline scenarios could occur within: 105 feet and 87 feet for hydrogen sulfide; 309 feet and 256 feet for sulfur dioxide; and 178 feet and 158 feet for sulfur trioxide. Potential life-threatening effects related to hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, and sulfur trioxide for respective pipeline segment releases could occur within: 73 feet and 62 feet for hydrogen sulfide; 16 feet and 15 feet for sulfur dioxide; and 12 feet and 11 feet for sulfur trioxide. However, the distances for hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, and sulfur trioxide exposures are considered to be very conservative, as under normal operating conditions these components are not expectedto be presentin measurable concentrations. Pipeline Walk Method Risk Analysis The pipeline-walk method and the population density data were used to estimate the expected numbers of people that could be affected by hypothetical ruptures or punctures based on the percent of time that a vapor plume of CO2 or the trace gases would be transported by the wind in all 16 different directions at varying speeds and for all the stabilityclasses listed in Table 3.17-8. Table 3.17-11 presents the estimated maximum number of people potentially affected by exposure to CO2 and the trace gases at various criteria concentrations, resulting from a hypothetical pipeline release for both a rupture and puncture for the nominal 12-inch diameter or the 10-inch diameter pipeline. The estimated number of people is a calculated number based on the population density within each hypothetical plume given the full range of meteorological conditions that could occur multiplied by the percent of time that each of those conditions could occur. For CO2, a pipeline rupture or puncture would not result in one or more persons being affected by CO2 concentrations of 30,000 parts per million or greater (i.e., the threshold for which irreversible adverse effects could occur). The number of people estimated to be within the zone where a concentration of 5,000 parts per million (i.e., the threshold for which transient adverse effects could occur) ranges fromless than one up to eight people. One individual or less could be affected if the release were to occur in rural areas, up to five people if the release were to occur near Meredosia, and up to eight people if the release were to occur near Jacksonville. For all release locations, people nearby at the time of the releasecould experience physicaleffects, in addition to effectsfrom the CO2 or trace gases. Table 3.17-11. Estimated Number of People Affected by CO2 and Trace Gases from the Hypothetical Pipeline Releases Based on the pipeline-walk analysis, the general public would not be subjected to irreversible, adverse effects of hydrogen sulfide from a pipeline rupture or puncture (unless an individual was close to the release), because the area of the vapor plume would be small. However, up to one person could experience transient effects from hydrogen sulfide exposure if a rupture were to occur near Meredosia or Jacksonville, but less than one person would be expected to experience transient effects if a release were to occur along therural portion of the pipeline route for either the nominal 12-inch or 10-inch diameter pipeline scenarios. The general public is not expected to be affected by exposure to sulfur dioxide in the event of pipeline ruptures or punctures. For sulfur trioxide, up to 3 people could experience transient effects such as temporary respiratory discomfort from a rupture but no irreversible, serious effects. These results are very conservative, since the sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide concentrations in the pipeline during normal operation are expected to be much less than the upper limits of the Alliance’s CO2 acceptance specification. The estimation of the number of people potentiallyaffected by a vapor plume considers the percent of time that the different meteorological conditions occur and the percent of time that the wind blows toward more populated areas. Thus, the potential impacts to the public from a release are anticipated to be negligible to minor short-term effects such as irritation or discomfort from hydrogen sulfide odors. The annual frequency of a rupture on the proposed 30-mile pipeline to the injection wells in Morgan County is estimated at 1.88 x 10-3 (0.00188). The probability of at least one rupture over a 30-year operating period is estimated to be 5.5 x 10-2 (0.055). The annual frequency of a puncture on the proposed 30-mile pipeline to the injection wells is estimated at 3.13 x 10-3 (0.00313). The probability of a puncture over a 30-year operating period is estimated to be 8.97 x 10-2 (0.0897). Based on the estimated frequencies of pipeline punctures or ruptures, both types of releases on the pipeline to the injection wells are considered unlikely (frequency from 1 x 10-2 to 1 x 10-4 per year or from one in 100 years to one in 10,000 years). CO2 Storage Study Area Since publication of the Draft EIS, the Alliance selected the single-site scenario with four horizontal wells as its proposed option and identified the location of the injection well site (as discussed in Section 2.5.2.1). DOE estimates that the nearest dwelling is located approximately 900 feet from the end of the pipeline at the injection well site. The CO2 storage study area is located in a sparsely populated region, with a population density of 2 to 5 people per square mile in part of the study area and 5to 25 people per square mile inthe remaining portion (see Figure3.17-3). The Alliance evaluated different injection well configurations using both vertical wells (dual-site scenario) and horizontal wells (single-site scenario) within the CO2 storage study area as described in Section 2.5.2.3. The extent of the subsurface CO2 plume for the two vertical well (dual-site) scenario, which is no longer under consideration by the Alliance, was estimated to be approximately 4,000 to 5,000 acres within the 6,800-acre study area. For the currently proposed horizontal well scenario (single-site), the lateral extent of the subsurface plume after 20 years of the injection period and 50 years of the post-injection period was estimated as approximately 4,000 acres from subsurface modeling of the horizontal injectionsystemusingtheSTOMP-CO2 simulator(Appendix G, Geological Report). Although an injection well failure would be extremely unlikely, DOE used the SLAB model to simulate a surface release from both vertical and horizontal injection wells. The releases were modeled as vertical or horizontal jets, assuming gas compositions similar to those used for the pipeline (see Table 3.17-7). The toxicity analysis used the PAC criteria applicable to the public for exposure duration of 1 hour or less (15 minutes for a well failure) and acute worker safety guidelines listed in Table 3.17-1. DOE estimated potential health risks from exposure to releases from the injection well assuming that trace gases (sulfur dioxide, sulfur trioxide, and hydrogen sulfide) are present in the CO2 gas at the limit of the Alliance’s CO2 acceptance specification. However, under normal operating conditions these trace gases are not expected to be present in measurable concentrations in the pipeline. The details of DOE’s modeling and analysis are presented below. CO2 = carbon dioxide; ROI = Region of Influence; sq/mi = square mile Figure 3.17-3. Population Density in Vicinity of Area of Injection Well Site(s) Two Vertical Injection Wells Scenario As noted above, the Alliance is no longer considering a two-vertical injection well scenario. However, the following analysis was prepared for the Draft EIS and is included here as a comparison with the Alliance’s proposed four-horizontal injection well scenario. The simulations for the two vertical injection well scenario assumed a well depth of 4,400feet, which is the expected base of the screened (perforated) interval for injection into the Mt. Simon Formation. Table3.17-12 shows the furthest distances that CO2 and trace gas criteria-level vapor plumes are predicted to migrate from a hypothetical injection well failure and the meteorological stability class associated with the maximum distance. Based on the SLAB simulations, CO2 concentrations greater than 5,000 parts per million averaged over a 15-minute period would occur at less than 92 feet from the injection wells. The furthest distance that higher CO2 concentrations of 30,000 parts per million could extend due to a release from a well is less than 10 feet. The furthest distance that a vapor plume with hydrogen sulfide of 27 parts per million (the condition where irreversible, adverse effects could be experienced) is 518 feet under calm conditions or less than 112 feet under other conditions. For both sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide, a vapor plume with concentrations that could result in adverse effects would be expected to occur at distances less than 200feet,whichis the protectedareaaroundeachinjectionwell. Table 3.17-12.

Meteorological condition for longest distance case. CO2 = carbon dioxide; H2S = hydrogen sulfide; ppm =partspermillion; SO2 = sulfurdioxide; SO3 = sulfur trioxide Based on the pipeline-walk analysis method, no nearby residents would be affected by an injection well release of CO2 or trace gases from a well 4,400 feet deep. Based on the SLAB simulations of releases to the air, the areal extent of a vapor plume, if a leak occurred during operation of the wells, was estimated by the model to be small (e.g., 0.02 acre for a vapor plume with CO2 equal to 5,000 parts per million or 0.6 acres for a vapor plume with hydrogen sulfide equal to 0.51 parts per million but less than 0.01 acre for a plume equal to 27 parts per million). The estimation of the number of people potentially affected by a vapor plume considers the percent of time that all different meteorological conditions occur and the percent of time that the wind blows in each of the 16 possible directions, some of which may be toward more populated areas. There are expected to be a total of 15 people working at the injection well facility in the daytime during the work week, and 3 people present at night and on weekends. All the workers are expected to beinside one of thebuildings most of thetime, which would provide additional protection if a leak occurred from one of the wells. The potential impacts to workers from a well release are expected to be short-term, negligible to minor effects, since the release duration from a well is estimated to be less than 15 minutes and alarms would immediately sound. The potential impacts to the public are expected to be negligible because they are unlikely to be close to the injection well sites, which would be surrounded by a controlled access area. Thus, the public could experience only short-term, transient effects such as headaches or irritation from odors if present within an impact zone from a well failure at the time of a release (see Table3.17-12).  Four Horizontal Injection Wells Scenario As now proposed by the Alliance, the horizontal injection well scenario involves up to four separate horizontal wells installed on one pad, but oriented alonga different azimuth. This scenario aligns with the injection well configuration currently proposed by the Alliance as described in Appendix G, Geological Report. Each well would consist of a vertical section to a depth of approximately 3,150 feet through the Potosi Formation, at which point the hole would begin to turn from a vertical to horizontal orientation. At a true vertical depth of approximately 4,030 feet, the hole would be horizontal and extend in two of the wells to approximately 1,500 feet and in the remaining two wells to approximately 2,500 feet. The volumes in the longest horizontal well of 2,500 feet long for all the options were computed using the inner diameters of each casing or tubing string and the estimated temperature and pressure of the CO2 fluid from the pipeline. Two bounding cases were simulated with the SLAB model: (1) the smallest volume using injection tubing with an inner diameter of 3.0 inches for the entire well and (2) an open hole with production casing (6.5-inch diameter) in place for the vertical portions of the well and open hole (9.5-inch diameter) for the turned and horizontal portions of the well. The duration of hypothetical releases fromthesetwo well designs differ, butare bothestimatedto be less than10 minutes. The SLAB model was used to simulate CO2, hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, and sulfur trioxide at the same concentrations as for the vertical injection wells and pipeline. The predicted vapor plume transport distances for the horizontal injection well cases are shown in Table 3.17-13. Based on the pipeline-walk analysis method, no nearby residents would be affected by an injection well release of CO2 or trace gases from either of the two bounding cases for the horizontal wells. The estimation of the number of people potentially affected by a vapor plume considers the percent of time that all different meteorological conditions occur and thepercent of time that the wind blows in each of the 16 possible directions, some of which may be toward more populated areas. The potential impacts to workers would be similar to the estimated effects from a release from the vertical injection well described above. The potential impacts to the public are expected to be negligible, because members of the public are unlikely to be close to the pad where the surface completion of the injection wells are located, which would be surrounded by a controlled access area. The estimated distances where adverse, transient effects could occur from trace gases for a 1-hour exposure period was greater than 500 feet only for hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, and sulfur trioxide under calm conditions for the open-hole completion case, and for sulfur trioxide under calm conditions for the injection well with tubing. For these exposures, the public could experience only short-term, transient effects such as headaches or irritation from odors if present within an impact zone froma well failure at the time of a release (see Table 3.17-13). Thus, using conservative, upper-bound concentrations of trace gases in the pipeline, DOE estimated that adverse, transient effects from exposure to these gases could occur at distances greater than 500feet under calm conditions, in the event of a release from the injection wells under the single-site, horizontal injection well scenario. However, since the injection well site would be located in a sparsely populated area and these gases would not be present in measurable concentrations under normal operating conditions, impacts from anyrelease are expected to be negligible. Table 3.17-13.

AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT AND IMPACTS Experience and Potential for CO2 Release from Wells Injection wells have been used in the natural gas storage industry for 100 years (Benson 2009) and for enhanced oil recovery for over 40 years (NETL 2013c). NETL (2012b) recentlycompiled information on injection wells into a Best Practices Guide covering well siting, design, construction, monitoring, and closure. The annual frequency of a potential failure in one injection well at a given site was estimated based on experience with existing injection wells as 2.02 x 10-5 per year (0.0000202 per year) (IEA 2006a). Two vertical wells are one option to be used for the FutureGen 2.0 Project. The annual frequency of a potential failure in either of the twovertical wells is estimated to be 4.04 x 10-5 per year (0.0000404 per year). The estimated probability of a potential failure in either of the two wells over a 30-year operating period would be 1.21 x 10-3 (0.00121). Based on the estimated frequency of a potential well failure, such an occurrence is considered extremely unlikely, which was defined as 1x10-4 per year to 1x10-6 per year or between oncein 10,000 yearsand once in 1 million years. No separate frequencies for releases from horizontal wells were identified. Horizontal injection wells have been used at four large-scale carbon storage projects: the Sleipner site beneath the North Sea, the In-Salah site beneath the Algerian desert, the Snøhvit Site beneath the Barents Sea, and the Weyburn-Midale site in Saskatchewan. In 2010, Det Norske Veritas stated that “so far there has been no report of significant leakage of stored CO2 out of the storage formations in any of the current projects” (DNV 2010). The likelihood of a release from the deep horizontal portion of the well is considered to be less than fromthe vertical portion. One benefit of using horizontal injection wells is that multiple wells can be directionally drilled from a common pad, limiting the surface footprint. However, in a recent Best Practices manual for Carbon Storage Systems and Well Management Activities, the author noted that using multilateral wells requires “significant modeling to maintain adequate reservoir conditions and minimal impact toadjacent formations” (NETL 2013b). Educational Facilities The educational facilities are expected to be located in the vicinity of Jacksonville. Health and safety related impacts are not expected during the operation of these facilities, as hazardous or toxic materials would not be used or stored at these locations, nor would these facilities be located in close proximity to the pipeline or injectionwells. 3.17.3.3 Post-Injection Impacts This section addresses potential releases of CO2 and associated trace gases from the subsurface both after their injection into the subsurface storage zone and after injection operations have ceased. The geology of the target CO2 storage formation is described in Section 3.4, Geology. Detailed subsurface plume modeling was conducted by the Alliance with STOMP-CO2 for the currently proposed injection well configuration of four horizontal injection wells for the 20-year injection period. The modeling estimated that the plume would grow to a size of approximately 4,000 acres after a 50-year post injection period (Alliance 2013). As a result, DOE used a subsurface plume area of 4,000 acres in the analysis of hypothetical post-injectionreleases. The evaluation of the potential effects from post-injection releases from the subsurface storage formation was conducted using thefollowing tools: • An Analog database for a previous DOE project (DOE 2007b). The database includes site characteristics of natural CO2 reservoir and operating CO2 storage or EOR sites; results from studies performed at other CO2 storage locations and from sites with natural CO2 accumulations to estimate or measure releases; and results of release estimates for risk assessments at other sites (e.g. two Australian proposed CO2 storage sites in Hooper et al. 2005) for characterizing the nature of potential risks associated with surface leakage due to caprock seal failures, faults, and fractures. The database was also used to predict CO2 release rates based on similarities with the proposed storage reservoir. • USEPA’s SCREEN3 model (USEPA 1995c) was used to estimate the resulting CO2 air concentrations if post-injection releases occurred from slow leaks at low flow rates through abandoned wells or seepage through the caprock and overlying formations. The predicted air concentrations were used to estimate the potential for exposure and any resulting impacts on workers, offsite residents, and sensitive receptors. • Review of recent risk assessment literature was also conducted to identify additional information such as the Vulnerability Evaluation Framework for Geologic Sequestration of Carbon Dioxide (USEPA 2008b) and the Best Practices for Risk Analysis and Simulation for Geologic Storage of CO2 (NETL 2013d). Thesedocuments address potential releasepathways. DOE considered potential releases that could cause acute effects (high concentration over a short duration) and chronic effects (low concentration over alonger duration). Three scenarios couldpotentially cause acute effects: (1) upward leakage through the CO2 injection wells following closure; (2) upward leakage through a deep oil and gas (or other type) well; and (3) upward leakage through undocumented, abandoned, or poorly constructed deep wells. Six scenarios could potentially cause chronic effects: (1) upward leakage through caprock and seals by gradual failure; (2) release through existing faults due to effects of increased pressure; (3) release through induced faults due to local over-pressure conditions; (4) upward leakage through the CO2 injection wells; (5) upward leakage through deep oil and gas (or other type) wells; and (6) upward leakage through undocumented, abandoned, or poorly constructed wells. Such releasescould occur during injection, butare discussed in this separate section. Table 3.17-14 summarizes the types of potential post-injection releases considered in this analysis. The fluxes (the amounts of CO2 that would flow through a unit area per unit time) for these releases were estimated based on the characteristics of the Mt. Simon Formation and information on the local geologic setting compared to the sites included in the database and information on wells near the injection area. This approach was used in the EIS for a previous carbon capture and storage project (DOE 2007b). Not allpotential releasepathways apply to theFutureGen2.0Project injection wells. The target injection zone for geologic storage is the Mt. Simon Formation, which is described in Section 3.4, Geology. The caprock for this project consists of two members of the 479-foot thick Eau Claire Formation, the Lombard and Provisto, located at depths of 3,425 through 3,838 feet at the stratigraphic well. The Mt. Simon Formation is underlain by a 13-foot thick conglomerate zone and Precambrian granite, which was reached at a depth of 4,416 feet in the stratigraphic well. The planned injection zone is between the depths of 4,000 and 4,400 feet into the Mt. Simon Formation, which is classified as a hypersaline aquifer with estimated total dissolved solids of approximately 47,500 parts per million. Thus, it is not considered to be a protected USDW per USEPA UIC regulations, which protect groundwater with lessthan 10,000 milligrams per litertotal dissolvedsolids. The characteristics that were used to develop the input data for the modeling of potential releases are discussed here. Key properties of the target injection zone include depth, thickness, porosity, permeability, and the caprock. Evidence that the Mt. Simon Formation is a feasible injection zone was provided by the Midwest Geological Sequestration Consortium Phase III Large-Scale Field Test. This DOE partnership is using CO2 from Archer Daniels Midland Company’s fuel-grade ethanol production facility in Decatur, Illinois, and has been injecting 1,000 tons per day since November 2011 via an injection well into the Mt. Simon Formation. The purpose of the Archer Daniels Midland project is to demonstrate the ability of the Mt. Simon Formation to accept and retain approximately 1.1 million tons (1.0 million metrictons) ofinjected CO2 over a 3-year period (DOE 2008b). Table 3.17-14.

Simon Formation was found at a depth of 3,900 feet and was 500 feet thick in the FutureGen 2.0 Project stratigraphic well. The base of this well as completed was 4,826 feet; a schematic diagram of the planned injection well design and the formations encountered in the stratigraphic well are shown in Figure 2-25. The Mt. Simon Formation is Cambrian in age and varies from fine to coarse-grained sandstone, and is described as quartz sandstone with 95 percent quartz with a low content of calcium, iron, and magnesium. The cement included feldspar, clay, and mica. Permeability in four core samples from this study obtained from depths of 4,000 to 4,150 feet from Illinois, but not the FutureGen 2.0 Project site, ranged from less than 10 to 350 millidarcies at depths of 4,100 to 4,150 feet (O’Connor and Rush 2005). The porosity ranged from 11 to 12.5 percent within this same interval. The porosities are similar to those in other parts of the Mt. Simon Formation within the Illinois Basin (Finley2005). The early STOMP-CO2 modeling ofthe Mt. Simon Formation for the FutureGen 2.0 Project used values for horizontal permeability of 37 to 417 millidarcies and porosity of 9.6 to 17.1 percent. The salinity of the Mt. Simon Formation brine was measured as 47,500 milligrams per liter. The overlying formation above the Mt. Simon Sandstone is the Cambrian-age Eau Claire Formation. While this formation is described as shale in other parts of the Illinois Basin, the formation in the stratigraphic well consists of thin sandstone at the base, overlain by a 257-foot thick dolomite, followed by a 156-foot thicksiltstone. In addition, there are a series of overlyingsecondaryseals including 214 feet of the regional Franconia Dolomites above the Eau Claire Formation. There are over 1,400 feet of dolomite between the top of the Eau Claire and the base of the St. Peter Sandstone, which is the lowest formation classified by USEPA, but not by Illinois, as a drinking water source. Above the St. Peter Sandstone,there are multiple shale layers,comprising a total of 1,412 feet of shale and limestone. Factors that affect the potential for releases from the storage formation include the presence of faults that cut the caprock(s), active seismicity, deep wells from past oil and gas operations, and abandoned or poorly constructed wells. There are oil fields east of the planned injection zone, gas fields to the southwest, and a gas storage site southwest of Waverly approximately 16 miles from the Alliance’s stratigraphic well and approximate center of the CO2 study area AoR (ISGS 2012d). There are 22 oil and gas wells within the 25-square mile study area identified in the Alliance’s UIC permit applications, although two of the wells are shallow producing gas wells that are 334 and 342 feet deep (see Table 3.41). Three of the oil and gas wells near the estimated location of the injection wells were deeper (1,205 to 1,530 feet deep). Thus, there would be 2,470feet or more between the existing wells and the top of the planned injectionzone and 2,388 feet between the bottomof these wells and the top of the target injection formation. While none of the known deep wells extends deep enough to penetrate the Eau Claire Formation (the primary caprock formation), at a depth of approximately 3,425 feet, or the injection zone, potential releases from unknown, poorly constructed, and abandoned deep wells were evaluated as a precaution. One of the deep oil and gas wells was listed as dry and abandoned but was not listed as plugged as were the other two deep wells. The nearest producing gas wells were in the southern part of the CO2 storage study area, approximately 3.6 miles southwest of the stratigraphicwell for the FutureGen 2.0 Project. However, these two wells were both relatively shallow (i.e., 334 and 342 feet deep). Most of the water wells in the AoR are shallow, and have depths ranging from 19 feet to 115 feet. However, there are two deeper wells with depths of 405 feet and 1,056 feet,whichare still more than 2,900 feet above the injection zone. The nearest major fault system is the Wabash Valley System. The site is approximately 156 miles northeast of one identified fault in this system (ISGS 2012e). There are no known surface ruptures on the faults within the Wabash Valley area (Obermeier and Crone 1994). The injection area is also outside of the area identified as having liquefaction features caused by unknown faults in the Wabash Valley System, which do not extend to the surface and may be associated with the Precambrian basement (Crone and Wheeler 2000). There are two smaller faults, but neither is close to the storage area (Nelson 1995). One fault is located west ofthe La Salle Anticline,whichis approximately 68 miles to the northeast ofthe proposed injection area and the other fault is located west of the Salem Anticline and is approximately 85 miles from the proposed injection area. The general seismic activity of the region is low near the CO2 storage study AoR, with a 2 percent probability of a seismic event with a peak acceleration of 8 to 10 percent of the gravity coefficient within the next 50 years (USGS 2012b). Past earthquakes of 4.5 magnitudes have occurred mostly in the southern part of the state, although the nearest earthquake was centered approximately 25 miles to the northeast (ISGS 2009). Because of low seismic activity and the lack of faults near the injection ROI, potential releases along faults are not expected for the Mt. Simon Formation and were therefore not modeled. The information summarized above on the site conditions and the experiences at other sites from the Analog database were used to identify the likelihood of potential releases and estimated flux rates for the releases. Table 3.17-15 shows the subsurface release flux rates and durations pertinent to potential releases fromthe likely injection zone. The rate of slow leakage through the caprock and other formations was estimated using data from the Farnham Dome Site in Utah, which has natural CO2 in sandstone and dolomite overlain by an interbedded limestone, shale and siltstone cap. Migration of CO2 through the 1,080 feet of dolomite layers between the Eau Claire Formation and into the lowest USDW, the St. Peter Sandstone, is considered unlikely to result in a releaseof gas tothe ground surface. The SCREEN3 model was used to simulate the resulting ambient air concentrations for CO2 due to gradual, slow seepage of gases through the caprock and other overlying formations. The slow seepage rates were allowed to continue during the modeling run for an extended period up to 5,000 years as a conservative estimate because smallleaks couldbe harderto detect. DOE used a time period of 5,000 years based on modeling of CO2 storage sites such as the Weyburn site in Saskatchewan, where “after 5,000 years modeling determined that a free supercritical CO2 dense gas phase will no longer exist, having been effectively trapped” (Preston et al. 2005). The modeling results showed that there was a 95 percent probability that 98.7-99.5 percent of the initial CO2-in-place would remain stored in the geosphere for 5,000 years and the likelihood of movement beyond this time period was very low (IEA 2005). Thus, a frequency of occurrence was estimated over 5,000 years for these natural pathways. The frequency unit was listed as 1/5,000 year per event, since the diffuse flux could occurover the entire spatialextent of the subsurface plume. The frequency for a rapid release through the caprock was estimated as <1 x 10-6 , since an eruptive release in sedimentarybasins has not occurred due to natural pathways (IEA 2006b) and modeling studies of CO2 discharges concluded that there are self-limiting features that prevented an eruptive release powered solely by mechanical energy stored in an accumulation of non-condensable gas, without substantial contributions from thermal energy (Pruess 2006). A higher frequency of 1 x 10-4 was used for gradual releases through the caprock, since low diffuse fluxes have occurred in some natural CO2 areas (e.g. Klusman 2003). However, the proposed target formation for the FutureGen 2.0 Project, the Mt. Simon Formation, has a thick caprock and multiple secondary seals consisting of thick shale and dolomite seals, so a higher frequency than 1 x 10-4 for diffuse leaks was not used for this site. Atmospheric releases of trace gases are unlikelyfor this release mechanism, because the trace gases in the injected fluid would dissolve in the brine or groundwater in the various layers. Thus, the trace gases would beunlikely to reachthe landsurface fromslowseepage throughmultiple saturated formations. Since there are no known nearby faults or overpressure zones, neither of these pathways was simulated. The frequency for leaks along faults due to regional overpressure was estimated as 1 x 10-5,as used in the risk assessments for two Australian candidate geologic storage sites in the Latrobe Valley (Hooper et al. 2005) and in previous DOE projects (DOE 2007b). The same frequency was also used for leakage along faults due to local overpressure. The duration for the faults was 30 years, corresponding to the originally proposed active injection period, when pressure in the reservoir is increasing. The analysis was not re-run for the currently proposed 20-year injection period, since it serves as a conservative upper bound for the impact analysis. The frequency unitis shown as1/5,000 year per fault, since there could be multiplefaults within the storage site, although not at this site. Leakage along unknown structural or stratigraphic connections was assigned the same frequency as faults. Lateral migration to a non-target aquifer was assigned a frequency of 1 x 10-6 , as used for leakage through a permeable zone in a seal (Hooper et al. 2005). The duration of these types of releases is estimated as 100 years to allow time for “the pressure-perturbed system to relax and return to an equilibrium state, generally long after injection ceases” (Birkholzer et al 2009). Modeling results for the injection into the Mt. Simon Formation show an increase in pressure during active injection, and then show a decrease to 90 percent within the first 100 years (Appendix G, Geological Report). The frequency unit is shown as 1/5,000 year per zone, since there could be multiplehigherpermeability zones within thestorage site, although not at this site. Potential leakage from the CO2 injection wells after injection ceased and from unknown abandoned or poorly constructed deep wells either during active injection or after injection ceased were also simulated using SCREEN3, because the flux rates were low and the CO2 gas would not be supercritical. Potential CO2 and trace gas releases at a low flux rate through deep wells were analyzed, although releases of trace gases are less likely. Table 3.17-15 also shows the subsurface release flux rates and durations pertinent to potential releases from wells. A potential future leak through an injection well after injection ceased was based on 1 percent of the amount injected per well into a vertical well on an annual basis for the high rate and 0.01 percent of the amount for the low rate. Following injection, leakage along the vertical portion of a horizontal wellis more likely, so this is an upper bound. The high rate for the abandoned wells used was five times the low injectionwell rate, since they could be older wells with potential damage to the cement used to close the wells, so that the hole diameter could be larger. One-half of the high rate was used as the low rate for abandoned wells. No deep oil or gas wells were simulated, since the known wells and producing reservoirs are shallowerthan the Mt. Simon Formation, as discussed previously. The frequency for leaking injection wells during the operational period was estimated as 2 x 10-5 per year-well. This frequency was decreased to 1 x 10-5 per year-well for the injection wells following operation, since these would be new wells constructed for CO2 injection. The duration of the leaks was estimated based on the time to detect a leak and repair the well, a week for high rates to a year for low rates in the future when the locations of the injection wells could be uncertain. The frequency for leaks from abandoned or deep oil and gas wells, since these wells are likely to be older and constructed as standard industrial wells, was set as 1 x 10-3 for leaking wells (Hooper et al. 2005). For leaking abandoned or undocumented wells that may not have been properly plugged, the duration of 100 years was used to represent the time when reservoir pressure would be elevated. The frequencyunit for wells is 1/year-well, since the likelihood of leaks along this pathway is a function of the number of wells within the estimated subsurface CO2 plume area. Table 3.17-15.

The risk ratios were calculatedbydividing each exposure concentration for CO2 or a trace gas by the pertinent criteria. A risk ratio of less than one indicates that there is no hazard fromthat exposure concentration, and all risk ratios were found to be substantially less than one as shown in the tables. Risk ratios are used to evaluate potential toxic effects; they are not used to evaluate carcinogenic effects. The gases evaluated here are not carcinogens. The comparison to the pertinent acute and chronic criteria for CO2, hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, and sulfur trioxide indicated that no exceedances at a distance of 300 feet are likely to occur. Most of the risk ratios were less than 0.1 indicating minimal potential for effects from gaseous releases. Thus, no effects to the general public are expectedto occur frompost-injection releases bythese pathways. Table 3.17-16.

This is more of a concern where the radon in homes exceeds the USEPA action level for radon of 4 picocuries per liter. Morgan County is located in Zone 1 as defined by USEPA (USEPA 2012i), which has a potential to exceed this criteria (IEMA 2009). In Morgan County, a total of 40 homes have been tested, of which 28 were above 4 picocuries per liter (IEMA 2012a). Mitigation systems were implemented in 11 homes in the county, in the Jacksonville area, and in the southeastern corner of the state (IEMA 2012b). None of the mitigation systems were in the proposed area for injection. Due to the thick caprock above the injection formation (479-foot Eau Claire Formation) and multiple low permeability dolomite and shale formations between the caprock and the glacial deposits, it is considered unlikely that the CO2 could displace additionalradon in the shallowformations. 3.17.4 Intentional Destructive Acts As with any United States energy infrastructure, the proposed FutureGen 2.0 Project facilities could potentially be the target of terrorist attacks or sabotage. However, the potential for such attacks on coal-fueled power plants has not been identified as a threat of comparable magnitude to the concerns about the vulnerability ofnuclear power plants to terrorist attacks (Behrens and Holt 2005). Although risks of sabotage or terrorism cannot be quantified because the probability of an attack is not known, the potential environmental effects of an attack can be estimated. Such effects may include localized impacts from releases of harmful materials or gases at the Meredosia Energy Center and associated facilities, similar to those that could occur as a result of an accident or a natural disaster. To evaluate the potential impacts of sabotage or terrorism, failure scenarios are analyzed without specifically identifying the cause of failure mechanism. For example, a truck running over an injection wellhead would result in a wellhead failure, regardless of whether this was done intentionally or through mishap. Releases of harmful chemicals can occur due to failure of a component, human error, a combination of both, or from external events such as plane or rail accidents (e.g., delivery of hazardous chemicals to the site), seismic events, or other natural events such as high winds, tornadoes, floods, ice storms, and natural or human-caused fires. Therefore, the accident analysis conducted for this EIS evaluates the outcome of catastrophic events without determining the motivation behind the incident. The accident analyses included potential releases from accidents at the energy center, CO2 pipeline, and injection wells. These accidents couldalso be representative ofthe impacts froma sabotage orterrorismevent. Release scenarios evaluated included: liquid oxygen tank leaks, pipeline rupture or puncture, and injection well failure as described previously. Evaluations of hypothetical releases indicate the following potential impacts: • The most likely individuals to be affected by releases from the energy center equipment or tanks are onsite workers. The estimated number of workers during operations is 87 to 115 people, although not all would be present at any given time in proximity to an incident. A failure of the liquid oxygen tanks at the Meredosia Energy Center was evaluated as a potential impact to workers due to fires or frostbite. The initial vapor cloud from such a release was estimated to be withintheenergycenter property. • CO2 and trace gases could be dispersed into the air and migrate downwind frompipeline ruptures or punctures or injection well failures. The number of individuals from the general population potentially experiencing transient effects from a release event of CO2 would be less than one. For a release event from the pipeline or injection wells that includes the trace gases hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, or sulfur trioxide the number of individuals experiencing transient effects is estimated to be three or less. However, under normal operating conditions, the concentration of trace gases are expected to be lower than simulated, in which case there would beno effects fromthe trace gases to the generalpublic. • Under the highest consequence scenarios, onsite workers would be the individuals most at-risk of injury or death ifnear a release at the energycenter, pipeline,or injection wells. 3.17.5 Impacts of the No Action Alternative Under the no action alternative, DOE would not provide cost-shared funding for the FutureGen 2.0 Project. Although the Alliance may still elect to construct and operate the project in the absence of DOE cost-shared funding, for the purposes of the analysis in this EIS, DOE assumed the no action alternative is equivalent to the no-build alternative. Therefore, the project would not be constructed and there would be no change in the status quo with respect to human health and safety conditions within the ROI. 3.18 SOCIOECONOMICS 3.18.1 Introduction This section addresses the socioeconomic conditions most likely to be affected by the construction and operation of the FutureGen 2.0 Project. The discussion presents the region’s demographics, economy, sales and tax revenues, per capita and household incomes, sources of income, and housing availability. This section also addresses potential direct and indirect impacts on socioeconomics resulting from the proposed project. 3.18.1.1 Region of Influence The ROIfor socioeconomics includes Morgan County (in which project components would be located) as wellas the surrounding counties of Brown, Cass, Pike, and Scott. 3.18.1.2 Method of Analysis and Factors Considered DOE performed the socioeconomic impact analysis in this EIS in the following sequence: (1) DOE reviewed data from the U.S. Census Bureau to determine population and employment trends within the ROI; and (2) DOE overlaid the project, including community services and other impacts identified in other sections of this EIS, onto these existing trends to determine potential socioeconomic impacts. It is likely that workers would reside in the primary population centers surrounding the energy center site. Overall,economic benefitswould occurthroughoutthe ROI. DOE assessed the potential for impacts, both beneficial and adverse, based on whether the proposed project would: • Displace existing population or demolish existing housing; • Alter projected rates ofpopulation growth; • Affectthe housing market; • Displace existingbusinesses; • Affectlocal businesses andthe economy; • Displace existingjobs; or • Affectlocal employment or the workforce. 3.18.2 Affected Environment The Meredosia Energy Center is located in Morgan County and is surrounded by Brown, Cass, Pike, and Scott counties. For the counties potentiallyimpacted bythe FutureGen 2.0 Project, Table 3.18-1 compares the population information, Table 3.18-2 presents the housing data, and Table 3.18-3 presents the employment and income information. 3.18.2.1 Meredosia Energy Center, CO2 Pipeline, CO2 Storage Study Area, and Educational Facilities Population and Housing Population Table 3.18-1 provides population information for the counties potentially affected by the FutureGen 2.0 Project. The Meredosia Energy Center and the injection well site(s) are located in Morgan County. Brown, Cass, Pike, and Scott counties (see Figure 3.19-1) surround Morgan County and could also be impacted socioeconomically by the program. Morgan County had a total population of 35,547 in 2010 (USCB 2010e) and lost population as did other counties in the ROI since 2000, while the state population increased. In 2010, the total population for the five counties within the ROI was approximately 77,911 (USCB 2010e). The 2010 population of Illinois was 12,830,632 persons, representing a 3.3 percent increase from 2000 (USCB 2010e). The 2010 United States estimated populationwas 308,745,538, representinga 9.7 percent increase from 2000. Based on the trends within the region, the population is anticipated to grow at a slower rate than the United States and Illinois. These trends reflect a continuing decline in the population of northern Midwest rural areas with the nationwide shift in population to sunbelt states. Approximately 24.3 percent of United States residents and 24.3 percent of Illinois residents were under the age of 18 in 2009, versus 21 percent of the population in Morgan County and 16.8, 24.9, 22.3, and 22.7 percent in Brown, Cass, Pike, and Scott counties, respectively (USCB 2010e). Approximately 12.4 percent of Illinois residents and 12.9 percent of United States citizens were over the age of 64 in 2009 versus 16.2 in Morgan County and 11.8, 15.6, 19.3, and 18.4 percent in Brown, Cass, Pike, and Scott counties, respectively (USCB 2010e); therefore, Morgan County and most surrounding counties give indications of an older population compared tothe state and nation. As discussed in Chapter 2, the Meredosia Energy Center suspended operations at the end of 2011. No substantial population changes are expected to result from the suspension of thefacility. Housing Table 3.18-2 provides total housing and vacant units for the counties potentially affected by the FutureGen 2.0 Project. In 2010, there were 15,515 existing housing units in Morgan County and 34,223 within the ROI as a whole (USCB 2010f). Of the existing housing units within the ROI, 3,897 units were vacant, with Morgan County accounting for 1,411 of those units (USCB 2010f). The rental vacancy rate is 28.4percent in Morgan County and 20.7 percent withintheROI. As discussed in Chapter 2, the Meredosia Energy Center suspended operations at the end of 2011. There would beno changes in housing expected dueto thesuspension oftheMeredosiaEnergyCenter. Table 3.18-1.

In 2010, the unemployment rate was 13.4 percent for the ROI and 9.4 percent for Morgan County, compared to an unemployment rate of 8.9 percent in both the United States and Illinois (USBLS 2011). Thus, the unemployment rate within Morgan County and the ROIis higherthanthat for Illinois andthe UnitedStates. In 2009, Morgan County had a median household income of $42,672 and a per capita income of $23,404 (USCB 2010a). The median household income for the entire ROI was $42,855 and the per capita income was $21,620 (USCB 2010a). In comparison, the median household income for the United States was $52,221 and the per capita income was $27,041 (USCB 2010a). The state of Illinois had a median household income of $53,974 and a per capita income of $28,469 (USCB 2010a). Based on 2009 Census data, both Morgan County and counties within the ROI have per capita incomes lower than both Illinois and the United States. The Meredosia Energy Center employed 57 people prior to its suspension of operations at the end of 2011. Since the suspension of operations, all 57 positions were eliminated. Currently, only security personnel work at the energy center, with a few Ameren employees onsite from time to time to perform maintenance. Table 3.18-3.

To the extent impacts occur, they are expected to be short term and generally beneficial to the ROI.  The need for construction workers would be limited to the estimated 42-month construction period. Between 100 and 300 workers would be needed for the first 12 months; 300 to 500 workers for the second 12 months; 200 to 425 workers for the third 12 months; and up to 75 workers for the final 6 months. Work would peak for approximately 7 months, with approximately 400 to 500 construction and craft workers at the site on any given day.   Within the five-county ROI, an estimated 2,173 workers were employed in the construction industry between 2006 and 2010 (USCB 2010g). Based on the number of unemployed individuals in each of the counties within the ROI and the percentage of construction workers within each county, roughly 100 to 200 construction workers are presumed to be unemployed within the ROI and available to work on the project. Although DOE anticipates that most of the potential workers for the construction phase would already reside in the ROI, additional workers would be needed from outside the ROI. These workers would be expected to commute to the construction site on a daily basis (e.g., from the Springfield metropolitan area), while others may relocate to the area for the duration of the construction period. Therefore, a minor, temporary increase in populationmay occur. The minor temporary increase in population would affect local housing demand commensurately and would have a minor beneficial short-term impact on the housing market. The ROI has approximately 3,897 vacant housing units, with Morgan County accounting for approximately 1,411 of these units. Even if all the construction workers relocated to the area, ample housing would be available. Depending upon the percentage of construction jobs that would be filled by existing residents, the increase of employees from outside the ROI could increase the occupancy rate for vacant housing units and hotels within the ROI. This would resultin a positive, direct impact for the rental market and hotel industry within the ROI. Additionally, area residents may rent available rooms to supplement their household incomes, thereby contributingto a beneficial effect. Economy and Employment There would be a moderate, short-term, beneficial impact to the economy and employment within the ROI from construction at the Meredosia Energy Center. Construction of the facility would directly create up to 500 full-time and part-time construction jobs over the proposed 42-month duration of the effort. These workers would be paid consistent with wages in the area for similar trades. Direct, short-term impacts to employment would occur from jobs related to construction. Indirect employment (e.g., restaurant and other services staff) from incidental spending due to this increase in jobs may also be createdinthe ROI. DOE used the Regional Input-Output Modeling System II (RIMS II), which was developed for the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis, to evaluate the indirect economic impact on employment from constructing the Meredosia Energy Center. RIMS II provides two types of multipliers, final-demand and direct-effect, for estimating the impacts of changes on employment. An estimate of the change in the total number of jobs in the region’s economy was calculated by multiplying the initial change injobs by a direct-effect employment multiplier. By adding up to 500 FTE construction positions, the analysis showed that 577 secondary jobs would be created as a result of the construction of the oxy-combustion facility at the Meredosia Energy Center (BEA 2012). This would reduce the unemployment rate in the region and temporarily benefit the regional economy and employment. Therefore, a moderate, short-term beneficial impact on employment rates and income would occur within the ROI during the construction period. The purchase of building materials, construction supplies, and construction equipment, as well as spending by the construction workers, would add income to the local economy. These expenditures commonly include gasoline, automobile servicing, food and beverages, laundry, and otherretail purchases undertaken in the immediate area because of convenience and access during the course of the business day. Therefore, a short-term, beneficial impact to economic activity within the ROI would occur during the construction period. No displacement of existingbusinesses would be expectedas a result of construction forthe project. Taxes and Revenue There would be a moderate, short-term, beneficial impact to taxes and revenue within the ROI from construction of the oxy-combustion facilityattheMeredosia EnergyCenter. Construction of the project would generate revenue through state and local taxes over the duration of the effort. Local entities would benefit from temporarily increased sales tax revenues resulting from project-related spending on payroll and construction materials. It is anticipated that construction workers would spend their wages on short-term housing, food, and other personal items within the ROI. Additional sales tax revenues could result from taxes that are embedded in the price of consumer items such as gasoline. Therefore, an indirect and beneficial, short-term impact could be expected for the local economy from increased spendingand related sales taxrevenue. CO2 Pipeline and CO2 Storage Study Area Although the Alliance selected the southern route as its proposed route, the route could ultimately deviate slightly as a result of final project design and continuing coordination with landowners. However, the same siting criteria would be followed and impacts would be consistent with those addressed in this section. In addition, since the publication of the Draft EIS, the Alliance updated the design of the injection well site(s) to a single-site scenario that contains all four horizontal wells and surface facilities at one site (see Section 2.5.2.2). This design update resulted in a change to the number of construction workers required for the project. This section discusses the number of jobs created for both the original and revised designs. Additionally, the Alliance identified a proposed propertyfor the injectionwellsite as discussed in Section 2.5.2.1.  Population and Housing There would be a negligible to minor impact on population and housing from construction of the CO2 pipeline for either the southern or northern route, and for construction of the CO2 injection well site(s). To the extent impacts would occur, they are expected to be short termand generallybeneficial to the ROI. The acquisition of ROWs for construction of the pipeline would not require the displacement of population or demolition of existing housing. The acquisition of the proposed injection well site (see Section 2.5.2.1 and Figure 2-20) would require the demolition of a vacant house. This acquisition would be conducted as a voluntary acquisition as specified in the Uniform Relocation Act (49 CFR 24). Because the house is currently vacant, its demolition would not displace population nor affect the regional housing market. Between 150 and 300 workers would be needed for the construction of the pipeline and approximately 55 workers would be needed for the construction of the injection well facilities forthe dual-site scenario analyzed in the Draft EIS and no longer under consideration by the Alliance. The updated design currently proposed by the Alliance would require the same number of construction workers for the pipeline, but the number of workers required for construction of the single-site scenario would decrease to approximately 35. Construction workers mainly would come from within Morgan County and would be hired from county labor pools. Within the five-county ROI, an estimated 2,173 workers were employed in the construction industry from 2006 to 2010 (USCB 2010g). Based on the number of unemployed individuals in each of the counties within the ROI and the percentage of construction workers within each county, roughly 100 to 200 construction workers are presumed to be unemployed within the ROI. A smaller number of temporary construction workers with specialized training, and workers employed by contractors from outside the ROI, would also likely be employed to construct the pipeline. Some of these workers would be expected to commute to the construction site on a daily basis, while others may relocate to the area for the duration of the construction period. Therefore, a negligible to minor, temporary increasein population may occur. The minor temporary increase in population would increase local housing demand commensurately and would have a negligible beneficial short-term impact on the ROI’s housing market as described above for the Meredosia Energy Center, because ample housing is available. Depending upon the percentage of construction jobs that would be filled by existing residents, the increase of employees from outside the ROI could increase the occupancy rate for vacant housing units and hotels within the ROI. This would result in a positive, direct impact for the rental market and hotel industry within the ROI. Additionally, area residents may rent available rooms to supplement their household incomes, thereby contributing to a beneficial effect. Economy and Employment There would be a moderate, short-term, beneficial impact to the economy and employment within the ROI from construction of the CO2 pipeline along either the southern or northern route, and for construction of the CO2 injectionwell site(s). Construction of the CO2 pipeline would directly create up to 300 full-time and part-time construction jobs and the construction of the injection well sites for the dual-site scenario, which is no longer under consideration by the Alliance, would directly create up to 55 full-time jobs over the proposed construction period, for a total of approximately 355 jobs. Construction of the single-site scenario injection wells currently proposed by the Alliance would require fewer construction workers and result in a total of approximately 335 full-time jobs for construction of the pipeline and injection wells. These workers would be paid consistent with wages in the area for similar trades. Direct, short-term impacts to employment would occur from jobs related to construction. Indirect employment (e.g., restaurant and service staff) from incidental spending due to this increase in jobs may also be created in the ROI.  By adding 150 to 300 FTE construction positions, theRIMS II analysis showed that approximately173 to 346 secondary jobs would be created as a result of construction of the CO2 pipeline (BEA 2012). By adding 55 FTE construction positions for the originally proposed dual-site scenario, the RIMS II analysis showed that up to 63 secondary jobs would be created as a result of construction of the injection well site(s) (BEA 2012). For the single-site scenario currently proposed by the Alliance, the 35 FTE construction workers for the injection wells would create approximately 40 secondary jobs. The additional jobs would reduce the unemployment rate in the region and temporarily benefit the economy and employment in the ROI. Therefore, a moderate, short-term beneficial impact on employment rates and income would occur within the ROI during the construction period. Additional short-term, beneficial effects on the economy in the ROI would result from purchases of materials, supplies, and services during construction, as describedabove forthe Meredosia EnergyCenter. No existing businesses or jobs are expected to be displacedby acquisition of ROWs or construction of the pipeline. Taxes and Revenue There would be a moderate, short-term, beneficial impact to taxes and revenue within the ROI from construction of the CO2 pipeline and the CO2 injectionwell site(s). Construction of the project would generate revenue through state and local taxes over the duration of the effort. Local entities would benefit from temporarily increased sales tax revenues resulting from project-related spending on payroll and construction materials. It is anticipated that construction workers would spend their wages on short-term housing, food, and other personal items within the ROI. Additional sales tax revenues could result from taxes that are embedded in the price of consumer items such as gasoline. Therefore, an indirect and beneficial short-term impact could be expected for the local economy from increased spendingand related sales taxrevenue. Educational Facilities Population and Housing There would be a negligible to minor impact on population and housing from construction of the educational facilities in Morgan County. To the extent impacts occur, they are expected to be short term and generally beneficial to the ROI. The acquisition of property for construction of the educational facilities would not requirethe displacement of population or demolition ofexisting housing. As analyzed in the Draft EIS, approximately 87 workers would be needed for the design and construction of the educational facilities in Morgan County for the two-building design. In comparison, the current one-building design would require approximately 47 design and construction employees. Construction workers would come mainly from within the county and would be hired from local county labor pools as described above for the CO2 pipeline and CO2 injection well site(s). Even if all workers were hired externally and relocated to the ROI, the effect on population and housing in the ROI would be negligible and temporary. Economy and Employment There would be a minor, short-term, beneficial impact to economy and employment within the ROI from construction of the educationalfacilities in Morgan County. Construction of the two-building design for the educational facilities analyzed in the Draft EIS would directly create up to 87 full-time construction jobs over the proposed construction period. The current one-building design would create up to 47 full-time construction jobs. These workers would be paid consistent with wages in the area for similar trades. Direct, short-term impacts to employment would occur from jobs related to construction. Indirect employment (e.g., restaurant staff) from incidental spending due to thisincrease in jobs may also be created in the ROI.  By adding up to 87 FTE construction positions for the two-building design, the RIMS II analysis showed that up to 100 secondary jobs would be created as a result of construction of the educational facilities (BEA 2012). Since the current one-building design of the educational facilities would require only 47 FTE construction positions, approximately 55 secondary jobs would be created. The additional jobs would reduce the unemployment rate in the region and temporarily benefit the economy and employment in the ROI. Therefore, a minor, short-term beneficial impact on employment rates and income would occur within the ROIduring the construction period. Also, as described above for the CO2 pipeline and CO2 injection well site(s), secondary spending during the construction effort on materials and supplies, as well as by workers for food and services, would result in short-term, beneficial impacts oneconomic activity. As described in Sections 2.5.3 and 3.0, since the release of the Draft EIS, discussions between the Alliance and Jacksonville civic authorities have focused on a potential site for the educational facilities in Jacksonville, but the specific locations for the educational facilities currently remain unknown. Potential displacement of any business that may be associated with the siting of the educational facilities would be appropriately addressed and compensated through agreement betweenthe Alliance andJacksonville civic authorities. Taxes and Revenue There would be a minor, short-term, beneficial impact to taxes and revenue within the ROI from construction of the educationalfacilities in Morgan County. The project would generate revenue through state and local taxes over the duration of construction. Local entities would benefit from temporarily increased sales tax revenues as described above for the CO2 pipeline and CO2 injection well site(s). Therefore, an indirect and beneficial, short-term impact could be expectedforthe localeconomyfromincreasedspendingandrelated sales tax revenue. 3.18.3.2 Operational Impacts Meredosia Energy Center Population and Housing There would be a negligible to minor impact on population and housing in the ROI from operation of the Meredosia Energy Center. The project would require approximately 87 to 115 full-time employees. It is anticipated that most of the employees would be drawn from the workforce residing within the ROI. Housing for any workers relocating to the area would likely be distributed between owned and rental accommodations.  Even if all of the required staff relocated to the ROI, the increase in population would be very small. Based on the 2010 estimated population and the average household size (2.5 people per household) within the ROI, the relocation of 87 to 115 employees could result in a population increase of 218 to 288 people, representing a 0.28 to 0.37 percent increase in population within the five-county ROI. Any influx of employees from outside the ROI could increase the occupancy rate for vacant housing units within the ROI. Ample housing exists within the ROI to support this increase in population. The ROI has approximately 3,897 vacant housing units, with Morgan County accounting for approximately 1,411 of these units. If all 87 to 115 employees relocated to the ROI, this would represent only a 2.2 to 3.0 percent decrease inavailable housing. Economy and Employment A moderate long-term, beneficial impact to economy and employment would occur within the ROI from operation of the Meredosia Energy Center. The operational phase of the project would have annual operation and maintenance needs that would benefit the ROI. Local contractors could be hired to complete specialized maintenance activities that could not be undertaken by permanent staff, and items such as repair materials, water, and chemicals could be purchased within the ROI. This would have a beneficial impact on the economy in the ROI. The operational phase of the project would also have a direct and beneficial impact on employment by creating approximately 87 to 115 permanent jobs in the ROI. These new jobs would represent a 3.2 to 4.2 percent decrease in the unemployed workforce of the ROI. In addition, operation of the Meredosia Energy Center could replace many of the 57 jobs that were lost following the suspension of operations at thefacility in 2011. Each new operational job created by the project would generate secondary jobs, both indirect and induced. An indirect job supplies goods and services directly to the project. An induced job results from the spending of additional income from indirect and direct employees. By adding up 87 to 115 FTE permanent jobs, the RIMS II analysis showed that approximately107 to 142 secondaryjobs would be created as a result of operation of the Meredosia Energy Center (BEA 2012). This would further reduce the unemployed workforce in the region by an additional 3.9 to 5.2 percent and benefit the economy and employment in the region. Therefore, a moderate, beneficial impact on employment rates and income would occur within the ROI during operations. No existing businesses or jobs would be displaced by energycenter operations. The Illinois Commerce Commission approved a 20-year power purchase agreement for the FutureGen 2.0 Project as discussed in Section 2.4.4.5 (Illinois Commerce Commission 2013a). As part of the approval process, the cost of the FutureGen 2.0 Project was independently evaluated against a cost benchmarkdesigned to protect Illinois ratepayers. The costs were estimated to be less than the cost benchmark. Under the power purchase agreement, Ameren and Commonwealth Edison (an Exelon subsidiary) would enter into contracts with the Alliance to purchase the electricity generated by the FutureGen 2.0 Project. The average monthly bill impact for residential customers serviced by either Ameren or Commonwealth Edison is estimated to be less than $1.50 per month. Customers of rural electric cooperatives would see no impact to their monthly electric bills. Taxes and Revenue There would be a long-term, beneficial impact to taxes and revenue within the ROI from operation of the Meredosia Energy Center. The estimated 87 to 115 employees who would fill new jobs created by the project could generate income tax revenues, as well as sales and use tax revenues within the ROI. Local entities would benefit from increased sales tax revenues resulting from spending on payroll, supplies, and materials. Therefore, an indirect and beneficial long-termimpact could be expected for the local economy fromincreased spendingand related sales tax revenue. CO2 Pipeline and CO2 Storage Study Area Although the Alliance selected the southern route as its proposed route, the route could ultimately deviate slightly as a result of final project design and coordination with landowners. However, the same siting criteria would be followed and impacts would be consistent with those addressed in this section. In addition, since the publication of the Draft EIS, the Alliance updated the design of the injection wells to a single-site scenario that containsallfour horizontalwells and surface facilities at one site (see Section 2.5.2.2). Although the design update resulted in a change to the number of operational workers, this section discusses the number of jobs created for both the original and revised designs. Additionally, the Alliance identified a proposed property for the injection well site as discussed in Section2.5.2.1.  Population and Housing There would be a negligible impact to population and housing from operation of the CO2 pipeline and CO2 injection well site(s). Operation of the injection well sites for the original dual-site scenario would increase the number of employees by approximately 21 full-time positions. The updated design for the single-site scenario currently proposed by the Alliance would create approximately 10 to 15 full-time positions. Even if all of the staff relocated to the ROI, the increase in population would be very small. Based on an analysis comparable to that described above for the Meredosia Energy Center, the relocation of up to 21 employees could result in an increase of up to 0.03 percent in population within thefive-county ROIand cause a reduction of up to 0.5 percent in available housing. Economy and Employment There would be a minor, long-term, beneficial impact to the economy and employment within the ROI from operation and maintenance needs for the CO2 pipeline and CO2 injection well site(s). Local contractors could be hired to complete specialized maintenance activities that could not be undertaken by permanent staff, and items such as repair materials, water, and chemicals could be purchased within the ROI. The operational phase of the project would also have a direct and beneficial impact on employment by creating approximately 21 permanent jobs in the ROI for the dual-site scenario analyzed in the Draft EIS. The updated design for the single-site scenario currently proposed by the Alliance would create approximately 10 to 15 full-time positions. These new jobs would represent a decrease of up to 0.8 percent in the unemployed workforce of the ROI, and each new operations job created by the project would generate secondary jobs, both indirect and induced, as described above for the Meredosia Energy Center.  By adding up to 21 FTE permanent jobs, the RIMS II analysis showed that up to approximately 18 secondary jobs would be created as a result of operation of the injection well site(s) (BEA 2012). This may further reduce the unemployed workforce and benefitthe economy and employment in the region. Taxes and Revenue There would be a long-term, beneficial impact to taxes and revenue within the ROI from operation and maintenance of the injection well site(s). The estimated 21 employees who would fill new jobs created by the dual-site scenario could generate income tax revenues, as well as sales and use tax revenues within the ROI. In addition, sales tax would be levied on materials and supplies purchased for energy center operations. The single-site scenario currently proposed by the Alliance would also have a long-term beneficial impact on taxes and revenues, although to a slightly lesser extent given the slightly lower number of employees. Educational Facilities Population and Housing There would be a negligible impact to population and housing from operation of the educational facilities. Operation of the educational facilities would require approximately 22 new full-time positions. Even if all of the staff relocated to the ROI, the increase in population would be very small. Based on an analysis comparable to that described above for the Meredosia Energy Center, the relocation of 22 employees with families could result in a 0.07 percent increase in population within the five-county ROI and cause a 0.6 percent reduction in availablehousing. Economy and Employment There would be a minor, long-term, beneficial impact to the economy and employment within the ROI from operation of the educational facilities. Daily spending by employees for food and services would positively affect the area, as would spending for materials and supplies to support facilities’ operations. By attracting visitors interested in the technologies applied at the Meredosia Energy Center and the injection well site(s), the educational facilities would benefit the regional economy indirectly. Visitors would likely purchase food and refreshments at nearby establishments and utilize other services in the ROI. The operational phase of the project would have a direct and beneficial impact on employment by creating approximately 22 permanent jobs in the ROI. These new jobs would represent a 0.8 percent decrease inthe unemployed workforce within the ROI, and each new operationsjob created by the project would generate secondary jobs, both indirect and induced, as described above for the Meredosia Energy Center.  By adding 22 FTE permanent jobs (15 for the training facility and 7 for the visitor and research center), the RIMS II analysis showed that approximately 24 secondary jobs (15 due to the training facility and 9 due to the visitor and research center) would be created as a result of the operation of the educational facilities (BEA 2012). This would further reduce the unemployed workforce of the ROI by 0.9 percent and benefittheeconomy and employment in the region.   Taxes and Revenue There would be a long-term, beneficial, impact to taxes and revenue within the ROI from operation of the educational facilities. The estimated 22employees who would fill new jobs created by the operation of the educational facilities could generate income tax revenues, as well as sales anduse tax revenues within the ROI. In addition, sales tax would be levied on materials and supplies purchased for operation of the educational facilities. 3.18.4 Impacts of the No Action Alternative Under the no action alternative, DOE would not provide cost-shared funding for the FutureGen 2.0 Project. Although the Alliance may still elect to construct and operate the project in the absence of DOE cost-shared funding, for the purposes of the analysis in this EIS, DOE assumed that the no action alternative is equivalent to a no-build alternative. Therefore, the project would not be constructed and there would be no change to socioeconomic conditions, as well as no potential benefits from the construction and operationof the energycenter, CO2 pipeline,injectionwells, and educational facilities. INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK 3.19 ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE 3.19.1 Introduction This section identifies low-income and minority communities potentially affected by the construction and operation of the FutureGen 2.0 Project and analyzes potential direct and indirect impacts on environmentaljusticeresulting from the proposed project. 3.19.1.1 Region of Influence The proposed project would be located in Morgan County, which is surrounded by Brown, Cass, Pike, and Scott counties. The ROI was selected to include the census tracts and block groups that would be most directly affected by the construction and operation of FutureGen 2.0 Project components. These include the land areas within a 5-mile radius around the Meredosia Energy Center, and the land areas affected bythe CO2 pipeline corridor, the CO2 storage study area, and the educational facilities. This land area includes all or part of Brown, Cass, Morgan, Pike, and Scott counties (see Figure 3.19-1). The compositions of minorities and low-income residents within these areas were consideredin comparison to the compositions of minorities and low-income residents in the general population of Morgan County, adjacent counties (Brown, Cass, Pike, and Scott), the state of Illinois, and the United States in accordance with CEQ guidelinesfor purposes of identifying thepotential for disproportionately adverse impacts. 3.19.1.2 Method of Analysis and Factors Considered Census data to support environmental justice analyses typically are compiled at the census tract level and the block group level. DOE used block group data to characterize minority populations and census tract data to characterize low-income populations. The analysis for environmental justice in this EIS was performed as follows. First, DOE collected demographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau to characterize low-income and minority populations. DOE then used potential environmental, socioeconomic, and health impacts identified in other sections of this EIS to assess potential impacts to environmental justice communities that could occur with the proposed construction and operation of the project. Finally, DOE utilized the CEQ’s December 1997 Environmental Justice Guidance (CEQ 1997), which provides guidelines regarding whether human health effects on minority or low-income populations are disproportionately high and adverse. Under this guidance, agencies are advised to consider the following three factors to the extent possible: • Whether the risks or rates of health effects (which may include bodily impairment, infirmity, illness, or death) are significant(as considered by NEPA), or above generally accepted norms; • Whether the risk or rate of hazard exposure by a minority population, low-income population, or Native American tribe to an environmental hazard is significant (as considered by NEPA) and appreciably exceeds or is likely to appreciably exceed the risk or rate to the general population or other appropriatecomparison group; and • Whether health effects occur in a minority population, low-income population, or Native American tribe affected by cumulative or multiple adverse exposures from environmental hazards. DOE assessedthe potentialforimpacts basedon whether the proposed project would: • Cause asignificant and disproportionatelyhigh and adverse effect ona minority population; or • Cause asignificant and disproportionately high and adverse effect on a low-income population. 3.19.1.3 Regulatory Framework EO 12898, “Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations,” provides that “each federal agency shall make achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing, as appropriate, disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on minority populations and low-income populations” (EO 12898). DOE (2012)defines “environmentaljustice” as: The fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people—regardless of race, ethnicity, and income or education level—in environmental decision making. Environmental Justice programs promote the protection of human health and the environment, empowerment via public participation, and the dissemination of relevant information to inform and educate affected communities. Department of Energy Environmental Justice programs are designed to build and sustain community capacity for meaningful participation for all stakeholders in Department of Energy host communities. In its guidance for the consideration of environmental justice under NEPA, the CEQ defines a “minority” as an individual who is American Indian or Alaskan Native, Black or African American, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, Hispanic or Latino. CEQ characterizes a “minority population” as existing in an affected area where the percentage of defined minorities exceeds 50 percent of the population, or where the percentage of definedminorities in the affected area is meaningfullygreater (25 percent higher) than the percentage of defined minorities in the general population or other appropriate unit of geographic analysis. The CEQ guidance further recommends that low-income populations in an affected area should be identified using data on income and poverty from the U.S. Census Bureau (CEQ 1997). Low-income populations are populations where households have an annual household income below the poverty threshold, which was $17,050 for a family of four at the time of the 2000 Census (HHS 2000) and $22,050 for a family of four atthe time of the 2010 Census(HHS 2010). 3.19.2 Affected Environment 3.19.2.1 Meredosia Energy Center Minority Populations As shown in Table 3.19-1 and Figure 3.19-1, the majority of the population within Morgan County, in which the Meredosia Energy Center is located, is white (90.9 percent), as compared to the state of Illinois (71.5 percent) and the United States (72.4 percent). The overall population in Morgan County is generally less racially and ethnically diverse (less than 10 percent non-white) than the general population of the state and far more homogeneous than the United States; therefore, a “minority population” as defined by CEQ does not exist in Morgan County. The percentage of minority individuals living in Census Tract 9514, in which the Meredosia Energy Center is located, is 1.5 percent (USCB 2010f). This is lower than the percentages inMorgan County, thestateas a whole, and the United States (USCB 2010e). As discussed in Chapter 2, the Meredosia Energy Center suspended operations at the end of 2011. The minority population distribution in the area is not expected to change as a result of the suspension of operationsattheMeredosia Energy Center.  Figure 3.19-1.

Figure 3.19-2 presents the low-income population distributions within the FutureGen 2.0 Project area. The percentage of low-income individuals within Morgan County (14.1 percent), in which the Meredosia Energy Center is located, is generally comparable to the percentage in the state (13.3 percent) and slightly lower than the United States (14.3 percent) percentage (see Table 3.19-1). The other counties within the ROI are comparable to Morgan County, with Brown and Pike counties having a slightly higher percentage of low-income individuals (15.9 percent and 17.1 percent, respectively) than Illinois and the United States; and Cass and Scott counties having a slightly lower percentage of low-income individuals (12.5 percent and 10.4 percent, respectively) than Illinois and the United States. The percentage of low-income individuals living in Census Tract 9514, in which the Meredosia Energy Center is located, is 12.6 percent. This is lowerthan the percentages inMorgan County, the state as a whole, and the UnitedStates(USCB 2010g). There are no anticipated changes in low-income populations that would be attributable to the suspension of operations at the Meredosia EnergyCenter. 3.19.2.2 CO2 Pipeline, CO2 Storage Study Area, and Educational Facilities Minority Populations No “minority population” as defined by the CEQ exists within the proposed CO2 pipeline corridor from the energy center to the CO2 storage study area or within the CO2 storage study area. The percentages of minorities within the block groups comprising the CO2 pipeline corridor and within the storage study area are 2percent and 2.1 percent, respectively, which arelower than the percentages in Morgan County. Depending on the location selected for the educational facilities, minority populations may exist nearby; however, given the demographics of Morgan County (90.9 percent white), the presence of CEQ-defined minority populations is unlikely. Figure 3.19-2. Low-Income Populations within the FutureGen 2.0 Project Area Low-Income Populations The percentage of low-income individuals within Morgan County overall is 14.1 percent. This percentage is not substantially higher than the percentage in the state (13.3 percent) and is nearly the same as the percentage in the United States (14.3 percent) (see Table 3.19-1). The percentages of low-income individuals within the census tracts comprising the CO2 pipeline corridor and storage study area are 8 percent and 4.2 percent,respectively. These arelower than the percentages for Morgan County, the state as a whole, and the United States (USCB 2010e). Depending on the location selected for the educational facilities,low-income populations may exist nearby. 3.19.3 Impacts of Proposed Action 3.19.3.1 Construction Impacts Meredosia Energy Center As discussed in Section 3.19.2.1, there are no areas of minority populations, as defined by EO 12898 and CEQ guidance, located within the ROIfor the Meredosia Energy Center. Therefore, no disproportionately high and adverse impacts to minority populations are anticipated during construction for the proposed project. No census tracts within the ROI have low-income populations that are proportionately greater than those of the general populations in Morgan County, surrounding counties, the state, and the United States; therefore, no disproportionately high and adverse impacts are anticipated to low-income populations. Construction impacts that may affect the local population, such as impacts to air quality, surface water, transportation, and noise, would be minor and temporary in nature (see Section 3.1, Air Quality; Section 3.6, Surface Water; Section 3.13, Traffic and Transportation; and Section 3.14, Noise and Vibration). Short-term beneficial impacts may include an increase in employment opportunities and potentially higher wages or supplemental income through jobs created during facility construction, as well as the opportunity for homeowners to rent rooms for temporary construction worker lodging (see Section 3.18, Socioeconomics). Environmental justice impacts (or lack thereof) associated with the construction of the oxy-combustion facility at the Meredosia Energy Center would be the same when compared to both the historical baseline (prior operation of the energy center) and the projected baseline (post-suspension of operations at the energycenter). CO2 Pipeline, CO2 Storage Study Area, and Educational Facilities As discussed in Section 3.19.2.2, there are no areas of minority populations, as defined by EO 12898 and CEQ guidance, located within the ROI for the CO2 pipeline, the CO2 storage study area, or the educational facilities. Therefore, no disproportionately high and adverse impacts to minority populations are anticipated. The pipeline route could ultimately deviate slightly from the Alliance’s proposed southern route as a result of final project design and continuing coordination with landowners; however, the same siting criteria would be followed and impacts would be consistent with those addressed in this section. As discussed in Section 3.19.2.2, no census tracts within the ROI have low-income populations that are proportionately greater than those of the general populations in Morgan County, surrounding counties, the state, and the United States; therefore, no disproportionately high and adverse impacts are anticipated to low-income populations. Construction impacts that may affect the local population, such as impacts to air quality, surface water, transportation, and noise, would be minor and temporary in nature (see Section 3.1, Air Quality; Section 3.6, Surface Water; Section 3.13, Traffic and Transportation; and Section 3.14, Noise and Vibration). Short-term beneficial impacts may include an increase in employment opportunities and potentially higher wages orsupplementalincome through jobs created during facilityconstruction,as well as the opportunity for homeowners to rent rooms for temporary construction worker lodging (see Section 3.18, Socioeconomics). 3.19.3.2 Operational Impacts Meredosia Energy Center As described in Section 3.19.2.1, no areas of minority or low-income populations, as defined by EO 12898 and CEQ guidance, are located within the ROI for the Meredosia Energy Center. Aesthetics, transportation, noise, and socioeconomic impacts resulting from operations would not have a disproportionately high and adverse effect on minority and low-income populations (see Section 3.11, Aesthetics; Section 3.13, Traffic and Transportation; Section 3.14, Noise and Vibration; and Section 3.18, Socioeconomics). The potential health risks from a pipeline rupture or puncture, or a catastrophic accident, terrorism, or sabotage are described in Section 3.17, Human Health and Safety. Census tracts and block groups in closest proximityto the Meredosia EnergyCenter would be most at risk in the event of a release resulting from an accident or intentional destructive act at the energy center. As described in Section 3.19.2.1, no minority or low-income populations exist in these census tracts and block groups at higher concentrations than in the general population. Therefore, no disproportionately high and adverse impacts to minority and low-income populations would be anticipated from an accident or intentional destructive act. A small, long-term, beneficial impact to low-income populations would be anticipated due to an increase in employment opportunities and potentially higher wage jobs associated with facility operation (see Section 3.18, Socioeconomics). Environmental justice impacts (or lack thereof) associated with the operation of the Meredosia Energy Center are the same when compared to boththe historical baseline and the projected baseline. CO2 Pipeline, CO2 Storage Study Area, and Educational Facilities As described in Section 3.19.2.2, no areas of minority or low-income populations, as defined by EO 12898 and CEQ guidance, are located within the ROI for the CO2 pipeline, the CO2 storage study area, or the educational facilities. Aesthetics, transportation, noise, and socioeconomic impacts resulting from operations would not have a disproportionately high and adverse effect onminority and low-income populations (see Section 3.11, Aesthetics; Section 3.13, Traffic and Transportation; Section 3.14, Noise and Vibration; and Section 3.18, Socioeconomics). The potential health risks from a CO2 pipeline rupture or puncture, or a catastrophic accident, terrorism, or sabotage involving the pipeline or CO2 injection wells are described in Section 3.17, Human Health and Safety. Census tracts and block groups in closest proximity to the CO2 storage study area and the associated CO2 pipeline would be most at risk in the event of a release resulting from an accident or intentional destructive act along the pipeline or at the injection wells. As described in Section 3.19.2.2, no minority or low-income populations exist in these census tracts and block groups at higher concentrations than in the general population. Therefore, no disproportionately high and adverse impacts to minority and low-income populations would be anticipated froman accident orintentionaldestructive act. Although the Alliance selected the southern route as the proposed route, it could ultimately deviate slightly as a result of final project design and coordination with landowners; however, the same siting criteria would be followed and impacts would be consistent with those addressed in this section. In addition, since the publication of the Draft EIS, the Alliance identified a proposed property for the injection well site (see Section 2.5.2.1). The proposed site is located within the CO2 storage study area, and DOE believes that the analysis of impacts presented in the Draft EIS remains valid.  A small, long-term, beneficial impact to low-income populations would be anticipated due to an increase in employment opportunities and potentially higher wage jobs associated with the project operations. 3.19.4 Impacts of the No Action Alternative Under the no action alternative, DOE would not provide cost-shared funding for the proposed FutureGen 2.0 Project. Although the Alliance may still elect to construct and operate the project in the absence of DOE cost-shared funding, for the purposes of the analysis in this EIS, DOE assumed the no action alternative is equivalent to the no-build alternative. Therefore, the project would not be constructed and there would be no adverse impact to environmental justice populations. In addition, the no action alternative would not provide the potential beneficial economic impacts associated with the proposed project. 4 SUMMARY OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES This chaptercontains the followingsections: • Section 4.1, Comparative Impacts of Alternatives • Section 4.2, Measures toMitigate Adverse Impacts • Section 4.3, Potential CumulativeImpacts • Section 4.4, Incomplete andUnavailable Information • Section 4.5, Irreversible and Irretrievable Commitments • Section 4.6, Relationship between Short-Term Uses of the Environment and Long-Term Productivity 4.1 COMPARATIVE IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVES As described in Chapter 2, the FutureGen 2.0 Project considers two alternatives: the no action alternative and the proposed action. Under the no action alternative, DOE would not provide cost-shared funding for the FutureGen 2.0 Project.Althoughthe Alliance maystill elect to construct and operate the project inthe absence of DOE cost-shared funding, for the purposes of the analysis in the EIS, DOE assumed that the no action alternative is equivalent to a no-build alternative. The proposed project consists of the Oxy-Combustion Large Scale Testand the CO2 Pipelineand Storage Reservoir as described in Section 2.5. DOE evaluated the potential impacts of the no action alternative and the proposed action in relation to the baseline conditions. Detailed discussion of baseline conditions and potential impacts are provided in Chapter 3. Table 4.1-1 summarizes the potential impacts for each of the 19 resource areas for the no action alternative and forthe proposed action. The EIS uses the followingdescriptors to qualitativelycharacterize impacts on respective resources: • Beneficial – The impacts would benefit the resource. • Negligible – No apparent or measurable impacts are expected; may also be described as “none” if appropriate. • Minor – The actionwouldhave a barelynoticeable ormeasurable adverse impacton the resource. • Moderate – The action would have a noticeable or measurable adverse impact on the resource. This category could include potentially significant impacts that would be reduced to a lesser degree by the implementation of mitigation measures. • Substantial – The action would have obvious and extensive adverse effects that could result in potentiallysignificant impacts on a resource despite mitigation measures. Table 4.1-1. Summary of Environmental Impacts by Alternative for the FutureGen 2.0 Project Criteria Considered No Action Proposed Project DOE/EIS-0460 FUTUREGEN 2.0 PROJECT FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT SUMMARY OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES COMPARATIVE IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVES Air Quality Impacts were assessed based on whether the proposed project would: • Result in emissions of criteria pollutants or hazardous air pollutants that would exceed relevant air quality or health standards; • Cause an adverse change in air quality related to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards or Illinois standards; • Violate any federal or state permits; • Affect visibility and regional haze in Class I areas; or • Conflict with local or regional air quality management plans to attain or maintain compliance with the federal and state air quality regulations. No Impacts. Baseline conditions would not change. Construction: Minor Adverse Impacts: Construction of the proposed FutureGen 2.0 Project would result in short-term, minor, localized increased tailpipe and fugitive dust emissions. Because the proposed project would occur in an area listed as either in “attainment” or “unclassified" for all criteria pollutants, Clean Air Act conformity requirements are not applicable and thus there are no emissions thresholds that pertain to the construction phase of this project. Emissions would be concentrated at the construction sites and would steadily decrease with distance. Operations: Minor Adverse Impacts: Normal operations of the oxy-combustion facility would cause increases in air emissions over current conditions. Air emissions generated by operations of the project would not exceed relevant air quality standards when analyzed as an isolated project or when cumulatively combined with applicable regional sources. During normal operations, the gas quality control system would incorporate state-of-the-art flue gas scrubbing technology to minimize pollutant emissions from the stack. Beneficial impacts could result from overall lower emissions, as electricity generated by this project may displace electricity generated by traditional coal-fired power plants that emit significantly higher levels of pollutants. Climate and Greenhouse Gases Impacts were assessed based on whether the proposed project would: • Cause an increase (or decrease) in GHG emissions of 75,000 tons per year (68,250 metric tons per year) CO2-equivalent or more; or • Threaten to violate federal, state, or local laws or requirements regarding GHG emissions. No Direct Impacts. Indirect Adverse Impacts related to not furthering commercial-scale advanced oxycombustion coal-based power generation technologies with CO2 capture and sequestration. Further, without the project, regional electricity needs would likely be met by conventional coal-or natural gas-based electric power generation. Therefore, Construction: Minor Adverse Impacts: Construction of the proposed FutureGen 2.0 Project would generate approximately 48,009 tons (43,688 metric tons) of CO2 emissions over the multi-year construction period. Operations: Beneficial Impacts: The capture and geological storage of GHG emissions by the project would produce a beneficial cumulative effect on a national and global scale. Operation of the project components would result in up to approximately 169,701 tons per year (154,283 metric tons per year) of new CO2 emissions (net after CO2 capture and storage). The proposed project would capture and sequester approximately 1.2 million tons per year (1.1 million metric tons per year) of CO2 emissions from the generation of 168 MWe (gross) electric power, which would generate approximately 90 percent lower GHG emissions compared to a similarly sized conventional coal-fired power plant, or approximately 70 percent lower compared to a natural-gas fired power plant. On September 20, 2013, the USEPA proposed a CO2 emissions standard for new coal-based power plants that could require emissions to be as low as 1,000 pounds CO2/MWh gross. The proposed oxycombustion facility would emit approximately 295 pounds CO2/MWh gross and would therefore meet this requirement if it were to be finalized. The reduction in CO2 emissions resulting from the project would incrementally reduce the rate of GHG accumulation in the atmosphere and help to incrementally mitigate climate change related to atmospheric concentrations of GHGs. On a broader scale, successful implementation of the project may lead to widespread acceptance and deployment of oxy-combustion technology with geologic storage of CO2, thus fostering a long-term Table 4.1-1.

Overall construction for the proposed project would disturb up to a maximum of 364 acres of soil classified as prime farmland. However, with the identification of the proposed injection well site as addressed in this Final EIS, the permanent loss of prime farmland would be approximately 14 acres (4 percent) for all associated facilities, as compared to less than 25 acres (7 percent) based on the original concept for the injection well facilities. All other prime farmland in the pipeline route could be restored to preconstruction use. Based on the revised site plan, construction at the Meredosia Energy Center would disturb up to a maximum of 95 acres of soils classified as farmland of statewide importance (of which 54 acres would be permanently converted for project use), as compared to 146 acres reported in the Draft EIS (79 acres permanently converted). However, these soils at the energy center are not currently used for agricultural purposes and likely are no longer suitable for agricultural use. Also, construction would affect 16 acres of Urban soils and 2 acres of hydric soils at the energycenter. Operations: Minor Adverse Impacts: Based on the revised site layout, approximately 54 acres of soils classified as farmland of statewide importance would be permanently converted to uses for the Meredosia Energy Center (compared to 79 acres for the original layout). Also, approximately 14 acres of prime farmland soils would be permanently converted to project uses at the proposed injection well site (compared to less than 25 acres for the original injection well concept). DOE anticipates that the property above the CO2 pipeline would be returned to agricultural use after the construction period ends. Geology Impacts were assessed based on whether the proposed project would: • Cause or be damaged by geologic-related events (e.g., earthquake, landslides, sinkholes); No Impacts. Baseline conditions would not change; the stratigraphic well would be closed. Construction: Minor Adverse Impacts: Construction at the Meredosia Energy Center and CO2 pipeline may require excavation of glacial materials. Construction of the injection wells would result in removal of geologic media through the drilling process. This process would not be unique to the area and would not affect the availability of local geologic resources. Table 4.1-1.

At the injection wells, the potential of CO2 migrating out of the injection zone is considered highly unlikely. Computer modeling conducted by the Alliance for their proposed injection well configuration of four horizontal wells installed at one injection well site predicted that the CO2 plume would expand to encompass an area of approximately 4,000 acres within the CO2 storage study area over the 20-year injection period. During injection, the Alliance would monitor the formation pressure to ensure that injection-induced seismicity would not occur. The Alliance would also follow a USEPA-approved MVA plan, and conduct extensive studies and monitoring to minimize this potential long-term impact. As required by the UIC permits, appropriate mitigation strategies would be implemented should such CO2 migration be identified. Groundwater Impacts were assessed based on whether the proposed project would: • Deplete groundwater supplies on a scale that would affect available capacity of a groundwater source for use by existing water rights holders, or interfere with groundwater recharge; • Conflict with established water rights, allocations, or regulations protecting groundwater for future beneficial uses; • Contaminate shallow aquifers due to chemical spills, well drilling or well completion failures; • Conflict with regional or local aquifer management plans or the goals of governmental water authorities; or • Contaminate USDWs through acidification of an aquifer due to migration of CO2 or toxic metal dissolution and mobilization, displacement of naturally occurring No Impacts. Baseline conditions would not change. Construction: Negligible Impacts: Construction at the Meredosia Energy Center and pipeline corridor would not include onsite discharges to groundwater and would follow the updated National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit and Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure plans to minimize any potential for groundwater contamination. Construction of the injection wells would follow the construction plan in the UIC permits so that local groundwater aquifers would not be impacted from drilling. Operations: Minor Adverse Impacts: Operation of the Meredosia Energy Center would withdraw approximately 124,000 gallons of groundwater per day from three onsite groundwater wells, which is less than the historical use at the energy center site (between 212,000 and 982,000 gpd), and less than 4 percent of the historical use by the industrial plants in the Meredosia area. The potential for groundwater contamination would be minimized during operations by implementing a Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure Plan and implementing the procedures in the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit. Operation of the pipeline would have negligible impacts as it would not be expected to affect groundwater. At the injection wells, the potential for CO2 migration upward through fractures in the caprock seal is considered highly unlikely, and extensive vertical movement into drinking water aquifers would not be expected. As part of the UIC permit applications (submitted in early 2013), the Alliance provided an MVA plan, which presents the procedures that the Alliance would use to monitor and contain the CO2 within the injection zone. Table 4.1-1.

If the Alliance undertakes activities related to the barge unloading facility that would disturb the river bottom, then water quality could be reduced by increased turbidity and sedimentation during streambed disturbance. While all perennial streams and the majority of intermittent streams would be avoided using trenchless technologies for pipeline construction, trenching could occur during pipeline construction at certain ephemeral and intermittent streams that are seasonally-dry at the time of construction. However, these features would be restored to pre-construction conditions after construction activities were completed. Construction of the injection well site(s) could increase the potential for contamination from material spills. Operations: Minor Adverse Impacts: Based on refinements in design since publication of the Draft EIS, the project would withdraw an estimated 13.6 mgd from the Illinois River for oxy-combustion facility operations and discharge 10.6 mgd of treated effluents (representing increases from the estimated 11.4 mgd withdrawal and 9 mgd discharge analyzed in the Draft EIS for the original design). However, the surface water withdrawals and discharges for operations would be approximately94 percent less than the average 217 mgd withdrawal and 189 mgd discharge during historical operations at the energy center. There would be no operational impacts associated with the barge area, as this area would be returned to pre-existing conditions after construction activities at the Meredosia Energy Center were completed. The proposed project would increase the potential for stormwater runoff due to increased impervious area at the proposed oxy-combustion facility site and would increase the potential for contamination from material spills. Operation of the pipeline and injection well site(s) would not affect surface water, other than increasing the potential of material spills during maintenance. Table 4.1-1.

Although the Alliance’s current plans for unloading equipment would avoid potential impacts to the bank or bottom of the Illinois River, the EIS maintains the options evaluated in the Draft EIS as representing appropriate upper bounds for the barge unloading operations during construction of the oxy-combustion facility. If the Alliance undertakes activities related to the proposed barge unloading facility that would disturb the river bottom, then temporary impacts would occur resulting in potential increased sedimentation of the Illinois River. For the CO2 pipeline, the southern route operational ROW contains no NWI-mapped wetlands, but may contain up to 0.5 acre of freshwater wetlands based on a wetland delineation performed by the Alliance in spring 2013; the northern route, which is no longer being considered by the Alliance, contains 0.2 acre of NWI-mapped open water wetlands. While all wetlands, perennial streams, and the majority of intermittent streams would be avoided using trenchless technologies, trenching could occur during pipeline construction at certain ephemeral and intermittent streams which are seasonally-dry at the time of construction. Construction of the pipeline at these locations, which although dry may still be considered USACE-jurisdictional features, would cause temporary disturbance of the dry stream channel bed and would be restored after construction activities were completed. In addition to the above, the wetland delineation conducted by the Alliance also identified a 0.03-acre area of hydric soils located in an active agricultural field within the southern pipeline route that would be crossed using traditional trenching. Although this feature possesses the characteristics of a wetland, it is not expected to be considered jurisdictional by the USACE. No impacts to wetlands are anticipated at the CO2 injection well site(s). Construction within the 100-year floodplain would primarily occur only in areas that are currently developed at the Meredosia Energy Center; therefore, additional impacts are not expected. If the Alliance undertakes activities related to the proposed barge unloading facility as analyzed in the Draft EIS, temporary placement of facilities within the 100-year floodplain would occur during construction, and the area would be returned to pre-construction conditions after construction activities are completed. Construction of the CO2 pipeline would cross 100-year floodplains and may result in small ancillary structures being placed in the 100-year floodplain, resulting in minor impacts. Construction at the CO2 injection well site(s) is not anticipated to impact floodplains; as per the siting criteria, these areas would be avoided. Operations: Negligible to Minor Adverse Impacts: There would be no operational impacts to wetlands as maintenance of the ROW (e.g., mowing or vegetation clearing) would not occur within wetland areas. Mainline block valves would be placed on either side of streams and other wetland features, as needed. Table 4.1-1. Summary of Environmental Impacts by Alternative for the FutureGen 2.0 Project Criteria Considered No Action Proposed Project Biological Resources DOE/EIS-0460 FUTUREGEN 2.0 PROJECT FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT SUMMARY OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES COMPARATIVE IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVES Impacts were assessed based on whether the proposed project would: • Cause displacement of terrestrial or aquatic communities or loss of habitat; • Diminish the value of habitat for wildlife or plants; • Cause a decline in native wildlife populations; • Interfere with the movement of native resident or migratory wildlife species; • Conflict with applicable management plans for terrestrial, avian, and aquatic species and their habitat; • Cause the introduction of noxious or invasive plant species; • Diminish the value of habitat for fish species (including altering drainage patterns causing displacement of fish species or interfering with movement of native resident fish species); • Cause a decline in native fish populations; • Adversely affect endangered, threatened, or other special status species; or • Cause adverse modification to designated critical habitat of a federally-listed species. No Impacts. Baseline conditions would not change. Construction: Minor to Moderate Adverse Impacts: The Alliance originally anticipated the need to clear approximately 33 acres of forested area at the energy center and 8 acres for the southern pipeline route. However, through ongoing refinements in the site plan at the energy center and the use of trenchless boring techniques during pipeline construction, the Alliance expects to reduce the amount of forested area cleared to a maximum of 9 acres at the energycenter and 6 acres for construction of the southern pipeline route. Although the Alliance’s current plans for unloading equipment at the energy center would avoid potential impacts to the bank or bottom of the Illinois River, the Final EIS maintains the options evaluated in the Draft EIS as representing appropriate upper bounds for the barge unloading operations during construction of the oxy-combustion facility. If the Alliance undertakes the barge unloading activities analyzed in the Draft EIS, there could be a disturbance to riverbed sediments and a release of buried contaminants, including polychlorinated biphenyls and mercury. This release could have an adverse impact on local and downstream aquatic resources, including protected species. DOE is preparing a Biological Assessment addressing the three federally-listed species for which suitable habitat occurs in the project area: the Indiana bat, decurrent false aster, and eastern prairie fringed orchid. Indiana bat habitat surveys were completed in spring-summer 2013 at the energy center and southern pipeline route. Decurrent false aster surveys were conducted during flowering in late summer 2013 where potential habitat was identified in the project area. Initial surveys for the eastern prairie fringed orchid determined that the soil types are unsuitable and no individuals were found. Based on the progress of the Biological Assessment, DOE believes that the proposed action is not likely to adversely affect any of the listed species. The Biological Assessment, when submitted, will provide DOE’s final determination and will identify measures as appropriate to minimize impacts on federally-listed species. Forested areas along the pipeline and at the energy center would be cleared between September and February to avoid disturbing the Indiana bat and migratorybirds. Operations: Minor Adverse Impacts: During operation, the 50-foot wide CO2 pipeline operational ROW would be kept free of woody vegetation to permit access for inspection and maintenance activities. This would leave the vegetation in the operational ROW in a persistent herbaceous state, creating a permanent habitat conversion in areas that were previously forested. Clearing of forested areas would cause a small degree of habitat fragmentation. In total, the proposed southern route as refined after release of the Draft EIS would result in the loss of up to 6 acres of forested lands (compared to 8 acres in the original layout). The northern CO2 pipeline route, which is no longer being considered by the Alliance, would result in the loss of up to 22 acres of forested lands. Due to the comparatively small areas of DOE/EIS-0460 FUTUREGEN 2.0 PROJECT FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT SUMMARY OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES COMPARATIVE IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVES Table 4.1-1.

However, any potential impacts to cultural resources would be avoided or mitigated in accordance with a Programmatic Agreement between the DOE, the Alliance, and the SHPO. The proposed injection well site identified after publication of the Draft EIS would require demolition of a single, abandoned dwelling that was constructed between 1959 and 1963. This structure is not unique in the region and appears to lack the necessary degree of architectural merit or historical relevance to be considered as potentially eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. In addition, other historic resources within the applicable area of potential effects would not be expected to incur any apparent or measurable impacts as the project would not be expected to alter the setting or other aspects of integrity of these resources. The project would not introduce visual, atmospheric, or audible elements that diminish the integrity of the resource’s significant historic features. Operations: No Impacts: Operation of the proposed project would not be expected to have an adverse impact on cultural resources. Land Use Impacts were assessed based on whether the proposed project would: • Be incompatible with land use adjacent to the Meredosia Energy Center and within and adjacent to the CO2 pipeline corridor, CO2 storage study area, and associated components and facilities; • Result in land use restrictions on adjacent properties; or No Impacts. Baseline conditions would not change. Construction: Minor Adverse Impacts: Since there are no applicable zoning and land use plans in unincorporated Morgan County, construction of the proposed project would not conflict with any designated county zoning plans. The educational facilities in the city of Jacksonville would be designed to abide by the existing zoning and comprehensive plan. The Meredosia Energy Center property offers sufficient infrastructure to support most of the construction activities required for the oxy-combustion facility. Additional land area outside of the energy center would be used for construction staging and equipment laydown, but that land area would only be temporarily impacted as it would revert back to its original condition after construction. Impacts due to construction of the CO2 pipeline and injection well site(s) would be negligible to minor. Short-term impacts Table 4.1-1.

Long-term impacts would occur in areas that require conversion of land, such as vegetated land, for the pipeline ROW and for the CO2 injection well site(s). Construction of the educational facilities in the city of Jacksonville would have negligible impacts since the Alliance would follow stipulations of the Jacksonville Zoning Ordinance. Operations: Negligible Adverse Impacts: Operation of the oxy-combustion facility would not conflict with any designated county zoning plans. Additionally, operation of the oxy-combustion facility would be compatible with the developed, industrial land use within and adjacent to the Meredosia Energy Center; therefore, impacts would be negligible. Impacts due to operation of the CO2 pipeline and injection well site(s) would be negligible to minor. Most of the land along the pipeline is agricultural and would continue to be used for agricultural purposes during operations. Operation of the injection well site(s) would result in minor impacts associated with permanently removing less than 25 acres of mostly agricultural land from existing use. To the extent practicable, the Alliance would avoid net reductions in agricultural land. To replace acreages of land potentially removed from agricultural use due to the project, the Alliance would designate land that is currently not farmed as agricultural land. Land potentially placed into new agricultural use would be in the immediate vicinity of land taken out of agricultural use. Operation of the educational facilities in the city of Jacksonville would have negligible impacts since the Alliance would follow stipulations of the Jacksonville Zoning Ordinance. Aesthetics Impacts were assessed based on whether the proposed project would: • Block or degrade a scenic vista or viewshed; • Degrade or diminish a federal, state, or local scenic resource; • Change the area’s visual resources; • Create glare or illumination that would be obtrusive or incompatible with existing land use; or • Create visual intrusions or visual contrasts affecting the quality of a landscape. No Impacts. Baseline conditions would not change. Construction: Minor to Moderate Adverse Impacts: Construction of the proposed FutureGen 2.0 Project would result in temporary minor adverse impacts from increased visibility of construction activities to nearby sensitive receptors, as well as from fugitive dust, transportation, and noise. Temporary moderate impacts would occur as a result of the lighting required to support well drilling on a 24-hour per day basis. Operations: Minor Adverse Impacts: Operations of the project would result in minor impacts to aesthetics from the introduction of new buildings to the viewshed, including a 450-foot stack and associated steam plume. Minor impacts would occur to the viewshed from new utility lines constructed to the injection well site(s), placement of pipeline markers along the CO2 pipeline, and from the introduction of the new surface facilities at the injection well site(s). Additional minor impacts would occur from the permanent conversion of natural areas (i.e., forests or grasslands) to typically revegetated grass in the areas of the pipeline ROW and injection well site(s). Periodic vegetation clearing and other maintenance activities would also result in negligible impacts. Table 4.1-1. Summary of Environmental Impacts by Alternative for the FutureGen 2.0 Project Criteria Considered No Action Proposed Project Materials and Waste Management DOE/EIS-0460 FUTUREGEN 2.0 PROJECT FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT SUMMARY OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES COMPARATIVE IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVES Impacts were assessed based on whether the proposed project would: • Cause new sources of construction materials and operational supplies to be developed, such as new mining areas, processing plants, or fabrication plants; • Affect the capacity of existing material suppliers and industries in the region; • Create wastes for which there are no commercially available disposal or treatment technologies; • Create the need for a hazardous waste treatment, storage, or disposal permit for the project; • Affect the capacity of waste collection services, and treatment, storage, and disposal facilities; • Create reasonably foreseeable conditions that would increase the risk of a hazardous waste release; or • Create reasonably foreseeable conditions that would increase the risk of a hazardous material release. No Impacts. Baseline conditions would not change. Construction: Negligible Adverse Impacts: Construction of the proposed FutureGen 2.0 Project would require the use of structural and other materials in quantities that would have negligible impact on local or regional supplies. Generation of construction wastes would be minimized through material management practices such as spill prevention for petroleum products and segregation of recyclable materials. Adequate disposal capacity exists in the region to handle any construction wastes that would be generated. Operations: Minor to Moderate Adverse Impacts: Based on the Alliance’s refinements to the design since publication of the Draft EIS, project operation would require the following materials in larger quantities compared to the quantities analyzed in the Draft EIS: coal (approximately 745,000 tons per year, compared to 700,000 in the Draft EIS), hydrated lime (approximately 68,200 tons per year, compared to 43,000 in the Draft EIS), and trona (approximately 3,200 tons per year, compared to 800 in the Draft EIS). These and other materials required to operate the proposed project are widely available; their use in the project would not have a noticeable impact on local and regional supplies. The largest waste streams from operation of the project would consist of fly ash (approximately 200,000 tons per year) and bottom ash (approximately 14,000 tons per year, compared to 12,000 in the Draft EIS). The Meredosia Energy Center would attempt to sell fly ash by-product to local and regional businesses. Bottom ash, and any fly ash that is not beneficially reused, would be disposed of in permitted landfills. Disposal of these waste streams could have minor to moderate impact on local and regional disposal capacity. The project also has the potential to generate hazardous waste and non-hazardous municipal solid wastes from the oxy-combustion facility, CO2 pipeline, injection well site(s), and educational facilities. These wastes would be collected and transported offsite for disposal in accordance with applicable regulations, and the amounts and types of waste generated would not substantially affect local and regional treatment and disposal capacity. Traffic and Transportation Impacts were assessed based on whether the No Impacts. proposed project would: Baseline conditions • Substantially increase daily vehicular would not change. traffic on key roadway segments and thereby degrade the level of service to exceed traffic-handling capacity; • Substantially increase daily barge traffic on the Illinois River to exceed capacity and interfere with other users; or Construction: Minor Adverse Impacts: Construction of the proposed FutureGen 2.0 Project would cause temporary and localized congestion, particularly on roadways close to the Meredosia Energy Center, and to a lesser extent, on roadways close to the other construction sites. However, construction would be temporary, and all roadways in the ROI have the capacity to accommodate traffic increases associated with the construction of all components of the proposed project without substantially degrading the level of service. Limited adverse effects due to additional barge traffic and offloading would be expected. DOE/EIS-0460 FUTUREGEN 2.0 PROJECT FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT SUMMARY OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES COMPARATIVE IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVES Table 4.1-1. Summary of Environmental Impacts by Alternative for the FutureGen 2.0 Project Criteria Considered Traffic and Transportation (continued)  No Action  Proposed Project  • Conflict with regional or local transportation improvement plans.  Operations: Minor Adverse Impacts: Operation of the proposed FutureGen 2.0 Project would have long-term minor adverse effects on transportation resources resulting from increased vehicle and truck traffic. Operation would cause long-term but localized congestion, particularly on roadways close to the Meredosia Energy Center. The level of service would not change on any roadways during operations, when compared to a no-build scenario.  Current design anticipates that Powder River Basin coal would be the only material delivered by barge, which would require approximately 180 barge trips per year. However, alternatively, the Alliance may decide to have the Illinois bituminous coal (IL No.6) and the Powder River Basin coal blended offsite at a commercial coal-handling facility. In that case the entire volume would be delivered by barge, amounting to approximately 451 barge deliveries per year to transport coal to the energy center (1 to 2 barge deliveries on a daily basis). Historically, the number of annual barge deliveries ranged between 140 and 500 over the past several years. Therefore, waterway capacity would be sufficient for the operation of the barges, and impacts are expected to be negligible. Potential deliveries of blended coal by barge would replace daily deliveries by truck.  Noise  Impacts were assessed based on whether the proposed project would: • Conflict with any state or local noise ordinances; • Cause perceptible increases in ambient noise levels at sensitive receptors during construction—from either mobile or stationary sources; • Cause long-term perceptible increases in ambient noise levels at sensitive receptors during operations—from either mobile or stationary sources; or • Cause excessive ground-borne vibration to persons or property. No Impacts. Baseline conditions would not change. Construction: Minor to Moderate Adverse Impacts: Construction noises at the Meredosia Energy Center could have a minor to moderate impact on the few nearest residences; however, due to the nature of construction, the noise would be intermittent and temporary until the construction phase is over. Construction of the pipeline would result in minor to moderate, short-term, and intermittent increases in noise and vibrations at receptors near the pipeline ROW due to construction equipment activity and increased truck traffic. Not accounting for natural attenuation, receptors at distances greater than approximately 830 feet during typical pipeline construction, or approximately 2,330 feet during trenchless boring activities, would hear the construction noise at levels below 65 dBA, which is the limit deemed as normally acceptable to residential receptors. At the injection well site(s), the primary sources of noise during construction would be from drilling the wells and construction of the supporting facilities. The drilling of the injection wells would occur over a continuous, 24-hour duration, 7 days per week, for approximately 100 days per well, and because of the duration, would be the dominant noise source. The Alliance would construct earthen noise berms around the well pad to mitigate the noise impact to the nearest residences during this period. Ground vibrations from well drilling activities are expected to have negligible impact to nearby structures. DOE/EIS-0460 FUTUREGEN 2.0 PROJECT FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT SUMMARY OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES COMPARATIVE IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVES Table 4.1-1. Summary of Environmental Impacts by Alternative for the FutureGen 2.0 Project Criteria Considered Noise (continued)  No Action  Proposed Project  Operations: Minor Adverse Impacts: During operations, noise from the Meredosia Energy Center would either remain the same or be reduced in comparison to historical energy center operations. Similarly, noise levels during operations are expected to stay at the same level in comparison to current (post-2011) ambient conditions, since local noise levels are and will continue to be dominated by the existing Cargill facility and the highway IL-104. There would, however, be an increase in truck noise in the near vicinity of the energy center due to increased usage of trucks for coal delivery under the proposed project, compared to the historical use of barges as the primary means for coal delivery. The volume of truck traffic transporting feedstock (mainly coal and limestone) and removing wastes (mainly fly ash and bottom ash) would total less than 88 daily roundtrips. This represents almost 50 additional roundtrips per day when compared to historic truck traffic volumes. Operations at the injection well site(s) under normal operating conditions would be dominated by typical heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems. Since the nearest sensitive receptors at the injection well site(s) are expected to be farther than 500 feet away, the noise impacts from operational equipment at the injection well site(s) would be minor.  Utilities  Impacts were assessed based on whether the proposed project would: • Impact the effectiveness of existing utility infrastructure or cause temporary failure; • Affect the capacity and distribution of local and regional utility suppliers to meet the existing or anticipated demand; or • Require public utility system upgrades. No Impacts. Baseline conditions would not change. Construction: Minor Adverse Impacts: Construction of the proposed FutureGen 2.0 Project would result in increased demand for potable and process water, increased generation of wastewater, and increased electricity consumption. In addition, the placement of new electrical lines would be required to support operation of the proposed project. Construction-related impacts to water supplies would be short term and minor, while construction-related impacts to wastewater treatment would be negligible. Overall impacts to utilities during construction would be minor. Operations: Minor Adverse Impacts: Operation of the oxy-combustion facility would result in demand for potable and process water, generation of wastewater, and electricity consumption and generation. Existing utilities have adequate capacity to handle additional demands. Operation of the injection well site(s) and educational facilities would result in increased demand for potable water and electricity, and increased generation of wastewater. Operations impacts to water supplies would be negligible. Overall impacts to utilities during operations would be minor. Table 4.1-1. Summary of Environmental Impacts by Alternative for the FutureGen 2.0 Project Criteria Considered No Action Proposed Project DOE/EIS-0460 FUTUREGEN 2.0 PROJECT FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT SUMMARY OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES COMPARATIVE IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVES CommunityServices Impacts were assessed based on whether the proposed project would: • Displace, impede effective access to, or increase demand beyond available capacities of emergency response services, fire protection, law enforcement, healthcare facilities, and school systems in the ROI; or • Conflict with local and regional plans for emergency response services, fire protection, law enforcement, healthcare facilities, or school systems. No Impacts. Baseline conditions would not change. Construction: Negligible Adverse Impacts: A temporary workforce of approximately 900 based on the updated design would be required during peak construction of the proposed project (a slight reduction from the Draft EIS). These workers would likely be drawn from the existing workforce of the area; however, an undeterminable number of workers and associated families may relocate to the area temporarily. Existing community services (i.e., law enforcement, emergency response, hospitals, and education) are expected to be adequate to address the needs of the population in the ROI, including project personnel and their dependents. Existing emergency response capabilities are expected to be adequate to address potential accidents and other risks. Negligible impacts on community services would be expected. Operations: Negligible Adverse Impacts: Long-term operation of the project would require approximately 124 to 152 new employees based on the updated design (a slight reduction from the Draft EIS). It is likely that these workers would be drawn from the existing workforce of the area; however, an undeterminable number of workers and associated families may relocate to the area permanently. Existing community services (i.e., law enforcement, emergency response, hospitals, and education) are expected to be adequate to address the needs of the population in the ROI, including project personnel and their dependents. Existing emergency response capabilities are expected to be adequate to address potential accidents and other risks. Negligible impacts on community services would be expected. Human Health and Safety Impacts were assessed based on whether the proposed project would: • Increase worker health risks due to industrial accidents, injuries, or illnesses during construction and normal operating conditions; • Increase public health risks due to accidental releases of CO2 or other trace gases associated with captured CO2 during transport, active geologic storage activities, and following closure of the injection wells; or • Increase public health risks due to intentional destructive acts. No Impacts. Baseline conditions would not change. Construction: Minor Adverse Impacts: The potential for worker injuries would be present during construction of the proposed FutureGen 2.0 Project. Based on the incident rate for utility system construction, the number of lost work days is estimated to be 12.5 or less over the entire construction period for all project components. Operations: Minor Adverse Impacts: Accidents and lost work days during operation of the oxy-combustion facility could occur. The two liquid oxygen tanks at the facility pose the highest potential consequences if an accident were to occur, which could affect workers but not the general public. However, such accidents are extremely unlikely to occur (i.e., the potential for an accident to occur is between once in 10,000 years and once in a million years). The potential for accidents involving the CO2 pipeline are considered to be unlikely (i.e., the potential to occur between once in 100 years and once in 10,000 years). Workers in the vicinity of a pipeline puncture or rupture would be most susceptible to harm due largely to potential physical effects related to high-pressure and the velocity of the release, as well as from exposure to extreme temperature drops which could cause frostbite. In addition, high concentrations of CO2 would be present in the narrow band Table 4.1-1. Summary of Environmental Impacts by Alternative for the FutureGen 2.0 Project Criteria Considered No Action Proposed Project Human Health and Safety (continued) DOE/EIS-0460 FUTUREGEN 2.0 PROJECT FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT SUMMARY OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES COMPARATIVE IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVES of CO2 escaping from the leak site. Immediate life threatening effects related to asphyxiation from short-term exposure to these high concentrations (i.e., exposure to CO2 at concentrations that exceed 100,000 ppmv) could occur; however, workers would likely be able to flee the areas with high concentration due to the visual, physical, and audible signs associated with the event. A pipeline rupture or puncture would potentially cause exposure and risk to the public as the CO2 expands and disperses creating a vapor plume. The potential maximum reasonably foreseeable accident scenario or exposure distances would occur with a pipeline rupture under calm meteorological conditions. There would be no effects to the general public from this type of rupture beyond a distance where CO2 concentrations would exceed 5,000 parts per million, which over a 60-minute time period, could extend to a distance of up to 1,769 feet. Transient effects, which include temporary symptoms such as headache, dizziness, sweating, or vague feelings of discomfort, could occur within these distances. Exposure distances would be much shorter under meteorological conditions with wind levels greater than calm, when more air movement and subsequent chemical dissipation would occur. The Alliance’s pipeline siting criteria includes an intended minimum distance of 150 feet from any occupied structure, which is greater than the distances at which exposures could result in serious adverse effects or life-threatening effects under meteorological conditions present more than 95 percent of the time. Under meteorological conditions D10 and D12, which occur only 3.6 and 0.7 percent of the time, respectively, irreversible or serious adverse effects associated with CO2 exposures, could occur within exposure distances of up to 152 feet from the rupture site, and the potential for life-threatening effects from exposures could occur within 79 feet. Potential health impacts from accidental releases of CO2 from the horizontal injection wells, considered to be extremely unlikely events, could extend to 114 feet if injection tubing is used, or to 540 feet if not. Under the vertical well configuration, analyzed in the Draft EIS but no longer proposed by the Alliance, effects of CO2 from a release would be limited in extent to 92 feet from the well site. Releases of CO2 following the end of injection operations are not expected to result in ambient air concentrations above established health criteria; thus health effects to the public would not be expected. Potential health effects could occur from exposure to trace gases in the pipeline and injection wells (hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, and sulfur trioxide); however, under normal operating conditions these components are not expected be present in measurable concentrations. Note that the oxy-combustion process is not expected to produce measureable concentrations of hydrogen sulfide. Potential effects from catastrophic or intentional destructive acts are expected to be similar to the above impacts. Table 4.1-1.

A temporary increase in population caused by a slight influx of construction workers from outside the ROI would not have an adverse impact on population and housing. There is adequate capacity in the region to meet the labor force demand and the project is expected to benefit the regional economy. Operations: Beneficial Impacts: Spending and employment for operations of the proposed project would generally result in net beneficial impacts to socioeconomic conditions.

The regulations further define “mitigation” (40 CFR 1508.20) to include: (a)Avoiding the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action. (b) Minimizing impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation. (c) Rectifying the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected environment. (d) Reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations during the life of the action. (e) Compensating for the impact by replacing or providing substitute resources or environments. Per established protocols, procedures, and requirements, the Alliance would comply with all applicable federal, state, or municipalregulations and ordinances,as well as associated permittingprocesses, through the implementation of standard operating procedures and BMPs. These are generally required by environmental regulatory mandates applicable to the design, construction, and operation of the project. The Alliance also incorporated additional measures into the project to reduce impacts. Therefore, as the lead agency for the EIS, DOE considers that these mitigation measures are “already included in the proposed action or alternatives” consistent with 40 CFR 1502.14(f). DOE has also explored the range of reasonable mitigation measures, beyond those included in the proposed action or alternatives. If DOE decides to proceed with the proposed action, the ROD will “state whether all practicable means to avoid or minimize environmental harm from the alternative selected have been adopted, and if not, why they were not” in conformance with the CEQ NEPA regulations (40 CFR 1505.2(c)). For those additional mitigation measures deemed appropriate in its ROD, DOE will adopt and describe a monitoring and enforcement programto ensure that the measures wouldbe implemented(40 CFR1505.2(c)). 4.2.2 Mitigation Measure Summary by Resource Area This section provides a consolidated summary of the mitigation measures applicable to each environmental resource area, whichare also described for each resource area in Chapter 3 of this EIS. For each resource area, both for the construction and operation phases, Table 4.2-1 summarizes the measures that would be implemented by the Alliance to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and ordinances, as well as additional measures that the Alliance would incorporate into the project to further reduce potential impacts. These are the measures that DOE considers to be already included in the proposed action. In a final grouping under construction and operation respectively for each resource area, Table 4.2-1 outlines possible additional measures identified to further reduce impacts. The Alliance will collect additional information about the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of other available mitigation measures during final design. If DOE decides to proceed withthe proposed action after publication of the Final EIS, the ROD will identify any additional specific mitigation measures selected as appropriate for implementation and funding in conjunction with the proposed action, and DOE will state why other measures would not be adopted. The additional mitigation measures would be the subject of a monitoring and enforcement program for the implementation of the proposed action. Table 4.2-1.

Simon Formation to maintain well integrity and to prevent upward migration of CO2. Possible Additional Measures Identified to Further Reduce Impacts: • None Operations Measures Required byLaws, Regulations, Permits, and Ordinances: • Operate wells in accordance with the UIC permits, which would specify operating and monitoring criteria for the CO2 injection to prevent the migration of CO2 from the injection zone and to ensure the protection of USDWs. • Implement the MVA plan and use subsurface monitoring to assess the potential for migration of CO2 out of the injection zone. • Conduct mechanical integrity testing on the injection wells by continuously monitoring injection pressure, flow rate, and injected volumes, and annular pressure and fluid volume. • Conduct annual testing using down-hole geophysical logs or surveys to verify CO2 retention. Annual testing may decrease to once every 5 years with each successful test. • Temporarily halt CO2 injection and assess the situation if well integrity issues are identified, if there are seismic effects, or if there are abnormal readings in order to ensure CO2 retention in the reservoir. • Reevaluate the AoR at least every 5 years after the issuance of the UIC Class VI permits, as required under 40 CFR 146.84(b)(2)(i). This reevaluation would consider the volume of CO2 that has been injected during the previous 5 years, the pressure at which it has been injected, and the resulting CO2 plume, as determined by ongoing monitoring in accordance with the UIC permits. Any changes to the AoR as a result of the reevaluation could also trigger changes to the MVA monitoring protocol. Measures Incorporated Into the FutureGen 2.0 Project to Reduce Impacts: • Sample groundwater from up to 10 nearby farm/residential wells to verify that the project has no adverse environmental impacts. • Install a multi-level monitoring well to monitor the pressure and geochemical changes in the injection zone to assess the potential for excessive pressure build up and injection-induced seismicity. • Use remote sensing technology or install surface tiltmeters. Possible Additional Measures Identified to Further Reduce Impacts: • None Construction Table 4.2-1.

Mitigation would follow the USACE Compensatory Mitigation Policy for Illinois and would be determined through coordination with both the USACE St. Louis and Rock Island Districts as applicable. • Comply with the NPDES and Section 401 Water Quality Certification permitting process via the IEPA to reduce and prevent potential impacts to waters of the U.S. during construction of the proposed project. • Develop and implement an IEPA-approved SWPPP (to address erosion prevention measures, sediment control measures, permanent stormwater management, dewatering, environmental inspection and maintenance, and final stabilization) as required by the IEPA, in accordance with a general NPDES Permit for construction. The Table 4.2-1. Mitigation Measures for the Proposed FutureGen 2.0 Project Resource Mitigation Measures Surface Water (continued) SWPPP would incorporate principles of the Illinois Urban Manual (AISWCD 2012) and would direct the mitigation of potential impacts from stormwater runoff and discharges during construction. • Pursuant to 40 CFR 112 of the CWA, the existing SPCC plan at the Meredosia Energy Center would be modified within six months of beginning construction to reflect new facility operations regarding the storage and managements of petroleum, oils, and other lubricants at the facility. The SPCC plan would implement measures to prevent releases of oil to adjacent surface waters, and would identify and determine response action procedures to reduce impacts in the event of a spill. Measures Incorporated Into the FutureGen 2.0 Project to Reduce Impacts: • Use soil stabilization measures (e.g., seeding, mulching, or matting) to reduce erosion of soils exposed during construction to prevent sedimentation impacts to streams during storm events. • Stabilize temporary access roads, haul roads, parking areas, laydown, material storage and other onsite vehicle transportation routes as soon as practicable after grading to reduce the erosion potential. • Preserve natural vegetation as much as practicable, but especially in critical areas such as on steep slopes and in areas adjacent to watercourses, swales, or wetlands to reduce potential for sedimentation impacts to streams during storm events. • Maximize use of existing roads in planning site access to reduce vegetation disturbance and the potential for erosion and sedimentation impacts to streams during storm events. • Keep construction materials, debris, construction chemicals, construction staging, fueling, etc. at a safe distance from surface waters. Remove spoil, debris, piling, construction materials, and any other obstructions resulting from or used during construction as soon as practicable. These measures would reduce the potential for contamination of surface waters from accidental spills and would reduce the potential for construction debris to enter surface waters. • Use trenchless technologies, such as horizontal directional drilling and jack and bore tunneling, for crossings of all waterbodies to avoid impacts to surface waters. • In the event that trenching is used for crossings of dry stream (ephemeral and intermittent) channels, design pipeline crossings using the most direct route and construct water crossings during periods of low flow conditions to the extent practicable. Use crossing sites that have low, stable banks, a firm stream bottom, and minimal surface runoff when possible. These measures would reduce disturbance to streambeds and surface waters during pipeline installation. • Any stormwater runoff exposed to the coal storage and ash area (including coal pile runoff, coal handling dust suppression water, coal handling equipment wash-down water, and stormwater from the coal yard) would be diverted to the new lined settling basin through berms and above-ground conveyance systems. The basin would be lined to detain water and provide settling for removal of suspended solids. After an appropriate detention time, the wastewater would flow to the wastewater treatment system for treatment and then would be discharged to the Illinois River in accordance with an NPDES permit. Possible Additional Measures Identified to Further Reduce Impacts: • Where practical, consider weather and ground conditions when scheduling construction activities to reduce potential impacts to surface waters, such as erosion and the spread of contaminants that may be exacerbated by sheet flow during storm events. Operations Measures Required byLaws, Regulations, Permits, and Ordinances: • The CWA requirement for the development and implementation of an SPCC plan during operation of the project would direct prevention, control, and response to releases of oil that could potentially contaminate surface waters. • The project would operate under the existing (pending recently submitted modifications based upon project design changes) NPDES Permit (NPDES Permit IL0000116) which would impose monitoring requirements and effluent discharge Table 4.2-1.

In accordance with American Society of Mechanical Engineers Standard 31.44 (ASME 31.44) and 49 CFR 195, MLBVs would be installed along the CO2 pipeline approximately every 10 miles to isolate and contain any leak and would also be installed on either side of major river crossings, at other waterbody crossings of more than 100 feet wide from high water mark to high water mark, and optionally at major road crossings. These measures would serve to prevent and reduce adverse impacts to surface waters in the unlikely event of a pipeline rupture.  Measures Incorporated Into the FutureGen 2.0 Project to Reduce Impacts:  •  Provide proper drainage systems to and from paved arterial roads to the injection wells to the extent heavy vehicle traffic is expected.  Possible Additional Measures Identified to Further Reduce Impacts:  •  Use water conservation measures to the maximum extent practicable (e.g., efficient landscaping and recycling wastewater).  Resource Mitigation Measures wetlands. Possible Additional Measures Identified to Further Reduce Impacts: • None Construction Measures Required byLaws, Regulations, Permits, and Ordinances: • DOE has been engaged in ongoing consultations with the USFWS and is preparing a Biological Assessment for submission to the USFWS that addresses the three federally-listed species for which suitable habitat occurs in the project area: the Indiana bat, decurrent false aster, and eastern prairie fringed orchid. Based on the progress of the Biological Assessment at publication of the Final EIS, DOE believes that the proposed action is not likely to adversely affect any of the listed species. The Biological Assessment, when submitted, will provide DOE’s final determination and will identify measures as appropriate to minimize impacts to federally-listed species. The Biological Assessment would also support the USFWS in issuing its Biological Opinion for the project, if one is needed. • To avoid potential violations of the MBTA, the Alliance would perform initial land clearing activities and vegetative maintenance activities between September and February (outside of the migratory bird nesting season from April 1 to July 31) or would conduct a survey for migratory bird nests immediately prior to land clearing activities. Should any nests be found, the Alliance would either re-design the appropriate project component or alter the construction schedule to avoid the take of any individuals. • DOE conducted bald eagle surveys on the Meredosia Energy Center site in June 2013 and determined that there are no nesting bald eagles onsite. These results will be communicated to USFWS in the Biological Assessment. • If the Alliance undertakes activities related to the barge unloading facility that would disturb the river bottom, then prior to initiating construction within the proposed barge unloading area, a survey for the ebonyshell (a state-listed threatened species) would be performed by a qualified biologist. Should the species be found, the area would be avoided, if practicable, or coordination would occur with USFWS and IDNR to determine Table 4.2-1. Mitigation Measures for the Proposed FutureGen 2.0 Project Resource Mitigation Measures Biological the appropriate course of action. Resources • A qualified biologist would conduct surveys for federal- and state-listed species in (continued) areas with appropriate habitat within the finalized CO2 pipeline route and injection well site(s). Should any federal- or state-threatened or endangered species be found, the proposed project would be sited to avoid potential impacts, or coordination would occur with USFWS to determine the appropriate course of action. • To avoid potential violations of the Illinois Endangered Species Protection Act, and as requested by IDNR, a Conservation Plan would be developed and implemented for the Illinois chorus frog and any other protected species. The plan would summarize the measures that would be taken should any protected species be encountered during construction activities. Measures Incorporated Into the FutureGen 2.0 Project to Reduce Impacts: • Following publication of the Draft EIS, the Alliance reduced the acreage of forested areas that would be cleared at the Meredosia Energy Center and along the CO2 pipeline route to avoid and minimize impacts on the Indiana bat and migratory birds. Possible Additional Measures Identified to Further Reduce Impacts: • Implement measures to avoid the spread of invasive plants, such as washing long-term construction equipment prior to being brought to the construction site to reduce the potential for introduction of invasive seeds that may have been picked up at other locations. Operations Measures Required by Laws, Regulations, Permits, and Ordinances: • In accordance with Section 316(b) of the CWA, maintain withdrawal rates for the river water intake at the Meredosia Energy Center at or below a maximum velocity of 0.5 feet per second to reduce the number of fish trapped against intake screens. Measures Incorporated Into the FutureGen 2.0 Project to Reduce Impacts: • None Possible Additional Measures Identified to Further Reduce Impacts: • None Cultural Construction Resources Measures Required by Laws, Regulations, Permits, and Ordinances: Measures Incorporated Into the FutureGen 2.0 Project to Reduce Impacts: Possible Additional Measures Identified to Further Reduce Impacts: • None Operations Measures Required by Laws, Regulations, Permits, and Ordinances: • None Table 4.2-1.

The pipeline would not be located within 50 feet of any private dwelling, or any industrial building or place of public assembly in which persons work, congregate, or assemble, unless it is provided with at least 12 inches of soil cover in addition to that prescribed in 49 CFR 195.248 (“Cover Over Buried Pipeline”). • Obtain necessary legal ROW easements for utility corridors. • The Alliance would abide by stipulations of the Jacksonville Zoning Ordinance in locating the proposed educational facilities within the corporate limits of Jacksonville and contiguous territory within 1.5 miles beyond. Additionally, the Jacksonville comprehensive plan and future land use plans would be used during site coordination and selection, and the Alliance would coordinate with the Jacksonville Regional Economic Development Corporation during the site identification process. Measures Incorporated Into the FutureGen 2.0 Project to Reduce Impacts: • Adhere to IDOA Pipeline Construction Standards and Policies outlined in the Agricultural Impact Mitigation Agreement (see Appendix H, Agricultural Mitigation) to help preserve the integrity of any agricultural land that would be impacted by pipeline construction. • The Alliance would reduce potential impacts on agricultural production and land use within and adjacent to the ROW for the pipeline by conducting construction activities outside of the planting and growing seasons to the extent practicable. • To the extent practicable, the Alliance would locate the pipeline no closer than 150 feet from residences, which surpasses the 50-foot separation distance required by 49 CFR 195. Examples of when a shorter distance would be used (but not less than 50 feet as required by federal law) would include when necessary to avoid a sensitive environmental resource or at the request of an affected landowner. • To the extent practicable, the pipeline would be located along existing ROWs. In addition, access to the construction ROW for the pipeline would be provided from existing roads that cross the pipeline route to the extent practicable. • In cases where the pipeline would bisect a property, the pipeline would be designed to incorporate suitable crossings by placing the pipeline underground, engineering the pipeline to withstand the weight of typical rural or residential vehicles (i.e., cars, trucks, tractors), and maintaining property owner access throughout the entire property. • Potential impacts to agricultural land crossed by the pipeline would be mitigated by restoring the land to its original condition to the extent practicable and allowing the current land use to resume after construction. • Arrangements would be made between landowners and the Alliance to reduce the longterm impacts on agricultural land use or other activities around the proposed injection facilities. • To the extent practicable, avoid net reductions in agricultural land, including taking measures to replace lands taken out of agricultural use with land that can be placed into agricultural use. Land placed into new agricultural use would be in the immediate vicinity of land taken out of agricultural use. Possible Additional Measures Identified to Further Reduce Impacts: • None Table 4.2-1.

Cumulative impacts are the collective result of the incremental impacts of an action that, when added to the impacts of other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions, would affect the same resources, regardless of what agency or person undertakes those actions (40 CFR 1508.7). Cumulative impacts can result from actions that have individually minor impacts but that collectively impose significant impacts over a period of time. DOE considers a reasonably foreseeable action to be a future action that has a realistic expectation of occurring. These include, but are not limited to, actions under analysis by a regulatory agency, proposals being considered by state or local planners, plans that have begun implementation, or future actionsthat have been funded. Humans have been altering the area in which the FutureGen 2.0 Project would be constructed and operated since people began settling the region more than 7,000 years ago (Illinois State Museum 2012). In combination with natural processes, these past and ongoing activities have produced the affected environment, which is described in detail in Chapter 3 of this EIS. The impacts of the proposed project on the existing environment are also described in Chapter 3. In this section, DOE describes the potential for cumulative impacts of the project and reasonably foreseeable future actions in the region that would or could affect the same environmental resources. The following subsections describe the process DOE used to identify potential cumulative impact issues and the reasonably foreseeable future development actions potentiallyoccurringin the area. 4.3.2 Analysis Methodology DOE analyzed potential cumulative impacts on environmental resources within the ROIs defined for respective resource areas in Chapter 3. Depending on the resource area, the ROI consists of a human community or political boundary (e.g., a county, city, or neighborhood); an area based on typical natural resource boundaries (e.g., a watershed or defined ecological region); a resource as described on a regional, national, or global level (e.g., air quality within an AQCR); or an area of effect dependent on locations of project disturbances (e.g., the footprint of disturbance for the CO2 pipeline ROW). Instances where the ROI was defined as an area of project disturbance in Chapter 3 also generally include areas of disturbanceanticipatedforthe foreseeable future actions. DOE assigned levels of importance for potential cumulative impacts on respective environmental resources by beginning with the potential impacts of the FutureGen 2.0 Project on each environmental resource, as described in Chapter 3. Cumulative impacts relate to the incremental effects of multiple actions occurring in the same ROI; therefore, DOE next considered other ongoing and foreseeable actions affecting the same ROI for each resource that would add incrementally to the potential impacts of the FutureGen 2.0 Project. Finally, DOE considered public comments received during scoping and the public comment period, the interests of governmental and nongovernmental organizations, and past experience with other similar proposed projects in assigning levels of importance to a resource subject. Accordingly, DOE considered the potential for cumulative impacts affecting resource subjects as high, intermediate, or lowin importance, based on thecriteria discussed below. DOE considered cumulative impacts affecting a resource to be of high importance if the following occurred: • The incremental effect of the FutureGen 2.0 Project alone as analyzed in Chapter 3 would cause a significant impact inthe context of NEPAreviewandanalysis. • An analysis of cumulative impacts for this issue would be necessary to support a reasoned decisionamongthe alternatives. • Society, in general, has a history or record of being concerned about this type of cumulative impact andtwo or more ofthe factors of intermediate importance are present. DOE considered cumulative impacts affecting a resource to be of intermediate importance if the following occurred: • The incremental addition by the FutureGen 2.0 Project to the impacts of other foreseeable actions may cause a regulatory/resource threshold or physical limit (e.g., utility capacity) to be exceeded or approach an exceedance, and this effect would be significant from the viewpoint of NEPA review, federaldecision-making, and public disclosure. • There is a governmental organization or nationally recognized nongovernmental organization that has a history orrecord of being concerned aboutthe potential cumulative effect. • The cumulative effect issue was raised during the scoping process by either a governmental organization or by more than one nongovernmental entity or person, and theparticular issueis not irrelevant or inconsequential infederal decision-making. • The issue is indicated to be important judging by the fact that one or more governmental or nongovernmental organizations have published statistics or trendson theissue. DOE considered cumulative impacts affecting a resource to be of low importance if the following occurred: • The potential impact doesnot exhibit anyof the indicatorslistedinthetwocategoriesabove. • The FutureGen 2.0 Project would contribute no impacts, negligible impacts, or would result only inbeneficial impacts. By applying the above criteria to the environmental resources analyzed in Chapter 3, and considering the potential impacts of the FutureGen 2.0 Project as described therein, DOE assigned the levels of importance to resource subjectsas listedinTable 4.3-1.  Table 4.3-1.

These resources and potential impacts are described further in Section 4.3.4. The two environmental resources considered to have a high potential for cumulative impacts, Climate and GHGs and Geology, are discussed in greater detail attheend of that section. DOE considered the following four environmental resources as having a low potential for cumulative impacts: • Utilities • CommunityServices • Socioeconomics • EnvironmentalJustice In the case of each of these resources, the low potential for cumulative impacts is based on the negligible to beneficial impacts caused by the FutureGen 2.0 Project, which would result in no substantive incremental effects when added to the impacts of ongoing and foreseeable future actions. As cumulative impacts are not expected for these four resources identified as having a low level of importance, they are not discussedfurtherinthe cumulative impactanalysis forthis EIS. 4.3.3 Foreseeable Future Actions Considered For this cumulative impacts analysis, the predicted environmental effects of specific actions were considered together with those of the FutureGen 2.0 Project to produce a description of the combined or cumulative environmental impacts. To identify specific actions that might impose cumulative environmental effects in the region, DOE sought information on specific projects, developments, or activities, which might have effects on environmental resources that would overlap with those of the FutureGen 2.0 Project. This effort included a search for electric power projects, CO2 geologic storage projects, large industrial facilities, transportation projects, large commercial developments, municipal projects, and other such projects in the Morgan County area. DOE focused primarily on actions within a 30-mile radius of FutureGen 2.0 Project components, while also considering the ROI established for each respective resource area. DOE also searched for foreseeable future energy-related projects beyond this radius that could have a potential cumulative impact on air quality, climate and GHGs, and geology. Seven reasonablyforeseeable projects were identifiedas describedinTable 4.3-2. Table 4.3-2.

The effects of past actions are already encompassed within the affected environment as described in Chapter 3 of this EIS; however, a general description of the history of developmentin the region follows forthe purpose of summarizing trends. Historically, the general area of the proposed project consisted of bottomland deciduous forests and swamp forests, upland mixed oak forests, and extensive prairie grassland communities. Following European settlement, the natural land cover and vegetation communities have been considerably altered for agricultural uses with more than 75 percent of the land area currently used as cropland or pastureland. There is some oil and gas production, and some areas have been affected by extensive surface and underground coal mining; however, historical mining activity peaked about a century ago. The area containsnumerous perennial streams and rivers withmajor waterways, such as the Illinois River, havinga large influence on the surrounding landscape (Commission for Environmental Cooperation 2011). There are relatively small scattered municipalities, with Jacksonville being the largest in Morgan County, though urban land covers are notextensive in the area. Native Americans had first settled the region and began farming nearly 7,000 years before the first European settlers began arriving in Morgan County in 1818 (the year Illinois gained statehood) (Illinois State Museum 2012). Jacksonville was established as the Morgan County seat in 1825, and the attraction of fertile Illinois soils brought settlers to the area at a fast pace. In the early 1830s, Jacksonville was the most populous municipality in the state. In the 1850s, the Jacksonville area grew considerably, primarily on the continued expansion of agricultural activities, including the production of wheat, pork, and cattle, and the expansion of railroad access, which provided means to transport local products and import from other areas of the country. During the 1900s, numerous businesses started operation in Morgan County, which were mainly associated with agricultural activities. Numerous non-agricultural manufacturing businesses were also developed in Morgan County, primarily in the Jacksonville area, such as the Eli Bridge Company, the world's oldest manufacturer of Ferris wheels and other amusement rides, and the current Pactiv, LLC manufacturing facility, which produces a number of plastic storage and waste management products(City ofJacksonville 2012d). The overall population of Morgan County has remained relatively constant since 1900, which reflects the agrarian nature of the area. The population of the county was approximately 36,400 in 1900 and 35,500 in 2010 and has not fluctuated below 33,500 or above 37,500 during that time; the high occurred in 1910 (USCB 1994; USCB 2010e). Thus, the historic trend of land alteration fromnatural cover types to human altered types was likely related primarily to the rate at which agricultural lands were developed. Typically, agricultural activities involve the conversion of naturally vegetated areas to stands of monolithic crops (e.g., corn and soybeans). In the case of animal grazing in pastureland, the activities of the animals generally make areas unsuitable for typical native vegetation through directly consuming plants and trampling on and compacting soils. In addition, agricultural activities occurring near surface waters can have substantial negative effects on surface waters through nonpoint source pollution caused byuse of fertilizers, herbicides,andpesticides as well as the generation of animal wastes. Table 4.3-3 describes cumulative impacts on each resource area that DOE assigned as having high or intermediate potential for cumulative environmental impacts. The impact analyses presented in Table4.3-3 use the same characterizations for impacts (beneficial, negligible, minor, moderate, and substantial) as defined in Section 4.1, Comparative Impacts of Alternatives. The table is followed by discussions of Climate and Greenhouse Gases as well as Geology, which are the only resource areas consideredto be of high importance with respectto potential cumulative impacts. Table 4.3-3.

Glacial and modern alluvial deposits are draped over the bedrock formations, and create the topographic relief while providing the source material for soils. The Mt. Simon, Eau Claire, and St. Peter formations are laterally extensive bedrock formations that stretch through the Illinois Basin and are found in deep well cores throughout Illinois. There are three historical oil and gas fields in Morgan County: the Prentice field, which is located south of Ashland, has 25 oil and gas wells and is located approximately 1.5 miles east of the CO2 storage study area; the Jacksonville field, located directly east of the city of Jacksonville, contains more There would be negligible to minor impacts from construction to the geologic resources, primarily from displacing or moving glacial materials for cut and fill procedures. There would be minor impacts during operation, as 1.2 million tons (1.1 million metric tons) per year of CO2 is injected into the Mt. Simon Formation. The presence of primary and secondary confining zones and the use of multiple monitoring and verification procedures would ensure that the CO2 is stored safely within the injection zone formations. There would be no noticeable impact to the geologic resources from the Illinois Route 104 Bridge Replacement, US-67 improvements, or the Illinois Rivers Transmission Project based on a review of associated environmental documentation (see Table 4.3-2). There are two geologic CO2 storage projects located in Decatur, 60 miles east of the FutureGen 2.0 CO2 storage study area. The MGSC Phase III Large-Scale Field Test and ICCS Area 1 would be injecting into the Mt. Simon Formation. Also, the proposed Taylorville Energy Center may include geologic CO2 storage in the Mt. Simon Formation approximately 45 miles from the FutureGen 2.0 CO2 storage study area. The CO2 plumes for these projects would not overlap with the plume as modeled for the Negligible cumulative impacts would be expected from construction of the proposed project and the foreseeable future actions, as most of the impacts would be related to the earthmoving needed for each and would not overlap. There would be minor cumulative effects on regional geology from operation of the proposed project and other CO2 storage projects in the Illinois Basin. The respective CO2 plumes would not interact, because they would only extend for a few miles or less at each injection well. Although the CO2 pressure front could extend tens of miles from large-scale injection well sites in open aquifer systems (Zhou and Birkholzer 2011), pressure would decrease with distance from the injection wells, and there are no fault systems between the proposed project and Decatur or Taylorville. Capacity estimates predict that the Illinois Basin and the Mt. Simon Formation could safely accommodate 20 DOE/EIS-0460 FUTUREGEN 2.0 PROJECT FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT 4.

In Morgan County, the total land for farming has increased from 306,000 acres in 1997 to 321,000 acres in 2007. The average farm size also increased from 372 to 433 acres (USDA 1999; USDA The FutureGen 2.0 Project would have minor impacts on Physiography and Soils, predominantly related to the increased potential for soil erosion and the temporary displacement of farmland during construction activities.

The Meredosia Energy Center is located in an industrial area south of the village of Meredosia. The industrial development has been present for the past century. The proposed CO2 pipeline and injection wells would be located in northern Morgan County, which has traditionally been dominated by agricultural land use. Construction and operation of the oxy-combustion facility would cause short-term minor impacts and negligible long-term impacts since construction would be consistent with the industrial nature of the Meredosia Energy Center. Temporary, minor impacts would occur due to the short-term change in land use during the construction phase. Such land would be restored to its original state after construction. Permanent, minor impacts would occur due to conversion of land use, such as vegetated land, for portions of the pipeline ROW and the CO2 injection wells and associated surface facilities. A portion (approximately 3.75 miles) of Alternative E of the US-67 improvements project would require the same stretch of existing ROW on US-67 as the FutureGen 2.0 Project southern pipeline route. Additionally, there would be a possibility for induced development as increased travel along the expanded highway could lead to further commercial and retail development. The Illinois Route 104 River Bridge Replacement Project would realign a portion of Illinois Route 104 on the east side of the river away from Meredosia’s downtown area approximately one-half block to the north. The Illinois Rivers Transmission Project would construct a Improvements to a portion of US67 commenced on June 17, 2011, and are planned to be completed by the end of 2013. The FutureGen 2.0 Project is anticipated to begin construction in 2014, so it is unlikely that both project schedules would coincide and require construction in the same ROW along US-67 at the same time. The FutureGen 2.0 Project would not contribute incrementally to any induced development along the highway attributable to the US-67 improvement project. Most of the Illinois Route 104 bridge alignment would stay within its existing corridor but a portion will change land use from residential and commercial to transportation use. The new alignment would also convert some agricultural land adjacent to the existing roadway to transportation use. The land area affected by the Table 4.3-3.

The FutureGen 2.0 Project would not contribute incrementally to cumulative impacts on land use conversions and compatibility with surrounding land uses. Both the Illinois Rivers Transmission Project and the FutureGen 2.0 Project would require acquisition of easements for the transmission lines and CO2 pipeline, respectively. Therefore, it is likely that some land within Morgan County would subject to ROW easements as a result of both projects, which would cause a minor cumulative effect on land use.

Landfills and other waste disposal facilities in the area of the project have had sufficient past disposal capacities to meet increasing waste disposal needs that generally coincide with historic land development trends. Coal has been mined commercially within the United States, including within the states of Illinois and Wyoming, for many years, and the available reserves are considered abundant to serve the foreseeable energy needs of the nation. The impacts of coal mining are well-known and The FutureGen 2.0 Project would obtain coal from existing commercial mines in Illinois and the Powder River Basin (Wyoming), which have adequate capacity to meet the needs of the project without requiring changes in mining operations. The operation of the oxycombustion facility would generate approximately 200,000 tons of fly ash and bottom ash per year, over a 20-year period. The Alliance would seek opportunities for beneficial reuse of the ash, including recycling; however, any ash that cannot be beneficially reused would be disposed of in a commercial non-hazardous solid waste landfill. Disposal of the volume of ash that would be generated from the project could Several of the reasonably foreseeable future actions involve construction of new facilities and infrastructure, or modifications and improvements to existing facilities and infrastructure. Therefore, it is likely that they would generate wastes that could potentially be disposed of within the ROI, and therefore, negatively impact available landfill capacity. However, these impacts would be limited to the period of construction and would not be expected to exceed landfill capacity within the ROI. Operation of the reasonably foreseeable projects would not result in the generation of hazardous or non-hazardous The FutureGen 2.0 Project would add incrementally to the nationwide demands for coal but without substantially affecting the available capacities or operations at existing mines. Minor to moderate adverse cumulative impacts on regional landfill capacity could occur as a result of the proposed project and the foreseeable future projects. Generation of construction-related wastes from these projects, when combined with fly ash and bottom ash generated by the proposed project, could reduce landfill capacity available to local municipalities and businesses. These adverse impacts could be mitigated through beneficial reuse of some of the major waste streams generated by the Table 4.3-3.

Operational noise impacts would be associated with any increased traffic resulting from these infrastructure improvements. None of the other projects are expected to interact with the FutureGen 2.0 Project with respect to noise impacts. Cumulative impacts associated with noise would be negligible. It is highly unlikely that any of the reasonably foreseeable future actions would occur at the same location and at the same time as the proposed project; however, if they did overlap, there would be a minor cumulative impact of increased noise temporarily during construction activities. No cumulative impact in operational noise would be anticipated. Table 4.3-3.

SUMMARY OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES 4.3.4.2 Climate and Greenhouse Gases Impacts of Greenhouse Gases on Climate Climate is usually defined as the “average weather” of a region, or more scientifically as the statistical description of a region’s weather in terms of the means andvariabilityof relevant parameters over periods ranging from months to thousands of years. The relevant parameters include temperature, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and dates of meteorological events such as first and last frosts, beginning and end ofrainy seasons, and appearance and disappearance ofpack ice. GHGs in the atmosphere absorb energy that would otherwise radiate into space; anthropogenic (humancaused) releases of these gases could result in warming that would eventually alter global climate (IPCC 2007). Potential impacts of GHGs onclimate are essentially cumulative impacts, because no single source of GHG emissions is substantial enough to affect climate independently. In addition, CO2, the primary anthropogenic GHG, tends to mix quickly and evenly throughout the lower atmosphere; therefore,itis currentlynotpossible topredict the effect of increases or decreases in GHG emissions from an individual source on regional or global climate. Changes in climate are difficult to detect because of the complex variability in natural meteorological patterns over long periods of time and across broad geographical regions. There is much uncertainty regarding the extent of global climate change caused by anthropogenic GHGs and the appropriate strategies for stabilizing the concentrations of GHGs in the atmosphere. The World Meteorological Organization and United Nations Environment Programme established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to provide an objective source of information about global warming and climate change. The panel’s reports are generallyconsideredan authoritative source of informationon these issues. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report, “Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, as is now evident from observations of increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice and rising global average sea level” (IPCC 2007). The report found that the global average surface temperature has increased by approximately 1.3°F in the last 100 years; global average sea level has risen approximately 6 inches over the same period; and cold days, cold nights, and frosts over most land areas have become less frequent during the past 50 years. The report concluded that most of the temperature increase since the middle of the 20th century “is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic [GHG] concentrations.” The 2007 report estimated that, at present, CO2 accounts for approximately 77 percent of the global warming potential attributable to anthropogenic releases of GHGs, with the vast majority (74 percent) of this CO2 coming from the combustion of fossil fuels. Although the report considers a widerange offuture scenarios regarding GHG emissions, CO2 would continue to contribute more than 70 percent of the total warming potential under all of the scenarios. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change therefore believes that further warming is inevitable, but that this warming and its effects on climate could be mitigated by stabilizing the atmosphere’s concentration of CO2 through the use of (1) “low-carbon technologies” for power production and industrial processes; (2) more efficient use of energy; and (3) management of terrestrial ecosystems tocaptureatmospheric CO2 (IPCC 2007). Environmental Impacts of Climate Change The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the United States Global Change Research Program (formerly the U.S. Climate Change Science Program) have examined the potential environmental impacts of climate change at global, national, and regional scales. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report states that, in addition to increases in global surface temperatures, the impacts of climate change on the global environment may include: • More frequent heat waves, droughts, and fires; • Risingsea levels and coastal flooding; • Meltingglaciers, ice caps,andpolarice sheets; • More severe hurricane activityandincreases infrequencyand intensityof severeprecipitation; • Spreadofinfectious diseases tonewregions; • Loss of wildlifehabitats; and • Heartandrespiratoryailments fromhigher concentrations of ground-level ozone (IPCC 2007). On a national scale, average surface temperatures in the United States have increased,with the last decade being the warmest in more than a century of direct observations (CCSP 2008). Potential impacts on the environment attributed to climate change observed in North America include: • Extended periods of high fire risk andlarge increases in burned area; • Increased intensity, duration, and frequency ofheat waves; • Decreased snow pack, increased winter and early spring flooding potentials, and reduced summer stream flows in the western mountains; and • Increased stress on biological communities and habitatin coastalareas (IPCC 2007). The United States Global Change Research Programrecentlyreportedthe followingimpacts and trends in the Midwest region of the United States, including Illinois, associated with climate change (USGCRP 2009): • During the summer, publichealth and quality of life will be negatively affected by increasing heat waves, reduced air quality, and increasing insect and waterborne diseases. In the winter, warming will have mixed impacts. • The likely increase in precipitation in winter and spring, more heavy downpours, and greater evaporation in summer would lead to more periods ofboth floods and water deficits. • While the longer growing season provides the potential for increased crop yields, increases in heat waves, floods, droughts, insects, and weeds will present increasing challenges to managing crops, livestock, and forests. • Native species are very likely to face increasing threats from rapidly changing climate conditions, pests, diseases,andinvasive species moving in from warmer regions. Addressing Climate Change Concern regarding the relationship between GHG emissions from anthropogenic sources and changes to climate has led to a variety of federal, state, and regional initiatives and programs aimed at reducing or controlling GHG emissions from human activities as discussed in Section 3.2, Climate and Greenhouse Gases. Because climate change is considered a cumulative global phenomenon, it is generally accepted that any successful strategy to address climate change must rest on a global approach to controlling these emissions. In other words, imposing controls on one industry or in one country is unlikely to be an effective strategy. In addition, because GHGs remain in the atmosphere for a long time, and industrial societies will continue to use fossil fuels for at least the next 25 to 50 years, climate change cannot be avoided. As the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report states: “Societies can respond to climate change by adapting to its impacts and by reducing [GHG] emissions (mitigation), thereby reducing the rate and magnitude of change” (IPCC 2007). According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, there is a wide array of adaptation options. While adaptation will be an important aspect of reducing societies’ vulnerability to the impacts of climate change over the next two to three decades, “adaptation alone is not expected to cope with all the projected effects of climate change, especially not over the long term as most impacts increase in magnitude” (IPCC 2007). Therefore, it will also be necessaryto mitigate climate change bystabilizingthe concentrations of GHGs in the atmosphere. Stabilizing atmospheric concentrations will require societies to reduce their annual emissions. The stabilization concentration of a particular GHG is determined by the date that annual emissions of the gas start to decrease, the rate of decrease, and the persistence of the gas in the atmosphere. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report predicts the magnitude of climate change impacts for a range of scenarios based on different stabilization levels of GHGs. “Responding to climate change involves an iterative risk management process that includes both mitigation and adaptation, taking into account actual and avoided climate change damages, co-benefits, sustainability, equity, and attitudes to risk” (IPCC 2007). Climate Change, Greenhouse Gases, and the Proposed FutureGen 2.0 Project The capture and geological storage of GHG emissions by the FutureGen 2.0 Project would produce a beneficial cumulative effect on a national and global scale. Use of the oxy-combustion process combined with CO2 injection and permanent underground storage would remove approximately 1.2 million tons (1.1 million metric tons) per year of CO2 that would otherwise be emitted to the atmosphere, while producing 168 MWe of electricity. CO2 emissions from the Meredosia Energy Center would decrease from historical levels of 1.4 million tons (1.3 million metric tons) per year or more to approximately 0.2 million tons (0.1 million metric tons) per year. Over its 20 year operational lifespan, the FutureGen 2.0 Project would remove a total of approximately 24 million tons (22 million metric tons) of CO2 in the production of electricityfromcoal. These reductions in emissions alone would not appreciably reduce global concentrations of GHG emissions. However, these emissions changes would incrementally affect (reduce) the atmosphere’s concentration of GHGs, and, in combination with past and future emissions from all other sources, contribute incrementally to future change in atmospheric concentrations of GHGs. At present, there is no methodology that would allow DOE to estimate the specific effects (if any) this increment of change would produce near the project area or elsewhere. On a broader scale, successful implementation of the project may lead to widespread acceptance and deployment of oxy-combustion technology with geologic storage of CO2, thus fostering a long-term reduction in the rate of CO2 emissions from power plants across the United States. 4.3.4.3 Geology The potential for cumulative impacts associated with geological resources relates to the use of the Mt. Simon Formation as a repository for injected CO2. Besides the FutureGen 2.0 Project, there are three operational or planned CO2 storage projects using the Mt. Simon Formation for the geologic storage of CO2. One carbon capture project has been proposed at Taylorville, Illinois, and two projects (Illinois Basin-Decatur and Illinois Industrial Carbon Capture and Storage) are located at the Archer Daniels Midland plant in Decatur, Illinois. The Illinois Basin-Decatur project has been operatingfor the past year, injecting367,000 tons (333,000 metric tons) per year as part of a 3-year injection test (NETL 2012c). The Illinois Industrial Carbon Capture and Storage project would expand the geologic CO2 storage facility to accommodate commercial-scale carbon sequestration capacity by capturing and geologically storing 1 million tons (0.9 million metric tons) of CO2 annually from the company’s ethanol facility. The Archer Daniels Midland plant is located approximately 60 miles east of the FutureGen 2.0 CO2 storage study area. The Taylorville Energy Center project included a plan for local CO2 storage just north of Taylorville, Illinois; however, the project has been placed on indefinite hold pending state legislative action. The Taylorville Energy Center planned to inject 2.3 million tons (2.1 million metric tons) of CO2 per year adjacent to the new Taylorville Energy Center which would be located approximately 45 miles southeast of the FutureGen 2.0 CO2 storage studyarea. The maximum modeled CO2 underground plume radius for the Illinois Basin-Decatur project is projected to be approximately 2,000 feet after 100 years (DOE 2008c). The Illinois Industrial Carbon Capture and Storage project used the projected pressure front radius for the AoR (2 miles), which would include the predicted CO2 plume radius of 5,900 feet (DOE 2008c). If the Taylorville Energy Center project were to proceed and inject CO2, the plume was projected to occupy approximately 20 square miles. The FutureGen 2.0 Project would inject 1.2 million tons (1.1 million metric tons) of CO2 annually, which would result in a plume size of approximately 4,000 acres (6.25 square miles). DOE has estimated that the CO2 storage capacity for the Mt. Simon Formationis approximately 12 to 165 billion tons (11 to 150 billionmetric tons) of CO2 (NETL 2012a). Pressure studies have modeled 20 projects injectinga total of 100 million tons (91 million metric tons) per year for 50 years, in the central Illinois Basin, representing one-third of the total current emissions from large stationary CO2 sources in the region (Zhou and Birkholzer 2011). The project sites were assumed to be approximately 30 miles apart, and the model showed that not only could the Mt. Simon Formation contain the CO2, the pressure changes stayed within the fractional buildup thresholds deemed safe by the natural gas entities in the region thus causing no increase in potential forinducedseismicity (Zhou and Birkholzer 2011). Given the substantial spatial separation predicted for the CO2 plumes from the FutureGen 2.0 Project and the other three CO2 injection and storage projects, the overall seismic stability of the region, and the CO2 storage capacity of the Mt. Simon Formation, negligible cumulative impacts would be expected. 4.4 INCOMPLETE AND UNAVAILABLE INFORMATION Under NEPA, federal agencies must disclose incomplete or unavailable information if such information is essential to a reasoned choice among alternatives in an EIS, and must obtain that information if the overall costs of doing so are not exorbitant (40 CFR 1502.22). If the agency is unable to obtain the information because overall costs are exorbitant or because the means to obtain it are not known, the agency must do the following: • Affirmativelydisclosethat suchinformationisunavailable; • Explain the relevance of the unavailable information; • Summarize existing credible scientific evidence that is relevant to the agency’s evaluation of significant adverseimpactson the human environment; and • Evaluate the impacts based upon theoretical approaches or research methods generally accepted inthescientific community. Since publication of the Draft EIS, the Alliance continuedto developits conceptual and preliminary designs for the oxy-combustion facility, CO2 pipeline, injection well facilities for permanent geologic CO2 storage, and educational facilities. The Final EIS reflects the changes that have been made as more information became available and has been edited throughout as appropriate to incorporate the updated information and to describe effects on the analysis of impacts. The principal changes between the Draft and Final EIS are also outlined in Table S-1 of the Summary. DOE has revised the balance of this section as appropriate to update the status of information identified as unavailableor incompletewhen the Draft EIS was published. This section discloses areas where information was unavailable or incomplete during preparation of the Draft EIS and discusses its relevance to the range of environmental impacts. As stated above, the section has been updated to reflect the status of information at publication of the Final EIS. The FutureGen 2.0 Project continues to be in the preliminary design phase, and certain aspects of the project are still under development or otherwise evolving. As a result, some detailsregardingproject plans and design are in development and were incomplete and unavailable during Draft EIS preparation, and some aspects have remained incomplete or unavailable during preparation of the Final EIS. To account for uncertainties caused by incomplete and unavailable information, DOE developed bounding conditions and assumptions based on the most current and available data and project plans in evaluating the range of potential impacts that could occur under the proposed project, consistent with the fourth item in the bulleted list in the first paragraph above. To the extent that information became available after publication of the Draft EIS, DOE updated and refined the analysis of impacts appropriately throughout this Final EIS. However, for cases in which uncertainties remain about project details, DOE considers that the bounding conditions analyzed in the Draft EIS appropriately reflect the upper limits of anticipated impacts. Project features andtheirrelevance to theresource-level analysis presentedinthis Final EIS include: • Oxy-Combustion Large Scale Test Design. Initial design plans and air permitting documents for the FutureGen 2.0 Project were based on a 200-MWe system. The Alliance subsequently determined that a 168-MWe capacity system would be more appropriate and revised the design during preparation of the Draft EIS. DOE based its analyses in the Draft EIS on updated project design characteristics reflecting the 168-MWe system for all the project components with the exception of the air quality analysis. Because the construction air permit application for the 168-MWe system had not yet been prepared, DOE based its air quality analysis for the Draft EIS on the prior construction air permit application for the 200-MWe system. That evaluation provided a conservative estimate, or upper bound, for potential impacts. Since publication of the Draft EIS,the Alliance prepared and submitted a revised construction permit application in June 2013 for the updated design of the energy center. Accordingly, DOE updated Section 3.1, Air Quality, in the Final EIS to present estimated air emissions based on the 168-MWe design, as well as the updated analyses contained in the revised construction permit application. • Oxy-Combustion Large Scale Test General Arrangement and Site Plan. Details related to site grading and site drainage for the FutureGen 2.0 Project at the Meredosia Energy Center were still under development when the Draft EIS was prepared. To assess the potential for physical impacts at the energy center, DOE used generalized disturbance area maps provided by the Alliance and Ameren. These maps depict boundaries within which development would occur, and thus provide a conservative, or upper bound, estimate of potential impacts. Design details beyond general location were also unavailable for the proposed stormwater management basins. DOE considered potential impacts related to this feature based on its general location, sensitive features present near that location, and measures that would be taken by the Alliance and Ameren with respect to the sensitive features. These topics are addressed in Section 3.6, Surface Water, and Section 3.7, Wetlands and Floodplains. Based on discussion and commentsfrom USFWS,DOE undertook measures to reduce the amount of forested land that would be cleared for the project as discussed in Section 2.4.3. Through ongoing refinements in site plans by the Alliance, the amount of forested acreage that could be lost would likely be substantially lower than the upper bound identified in the Draft EIS (i.e., 33 acres at the Meredosia Energy Center). With current site plans, the impacts could range from less than 1 acre to as many as 9 acres of forestedlands as discussed in Section 3.8, Biological Resources. • CO2 Pipeline Routes. The Alliance identified two potential pipeline routes to the CO2 storage study area, the southern route (preferred) and the northernroute (alternative), both withina 4-mile wide pipeline corridor. The Alliance was still in the process of planning the pipeline route as the Draft EIS was prepared, and portions of the proposed routes could be adjusted within the 4-mile corridor to avoid sensitive features or to address other constraints. Because access to the proposed pipeline ROWs was not available during Draft EIS preparation, field studies for cultural resources, sensitive biological species, and wetlands were unavailable at the time. In addition, pipeline routes within the CO2 storage study area were not yet defined in the absence of specific injection well locations and, therefore, DOE used hypothetical routes to develop the potential range of impacts. Thus, for the Draft EIS, DOE relied on data available within the pipeline corridor and prospective ROWs and the CO2 storage study area (e.g., federal and state mapping data) to determine the likely presence of resources and the potential range of impacts that could occur. After extensive field work and coordination with landowners, the Illinois SHPO, IDNR, and USACE, the Alliance defined the southern pipeline route as the most likely pipeline route to the injection well location. The route was selected in consideration of landowners’ interests, constructability, access to existing ROWs, and the desire to avoid sensitive environmental resources, such as wetlands, cultural resources, forest land, and threatened or endangered species and their habitats. For the Final EIS, DOE revised Section 2.5.1 to explain the selection of the southern pipeline route and updated all figures that depict the pipeline routes. DOE also updated all resource sections in the Final EIS that quantify impactsalongthe pipeline route. • CO2 Injection and Monitoring Wells. The Alliance was in the process of preparing permit applications for the UIC Class VI injection wells during Draft EIS preparation. Because this aspect of the project was still in progress when the Draft EIS was prepared, the specific locations of the proposed injection and monitoring wells within the CO2 storage study area were not yet identified. As a result, DOE used conceptual design data, proposed footprints, and siting criteria to assess the potential impacts given the resources present in the CO2 storage study area. These topics are addressed in Section 3.3, Physiography and Soils; Section 3.6, Surface Water; Section 3.7, Wetlands and Floodplains; Section 3.8, Biological Resources; Section 3.9, Cultural Resources; and Section 3.10, Land Use. The Alliance submitted the UIC permit applications for the Class VI injection wells (March 2013, revised May 2013) while the Draft EIS was being prepared for publication, although the final siting and configuration of the injection wells must be approved by USEPA in the issuance of the UIC permits. DOE updated Section 2.5.2 in the Final EIS to incorporate the current design data, which is compared to the bounding data already presented in the Draft EIS. The Alliance also has negotiated with local landowners to acquire additional rights to subsurface pore space and ensure that the CO2 plume would not affect subsurface rights of non-participating landowners. As a result of these efforts, the size of the CO2 storage study area expanded to 6,800 acres, with the additional 1,500 acres located south and west of the study area boundary in the Draft EIS. Based on the latest modeling, however, the subsurface plume extent would remain as estimated in the Draft EIS (approximately 4,000 acres). Since publication of the Draft EIS, the Alliance also revised the injection well configuration from a dual-site scenario to a single-site scenario. Additional details about the injection well site configuration currently proposed by theAlliancewere made availablefor the Final EIS as follows: • The single-site scenario would require only one building to house the surface facilities. Since the dual-site scenario, which is no longer under consideration by the Alliance, would require as many as four buildings distributed between two sites, the area of disturbance for construction and operations would be larger than for the single-site scenario. Therefore, analysis in the Final EIS is bounded conservatively by the dual-site scenario (i.e., multiple-building design) as analyzed in the DraftEIS. • The land area impacted by single-site scenario would be reduced in comparison to the dual-site scenario, because the Alliance would locate all injection wells and infrastructure at one location requiring less land area. Additionally, the length and acreage required for access roads would be reduced for the single-site scenario. Although impacts associated with the currently proposed single-site scenario would be less, the analysis in the Final EIS is bounded conservatively bythe dual-site scenarioas analyzed in theDraft EIS. • Details about the monitoring well network for the single-site scenario were not available for the Draft EIS but were added to the Final EIS. Although the monitoring wells for the single-site scenario currently proposed by the Alliance would require less land area, the analysis in the Final EIS is bounded conservatively bythe dual-site scenarioas analyzed in theDraft EIS. • Educational Facilities. The Alliance had not identified the specific location of the proposed educational facilities during Draft EIS preparation; however, the general location was expected to be in the vicinity of Jacksonville, Illinois. DOE considered the Alliance’s conceptual design and the siting criteria that would be used for locating the facilities in order to evaluate the range and types of potential impacts that could occur from this project component. These potential impacts are addressed in each resource section of Chapter 3 as appropriate. Since publication of the Draft EIS, the Alliance modified its plans such that the current conceptual design assumes that the visitor, research, and training facilities would be housed in a single building, rather than two separate buildings. These changes are described in Section 2.5.3 of the Final EIS. However, since design concepts are still in development, the Final EIS evaluates impacts associated with the educational facilities based on the more conservative conceptual design intheDraft EISformultiple educational buildings. As indicated above, DOE evaluated the potential range of impacts based upon the best available information for the FutureGen 2.0 Project and information on affected environment that could reasonably be obtained. In the absence of design data or specific location data for a project feature, DOE developed a range of potential impacts based on conceptual design data, siting criteria, other available project plans and commitments, and available baseline data for each resource area. DOE’s analysis was conducted in order to provide a range of potential impacts, including an upper bound, so as to provide decision-makers with information that would support a reasoned choice among the alternatives. DOE concluded that the impacts of the FutureGen 2.0 Project are appropriately described in this Final EIS and that the range of potential impactswould remain within theupper bounds defined. 4.5 IRREVERSIBLE AND IRRETRIEVABLE COMMITMENTS This section describes the amounts and types of resources that A resource commitment is irreversible when would be irreversibly or irretrievably committed for the primary or secondary impacts from its use limit FutureGen 2.0 Project. A resource commitment is considered concurrent or future use options and is irreversible when primary or secondary impacts from its use irretrievable when its use or consumption is neither renewable nor recoverable for use by limit concurrent or future use options. Irreversible commitment future generations. applies primarilyto nonrenewable resources suchas minerals or cultural resources, and to those resources that are renewable only over long time spans, such as soil productivity or mature forests. A resource commitment is considered irretrievable when the use or consumption of the resource is neither renewable nor recoverable for use by future generations. Irretrievable commitment applies to the loss of production, harvest, or natural resources. Once consumed, the resource is nolonger available for future generations. The principal resources that would be committed by the proposed project are the lands required for the construction and operation of the proposed oxy-combustion facility, CO2 pipeline, injection wells, and the educational facilities. Other resources that would be committed to the project include construction materials (e.g., steel and concrete), process materials (e.g., trona and hydrated lime), and fuels (e.g., coal and natural gas) used for construction and operations. In addition, the proposed project would commit the Mt. Simon Formation beneath Morgan Countytopermanent usefor geologic storage of CO2. Surface lands would be irreversibly committed throughout the approximately 20-year operational life of the proposed project. After this time and upon future decommissioning, proposed project components could be removed and the surface lands again made available to be re-used for another purpose. At the Meredosia Energy Center, all of the land required for the operation of the oxy-combustion facility is currently owned by Ameren and would be purchased by the Alliance. Therefore, there would be no loss of these lands, as they would be used for their current purpose. Onsite construction laydown areas would be leased for the duration of construction. The proposed CO2 pipeline would be constructed and operated by the Alliance. Construction ROWs such as laydown areas would be leased or used pursuant to short-term easements with landowners. Operational ROWs would be acquired through long-term easements with landowners. Lands used for agricultural production could be returned to that use after completion of pipeline construction. The Alliance would purchase the land required for the injection wells and associated infrastructure and the subsurface pore space into which the CO2 would be injected. Land required for monitoring wells would be purchased or leased by the Alliance depending on the type of monitoring well and landowner preference. The proposed CO2 pipeline ROW would be co-located along or within existing highway ROWs to the greatest extent practicable. For the remainder of the CO2 pipeline ROW, temporary easements would be required during construction, and permanent easements would be maintained for the operation of the CO2 pipeline. The CO2 pipeline ROW would not preclude farming once construction was complete. Lands currently being used for agriculture could be returned to agricultural use with few restrictions after completion of construction. Hence, agricultural lands within the temporary and permanent easements for the CO2 pipeline would not be considered irretrievably committed. However, the loss of agricultural use of theselands during the construction period would bean irreversiblecommitment. Natural habitat would be lost primarily where the CO2 pipeline ROWs would cross forested areas, mainly along streams and associated surface waters within the forested areas. The CO2 pipeline ROWs would result in the removal of up to 8 acres of forested areas along the southern route and 22 acres of forested areas along the northern route during construction, which would be converted to, and maintained as, grasslands over the 20-year operational life of the proposed project. The remainder of existing forested areas removed during construction would be allowed to revert back to forest through natural succession. At the end of the project's 20-year life, the operational ROW could revert back to forest through natural succession as well. However, the removal of forested area is considered an irreversible commitment because of the long time period requiredfor a foresttore-establish. The land that would be occupied by the CO2 injection wells, associated facilities, and access roads would be irreversibly committed throughout the 20-year operational life of the project. Once CO2 injection operations are completed, some wells and equipment at the injection well site(s) may still be used for long-term monitoring purposes. Nevertheless, after removal of surface facilities, the land could return to other productive uses. Considerable amounts of water used to operate the FutureGen 2.0 Project would also be irreversibly committed (e.g., evaporated to the atmosphere rather than discharged back to surface or groundwater). The FutureGen 2.0 Project would use up to 3.0 mgd of process waterfromtheIllinoisRiverthat would be committed for the 20-year operational life of the oxy-combustion facility. Approximately 13.6 mgd of water would be taken from the river and cycled through the cooling towers where some of the water would evaporate. Thebalance (10.6 mgd) would be treated and returned to the Illinois River. During operation, up to 0.1 mgd of groundwater would be used from onsite wells at the Meredosia Energy Center. Well water would be used for steam cycle demineralizer influent, coal-handling dust suppression, and potable water. Village of Meredosia water may also be used for potable water and fire protection. Because the project would not discharge any project-related water directly back to groundwater, the groundwater used would not be available for other uses. However, stormwater would be discharged to groundwatervia the stormwater management basin or evaporated via the linedsettlingbasin (refer to Section 2.4.2.2 foradditionaldetails).  Other resources that would be committed to the project include materials and energy resources used for construction and operation. Material and energy resources committed for the project would include construction materials (e.g., steel, concrete), electricity, and fuel (e.g., diesel, gasoline). All energy used during construction and operation would be irretrievable. During operation, up to 1,224 tons of bituminous coal, 816 tons of sub-bituminous coal, 187 tons of hydrated lime, and 8.9 tons of trona would be used on a daily basis, which would be irretrievablycommitted. These resources would not be available for use byfuture generations. The FutureGen 2.0 Project also would consume natural gas for heating purposes during operations. Although the amount of natural gas used would be negligible in relation to regional supplies, it would be irretrievably committed. The auxiliary electric power demand to operate the oxy-combustion facility would total 69 MWe. Although the oxy-combustion facility would irretrievably consume electricity during operation, it would generate approximately 168 MWe of electricity, which would not otherwise be generated. As described above, the project would result in irreversible (i.e., lostfor a period of time) commitments of primarily renewable natural resources. The project would also result in an irretrievable (i.e., permanently lost) commitment of portions of geologic storage formations, energy, material resources, and fuel. 4.6 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SHORT-TERM USES OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND LONG-TERM PRODUCTIVITY This section describes the relationship and tradeoffs between the short-term uses of the environment for the FutureGen 2.0 Project and the project’s long-term benefits. Short-term uses of the environment would include the activities and associated impacts during the construction and 20-year operational lifespan of the proposed project. Potential impacts to various resources have been described throughout Chapter 3. Potential environmental impacts would include: • Air quality impacts resulting from criteria pollutant and fugitive dust emissions, as described in Section 3.1, AirQuality; • Erosion and sedimentation impacts on surface waters during construction, and impacts to the Illinois River and local aquifers from withdrawal of water to support operations, as described in Section 3.3, Physiographyand Soils; Section 3.6,Surface Water; and Section 3.5, Groundwater; • Vegetation and wildlife habitat impacts caused by land-clearing activities, as described in Section 3.7, Wetlands and Floodplains; and Section 3.8, Biological Resources; • Aesthetic and land use changes affecting nearby residents, as described in Section 3.10, Land Use; and Section 3.11, Aesthetics; • Traffic impacts during construction due to temporary detours and the movement of heavy equipment, plus increased traffic on local roadways during construction and operation, as described in Section 3.13, Traffic and Transportation;and • Noiseimpactsfrom construction activities and operations, as described in Section 3.14, Noise and Vibration. The FutureGen 2.0 Project would use environmental resources, consume products and energy, produce wastes and emissions, and occupy land. The project would consume resources including coal, surface water, groundwater, and natural and manufactured products during its planned 20-year operational life. The Draft EIS estimated that the project would use up to 285 acres of land in Morgan County, Illinois, for the operation of the oxy-combustion facility on the Meredosia Energy Center site, the permanent CO2 pipeline ROWs, the injection and monitoring well sites, and the educational facilities. The current design would impact less land area; however, this Final EIS maintains the values analyzed in the Draft EIS as the conservative bounding conditions. See Chapter 2 for a discussion of the proposed project components. Upon future decommissioning of proposed project components, DOE assumes the structures could be removed and that the land could be made available for other purposes. The project would enhance short-term productivity in the region through the direct, indirect, and induced creation ofconstruction jobs during the construction of the oxy-combustion facility, the pipeline, injection wells, and educational facilities. In addition, the project would have a long-term beneficial impact on the local economy, employment, and tax base over its operational life as a result of the permanent jobs that would be created, plus the indirect and induced jobs created as a result of these permanent jobs (see Section 3.18, Socioeconomics). Another long-term benefit of the project would be the achievement of lower emissions of GHGs in comparison to conventional coal-fueled power plants by capturing and geologically storing CO2. During average annual operating conditions, the project is expected to generate approximately 168 MWe of electricity from coal combustion, with a near-zero emissions technology designed to capture at least 90 percentofthe CO2 that wouldotherwise be emittedto the atmosphere during steady-state operation. On a broader scale, the widespread acceptance and employment of oxy-combustion technology with geologic storage could foster an overall long-term reduction in the rate of CO2 emissions from power plants across the United States, thereby reducing national GHG emissions. If the proposed project is successful, the short-term use of land, materials, water, and energy to construct and operate the project would have long-term positive impacts on reducing GHG emissions both in the United States and globally (see Section 3.2, Climate and Greenhouse Gases). In summary, the short-term uses of the local environment do not represent substantial commitments of resources and would not cause substantial adverse impacts. In exchange for these short-term uses and associated effects, a substantial long-term benefit to the regional, national, and global environment may be achieved through the commercial-scale demonstration of technologies that can generate and distribute electricityusingfossil fuelswithsubstantiallyreducedGHGemissions. 5 REGULATORYANDPERMIT REQUIREMENTS CEQ regulations for NEPA Part 1502 Section 1502.25 states that, to the fullest extent possible, agencies shall prepare draft EISs concurrently with and integrated with environmental impact analyses and related surveys and studies required by environmental review laws and EOs. It also requires a draft EIS list all federal permits, licenses, and other entitlements that must be obtained in implementing the proposed project. The following table contains relevant regulatory and permit requirements for the construction and operation of the FutureGen 2.0 Project. The table identifies relevant federal regulatory requirements considered within the EIS including federal regulations and EOs, state regulations and permitting requirements, and localregulations and permitting requirements. Table 5-1.

The Risk Management Plan must include: • A hazard assessment that details the potential effects of an accidental release, an accident history of the last 5 years, and an evaluation of the worst-case and alternative accidental releases; • A prevention program that includes safety precautions and maintenance, monitoring, and employee training; and • An emergency response program that spells out emergency health care, employee training measures, and procedures for informing the public and response agencies (e.g., the fire department) should an accident occur. The plan must be updated and resubmitted to the agency every 5 years. Under the Illinois Accidental Release Prevention Program, the Alliance could be required to comply with the Chemical Accident Provisions because the energy center could have the potential to emit covered substances at levels above the accidental release threshold quantities. Clean Air Act and Air Toxics (MATS) (part of Title I) • New Source Performance Standards (NSPSs) (part of Title I) • Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) Permit (part of Title I) • Regional Haze Rule Each of these CAA requirements is addressed in this table. CAA Title V provides the basis for the Operating Permit Program and establishes permit conditions, including monitoring and analysis, inspections, certification, and reporting. Authority for implementation of the permitting program is delegated to the state of Illinois. Table 5-1. Relevant Regulatory and Permit Requirements for the Proposed Project Statute, Description Regulation, Order Clean Air Interstate Rule  On March 10, 2005, USEPA issued the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR). This rule  provides states with a solution to the problem of power plant pollution that drifts from one  40 CFR 96  state to another. CAIR covers 27 eastern states and the District of Columbia. The rule  uses a cap and trade system to reduce the target pollutants – SO2 and NOx.  A December 2008 court decision found flaws in CAIR, but kept CAIR requirements in  place temporarily while directing USEPA to issue a replacement rule. On July 6, 2011,  the USEPA finalized the Cross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR), which was intended to  replace CAIR. However, on August 21, 2012, the U.S. Court of Appeals struck down the  USEPA’s CSAPR. As a result, CAIR remains in effect.  Clean Water Act, Title IV 40 CFR 104 through 140 Focuses on improving the quality of water resources by providing a comprehensive framework of standards, technical tools, and financial assistance to address the many causes of pollution and poor water quality, including municipal and industrial wastewater discharges, polluted runoff from urban and rural areas, and habitat destruction. Applicable Sections: • Section 303(d) and 305(b). Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) requires states to identify and develop a list of impaired waterbodies where technology-based and other required controls have not provided attainment of water quality standards. Section 305(b) of the CWA requires states to assess and report the quality of their waterbodies. In 2008, Illinois combined their 303(d) and 305(b) list into one report referred to as the Integrated Report. The report identifies those waterbodies that are impaired and do not meet designated uses, and establishes total maximum daily loads for pollutants of concern. • Section 401 - Certification. Provides states with the opportunity to review and approve, condition, or deny all federal permits or licenses that might result in a discharge to state or tribal waters, including wetlands. The major federal permit subject to Section 401 review is a Section 404 permit. Every applicant for a Section 404 permit must request state certification that the proposed activity would not violate state or federal water quality standards. In Illinois, there are 26 specific nationwide permits for which a Section 401 certification has been categorically issued per the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), including Nationwide Permit 12. • Section 402 - National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit. Requires sources to obtain permits to discharge effluents and stormwater to surface waters. The CWA authorizes USEPA to delegate permitting, administrative, and enforcement duties to state governments, while USEPA retains oversight responsibilities. The state of Illinois has been delegated NPDES authority and therefore would issue the NPDES permit. • Section 404 o Permits for Dredged or Fill Material. Regulates the discharge of dredged or fill material in the jurisdictional wetlands and waters of the U.S. The USACE has been delegated the responsibility for authorizing these actions. o Nationwide Permit 12 Utility Line Activities. Authorizes the construction, maintenance, and repair of utility lines and the associated excavation, backfill, or bedding for the utility lines in all waters of the U.S. The USACE has been delegated the responsibility for authorizing these actions. Table 5-1. Relevant Regulatory and Permit Requirements for the Proposed Project Statute, Description Regulation, Order Compliance Assurance  The rule applies to facilities that have emissions units located at major sources subject  Monitoring Rule  to Title V air quality permitting and that use control devices to achieve compliance with  emissions limits. A Compliance Assurance Monitoring Plan is required as part of the  40 CFR 64  initial application for a Title V Operating Permit. The rule requires that these facilities  35 Illinois Administrative  monitor the operation and maintenance of their control equipment to evaluate the  Code (IAC) 201  performance of their control devices and report if they meet established emissions  standards. If these facilities find that their control equipment is not working properly, the  rule requires them to take action to correct any malfunctions and to report such  instances to the appropriate enforcement agency (i.e., state and local environmental  agencies).  Six exemptions apply. The rule does not apply to emissions limitations and standards  that: (1) are contained in post 1990 rules, (2) specify a continuous compliance  determination method, (3) are related to stratospheric ozone requirements, (4) are  included in the Acid Rain program, (5) apply solely under an emissions trading program,  or (6) are included in an emissions cap that meets the requirements of 40 CFR  70.4(b)(13). Because existing standards would require continuous monitoring of NOx,  SO2, and particulate matter (PM), compliance assurance monitoring would not apply to  these pollutants. The project does not include add-on controls for carbon monoxide (CO)  or for VOCs and therefore these pollutants would not be subject to compliance  assurance monitoring.  Compliance with Floodplain and Wetland Environmental Review Requirements. Title 10 Part 1022 Establishes policy and procedures for discharging the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) responsibilities under EO 11988 and EO 11990, including DOE policy regarding the consideration of floodplain and wetland factors in DOE planning and decision-making; and DOE procedures for identifying proposed projects located in a floodplain or wetland, providing opportunity for early public review of such proposed projects, preparing floodplain or wetland assessments, and issuing statements of findings for actions in a floodplain. Emergency Planning and  Requires that inventories of specific chemicals used or stored onsite be reported on a  Community Right-to periodic basis. The project would process or otherwise use substances subject to the  Know Act of 1986  Act’s reporting requirements, such as sulfuric acid.  42 USC 11001 et seq.  Endangered Species Act 16 USC 1536 et seq. Enacted by Public Law 93205, Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 USC 1531 et seq.) Section 7 – Interagency Cooperation. Requires any federal agency authorizing, funding, or carrying out any action to ensure that the action is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat of such species. Under Section 7 of the Act, DOE has consulted with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and the Illinois Department of Natural Resources (IDNR). Section 10 – Exceptions. An Incidental Take Permit allows for the taking of a species incidental to an otherwise lawful act. This permit is required when non-federal activities would result in the take of threatened or endangered apices. Each permit application must be accompanied by a Habitat Conservation Plan, which ensures that the effects of the authorized incidental take are adequately minimized and mitigated. If such a permit is required, DOE would consult with the USFWS. Table 5-1.

These  agencies are to be sent copies of this Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and  16 USC 661 et seq.  their comments will be considered.  Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program 40 CFR 98 The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 (H.R. 2764; Public Law 110–161) directed the USEPA to develop a mandatory reporting rule for GHG emissions. The rule became effective December 29, 2009, and includes requirements for 31 emissions source categories, including electric generation and general combustion sources. On December 1, 2010, USEPA finalized new rules that amend the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule (GGRR). The new rules require reporting of emissions data from additional sources, including facilities that inject and store CO2 underground for the purposes of geologic sequestration (Subpart RR). Subpart RR reporting requirements went into effect on December 31, 2010. Greenhouse Gas  This rule limits applicability of GHG emissions standards under the CAA to new and  Tailoring Rule  modified stationary sources that emit more than 75,000 tons per year (68,250 metric  tons) of CO2 equivalents (beginning January 2, 2011). If GHG emissions exceed the  40 CFR 51, 52, 70,  threshold, the GHG emissions would be subject to best available control technology and  and 71  other relevant requirements that apply to PSD permits. Because this project includes  contemporaneous and creditable decreases in GHG emissions, the project is not subject  to PSD for GHG.  Mercuryand Air Toxics rule (also known as Utility Maximum Achievable Control Technology[MACT] rule) 40 CFR 63 Subpart UUUUU On February 16, 2012, the USEPA finalized the NESHAPs from Coal- and Oil-Fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units (EGUs) under 40 CFR 63, Subpart UUUUU, otherwise known as the MATS rule (or Utility MACT). New and existing facilities would be subject to the rule. This rule replaces the 2005 Clean Air Mercury Rule. The proposed project is categorized as an EGU and would therefore be subject to this regulation. Table 5-1. Relevant Regulatory and Permit Requirements for the Proposed Project Statute, Description Regulation, Order Migratory Bird Treaty Act  Protects birds that have common migration patterns between the United States and  Canada, Mexico, Japan, and Russia. The Act regulates the take and harvest of  16 USC 703 et seq.  migratory birds. The USFWS will review this EIS to determine whether the activities  analyzed would comply with the requirements of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.  National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants 40 CFR 61 and 63 35 IAC 201 35 IAC 232 Non-criteria pollutants that can cause serious health and environmental hazards are termed hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) or air toxics. The NESHAPs apply primarily to new and existing sources in source categories designated by the USEPA. Specific NESHAPs apply to major sources of HAPs defined to be major (i.e., emitting a single HAP in excess of 10 tons per year or an aggregate emissions rate of over 25 tons per year of any combination of regulated HAPs). However, USEPA has also promulgated several NESHAPs which apply to area sources of HAPs (less than major source levels of HAPs). The emergency generators at the energy center would be subject to 40 CFR 63 Subpart ZZZZ, “National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Stationary Reciprocating Internal Combustion Engines.” The auxiliary boiler would be subject to 40 CFR 63 Subpart DDDDD, “National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Industrial, Commercial, and Institutional Boilers and Process Heaters at Major Sources.” National Environmental  This EIS is being prepared to comply with NEPA, the federal law that requires agencies  Policy Act (NEPA)  of the federal government to study the possible environmental impacts of major federal  actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.  42 USC 4321 et seq.  National Historic Preservation Act 36 CFR 800 16 USC 470 et seq. Under Section 106, the head of any federal agency having direct or indirect jurisdiction over a proposed federal or federally-assisted undertaking in any state and the head of any federal department or independent agency having authority to license any undertaking shall, prior to the approval of the expenditure of any federal funds on the undertaking or prior to the issuance of any license, as the case may be, take into account the effect of the undertaking on any district, site, building, structure, or object that is included in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register. The head of any such federal agency shall afford the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation established under Title II of the Act a reasonable opportunity to comment with regard to such undertaking. National Pollutant  Authorized under the CWA, the NPDES program requires sources to obtain permits to  Discharge Elimination  discharge effluents and stormwater to surface waters. Under this program, permit  System  modifications are required if discharge effluents are altered. The CWA authorizes  42 USC 1342 et seq.  USEPA to delegate permitting, administrative, and enforcement duties to state  governments, while it retains oversight responsibilities. The state of Illinois has been  35 IAC 309  delegated NPDES authority and therefore would issue an NPDES permit for the project.  The proposed project would discharge treated industrial wastewater to surface waters  under NPDES Permit No. IL0000116. This NPDES Permit (IL0000116), which was  renewed September 30, 2011, is valid for the next five years. A modification to this  permit was submitted to IEPA on June 20, 2013, based upon project design  changes which occurred after the Draft EIS was released; approval is currently  pending. Pending future design changes, this permit may require additional revision  prior to the project discharging wastewater.  Table 5-1. Relevant Regulatory and Permit Requirements for the Proposed Project Statute, Description Regulation, Order New Source Performance Standards 40 CFR 60 The NSPS are technology-based standards applicable to new, modified and reconstructed stationary sources of regulated air emissions in certain source categories. Where the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) emphasize air quality in general, the NSPS focus on particular sources of approximately 70 industrial source categories or sub-categories of sources (e.g., fossil fuel-fired generators, grain elevators, steam generating units) that are designated by size as well as type of process. NSPS standards have been developed and would apply to the oxy-combustion boiler, the auxiliary fuel oil fired boiler, and the emergency generator. NSPS standards have also been promulgated for coal processing plants and certain portions of the Meredosia Energy Center coal handling system may fall under the coal processing plant standards after modification for this project. Noise Control Act  Directs federal agencies to carry out programs in their jurisdictions “to the fullest extent  within their authority” and in a manner that furthers a national policy of promoting an  42 USC 4901 et seq.  environment free from noise that jeopardizes health and welfare.  Notice to the Federal The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) must be notified and informed of proposed Aviation Administration lighting for any structures more than 200 feet high pursuant to 14 CFR 77. The FAA would then determine if the structures would or would not be an obstruction to air 14 CFR 77 navigation. Subsequent construction notification(s) are required to be submitted to the FAA. Occupational Safety and  Compliance with OSHA would be required according to OSHA standards.  Applicable Rules:  Health Act  29 USC 651 et seq.  • OSHA General Industry Standards (29 CFR 1910)  • OSHA Construction Industry Standards (29 CFR 1926)  • OSHA sets permissible exposure limits for chemicals allowed for workers over an 8 hour period at facilities.  Energy center employees would be instructed in worker protection and safety  procedures, and would be provided appropriate personal protective equipment pursuant  to the contractor’s and/or energy center’s safety program.  Oil Pollution Prevention This Rule requires a Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasures (SPCC) plan if the Rule energy center stores more than 1,320 gallons of oil onsite aboveground (or more than 40 CFR 112 42,000 gallons of oil onsite belowground). The rule is applicable to the project based on the proposed storage of diesel fuel and potential use of large transformers that hold more than 1,320 gallons of mineral oil. Pollution Prevention Act  Establishes a national policy for waste management and pollution control that focuses  first on source reduction, and then on environmentally safe waste recycling, treatment,  42 USC 13101 et seq.  and disposal. EO 13101, “Greening the Government through Waste Prevention,  Recycling, and Federal Acquisition”, and EO 13148, “Greening the Government through  Leadership in Environmental Management”, provide guidance to agencies to implement  the Pollution Prevention Act. DOE requires specific goals to reduce the generation of  waste. DOE would implement a pollution prevention plan by incorporating such waste- reducing activities as ordering construction materials in correct sizes and numbers,  resulting in very small amounts of waste; and implementing best management practices  to reduce the volume of waste generated and reuse waste wherever possible.  Table 5-1. Relevant Regulatory and Permit Requirements for the Proposed Project Statute, Description Regulation, Order Prevention of Significant Deterioration (Clean Air Act Title I) 40 CFR 52.21 The PSD Program involves a pre-construction review and permit process for construction and operation of a new or modified major stationary source of air emissions in attainment areas. A major source is a source for which the amount of any one regulated pollutant emitted is equal to or greater than thresholds of 100 tons per year for sources which are part of the 28 categories defined by the PSD rule or 250 tons per year for all other source categories. Regulated air pollutants include PM, VOC, GHGs, SO2, NOx, and CO. Authority for implementation of the Title I PSD program has been delegated to IEPA. The construction permit application for the proposed project quantifies and analyzes the estimated operational emissions, and concludes that the proposed project would not require a PSD permit; however, the construction permit application has not yet been approved by IEPA (Ameren 2013). Regional Haze Rule  In July 1999, the USEPA published the Regional Haze Rule to address visibility  impairment in our nation’s largest national parks and wilderness (“Class I”) areas. The  CAA Section 169  Regional Haze Rule required states to develop Best Available Retrofit Technology  (BART) standards for combustion sources constructed between 1962 and 1977 which  have the potential to emit greater than 250 tons per year of regional haze pollutants.  These standards were to be developed on a case-by-case basis. Facilities constructed  after 1977 were subject to NSPS standards for boilers and BART was not required.  Therefore, the FutureGen 2.0 Project would not be required to conduct a Class I area  impact analysis under the Regional Haze Rule.  Resource Conservation and Recovery Act(RCRA) 40 CFR 239 through 299 Regulates the treatment, storage, and disposal of hazardous wastes. Project participants would be required to identify any residues that require management as hazardous waste under RCRA (40 CFR 261). For some waste streams, this includes testing waste samples using the toxic characteristic leaching procedure or other procedures that measure hazardous waste characteristics. Applicable Title: Title II, Subtitle C - Hazardous Waste Management, provides for a regulatory system to ensure the environmentally sound management of hazardous wastes from the point of origin to the point of final disposal. Title II, Subtitle D - State or Regional Solid Waste Plans, requires state and local government to establish a regulatory framework for the proper management and disposal of non-hazardous solid wastes. Rivers and Harbors Act  Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act requires authorization from the USACE for the  of 1989  construction of any structure in or over any navigable water of the U.S., the  excavation/dredging or deposition of material in these waters or any obstruction or  33 USC 401, 403, 407  alteration in "navigable water". Structure or work outside the limits defined as navigable  waters of the U.S. require a Section10 permit if the structure or work affects the course,  location, condition, or capacity of the waterbody.  The Alliance is currently discussing the applicability of this requirement with the USACE.  Safe Drinking Water Act 42 USC 300 et seq. Gives USEPA the responsibility and authority to regulate public drinking water supplies by establishing drinking water standards, delegating authority for enforcement of drinking water standards to the states, and protecting aquifers from hazards such as injection of wastes and other materials into wells. The USEPA has primacy over Class VI injection wells, which are used for geologic sequestration of CO2. USEPA regulations for the Underground Injection Control (UIC) program of the Safe Drinking Water Act are codified at 40 CFR 146. Table 5-1. Relevant Regulatory and Permit Requirements for the Proposed Project Statute, Description Regulation, Order Transportation of  Specifies safety standards and reporting requirements for pipeline facilities used in the  Hazardous Liquids by  transportation of hazardous liquids or CO2. This includes pipeline location standards to  Pipeline  avoid private dwellings, industrial buildings, and places of public assembly, stipulations  for pipeline depth and right-of-way (ROW) requirements. This Act established the Office  49 CFR 195  of Pipeline Safety (OPS), which is part of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety  Administration. OPS maintains a pipeline incident database and also requires pipeline  annual operator reports. OPS develops safety guidelines for pipelines. The 1992  amendments, particularly Section 601 Safety, expanded the authority of OPS to  evaluate safety and environmental protection related to siting and operation of natural  gas, oil, and hazardous liquid pipelines.  Underground Injection Control Permit 40 CFR 146 Construction and operation of CO2 injection wells for geologic storage would require the issuance of UIC permits in accordance with 40 CFR 146 under the Safe Drinking Water Act. The USEPA currently has the authority to issue and administer the Class VI permits required for large-scale injection of CO2. The Alliance submitted the UIC permit applications to the USEPA in March 2013, with a subsequent revision in May2013. Executive Orders Executive Order 13175  Directs federal agencies to establish regular and meaningful consultation and  Consultation and  collaboration with tribal governments in the development of federal policies that have  Coordination with Indian  tribal implications, to strengthen United States government-to-government relationships  Tribal Governments  with Indian tribes, and to reduce the imposition of unfunded mandates on tribal  governments.  Executive Order 13432 EO issued (May 2007) to reduce GHG emissions from motor vehicles, nonroad vehicles, Cooperation Among and nonroad engines.

The EO also requires agencies to develop procedures to ensure the fullest practical provision of timely public information and the understanding of federal plans and programs with potential environmental impacts, and to obtain the views of interested parties. DOE promulgated regulations (10 CFR 1027) and issued DOE Order 451.1b, “National Environmental Policy Act Compliance Program”, to ensure compliance with this EO. Because the proposed project is a federal action that requires NEPA analysis, DOE must comply with Order 451.1b. Table 5-1.

This  Rules  permit applies to all directionally bored pipeline and utility crossings placed beneath the  beds of all Illinois rivers, lakes, and streams under the Department's jurisdiction. This  615 ILCS 5  permit also applies to other pipeline and utility crossings placed beneath the beds of all  Illinois rivers, lakes, and streams under the Department's jurisdiction except those in  Part 3708.  General Permit for Construction Storm Water Discharge IEPA NPDES Permit No. ILR10 35 IAC, Subtitle C, Chapter 1 Construction sites that disturb one acre or more are required to have coverage under the NPDES general permit for stormwater discharges from construction site activities. When the construction activity is completed and all disturbed areas are stabilized, the responsible party must submit a Notice of Termination in order to end coverage under the General Permit. Human Skeletal Remains  Under the Human Skeletal Remains Protection Act, any person who discovers human  Protection Act  skeletal remains shall promptly notify the coroner. It is unlawful for any person, either by  20 ILCS 3440  himself or through an agent, to knowingly disturb human skeletal remains, grave  markers, or grave artifacts in unregistered graves protected by this Act unless such  17 IAC 4170  person obtains a permit issued by the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency.  Table 5-1. Relevant Regulatory and Permit Requirements for the Proposed Project Statute, Description Regulation, Order Hydrostatic Test Water Discharge Permit NPDES General Permit 35 IAC Subtitle C, Chapter 1 This permit would be obtained from the IEPA, Division of Water Pollution Control under the NPDES Program. This permit would regulate hydrostatic test water discharge and construction dewatering to waters of the state. No trench dewater permit would be required for the proposed project unless contaminated soil/water and discharge would flow to an uncontaminated source. Illinois Clean Coal  The law creates a framework for developing clean-coal power projects with CO2 capture  Portfolio Standard Law  and storage, requiring emissions from these electric generation facilities to be as clean  as natural gas generators. To qualify as a clean coal facility under this legislation, new  20 ILCS 3855  coal-fueled power plants that begin operations between 2016 and 2017, must capture  and store 70 percent of carbon emissions, and after 2017, must capture and store 90  percent of the carbon emissions the facility would otherwise emit. Facilities must also  incorporate power generating equipment that limit regulated pollutants (SO2, NOx, CO,  particulates, and mercury) from combustion of the synthetically-produced feedstock to  levels that are no higher than combined cycle, natural gas-fired plants. The law requires  electric utilities and other electric retail suppliers in Illinois to purchase up to 5 percent of  their electricity from clean coal facilities. It also entitles one initial clean coal facility with a  final air permit to 30-year purchase agreements for the sale of its output.  Illinois Department of Developed recommended pipeline construction standards to help preserve integrity of Agriculture agricultural land and reduce impacts from pipelines such as deeper burial to 5 feet under agricultural areas with tile drains. Illinois Elevator Safety  The Illinois Elevator Safety Rules assures that conveyances are correctly and safely  Rules  installed and operated within the state by regulating the installation, construction,  operation, inspection, testing, maintenance, alteration, and repair of elevators,  41 IAC 1000  dumbwaiters, escalators, moving sidewalks, platform lifts, stairway chairlifts, and  automated people movers, and by licensing personnel and businesses that work on  these conveyances. The project would install an elevator.  Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act 20 ILCS 3305 This Act set up the Illinois Emergency Management Agency and procedures for planning and handling natural disasters and man-made emergencies. Title 29: Emergency Services, Disasters, and Civil Defense specifies the agency’s work related to emergency planning, incident reporting for releases of extremely hazardous or hazardous chemicals above specified reportable quantities. This agency maintains information on radon in the state. Illinois Emergency  Provides for state implementation of federal statues related to reporting of hazardous  Planning and Right to  chemicals stored onsite and notification requirements if a release occurs to offsite areas.  Know Act  430 ILCS 100  Illinois Endangered This Act requires a consultation process be undertaken with the IDNR to determine the Species Act potential impact of a facility on state threatened, endangered, or special concern species. Such consultation is underway for the project. This documentation will be 17 IAC 1075 included in the Final EIS. Illinois Environmental  Supplements and strengthens existing criminal sanctions regarding environmental  Protection Act  damage by enacting specific penalties for injury to public health and the environment.  Establishes a unified, state-wide program supplemented by private remedies to restore,  415 ILCS 5  protect, and enhance the quality of the environment. Assures that adverse effects upon  the environment are fully considered and borne by those who cause them.  Table 5-1. Relevant Regulatory and Permit Requirements for the Proposed Project Statute, Description Regulation, Order Illinois Executive Order Illinois State EO issued (October 2006) to initiate a long-term strategy by the state to 2006-11 combat global climate change, and build on the steps the state has already taken to reduce greenhouse emissions. The Order created the Illinois Climate Change Advisory Group (ICCAG) to consider a full range of policies and strategies to reduce GHGs in Illinois and make recommendations to the Governor (IEPA 2011). Illinois Farmland Preservation Act 8 IAC 700  Illinois Department of Agriculture policy to promote the protection of Illinois farmland from unnecessary conversion and degradation.  Illinois Gas Pipeline Establishes minimum safety standards for the transportation of gas and for the pipeline Safety Act facilities. Applies to the design, installation, inspection, testing, construction, extension, 220 ILCS 20 operation, replacement, and maintenance of pipeline facilities. Illinois Historic  Consultation with the Illinois SHPO is required if historic properties could be located  Resources Preservation  within the project area. Such consultation is underway; DOE, the Alliance, and the  Act  Illinois SHPO are parties to a Programmatic Agreement that covers such activities (see  20 ILCS 3420  Appendix B, Cultural Resources Consultation [B3]).  Illinois Interagency Wetland Policy Act 20 ILCS 830 Establishes a state goal that there be “no overall net loss of the state's existing wetland acres or their functional values due to state supported activities." To accomplish this goal, the Act established a review process for all projects being pursued by a state agency or being accomplished with state funds that have the potential to adversely affect a wetland. If it is determined an impact is going to occur, the entity requesting approval must prepare a compensation plan that details how it will compensate for the impact. All compensation plans must be approved by IDNR. Interconnection  If an interconnection agreement is required with an owner of a transmission system,  Agreement  approval by the Illinois Commerce Commission may be required.  Permit for Groundwater The Illinois Department of Public Health, Environmental Health Division and local health Monitoring Wells departments review water well installation plans, issue permits for new well construction, and inspect wells. 77 IAC 920 Potable Water Supply Connection Permits 35 IAC 174 IEPA Division of Public Water Supplies, Construction Permit IEPA Division of Public Water Supplies, Permit Section, Operating Permit, IL532-0140 PWS 037  A construction permit would be required to connect to a public potable water supply. Any entity obtaining a construction permit must also obtain an operating permit prior to being placed in service. There is an existing connection from the Meredosia Energy Center to the village of Meredosia water supply. This would continue to be used for the FutureGen 2.0 Project. However, this would not require a new permit since the connection already exists. A permit could be required for the proposed educational facilities.  Sound Emissions Standards and Limitations for Property-Line Noise-Sources 35 IAC 901 Includes classifications of land according to use, which are applied to noise emissions regulations. The Code categorizes land use into Land Class A, B, and C depending on type (i.e., developed, agricultural, vegetated, etc.). Illinois regulations list the maximum noise limits that different classifications of land use can experience. The regulations identify un-weighted (decibel) permissible sound levels during day and nighttimes for sound emanating from a Class C land (e.g., industrial) to a receiving Class A land (e.g., residential) and are presented in Table 3.14-4. Table 5-1.

The public scoping period began on May 23, 2011, when DOE issued a Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare an EIS in the Federal Register, under Docket ID No. FR Doc. 2010–12632 (76 FR 29728). As part of the NOI, comments and suggestions were requested to be received within the 30-day scoping period and no later than June 22, 2011. Public scoping meetings were held June 7, 8, and 9, 2011 in Taylorville, Tuscola, and Jacksonville, Illinois, respectively. Under the FutureGen 2.0 Project (the “project”), DOE proposes to provide financial assistance (approximately $1 billion) through separate Cooperative Agreements with Ameren Energy Resources (Ameren) and the FutureGen Alliance (the Alliance) to support the implementation of project components, which if successful would advance the goals of the project. The potential issues identified from comments received during the public scoping period are summarized in Section 4. DOE took these issues into consideration when defining the scope and areas of emphasis (or focus) of this EIS for the FutureGen 2.0 Project. 2 PUBLIC SCOPING ACTIVITIES The NOI (Attachment A) initiated the public scoping period where members of the public (including federal, state, and local agencies; affected federally-recognized Indian tribes; and other interested stakeholders) were invited to comment on the proposed scope and content of the EIS. DOE mailed invitation letters to potentially interested parties the week of May 23, 2011, to announce the dates and locations of the public scoping meetings. The NOI stated that the public scoping meetings would be held at the following locations:  June 7, 2011 at Taylorville High School, Taylorville, Illinois  June 8, 2011 at Ironhorse Golf Club, Tuscola, Illinois  June 9, 2011 at the Elks Lodge, Jacksonville, Illinois The meeting locations were selected to provide appropriate geographic coverage and reasonable accessibility for stakeholders potentially affected by actions associated with the proposed oxy-combustion facility at the Meredosia Power Station site and the proposed CO2 pipelines, injection sites, geologic storage areas, and associated facilities.  DOE also published announcements in the following local newspapers on the dates indicated:   Journal-Courier, Jacksonville; May 22, 29; June 1, 5  State Journal-Register; Springfield; May 22; June 5  Breeze-Courier; Taylorville; May 23; June 3, 5  Herald & Review; Decatur; June 1, 5  Daily Union; Shelbyville; May 31; June 4  News-Progress; Sullivan; May 25; June 1  Tri-County Journal; Tuscola; May 26; June 2  Tuscola Journal; Tuscola; May 25; June 1  Record-Herald; Arcola; May 26; June 2  Journal-Gazette / Times-Courier; Mattoon / Charleston; June 1, 4 Additionally, announcement letters and project information were provided to local libraries. Letters accompanying the project information requested that the libraries post the announcement letters in a public viewing area until June 30, 2011. The announcement letters publicized the scoping meeting dates and locations and the availability of project information at the library. Project information included the NOI and two 8 ½” x 11” printouts of the DOE posters that were available during the scoping meetings (NEPA timeline and Project Overview Map). The project information packages were sent to the following libraries:  M-C River Valley Public Library District (Meredosia, IL)  Jacksonville Public Library  Taylorville Public Library  Tuscola Public Library  Arcola Public Library Each scoping meeting began with an informal session from 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. During this time, attendees were able to view project-related posters, handouts, and a video on NETL’s Carbon Sequestration Program (March 2007); and to ask questions of DOE, Ameren, and Alliance representatives. Sign-in sheets, comment forms and a box to submit comments were also provided at the sign-in table. A total of 160 attendees signed the meeting attendance lists cumulatively among all three meetings (93 in Jacksonville, 36 in Taylorville, and 31 in Tuscola). Lists of signed-in attendees for each of the meetings are provided in Appendix E. The formal scoping meeting at each location began at 7:00 p.m. and included presentations by DOE, Ameren, and the Alliance, followed by an opportunity for verbal comments by the public. The presentations and comments were transcribed by a court reporter for each meeting. Transcripts of the meetings and slides for the DOE, Ameren, and the Alliance presentations are available at: http://www.netl.doe.gov/publications/others/nepa/index.html. 3 PUBLIC SCOPING COMMENTORS A total of 21 individuals provided verbal comments cumulatively among all three meetings (15 in Jacksonville, 5 in Taylorville, and 1 in Tuscola) (Table 1). During the comment period, DOE accepted comments by telephone, facsimile, U.S. mail, and electronic mail. A total of 26 respondents submitted comment letters to DOE during the scoping period (Table 2).  Table 1. Commentors During the Scoping Meetings Table 1.

Other negative views not directly related to a specific environmental resource included: issues with the experimental nature of the project; a lack of belief that economic benefits would occur; the use of public funds for a private endeavor; belief that project funding should go toward renewable and alternative energy technologies aside from coal; and potential increased electricity costs for consumers. In terms of environmental resource-specific concerns, the majority of comments were related to Socioeconomics and carbon capture and storage (CCS), with a general belief that CCS ultimately contaminates the land instead of the air. The majority of natural resource topics were addressed in terms of impacts to farmlands; issues strictly related to natural resources tended to be general in nature (e.g., potential impacts to surface waters should be addressed). Additionally, two petitions in opposition of the project, signed by a total of about 340 residents and landowners in Morgan County, and one petition signed by 55 residents and landowners in Douglas County, were submitted to DOE.  Of the commentors that responded favorably, many commented positively on the project primarily due to economic and job creation benefits for the community, as well as benefits in terms of self-sufficient National energy production.  Table 3 provides a summary of the scoping comments that were received, organized by comment category or applicable resource area. DOE/EIS-0460 FUTUREGEN 2.0 PROJECT  PUBLIC SCOPING REPORT Table 3. Public Scoping Comment Summary Comment Category or Resource Area  Comment Summary  Opposition to the Project  General opposition to the project due to generally unfavorable views, the experimental nature of the project; general concerns that the Alliance cannot be trusted when they say CCS would stop global warming because it is an alliance of energy companies; potential adverse consequences to farmers and high quality farmland; general adverse environmental impacts including environmental contamination and seismic issues; a lack of belief that economic benefits would occur; the use of public funds; a lack of CCS regulations and questions of liability if a CO2 leak occurred; belief that project funding should go toward renewable and alternative energy technologies aside from coal; belief that CCS contaminates the land instead of the air; project costs; and a belief that local individuals that support the project do not live near an injection site and would not be personally affected.  Support for the Project  General support for the project due to economic benefits including job creation; a belief that the area could become a pioneer in energy technology; an increased need for National energy self-sufficiency; local educational opportunities; and that it represents a cleaner use of Illinois coal.  Purpose and Need  States that the project is federally funded, but if the industry thought it was profitable they would invest in it by themselves. General opposition to the project as it would be wasteful federal spending.  Purpose and Need  States that climate change impacts are occurring now, so why invest tax dollars in an established industry instead of other leading-edge energy technologies. Prefers that DOE fund alternative energy projects other than coal. States that investing in leading or cutting-edge technology would also create jobs.  Purpose and Need  Asks if additional electricity production is needed and if oxy-combustion is a cost-competitive electricity generation technology.  Alternatives  States that project officials have stated that additional injection sites may be required. Generally asks if additional storage sites are possible or expansion of the existing site.  Alternatives  Feels that the storage area should be at the plant site and not in Douglas County and that the risks are too high with a small amount of benefit.  Alternatives  Asks how the decision between the three alternative injection sites will be made. Asks if the sequestration site could be somewhere else, e.g., closer to the plant.  Alternatives  States that project alternatives should include funding energy efficiency and renewable energy projects.  5 DOE/EIS-0460 FUTUREGEN 2.0 PROJECT  PUBLIC SCOPING REPORT Table 3. Public Scoping Comment Summary Comment Category or Resource Area  Comment Summary  Alternatives  States that saline formations exist across the country and asks why not develop the project in a less inhabited area with less risk to farmland.  Economics; Energy Use  Asks that the complete costs of the project in terms of energy use (e.g., coal hauling) be included; asks that a complete life cycle cost analysis of the project be performed.  Regulation  States that new state legislation must be enacted for the project but nobody has explained what that legislation would be; asks if there is not new legislation if the project would go forward.   Liability Insurance  States that a study was done to determine if the FutureGen 2.0 Project could obtain a major industrial liability insurance policy and it was determined that the project could not.  Coal Mining  Generally asks that impacts of coal mining be addressed with respect to water resources, biological resources, and farmland.  Coal Mining  States that coal mining causes adverse impacts to farming due to land subsidence and states that increased mining for the project would be detrimental to agricultural production.  Coal Mining  General environmental and safety concerns about coal mining.  Coal Mining  States that coal mining causes adverse impacts to agricultural land.  Coal Mining  States coal mining activities cause contamination of streams and groundwater.  Coal Mining  States waste streams at coal mine sites should be included.  Air Quality  Asks that the DEIS analyze emissions, especially in terms of how the project compares to a conventional coal burning plant.  Air Quality  Asks that "uncertain air emissions" be explained and unexpected shutdowns/outages and restarts be explained.  Air Quality  States that all waste streams should be detailed in the DEIS including disposal sites.  6 DOE/EIS-0460 FUTUREGEN 2.0 PROJECT  PUBLIC SCOPING REPORT Table 3. Public Scoping Comment Summary Comment Category or Resource Area  Comment Summary  Biological  Quotes original FutureGen EIS text on subsurface microbes (Section 3.2.2.5) and asks if these are the building blocks of the planet.  Biological  Asked if transporting warm CO2 could cause insects and molds in the ground to proliferate, which would normally freeze during winter.  Biological  States concern that using the Morgan County injection site could cause pollution by brine groundwater, CO2, carbolic acid, etc. to a nearby stream that drains to the Illinois River (Indian Creek) and adverse impacts to fish, animals, plants, groundwater, and farm fields along the creek would result.  Climate and Greenhouse Gases  Asks that the DEIS analyze emissions, especially in terms of how the project compares to a conventional coal burning plant.  Community Services  States that local services in the Alexander area do not have the infrastructure or money to be able to respond to potential accidents at the Morgan County site or pipeline.  Geology  Stated concern that the Alliance would perform a study of how much subsurface pore space would be required to support the project and asks that an independent 3rd party perform the study.  Geology  Quotes the original FutureGen EIS (Section 3.2.1) stating that there is uncertainty with respect to fate and movement of injected CO2. States that people living in the area of injection do not want to be affected by a learning experience.  Geology  Generally asks that environmental impacts of a CO2 release be analyzed in the DEIS. Address methods for testing for leaks and procedures to stop CO2 release if a leak occurred, including remediation.  Geology  States that unless multiple characterization wells are drilled and tested it cannot be known if the subsurface can contain the injected CO2.  Geology  States that the earth changes (tectonic plates shift and move) and only looking at storage for 30, 50, or even hundreds of years may not be permanent storage.  Geology  States that a number of requirements for the depth to the Mt. Simon formation have been made public (for injection site requirements) and questions whether the depth is adequate at the preferred site.  Geology  Asks that the DEIS analyze seismic impacts of sequestration; consider proximity to New Madrid Fault. States that any seismic activity caused by the project could cause structural damage to buildings in the area.  7 DOE/EIS-0460 FUTUREGEN 2.0 PROJECT  PUBLIC SCOPING REPORT Table 3. Public Scoping Comment Summary Comment Category or Resource Area  Comment Summary  Geology  Asks for an explanation on why the CO2 will not come out of the ground. Asks that the risks and environmental impacts of any other gases coming to the surface (e.g., methane) be defined.  Geology  States that the Morgan County site is not a good injection location because the Mt. Simon formation is more porous and not as deep there as in other locations and shale layers are discontinuous, which means a higher risk for the CO2 to migrate. States that injecting the CO2 will ultimately force CO2, brine groundwater, or a combination of the two to either travel a large distance laterally or migrate to the surface.  Geology  Stated that the Morgan County injection Site is made up of sandstone and sits at a slight angle, which makes carbon injection problematic.  Geology  Generally questions CCS as being experimental; i.e., would the CO2 stay stored as expected.  Geology  States that a study concluded that more pore space is required than originally thought to store CO2. Questions the size of FutureGen 2.0's storage site and states that the Alliance's CEO has stated that the sequestration site may need to be expanded to 2,500 or as much as 10,000 acres.  Geology  States that the monitoring wells should be over a larger area than 2,500 acres.  Geology  States that remediating contamination in the ground is a long and costly proposition.  Geology  Questions whether CCS and associated CO2 injection pressures, would cause adverse consequences to groundwater, surface water, and the land surface, and how large of a pore space would really be required to store the volume of CO2 anticipated.  Geology  Generally asks that environmental impacts of a CO2 release be analyzed in the DEIS. Address methods for testing for leaks and procedures to stop CO2 release if a leak occurred, including remediation.  Geology  Asks if an odorant (e.g., methanethiol) could be added to CO2 to help detect CO2 leaks.  Geology  States that the Alliance has stated that if a CO2 leak occurred the project would be shut down, but when the Alliance was asked what would happen to the already stored CO2 that was leaking, the Alliance had no answer. Asks if the stored CO2 would just keep migrating to the surface.  8 DOE/EIS-0460 FUTUREGEN 2.0 PROJECT  PUBLIC SCOPING REPORT Table 3. Public Scoping Comment Summary Comment Category or Resource Area  Comment Summary  Groundwater  States concern that using the Morgan County injection site could cause pollution by brine groundwater, CO2, carbolic acid, etc. to a nearby stream that drains to the Illinois River (Indian Creek) and adverse impacts to fish, animals, plants, groundwater, and farm fields along the creek would result.  Land Use  Asks if the project secured mineral rights for the injection area what would happen to neighboring land values and permitted land uses.  Materials and Waste Management  States that when burning coal some waste can be captured, but other wastes are not (e.g., mercury).  Materials and Waste Management  States that coal ash disposal impacts should be considered.  Materials and Waste Management  States that all waste streams should be detailed in the DEIS including disposal sites.  Materials and Waste Management  States that plant-generated valuable byproduct disposition and revenues should be addressed in the DEIS, including sulfur and nitrogen.  Materials and Waste Management  Asks what will happen to nitrogen byproducts in the process; questions whether an ammonia processing plant would be built. Questions how sulfur byproducts will be dealt with and whether a sulfuric acid processing plant will be built.  Physiography and Soils  States concern that using the Morgan County injection site could cause pollution by brine groundwater, CO2, carbolic acid, etc. to a nearby stream that drains to the Illinois River (Indian Creek) and adverse impacts to fish, animals, plants, groundwater, and farm fields along the creek would result.  Physiography and Soils  States that Morgan County farmland is one of the most productive in the world, so it should not be risked for a dangerous experiment.  Public Health and Safety  Asks if hydrogen sulfide will be transported with the CO2, which is toxic.  Public Health and Safety  States that CO2 is hazardous to public health and asks what would happen if CO2 is released at injection site or along pipeline. Generally questions how hazardous the CO2 product is.  Public Health and Safety  States that the project is supposed to last 30 years; questions who will look after the safety of people in 50, 100, or 1000 years.  9 DOE/EIS-0460 FUTUREGEN 2.0 PROJECT  PUBLIC SCOPING REPORT Table 3. Public Scoping Comment Summary Comment Category or Resource Area  Comment Summary  Public Health and Safety  States concern about impacts of a CO2 release to public safety and asks what precautions would be taken to evacuate areas if a leak occurred.  Public Health and Safety  States that local services in the Alexander area do not have the infrastructure or money to be able to respond to potential accidents at the Morgan County site or along the pipeline.  Public Health and Safety  States that chemicals are used in CO2 sequestration process, so there are dangers at plant site as well as injection site.  Socioeconomics  Questions the estimated number of employees for construction and operation, i.e., believes they are higher than would actually be used or needed.  Socioeconomics  Asked if parts or percentages of the project could be sold to foreign investors and questioned whether taxpayers would want to fund a project that could be sold to foreign investors.  Socioeconomics  Asks that impacts be addressed to farmers living along the CO2 pipeline in terms of being disrupting or displaced.  Socioeconomics  Asks how local farmers would be compensated if negative impacts arose from the project.  Socioeconomics  States that there is a difference between the required construction workforce in the original FutureGen EIS vs. what has been reported for FutureGen 2.0 and asks that the difference be explained. Also asks that the value of Prime Farmland be discussed in terms of impacts to farmers if detrimental environmental impacts result.  Socioeconomics  Submitted a document describing impacts to land values due to environmental contamination and associated public stigma.  Socioeconomics  States concern about impacts to property values and the inability to build within a certain distance of the pipeline.  Socioeconomics  Questions whether the project would actually end up investing in Morgan County, e.g., there are not any companies in Morgan County that produce the parts needed to retrofit the power plant.  Socioeconomics  Asks if the project secured mineral rights for the injection area what would happen to neighboring land values and permitted land uses.  Socioeconomics  Asks if any state or county tax abatements or incentives or other incentives have been offered with respect to the Morgan County site.  10 DOE/EIS-0460 FUTUREGEN 2.0 PROJECT  PUBLIC SCOPING REPORT Table 3. Public Scoping Comment Summary Comment Category or Resource Area  Comment Summary  Socioeconomics  Generally asks if energy costs for consumers would be raised as a result of the project.  Socioeconomics  Questions whether the project would create jobs for local residents.  Surface Water  States concern that using the Morgan County injection site could cause pollution by brine groundwater, CO2, carbolic acid, etc. to a nearby stream that drains to the Illinois River (Indian Creek) and adverse impacts to fish, animals, plants, groundwater, and farm fields along the creek would result.  Surface Water  Asks that water resources be studied in depth.

Gamble Chief Miami Tribe of Oklahoma P.O. Box 1326 Miami, OK 74355   SUBJECT:  FutureGen 2.0 Program Environmental Impact Statement; Morgan, Christian, and Douglas Counties, Illinois (DOE/EIS-0460)  Dear Mr. Gamble:  The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) issued a Notice of Intent on May 23, 2011 to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the proposed action of providing approximately $1 billion in Federal funding (most of it appropriated by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act) for the FutureGen 2.0 program.  As described in the notice, the FutureGen 2.0 program consists of an Oxy-Combustion Large Scale Test component undertaken by Ameren Energy Resources (Ameren) and a Pipeline and CO2 Storage Reservoir component undertaken by the FutureGen Alliance (Alliance).  Additional information is now available on the extent of lands that may be affected by the proposed action.  The purpose of this correspondence is to provide you with the best available project information and to determine whether your tribe has an interest in the lands potentially affected and wishes to engage in government-to-government consultations in accordance with Executive Order 13175, Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments, and DOE’s American Indian and Alaskan Native Policy.    For the Oxy-Combustion Large Scale Test, Ameren and its team would construct and operate an approximately 200-megawatt electricity (MWe) gross output advanced oxy-combustion system to repower an existing steam turbine generator (Unit 4) at Ameren’s Meredosia Power Station in west central Illinois.  The process would be designed to capture approximately 1.3 million metric tons of CO2 per year from the oxy-combustion system and is targeted to achieve a CO2 capture rate exceeding 90 percent.  Information about the project component is available at Ameren’s website: www.ameren.com/CommunityMembers/Environment/Pages/FutureGenProject.aspx.  In addition, there is the potential that natural gas would be required as fuel for the auxiliary boiler, which may result in a new natural gas pipeline. The pipeline would be constructed within a 70-foot wide right-of-way (ROW) and located within a permanent 20-foot wide easement.  Attachment 1 is an illustration of the Meredosia Power Station site showing areas where land would be disturbed both for temporary features and staging areas during construction and for permanent structures to support operations.  Attachment 2 is an illustration of potential routes for the natural gas pipeline.  For the Pipeline and CO2 Storage Reservoir, the Alliance would design, construct, and operate a transmission pipeline and geologic injection and storage facility.  The CO2 captured at Ameren’s facility would be transported via the pipeline to the selected storage site where it would be injected through deep wells into the Mount Simon sandstone formation, which is one of the Illinois Basin’s major deep saline geologic formations.  The Alliance has identified its preferred sequestration site in Morgan County, Illinois, and has identified two alternative sites, one in Christian County, Illinois and one in Douglas page 2 3610 Collins Ferry Road, P.O. Box 880, Morgantown, WV  26507               County, Illinois.  Information about this project component is available at the Alliance’s website: www.futuregenalliance.org.  Attachment 3 is an illustration showing the location of the Meredosia Power Station, the preferred and alternative CO2 storage sites, and the alternative 4-mile wide corridors in which the CO2 transmission pipeline may be constructed depending upon the storage site selected.  Ultimately, the pipeline would be constructed in a single corridor along one of the routes to a single storage site in Morgan County, Christian County, or Douglas County, respectively 30, 75 or 125 miles from the Meredosia Power Station.  The construction and permanent ROWs would be 80 feet and 50 feet in width, respectively. A 100-foot ROW may be needed for special requirements, such as pipe transportation in wooded hilly terrain or where side slope construction may be unavoidable.  The pipeline would be buried at least four feet underground.  Additional depth of cover would be provided for crossings, drain ditches, and irrigation tiles. For agricultural land, the pipeline would be buried at least five feet deep in accordance with Illinois Department of Agriculture Pipeline Construction Standards and Policies.   Two injection wells, 25 monitoring wells, and miscellaneous support facilities would be constructed at the Morgan County CO2 storage site.  Although currently unknown at this time, the final location of injection wells would be based on results from ongoing characterization studies.  The Alliance does not plan to identify the location of injection wells at the Christian or Douglas County sites unless concerns arise around the technical, legal, or public acceptability of the preferred Morgan County site.  Instead, the Alliance has identified 25-square mile (16,000-acre) study areas in Christian and Douglas counties for injection sites. It is expected that up to approximately 25 acres would be disturbed within the storage site study areas.   We are very interested in receiving your comments on the proposed action and accommodating your wishes for further consultation and coordination.  Your active participation in this ongoing consultation process will be facilitated if we receive a written response on behalf of your tribal government.  If you require any additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me via (cliff.whyte@netl.doe.gov) or phone (304-285-2098).

A 100-foot ROW may be needed for special requirements, such as pipe transportation in wooded hilly terrain or where side slope construction may be unavoidable.  The pipeline would be buried at least four feet underground.  Additional depth of cover would be provided for crossings, drain ditches, and irrigation tiles. For agricultural land, the pipeline would be buried at least five feet deep in accordance with Illinois Department of Agriculture Pipeline Construction Standards and Policies.   Two injection wells, 25 monitoring wells, and miscellaneous support facilities would be constructed at the Morgan County CO2 storage site.  Although currently unknown at this time, the final location of injection wells would be based on results from ongoing characterization studies.  The Alliance does not plan to identify the location of injection wells at the Christian or Douglas County sites unless concerns arise around the technical, legal, or public acceptability of the preferred Morgan County site.  Instead, the Alliance has identified 25-square mile (16,000-acre) study areas in Christian and Douglas counties for injection sites. It is expected that up to approximately 25 acres would be disturbed within the storage site study areas.   We are very interested in receiving your comments on the proposed action and accommodating your wishes for further consultation and coordination.  Your active participation in this ongoing consultation process will be facilitated if we receive a written response on behalf of your tribal government.

Box 189 Miami, OK 74354   SUBJECT:  FutureGen 2.0 Program Environmental Impact Statement; Morgan, Christian, and Douglas Counties, Illinois (DOE/EIS-0460)  Dear Mr. Sparkman:  The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) issued a Notice of Intent on May 23, 2011 to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the proposed action of providing approximately $1 billion in Federal funding (most of it appropriated by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act) for the FutureGen 2.0 program.  As described in the notice, the FutureGen 2.0 program consists of an Oxy-Combustion Large Scale Test component undertaken by Ameren Energy Resources (Ameren) and a Pipeline and CO2 Storage Reservoir component undertaken by the FutureGen Alliance (Alliance).  Additional information is now available on the extent of lands that may be affected by the proposed action.  The purpose of this correspondence is to provide you with the best available project information and to determine whether your tribe has an interest in the lands potentially affected and wishes to engage in government-to-government consultations in accordance with Executive Order 13175, Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments, and DOE’s American Indian and Alaskan Native Policy.    For the Oxy-Combustion Large Scale Test, Ameren and its team would construct and operate an approximately 200-megawatt electricity (MWe) gross output advanced oxy-combustion system to repower an existing steam turbine generator (Unit 4) at Ameren’s Meredosia Power Station in west central Illinois.  The process would be designed to capture approximately 1.3 million metric tons of CO2 per year from the oxy-combustion system and is targeted to achieve a CO2 capture rate exceeding 90 percent.  Information about the project component is available at Ameren’s website: www.ameren.com/CommunityMembers/Environment/Pages/FutureGenProject.aspx.  In addition, there is the potential that natural gas would be required as fuel for the auxiliary boiler, which may result in a new natural gas pipeline. The pipeline would be constructed within a 70-foot wide right-of-way (ROW) and located within a permanent 20-foot wide easement.  Attachment 1 is an illustration of the Meredosia Power Station site showing areas where land would be disturbed both for temporary features and staging areas during construction and for permanent structures to support operations.  Attachment 2 is an illustration of potential routes for the natural gas pipeline.  For the Pipeline and CO2 Storage Reservoir, the Alliance would design, construct, and operate a transmission pipeline and geologic injection and storage facility.  The CO2 captured at Ameren’s facility would be transported via the pipeline to the selected storage site where it would be injected through deep wells into the Mount Simon sandstone formation, which is one of the Illinois Basin’s major deep saline geologic formations.  The Alliance has identified its preferred sequestration site in Morgan County, Illinois, and has identified two alternative sites, one in Christian County, Illinois and one in Douglas page 2 3610 Collins Ferry Road, P.O. Box 880, Morgantown, WV  26507               County, Illinois.  Information about this project component is available at the Alliance’s website: www.futuregenalliance.org.  Attachment 3 is an illustration showing the location of the Meredosia Power Station, the preferred and alternative CO2 storage sites, and the alternative 4-mile wide corridors in which the CO2 transmission pipeline may be constructed depending upon the storage site selected.

The pipeline would be buried at least four feet underground.  Additional depth of cover would be provided for crossings, drain ditches, and irrigation tiles. For agricultural land, the pipeline would be buried at least five feet deep in accordance with Illinois Department of Agriculture Pipeline Construction Standards and Policies.   Two injection wells, 25 monitoring wells, and miscellaneous support facilities would be constructed at the Morgan County CO2 storage site.  Although currently unknown at this time, the final location of injection wells would be based on results from ongoing characterization studies.  The Alliance does not plan to identify the location of injection wells at the Christian or Douglas County sites unless concerns arise around the technical, legal, or public acceptability of the preferred Morgan County site.  Instead, the Alliance has identified 25-square mile (16,000-acre) study areas in Christian and Douglas counties for injection sites. It is expected that up to approximately 25 acres would be disturbed within the storage site study areas.   We are very interested in receiving your comments on the proposed action and accommodating your wishes for further consultation and coordination.

Box 667 W9814 Airport Road Black River Falls, WI 54615   SUBJECT:  FutureGen 2.0 Program Environmental Impact Statement; Morgan, Christian, and Douglas Counties, Illinois (DOE/EIS-0460)  Dear Mr. Cleveland:  In a letter dated May 24, 2011, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) notified your tribal government of the department’s intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the proposed action of providing approximately $1 billion in Federal funding (most of it appropriated by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act) for the FutureGen 2.0 program.  As described in that letter, the FutureGen 2.0 program consists of an Oxy-Combustion Large Scale Test component undertaken by Ameren Energy Resources (Ameren) and a Pipeline and CO2 Storage Reservoir component undertaken by the FutureGen Alliance (Alliance).  Additional information is now available on the extent of lands that may be affected by the proposed action.  The purpose of this correspondence is to provide you with the best available project information and to determine whether your tribe has an interest in the lands potentially affected and wishes to engage in government-to-government consultations in accordance with Executive Order 13175, Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments, and DOE’s American Indian and Alaskan Native Policy.    For the Oxy-Combustion Large Scale Test, Ameren and its team would construct and operate an approximately 200-megawatt electricity (MWe) gross output advanced oxy-combustion system to repower an existing steam turbine generator (Unit 4) at Ameren’s Meredosia Power Station in west central Illinois.  The process would be designed to capture approximately 1.3 million metric tons of CO2 per year from the oxy-combustion system and is targeted to achieve a CO2 capture rate exceeding 90 percent.  Information about the project component is available at Ameren’s website: www.ameren.com/CommunityMembers/Environment/Pages/FutureGenProject.aspx.  In addition, there is the potential that natural gas would be required as fuel for the auxiliary boiler, which may result in a new natural gas pipeline. The pipeline would be constructed within a 70-foot wide right-of-way (ROW) and located within a permanent 20-foot wide easement.  Attachment 1 is an illustration of the Meredosia Power Station site showing areas where land would be disturbed both for temporary features and staging areas during construction and for permanent structures to support operations.  Attachment 2 is an illustration of potential routes for the natural gas pipeline.  For the Pipeline and CO2 Storage Reservoir, the Alliance would design, construct, and operate a transmission pipeline and geologic injection and storage facility.  The CO2 captured at Ameren’s facility would be transported via the pipeline to the selected storage site where it would be injected through deep wells into the Mount Simon sandstone formation, which is one of the Illinois Basin’s major deep saline page 2 3610 Collins Ferry Road, P.O. Box 880, Morgantown, WV  26507               geologic formations.  The Alliance has identified its preferred sequestration site in Morgan County, Illinois, and has identified two alternative sites, one in Christian County, Illinois and one in Douglas County, Illinois.  Information about this project component is available at the Alliance’s website: www.futuregenalliance.org.  Attachment 3 is an illustration showing the location of the Meredosia Power Station, the preferred and alternative CO2 storage sites, and the alternative 4-mile wide corridors in which the CO2 transmission pipeline may be constructed depending upon the storage site selected.  Ultimately, the pipeline would be constructed in a single corridor along one of the routes to a single storage site in Morgan County, Christian County, or Douglas County, respectively 30, 75 or 125 miles from the Meredosia Power Station.

Wilson, MI 49896-9728   SUBJECT:  FutureGen 2.0 Program Environmental Impact Statement; Morgan, Christian, and Douglas Counties, Illinois (DOE/EIS-0460)  Dear Mr. Meshigaud:  In a letter dated May 24, 2011, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) notified your tribal government of the department’s intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the proposed action of providing approximately $1 billion in Federal funding (most of it appropriated by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act) for the FutureGen 2.0 program.  As described in that letter, the FutureGen 2.0 program consists of an Oxy-Combustion Large Scale Test component undertaken by Ameren Energy Resources (Ameren) and a Pipeline and CO2 Storage Reservoir component undertaken by the FutureGen Alliance (Alliance).  Additional information is now available on the extent of lands that may be affected by the proposed action.  The purpose of this correspondence is to provide you with the best available project information and to determine whether your tribe has an interest in the lands potentially affected and wishes to engage in government-to-government consultations in accordance with Executive Order 13175, Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments, and DOE’s American Indian and Alaskan Native Policy.    For the Oxy-Combustion Large Scale Test, Ameren and its team would construct and operate an approximately 200-megawatt electricity (MWe) gross output advanced oxy-combustion system to repower an existing steam turbine generator (Unit 4) at Ameren’s Meredosia Power Station in west central Illinois.  The process would be designed to capture approximately 1.3 million metric tons of CO2 per year from the oxy-combustion system and is targeted to achieve a CO2 capture rate exceeding 90 percent.  Information about the project component is available at Ameren’s website: www.ameren.com/CommunityMembers/Environment/Pages/FutureGenProject.aspx.  In addition, there is the potential that natural gas would be required as fuel for the auxiliary boiler, which may result in a new natural gas pipeline. The pipeline would be constructed within a 70-foot wide right-of-way (ROW) and located within a permanent 20-foot wide easement.  Attachment 1 is an illustration of the Meredosia Power Station site showing areas where land would be disturbed both for temporary features and staging areas during construction and for permanent structures to support operations.  Attachment 2 is an illustration of potential routes for the natural gas pipeline.  For the Pipeline and CO2 Storage Reservoir, the Alliance would design, construct, and operate a transmission pipeline and geologic injection and storage facility.  The CO2 captured at Ameren’s facility would be transported via the pipeline to the selected storage site where it would be injected through deep wells into the Mount Simon sandstone formation, which is one of the Illinois Basin’s major deep saline geologic formations.  The Alliance has identified its preferred sequestration site in Morgan County, page 2 3610 Collins Ferry Road, P.O. Box 880, Morgantown, WV  26507               Illinois, and has identified two alternative sites, one in Christian County, Illinois and one in Douglas County, Illinois.  Information about this project component is available at the Alliance’s website: www.futuregenalliance.org.  Attachment 3 is an illustration showing the location of the Meredosia Power Station, the preferred and alternative CO2 storage sites, and the alternative 4-mile wide corridors in which the CO2 transmission pipeline may be constructed depending upon the storage site selected.  Ultimately, the pipeline would be constructed in a single corridor along one of the routes to a single storage site in Morgan County, Christian County, or Douglas County, respectively 30, 75 or 125 miles from the Meredosia Power Station.  The construction and permanent ROWs would be 80 feet and 50 feet in width, respectively. A 100-foot ROW may be needed for special requirements, such as pipe transportation in wooded hilly terrain or where side slope construction may be unavoidable.  The pipeline would be buried at least four feet underground.  Additional depth of cover would be provided for crossings, drain ditches, and irrigation tiles.

As described in that letter, the FutureGen 2.0 Program consists of an Oxy-Combustion Large Scale Test component undertaken by Ameren Energy Resources (Ameren) and a Pipeline and CO2 Storage Reservoir component undertaken by the FutureGen Alliance (Alliance).  Additional information is now available on the extent of lands that may be affected by the proposed action.  The purpose of this correspondence is to provide the best available project information and to initiate consultation with your office for conformance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the Endangered Species Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act.  For the Oxy-Combustion Large Scale Test, Ameren and its team would construct and operate an approximately 200-megawatt electricity (MWe) gross output advanced oxy-combustion system to repower an existing steam turbine generator (Unit 4) at Ameren’s Meredosia Power Station in west central Illinois.  The process would be designed to capture approximately 1.3 million metric tons of CO2 per year from the oxy-combustion system and is targeted to achieve a CO2 capture rate exceeding 90 percent.  Information about the project component is available at Ameren’s website: www.ameren.com/CommunityMembers/Environment/Pages/FutureGenProject.aspx.  In addition, there is the potential that natural gas would be required as fuel for the auxiliary boiler and the main boiler igniters, which, if realized, would require a new natural gas pipeline. The pipeline would be constructed within a 70-foot wide right-of-way (ROW) and located within a permanent 20-foot wide easement.  Attachment 1 is an illustration of the Meredosia Power Station site showing areas where land would be disturbed both for temporary features and staging areas during construction and for permanent structures to support operations.  Attachment 2 is an illustration of potential routes for the natural gas pipeline.  For the Pipeline and CO2 Storage Reservoir, the Alliance would design, construct, and operate a transmission pipeline and geologic injection and storage facility.  The CO2 captured at Ameren’s facility would be transported via the pipeline to the selected storage site where it would be injected through deep wells into the Mount Simon sandstone formation, which is one of the Illinois Basin’s major deep saline geologic formations.  The Alliance has identified its preferred sequestration site in Morgan County, Mr. Matt Mangan, page 2 3610 Collins Ferry Road, P.O. Box 880, Morgantown, WV  26507               Illinois, and has identified two alternative sites, one in Christian County, Illinois and one in Douglas County, Illinois.  Information about this project component is available at the Alliance’s website: www.futuregenalliance.org.  Attachment 3 is an illustration showing the location of the Meredosia Power Station, the preferred and alternative CO2 storage sites, and the alternative 4-mile wide corridors in which the CO2 transmission pipeline may be constructed depending upon the storage site selected.  Ultimately, the pipeline would be constructed in a single corridor along one of the routes to a single storage site in Morgan County, Christian County, or Douglas County, respectively 30, 75 or 125 miles from the Meredosia Power Station.  The construction and permanent ROWs would be 80 feet and 50 feet in width, respectively. A 100-foot ROW may be needed for special requirements, such as pipe transportation in wooded hilly terrain or where side slope construction may be unavoidable.  The pipeline would be buried at least four feet underground.  Additional depth of cover would be provided for crossings, drain ditches, and irrigation tiles. For agricultural land, the pipeline would be buried at least five feet deep in accordance with Illinois Department of Agriculture Pipeline Construction Standards and Policies.   Two injection wells, 25 monitoring wells, and miscellaneous support facilities would be constructed at the Morgan County CO2 storage site.  Although currently unknown at this time, the final location of injection wells would be based on results from ongoing characterization studies.

Instead, the Alliance has identified 25-square mile (16,000-acre) study areas in Christian and Douglas counties for injection sites. It is expected that up to approximately 25 acres would be disturbed within the storage site study areas.   DOE’s contractor for the EIS, Potomac-Hudson Engineering, Inc. (PHE), will support the consultations for the respective laws, and a representative from PHE will contact your office soon.  PHE will be obtaining data for inclusion in the EIS.  Please note that representatives from Ameren and the Alliance may also periodically contact your office as they continue to develop the project. We are very interested in receiving your comments on the proposed action and your assistance with the EIS.  We would appreciate your response within thirty days of the date of this letter.

Collins      Assistant Field Supervisor FEDERALLY LISTED THREATENED AND ENDANGERED SPECIES INFORMATION FOR MORGAN, CHRISTIAN,  AND DOUGLAS COUNTIES, ILLINOIS The endangered Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis) has been noted as occurring in several Illinois counties.  Potential habitat for this species occurs statewide, therefore, Indiana bats are considered to potentially occur in any area with forested habitat.  Indiana bats migrate seasonally between winter hibernacula and summer roosting habitats.  Winter hibernacula include caves and abandoned mines.  Females emerge from hibernation in late March or early April to migrate to summer roosts.  Females form nursery colonies under the loose bark of trees (dead or alive) and/or in cavities, where each female gives birth to a single young in June or early July.  A maternity colony may include from one to 100 individuals.  A single colony may utilize a number of roost trees during the summer, typically a primary roost tree and several alternates.  Some males remain in the area near the winter hibernacula during the summer months, but others disperse throughout the range of the species and roost individually or in small numbers in the same types of trees as females.  The species or size of tree does not appear to influence whether Indiana bats utilize a tree for roosting provided the appropriate bark structure is present.  However, the use of a particular tree does appear to be influenced by weather conditions, such as temperature and precipitation.   During the summer, Indiana bats frequent the corridors of small streams with well-developed riparian woods, as well as mature bottomland and upland forests.  It forages for insects along stream corridors, within the canopy of floodplain and upland forests, over clearings with early successional vegetation (old fields), along the borders of crop lands, along wooded fence rows, and over farm ponds and in pastures.  It has been shown that the foraging range for the bats varies by season, age and sex and ranges up to 81 acres (33 ha).  To avoid impacting the species, tree clearing activities should not occur during the period of April 1 to September 30.  If a proposed action occurs within a 5-mile radius of a winter hibernacula, tree clearing should be prohibited from April 1 to November 15.  If it is necessary to clear trees during this time frame, mist net surveys may be necessary to determine if Indiana bats are present.  A search for this species should be made prior to cave impacting activities. The snuffbox (Epioblasma triquetra) is proposed as endangered and is listed as occurring in the Kankakee and Embarrass Rivers, which includes Coles, Cumberland, Douglas, Kankakee, and Will Counties, Illinois. The species prefers small to medium-sized creeks and some larger rivers, in areas with a swift current. The decurrent false aster (Boltonia decurrens) is listed as threatened and is known to occur in several Illinois counties in the floodplain of the Illinois and Mississippi River.  It is considered to potentially occur in any county bordering the Illinois River and Jersey, Madison and St. Clair Counties bordering the Mississippi River.  It occupies disturbed alluvial soils in the floodplains of these rivers.  Federal regulations prohibit any commercial activity involving this species or the destruction, malicious damage or removal of this species from Federal land or any other lands in knowing violation of State law or regulation, including State criminal trespass law. The eastern prairie fringed orchid (Platanthera leucophaea) is listed as threatened and occurs in several Illinois counties.  It occupies wet grassland habitats.  Federal regulations prohibit any commercial activity involving this species or the destruction, malicious damage or removal of this species from Federal land or any other lands in knowing violation of State law or regulation, including State criminal trespass law.  This species should be searched for whenever wet prairie remnants are encountered. United States Department of the Interior FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE Marion Illinois Sub-Office (ES) 8588 Rout 148 Marion, IL 62959 (618) 997-3344 January 6, 2012 Mr. Ken Humphreys, CEO FutureGen Alliance, Inc. 1101 Pennsylvania Avenue NW Sixth Floor Washington, D.C. 20004 Dear Mr. Humphreys: We have reviewed the Protected Species Survey Report prepared by Specialized Ecological Services for the FutureGen Industrial Alliance, Incorporated Soil-Gas Monitoring and Meteorological Tower Project located in Morgan County, Illinois.  The proposed project involves the installation of a meteorological tower and soil-gas collection network in support of the FutureGen 2.0 Morgan County carbon sequestration site.  These comments are provided under the authority of and in accordance with the provisions of the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act (48 Stat. 401, as amended; 16 U.S.C. 661 et seq.); the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended; and the National Environmental Policy Act. Information in the letter indicates that a field survey revealed that no suitable habitat for the decurrent false aster (Boltonia decurrens) and Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis) exists within the proposed project area, thus you have determined the proposed project will have no effect on either species.  The field survey also revealed the eastern prairie fringed orchid is not present within the project area, thus you have determined the proposed project will have no effect on the eastern prairie fringed orchid.  This precludes the need for further action on this project as required under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended.  Should the project be modified, or new information indicates listed or proposed species may be affected, consultation or additional coordination with this office as appropriate, should be initiated.   Thank you for the opportunity to review the proposed project.

The purpose of this letter is to help clarify roles and responsibilities for complying with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA).  On August 5, 2010, DOE awarded American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 funding to the FutureGen Alliance (Alliance) and Ameren Energy Resources to build FutureGen 2.0, a clean coal repowering program and carbon dioxide storage network.    On November 28, 2011, the Alliance announced that it is negotiating an option to purchase portions of the Meredosia Energy Center from Ameren Energy Resources Company.  The purchase option would provide the Alliance with the assets it would need to continue the development of the FutureGen 2.0 clean coal power program in Morgan County, Illinois.  DOE is in the process of drafting an environmental impact statement, which is expected to be published in 2012.  DOE sent consultation letters to 24 tribal organizations.  DOE is requesting that your office continue to work with staff from the Alliance regarding the FutureGen 2.0 initiative to identify cultural resource issues and seek comments regarding specific work plans at various stages of this project.  Mr. Tom Anderson is the environmental permitting task leader for the Alliance and will continue to be Illinois Historic Preservation Agency’s (IHPA’s) point of contact.

Both DOE and the Alliance have review and approve this draft and are committed to working with IHPA toward a final PA that all parties can sign. You will note that this PA includes only Morgan County.  You may have seen recent announcements by the Alliance and DOE that have reduced the scope of the project to the Meredosia power plant, the pipeline to the proposed Morgan County injection site, and the action of injecting and storing CO2 beneath the Morgan County injection site, and of course a no action alternative.  This reduction in scope was based on the confirmatory results of our characterization well in Morgan County which demonstrated the viability of the Mt Simon sandstone formation to accept the volume of CO2 proposed by the project.  As a result, the Christian and Douglas County sites have been dropped from detailed evaluation in DOE’s EIS, and all action of FutureGen 2.0 will occur only in Morgan County. You will also note that the intended signers of the PA are only DOE, the Alliance, and the SHPO.  The Alliance is negotiating a purchase option with Ameren for those elements of Meredosia power plant needed for FutureGen 2.0, and therefore any construction or operational impacts, and the mitigation thereof, resulting at the power plant site from the project will be the Alliance’s responsibility and not Ameren’s.  As you review this draft PA, please contact me with any questions you might have, Tom Thomas L.

Professional Qualifications Standards All actions prescribed by this Agreement that involve the identification, evaluation, analysis, recording, treatment, monitoring, or disposition of historic properties, or that involve the reporting or documentation of such actions in the form of reports, forms, or other records, shall be carried out by or under the direct supervision of a person or persons who meets, at a minimum, the qualifications for history, archaeology, or architectural history specified in the Secretary of Interior's "Professional Qualifications Standards" (36 CFR § 800.2(a)(1)) and  (48 FR 44739-190), as appropriate.  II. Identification and Evaluation of Potential Historic Properties A. Identification of Historic Properties 1) The Alliance will take all measures necessary to discover, preserve, and avoid significant historic properties listed on or eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).  Under consultation with the SHPO, the Alliance will describe and define the Area of Potential Effect (hereafter referred to as the APE) in accordance with the definition contained in 36 CFR § 800.16(d).  The APE may be modified upon consultation with the SHPO to facilitate avoidance and will be documented through the implementation of historic property surveys and testing, documentary research, recordation, and other investigation data.  The APE may be amended without amending the Programmatic Agreement.  The APE may be amended by agreement of the signatories and shall be memorialized in writing. 2) The Alliance will ensure that all reconnaissance surveys and subsurface testing are conducted in a manner consistent with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards and Guidelines for Identification and Evaluation (48 FR 44720-23) and take into account the National Park Service publication “The Archaeological Survey: Method and Uses” (1978) and any extant or most recent version of appropriate SHPO guidelines for historic properties reconnaissance survey/reports, related guidance, etc.   B. Evaluation of Historic Properties 1) In consultation with the SHPO, the Alliance will evaluate the eligibility of significant historic properties by applying the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) criteria (36 CFR § 60.4). 2) For those properties that the SHPO agrees are not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP, no further historic properties investigations will be required, and Project activities may proceed in those areas. 3) If the survey results in the identification of properties that the SHPO agrees are eligible for inclusion on the NRHP, the Alliance shall treat such properties in accordance with Part III below. 4) If the Alliance  and the SHPO do not agree on NRHP eligibility, or if the ACHP or the National Park Service so request, DOE will request a formal determination of eligibility from the Keeper of the NRHP, National Park Service, whose determination shall be final. 5) Relative to the treatment of historic properties and the identification of traditional cultural properties, DOE and/or the SHPO will provide the appropriate Tribe(s) and the Tribal Historic Preservation Officer(s) (THPO) information related to the treatment measures proposed by the Alliance. III. Treatment of Historic Properties Those individual historic properties that DOE and the SHPO agree are eligible for nomination to, or that the Keeper has determined are eligible for inclusion on the NRHP, will be treated in the following manner: 1) If DOE, in consultation with the SHPO, determines that no other actions are feasible to avoid and minimize effect to archaeological properties, then the Alliance will develop a treatment plan, which may include various levels of data recovery, recordation, documentation, and active protection measures.  Alliance will implement the treatment plan in consultation with DOE and the SHPO. 2) If data recovery is the agreed-upon treatment, the data recovery plan will address substantive research questions developed in consultation with the SHPO.  The treatment plan shall be consistent with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards and Guidelines for Archaeological Documentation (48 FR 44734-37) and take into account the ACHP’s publication Treatment of Archaeological Properties (1980) and pertinent SHPO guidance.  It will specify, at a minimum, the following: a. The property, properties, or portions of properties where the treatment plan is to be carried out; b. The research questions to be addressed, with an explanation of research relevance and importance; c. The methods to be used, with an explanation of methodological relevance to the research questions; d. Proposed methods of dissemination results of the work to the interested public; and e. Proposed schedule for the submission of the results to the SHPO. 3) The Alliance will submit the treatment plan to DOE and/or the SHPO for 30 days’ review and comment.  The Alliance will take into account DOE and/or SHPO comment(s) and will ensure that the data recovery plan is implemented. 4) The Alliance will ensure that the treatment plan is carried out by or under the direct supervision of an archaeologist(s), architectural historian(s), and/or other appropriate cultural resource specialist that meets, at a minimum, the Secretary of the Interior’s Professional Qualifications Standards (48 FR 44738-9). 5) The Alliance will ensure that adequate provisions, including personnel, equipment, and laboratory space is available for the analysis and temporary curation of materials, artifacts, and biological specimens recovered from historic properties. 6) The Alliance will develop and implement an adequate program in consultation with the SHPO to secure and protect historic properties from vandalism during the process of data recovery. IV. Treatment of Human Remains, Funerary Objects, Sacred Objects, or Objects of Cultural Patrimony A. When human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony are encountered or collected, the Alliance will comply with all provisions outlined in applicable Federal or state law, regulations, guidance, provisions, etc., and any decisions regarding the treatment of human remains will be made recognizing the rights of lineal descendants, Tribes and other recognized Native American groups in consultation with the SHPO, THPO, and /or other appropriate legal authority regarding the evaluation, assessment, documentation, and disposition of remains or objects. B. If burials are discovered during the investigations covered by this PA, the Alliance shall ensure that required notifications of the discovery will be made to the county coroner and the SHPO as stipulated in the Human Skeletal Remains Protection Act (20 ILCS 3440, 17 IAC 4170).  Then, following authorization under the Human Skeletal Remains Protection Act (20 ILCS 3440, 17 IAC 4170) and its rules, human burials, human remains, and any associated burial artifacts will be removed following procedures for recordation and reporting that are similar to those established under the Human Skeletal Remains Protection Act (20 ILCS 3440, 17 IAC 4170).  No excavation of human remains will be performed except under the direction of a “Certified Skeletal Analyst” (17 IAC 4170.300(f)). V. Unexpected Discoveries The Alliance will notify DOE and the SHPO as soon as practicable if it appears that the Project will affect a previously unidentified property that may be eligible for the NRHP or affect a known historic property in an unanticipated manner.  1) The Alliance will stop construction activities in the vicinity of the discovery and will take all reasonable measures to avoid or minimize harm to the property until consultation with the SHPO.  (In the case of human remains, The Alliance will notify the appropriate agencies as detailed in Part IV, subpart B of this PA.)  2) DOE will notify the SHPO at the earliest possible time and consult with the SHPO to develop actions that will take into account the effects of the Project.  DOE will notify the SHPO of any time constraints, and DOE and the SHPO will mutually agree upon time frames for this consultation.  3) The Alliance may participate in this consultation. 4) DOE will provide the SHPO with written recommendations that take the effect of the Project into account.  5) If the SHPO does not object to DOE’s recommendations within the agreed upon time frame, DOE will require the Alliance to modify the activities as necessary to implement the recommendations.  VI. Dispute Resolution A. Should the SHPO, the ACHP, the Alliance or any other consulting party object within time frames provided by this PA to any plans, specifications, or actions provided for review pursuant to this Agreement, DOE will consult further with the objecting party to seek resolution.   B. Should DOE object within time frames provided by this PA to any plans, specifications, or actions provided for review pursuant to this Agreement, DOE will consult further with the other parties to seek resolution. If DOE determines within 14 days of receipt that the SHPO, the ACHP, or the Alliance objection cannot be resolved, DOE will forward to the ACHP all documentation relevant to the dispute including DOE’s proposed resolution to the objection. C. Any recommendation or comment provided by the ACHP will pertain only to the subject of the dispute. The responsibility of the signatories to carry out all actions under this PA that are not subject to the dispute will remain unchanged. The signatories will continue to implement other terms of the PA that are not subject to dispute. VII.  Duration, Amendments, and Termination A. Unless terminated pursuant to Subpart C below, this PA shall remain in effect from the date of execution until DOE, in consultation with all other signatories, determines that the terms of this PA have been fulfilled in a satisfactory manner.  Upon a determination by DOE that the terms of this PA have been satisfactorily fulfilled, this PA will terminate and have no further force or effect.  DOE will provide all other signatories with written notice of its determination and of termination of this PA.  Unless amended otherwise, this will expire on December 31, 2020. B. If any signatory to the PA determines that the stipulations of the PA cannot be fulfilled, the signatories may consult to seek amendment of the PA.  Amendments to this PA will be specific to the applicable and legitimate circumstances unless otherwise agreed to by the signatories. C. DOE, the SHPO, the ACHP, or the Alliance may terminate this PA by providing 30 days written notice to the other parties, provided that the parties will consult during the period prior to termination to seek agreement on amendments or other actions that would avoid termination. Termination of this PA will require compliance with 36 CFR § 800.

Department of Energy (DOE) is preparing an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the proposed action of providing approximately $1 billion in federal funding (most of it appropriated by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act) for the FutureGen 2.0 Project (the “Project”). The Project consists of the repowering of an existing electricity generator with clean coal technologies integrated with a pipeline that would transport carbon dioxide (CO2) to a sequestration site where it would be injected and stored in a deep geologic formation. These actions would be completed in two separate project components: (1) an Oxy-Combustion Large Scale Test undertaken by Ameren Energy Resources (Ameren) and (2) a Pipeline and CO2 Storage Reservoir undertaken by the FutureGen Alliance (Alliance). For the Oxy-Combustion Large Scale Test, Ameren and its team would construct and operate an advanced oxy-combustion system to repower an existing steam turbine generator (Unit 4) at Ameren’s Meredosia Power Station in west central Illinois. A concentrated and compressed CO2 stream produced in the process would be transferred to a pipeline for transmission to the Alliance’s storage location. Potomac-Hudson Engineering, Inc. (PHE) has prepared this wetlands report to support the EIS and future wetland permitting activities for the Project with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). This report has been prepared for the Ameren portion of the Project, the Oxy-Combustion Large Scale Test component, and does not include analyses of areas that may be affected by the Alliance’s portion of the Project, the Pipeline and CO2 Storage Reservoir component. Wetland evaluations were performed at potential impact areas at the Meredosia Power Station site and nearby offsite locations within the project area. The boundaries of the project area have been superimposed on all the figures in this report. In addition, Figures A-2 through A-7 depict temporary and permanent impact areas. Concurrent with the wetland evaluation, an initial assessment of the “ordinary high water mark” (OHWM) of the Illinois River was also conducted in areas at the north end of the Ameren site (Area 3 in Figure A-5) as well as property further to the north of Ameren, which is currently a public boat launch (Area 1 in Figure A-5). These are areas that may be altered by Ameren to support barge unloading during construction. This evaluation was also conducted to support possible USACE permitting efforts. After reviewing an earlier draft of this report, USACE conducted a site visit on August 16, 2011, during which the OHWM was identified. The OHWM (set at 440 feet) is shown in the aerial images provided in Appendix A. The remaining report is organized as follows: • Section 2 – Definitions discusses the wetland and ordinary high water mark definitions as contained in the Clean Water Act (CWA). • Section 3 – Methodology discusses the three-parameter wetland delineation methodology, the ordinary high water mark determination methodology, and field procedures employed. • Section 4 – Existing Conditions describes the study area and summarizes the wetlands that were delineated. In addition, the following attachments are provided in this report: • Attachment A – Figures o Figure A-1 – USGS Map -Meredosia Quadrangle o Figure A-2 – National Wetland Inventory Map o Figure A-3 -Soils Map o Figure A-4 – FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Map o Figure A-5 -Vegetation Map o Figure A-6 – Delineated Wetlands Map o Figure A-7 – Delineated Wetlands Map (enlarged) o Figure A-8 – Photograph Locations Map o Figure A-9 – Survey Map with Spot Elevations for Ordinary High Water Mark (Benton & Associates, Inc.) o Figure A-10 – Impacted Areas Map with Ordinary High Water Mark Contour (URS, 2011c) • Attachment B – Site Photographs • Attachment C – Wetland Data Sheets • Attachment D – Qualifications of Preparers FUTUREGEN 2.0 PROGRAM  AMEREN WETLAND REPORT FEBRUARY 01, 2012  2  DEFINITIONS  2.1  WETLANDS  Wetlands are defined under the CWA (40 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] Part 230) as follows: Those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas. Certain features, called “Waters of the U.S.,” (WOUS) are regulated by the USACE under the CWA, because they are important for the preservation of navigable waterways and interstate commerce. WOUS are subject to federal jurisdiction and permitting under Section 404 of the CWA. The regulatory definition of WOUS in the CWA (40 CFR Part 230) is as follows: (1) All waters which are currently used, or were used in the past, or may be susceptible to use in interstate or foreign commerce, including all waters which are subject to the ebb and flow of the tide; (2) All interstate waters including interstate wetlands; (3) All other waters such as intrastate lakes, rivers, streams (including intermittent streams), mudflats, sandflats, wetlands, sloughs, prairie potholes, wet meadows, playa lakes, or natural ponds, the use, degradation or destruction of which could affect interstate or foreign commerce including any such waters: (i) Which are or could be used by interstate or foreign travelers for recreational or other purposes; or (ii) From which fish or shellfish are or could be taken and sold in interstate or foreign commerce; or (iii)Which areused or couldbeused forindustrial purposes byindustriesin interstate commerce; (4) All impoundments of waters otherwise defined as waters of the United States under this definition; (5) Tributaries of waters identified in paragraphs (s)(1) through (4) of this section; (6) The territorial sea; (7) Wetlands adjacent to waters (other than waters that are themselves wetlands) identified in paragraphs (s)(1) through (6) of this section; waste treatment systems, including treatment ponds or lagoons designed to meet the requirements of CWA (other than cooling ponds as defined in 40 CFR 423.11(m) which also meet the criteria of this definition) are not waters of the United States. Waters of the United States do not include prior converted cropland. Notwithstanding the determination of an area's status as prior converted cropland by any other Federal agency, for the purposes of the CWA, the final authority regarding CWA jurisdiction remains with EPA. Wetland boundary determinations are typically conducted by applying the Routine Methodology listed in the Corps of Engineers Wetlands Delineation Manual (the “Manual”). This methodology requires that three criteria be present in order for an area to qualify as a federally jurisdictional wetland. The three wetland criteria are identified as (USACE, 1987): Hydrophytic vegetation is defined as macrophytic plant life growing in water, soil, or on a substrate that is at least periodically deficient in oxygen as a result of excessive water content. The USFWS has developed a list of wetland plants and their affinity for wetland conditions. The “National List of Plant Species that Occur in Wetlands: North Central (Region 3)” (USFWS, 1988) lists wetland plants common to the north central United States. (1)  hydrophytic vegetation;  (2)  hydric soils; and  (3)  wetland hydrology.  Hydric soils are defined as soils that are saturated, flooded, or ponded long enough during the growing season to develop anaerobic conditions within the major portion of the root zone. The National Technical Committee for Hydric Soils has developed criteria for hydric soil determination in addition to a list of hydric soil types. Wetland hydrology is the permanent or periodic inundation or soil saturation for a significant period during the vegetative growing season. Many factors influence the hydrology of an area, including precipitation, topography, soil permeability and plant cover. The frequency and duration of inundation or soil saturation are the important factors in the determination of the existence of wetland hydrology (USACE, 1987). 2.2 ORDINARY HIGH WATER MARK USACE regulations define the term “ordinary high water mark” (OHWM) for purposes of the CWA, as found in 33 CFR 328.3(e): The term ordinary high water mark means that line on the shore established by the fluctuations of water and indicated by physical characteristics such as a clear, natural line impressed on the bank, shelving, changes in the character of soil, destruction of terrestrial vegetation, the presence of litter and debris, or other appropriate means that consider the characteristics of the surrounding areas. 3 METHODOLOGY 3.1 WETLANDS DELINEATION METHODOLOGY 3.1.1 Vegetation As vegetation serves as an indicator of existing environmental conditions, the methodology of the Manual directs the researcher to analyze the existing vegetation. This involves estimation of existing plant species composition by direct observation. Wetlands are usually characterized by the predominance of hydrophytic plant species. Conversely, upland areas would be dominated by plant species better adapted to drier soil conditions. A mesic zone, or the transition zone between wetland and upland habitat, is often comprised of a mixture of facultative wetland species, facultative, and facultative upland species. With respect to vegetation, the Manual places great emphasis on the presence of hydrophytic species (dominance) as indicators of wetland areas. The determination of whether or not a species is dominant is based upon its percentage of cover. Dominance, as defined herein, refers to the spatial extent of a species. Commonly, the most abundant species in each vegetation stratum (trees, shrubs, vines, and herbs) exceeds 50 percent of the total dominance measure (i.e., aerial cover or basal area) (USACE, 1987). Table 3-1 presents the criteria for determining wetland indicator classifications. Table 3-1. USFWS Wetland Plant Indicator Status Wetland Indicator Classification  Percent Occurrence in Wetlands  Obligate Wetland (OBL)  Greater than 99%  Facultative Wetland (FACW)  67 to 99%  Facultative (FAC)  33 to 66%  Facultative Upland (FACU)  1 to 33%  Obligate Upland (UPL)  Less than 1%  Source: USFWS, 1988a A positive (+) or negative (-) symbol used in conjunction with one of the facultative indicator classes relates to a species preference to either the drier or the wetter end of its indicator class. The positive sign indicates preference to the wetter end of the category and a negative sign is a preference to the drier end (USFWS, 1988a). These wetlands indicator classifications were determined for species found in the project area and used in conjunction with their percentage of cover to determine whether a prevalence of wetland species are dominant in any of the vegetation communities occurring in the project area. 3.1.2 Soils A hydric soil is formed when it lies within a saturated, flooded, or ponded area for a sufficient duration during the growing season, which aids in the development of anaerobic conditions in the upper part of the soil profile. Typical hydric soil indicators include a low-chroma matrix, redoximorphic features (lowchroma mottles or high-chroma mottles), gleying, oxidized rhizospheres, iron concretions, and manganese nodules. A soil is generally considered to be hydric if it has a chroma of 1 or a chroma of 2 with mottling (USACE, 1987). An auger was used to extract soil profiles for inspection from multiple points along wetland boundaries and adjacent uplands. Soil samples were taken to a depth of approximately 12 inches below ground surface and examined for hydric soil traits (i.e. color, texture, and moisture content). The color of the soil matrix was then compared to the colors presented in the Munsell Soil Color Chart to confirm whether the colors were consistent with the hydric soil criteria. 3.1.3 Hydrology Wetland hydrology is often the least exact and most difficult parameter to establish in the field, largely due to seasonal fluctuations of ground water elevation and seasonal precipitation. Additional factors that influence wetland hydrology include topography, plant cover, soil texture, and depth to bedrock. Documenting the existence of wetland hydrology involves the observations of wetland field indicators, which provide direct or indirect evidence of inundation or soil saturation for extended periods during the growing season. Although these indicators are quickly assessed in the field, professional judgment must be used to decide whether these indicators demonstrate that the wetland hydrology criterion has been satisfied. Drift lines, water marks, sediment deposits, root staining, scour areas, buttressed trees and drainage patterns are some of the indicators which commonly identify wetland hydrology (USACE, 1987). 3.1.4 Non-jurisdictional Wetlands WOUS include all navigable waterways, their tributaries, as well as wetlands contiguous to and adjacent to those navigable waterways and tributaries. Isolated wetlands (those that have no surface hydrologic connection to WOUS) are not regulated under federal jurisdiction unless they are adjacent to or within the 100-year floodplain of WOUS. Determinations of whether features should be considered WOUS were based on field observations and desktop reviews of available mapping (e.g., U.S. Geological Survey topographic maps) based on the CWA definition provided in Section 2. 3.2 WETLANDS FIELD DELINEATION PROCEDURES The field investigation of potentially affected areas of the Meredosia Power Station site and offsite locations occurred on May 25, 26 and 27, 2011. The wetland delineation activities were conducted using the Corps of Engineers Wetlands Delineation Manual (1987) (the “Manual”) guidelines based upon the three-parameter approach defined earlier (hydrophytic vegetation, hydric soils, and wetland hydrology). The locations of all wetland features identified were marked in the field using flagging tape and subsequently recorded using a Trimble ProXRT Global Positing System (GPS) unit capable of sub-meter accuracy using real-time differential GPS and/or data post-processing procedures. All features were recorded for horizontal position using Illinois State Plane West, North American Datum, 1983 (NAD 83) coordinates in feet. 3.3 ORDINARY HIGH WATER MARK DETERMINATION METHOD A site visit was conducted on May 25, 2011 of the two areas of the banks of the Illinois River that could be potentially disturbed during construction of the project, namely in Area 1 and Area 3 (see Figure A-5 and Photos 1 through 7). Site observations were then reviewed in light of the USACE’s definition of the OHWM, as discussed in Section 2.2. On August 16, 2011, a USACE representative conducted a site visit and identified the OHWM at the 440-foot elevation. Based on this determination, spot elevations for the OHWM were taken during a survey conducted August 25, 2011 (Figure A-9). The OHWM contour line was then interpolated and is shown in the aerial images of Appendix A. A full topographic survey will be completed prior to construction of the project and will more accurately locate the OHWM. 4 EXISTING CONDITIONS 4.1 ONSITE AREAS (WITHIN AMEREN PROPERTY) 4.1.1 Review of Maps from Other Sources Prior to, during, and after the site visit a variety of maps were consulted in order to assist PHE with the field work and determinations regarding potential wetlands and WOUS. These included: • The USGS map (USDOI, 2001) is included as Figure A-1. An overlay of the areas that may be potentially disturbed is shown on the map. Since the USGS map is based on 2001 conditions, it is not completely reflective of current conditions. For example, the road to the ash ponds is not shown. Thus, the tree lines and topographic contours depicted in the vicinity of that road are not accurate based on current conditions. • The National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) wetlands features (USF&W, 2010) are overlaid on a recent (2010) aerial photograph and included as Figure A-2. An additional overlay of the areas to be potentially disturbed is also shown on the map. No NWI wetlands are within the areas of potential disturbance. For reference purposes, the wetlands that were identified in the field (and discussed later in Section 4.2) are also shown in Figure A-2. As discussed in Section 4.2, hydric soils extended upslope from the flagged wetlands. • The boundaries of the soil types in the Morgan County Soil Survey (USDA, 2006) are overlaid on a recent (2010) aerial photograph and included as Figure A-3. According to this mapping, which was based on aerials and field work that apparently predated construction of the Ash Road, there are no hydric soils within the areas of potential disturbance. For reference purposes, the wetlands that were identified in the field (and discussed in Section 4.2) are also shown in Figure A-3. • The boundaries of the 100-year and 500-year floodplains (FEMA, 2011) are overlaid on a recent (2010) aerial photograph and included as Figure A-4. According to this mapping, which was apparently based on pre-2006 aerials that predated construction of the Ash Road, there is a large floodplain south of the main entrance to the facility. The FEMA map shows that the main entrance, while out of the 100-year floodplain, is within the 500-year floodplain. For reference purposes, the wetlands that were identified in the field (and discussed in Section 4.2) are also shown in Figure A-4. 4.1.2 General Onsite Description Ameren’s property has been subject to a variety of disturbances over the years. These include: construction of houses and other features (pre-Ameren); filling and construction of the Ameren facility (including the power plant and associated features, such as roads, parking lots, railroad lines, storage tanks, barge unloading facilities, etc.); and maintenance of the facility that includes periodic mowing of the open field areas. A Vegetation Map is included as Figure A-5. The vegetation boundaries for the areas that would be potentially disturbed are overlaid on a 2010 aerial photograph. These areas are described below. Area 2 is a wooded area approximately 4.9 acres in size between the Illinois River to the west and a dirt road (Front Street) leading from the Meredosia Power Station property to the north, offsite. Area 2 is on the right side of Photo 8. The canopy is generally closed. There is a scattered shrub layer and lush herbaceous layer. Trees in the area include elm (Ulmus sp.), ash (Fraxinus sp.), silver maple (Acer saccharinum), northern catalpa (Catalpa speciosa), red mulberry (Morus rubra), and a few black walnut (Juglans nigra). Groundcover consists primarily of a Panicum grass and also includes Virginia creeper (Parthenocissus quinquefolia), catchweed bedstraw (Galium aparine), giant ragweed (Ambrosia trifida), and a Pachysandra species. The soils are loamy sand and well drained. Area 3 is a small (0.7 acre), heavily disturbed area adjacent to the Illinois River just north of the fenceline of the Meredosia Power Station. The area consists of a narrow area of fill along the fenceline, a rip-rap slope (see Photo 4) down to the flats along the river that are shown in Photos 5 and 6. Vegetation consists of patchy grassy areas with a few shrubs (e.g., eastern red cedar [Juniperus virginiana] and silver maple saplings) and other herbaceous vegetation (e.g., false aster [Boltonia asteroides]). The filled areas and steep slopes are gravelly and rocky, while the flats along the river are sandy. Area 4 is an 8.4-acre wooded area on the east side of the dirt road (Front Street) and Area 2. Area 4 is on the left side of Photo 8. Vegetation is similar to Area 2. The differences include: the frequency of black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia), and the lack of silver maple. Groundcover is dominated by catchweed bedstraw and has pokeweed (Phytolacca americana) and poison ivy (Toxicodendron radicans) with the other species from Area 2. The soils are loamy sand and well drained. Area 6 is a 6.9-acre field consisting of mowed grasses and other herbaceous vegetation adjacent to the Meredosia Power Station. The soils are loamy sand and well drained. Area 7 is a 16.7-acre field that contains grassy/herbaceous vegetation in open areas that surround seven wooded islands (with an additional 4.8 acres), which are identified in Figure A-5 as Area 7A. In the open areas vegetation consists of species such as prickly pear cactus, a milkweed species (Asclepias sp.), and multiple grasses. See Photos 13 and 14. The area contains a steep, linear low spot in the eastern part, roughly parallel to the access road to the ash ponds. See Photos 10 and 11 that have north and south views of this depression. Photo 12 is a view from the Ash Road down into the depression. As compared to the portion of the site at higher elevation, the most notable difference in vegetation is the presence of eastern cottonwood seedlings. The soils are loamy sand and well drained. Areas 7A, the seven wooded areas totaling 4.8 acres imbedded in Area 7, contain tree species such as black locust, smooth sumac (Rhus glabra), sassafrass (Sassafras albidum), black oak, and mulberry (Morus sp.). Herbaceous vegetation in the wooded areas consists of species such as Virginia creeper, catchweed bedstraw, and greenbrier (Smilax sp.). These wooded areas are on the fringes of the aforementioned Photos 10 to 14. The soils are loamy sand and well drained. Area 8 consists of mostly grassy/herbaceous vegetation in the open areas (8.6 acres) with a large wooded portion (6.8 additional arces on the eastern edge identified as Area 8A in Figure A-5) and two central wetland areas (0.6 additional acres identified as Area 8B in Figure A-5). The topography of the entire area creates a bowl effect for Area 8B (see Photo 15), though it is undulating, especially within much of the wooded area. Vegetation in the open areas (Area 8) consists primarily of multiple grasses including sedge, black locust, and smooth sumac saplings. Trees in the wooded portion (Area 8A) consist primarily of black locust with species such as eastern cottonwood, black oak, eastern red cedar, and smooth sumac. Dogwood (Cornus sp.) and honeysuckle (Lonicera sp.) shrubs are also present. Herbs and vines include species, such as common pokeweed, Virginia creeper, poison ivy, prickly pear cactus, catchweed bedstraw, and grape. Vegetation in the wetland areas consists of herbaceous species, including cattail (Typha sp.) and sedges that are sometimes ringed by eastern cottonwood saplings in greater abundance at slightly higher elevations. The soils within the two wetland areas and immediately adjacent to the wetlands were clayey with a chroma of 1 or 2 and clearly hydric. The boundary of the wetlands was defined by the topography (hydrology) and changes in the vegetative community. Area 9 consists of a relatively small area (0.8 acre) around the fuel unloading area. Vegetation consists only of trees, (primarily silver maple and willow (Salix sp.)), which were in the water of the Illinois River at the time of the site visit in May 2011. They are well below the elevation of the rest of the Meredosia Power Station Site. Because of the water level it was impossible to take any soil samples. The soils are loamy sand and well drained. Area 10 is a rectangular field between the old ash ponds to the west and a wooded lot to the east (Area 11) that is 6.5 acres in size. It consists mostly of grassy/herbaceous vegetation with species such as sedges, Panicum, Rubus species, and curly dock (Rumex crispus) covering most of the area with common pokeweed and milkweed around woodland edges. There are a few trees in the area such as black locust and black oak. The soils are loamy sand and well drained. Area 11 consists of a 7.6-acre wooded area between two fields, Area 10 to the west and Area 12 to the east. The herbaceous layer is thick in some spots and more open on others. Trees in the area consist of species such as pignut hickory (Carya glabra), sassafrass, ash, silver maple, and smooth sumac. Herbaceous vegetation consists of species such as catchweed bedstraw, Virginia creeper, and common pokeweed. The soils are loamy sand and well drained. Area 12 consists of an open area with vegetation consisting mainly of grasses such as purple tridens (Tridens flavus). Scattered smooth sumac saplings are also present. The soils are loamy sand and well drained. 4.1.3 Summary of Wetland Features Two wetland areas were identified onsite – shown as Vegetation Community Area 8B in Figure A-5 and as Wetlands Areas PA (0.37 acres) and PB (0.26 acres) in Figures A-6 and A-7. Soils are hydric throughout. Standing water in large portions was observed at both areas on May 25, 26 and 27 with soils saturated to the surface in nearby areas. One pair of Wetland Determination Data Forms were recorded for each wetlands area (see Attachment C). Their locations are shown in Figure A-7. Based on the FEMA maps, these wetlands are within the 100-year floodplain, associated with the Illinois River. A USACE representative conducted a site visit on August 16, 2011. In an e-mail follow-up to the site visit, dated August 18, 2011, USACE stated that they agreed with the boundaries of the delineated wetlands onsite and stated that these wetland areas are not isolated and would be considered under federal, USACE jurisdiction (Zobrist, 2011). Although there is no surface hydrologic connection to WOUS beyond their presence in the floodplain, USACE stated that there is a groundwater connection to the Illinois River, which allows the wetlands to be inundated due to river water level fluctuation. The wetlands classification of these areas, following Cowardin et al. (1979), are as follows: • System – Palustrine; • Class – Emergent Wetland; • Subclass – Persistent; and • Dominance Type – Mud. 4.2 OFFSITE AREAS 4.2.1 Railroad Property at Southeast Corner 4.2.1.1 General Site Description The area is shown as Area 14 and Area 14A in Figure A-5. It is primarily a mowed field that is 24.7 acres consisting of various grasses, prickly pear cactus, and purple vetch that is bisected by a rail line that provides access to industrial properties to the west (see Photos 16 and 17). There is a small deciduous wooded area in the southwest corner (Area 14A) that is 0.9 acres in size. The young overstory is dominated by oaks and mulberry. The understory contains sassafras and black walnut seedlings, multiflora rose, and honeysuckle. The herbaceous layer includes grasses and Virginia creeper. The soils are loamy sand and well drained throughout both areas. 4.2.1.2 Summary of Wetland Features There were no areas identified as wetlands on this property. 4.2.2 Railroad Property at Northeast Corner 4.2.2.1 General Site Description The area is shown as Area 5 in Figure A-5. Area 5 is a mostly grassy area that is 5.6 acres in size. It is dominated by herbaceous vegetation, but also contains two small wooded islands. The wooded areas consist of tree species such as eastern cottonwood, black locust, red mulberry, and black oak (Quercus velutina). Herbaceous vegetation within the wooded area consists of species such as Virginia creeper, poison ivy, and grape (Vitis sp.). The field areas goatsbeard (Tragopogon pratensis), chives (Allium schoenoprasum), prickly pear cactus (Opuntia humifusa), common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia), yellow sweet-clover (Melilotus officinalis), Ohio spiderwort (Tradescantia ohiensis), and multiple grass species including sedges (Carex sp.). The soils are loamy sand and well drained. 4.2.2.2 Summary of Wetland Features There were no areas identified as wetlands on this property. 4.2.3 Village Property to the North 4.2.3.1 General Site Description This area is shown as Area 1 in Figure A-5. It is an approximate 4.4-acre area, the majority of which is a paved parking area adjacent to the Illinois River. There are three eastern cottonwoods (Populus deltoides) in the sandy beach between the parking lot and the river when the river is at or near normal pool elevation. The two northern trees are shown in Photo 1 and the southern one in Photo 2, which also shows the sandy beach. The southern end of Area 1 is a grassy swale that carries runoff to the river. The soils are loamy sand and well drained. 4.2.3.2 Summary of Wetland Features There were no areas identified as wetlands on this property. 4.2.4 Offsite Area to the East 4.2.4.1 General Site Description Area 13 consists of a gravel parking lot. Around the edges of the lot are areas of herbaceous/grassy vegetation. The site was gravel on top of a loamy sand and is well drained. 4.2.4.2 Summary of Wetland Features There were no areas identified as wetlands on this property. 4.3 ILLINOIS RIVER ORDINARY HIGH WATER MARK As discussed in Section 3.3, site observations were conducted in two areas along the banks of the Illinois River – Area 1 and Area 3 – that could be potentially disturbed during construction (see Figure A-5 and Photos 1 through 7). In reviewing the definition of the OHWM and the physical conditions at the two areas, a definitive opinion was not possible. The water level at the time of the site visit, while above the normal pool elevation (as evidenced by the inundation of large areas of non-aquatic vegetation) was still well below other water levels (as evidenced by the drift line in the middle of the parking lot, Photo 1 and aerial photographs from 2010 that show the entire parking lot under water). During a site visit on August 16, 2011, a USACE representative identified the OHWM at the location as 440 feet above mean sea level, which is located well into the parking lot. Based on this determination, a 440-foot OHWM contour line was interpolated based on recent survey efforts (Figure A-9) and is shown in Figures A-2 through A-6 and A-8. A full topographic survey will be completed prior to construction of the project and will more accurately locate the OHWM. INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK 5 REFERENCES Benton & Associates, Inc. 2011.

The current proposed action involves the installation of a meteorological tower and soil-gas collection network in support of the FutureGen 2.0 Morgan County carbon sequestration site. The network will provide samples of soil gas for evaluating baseline CO2 concentrations and, once site operations begin, a means of assessing possible increases in CO2 concentration or co-injected tracer compounds. The network includes one meteorological tower and seven soil-gas monitoring chambers. Wetlands The ecological functions and social values associated with wetland habitats afford them special regulatory protection. In keeping with the regulatory requirements of the Clean Water Act (CWA), wetlands on properties to be altered by commercial activities must be identified and impacts to those wetlands mitigated. As authorized by Section 404 of the CWA, the US Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) and US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) jointly define wetlands as “those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, the prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions (Corps 33 CFR 328.3 and EPA 40 CFR 230.3).” This definition is currently the standard for jurisdictional wetland delineation. To be a jurisdictional wetland and therefore fall under federal and state regulatory limitations, an ecological community must exhibit three wetland characteristics: (1) wetland hydrology, (2) hydric soils, and (3) hydrophytic vegetation. Hydrology Because hydrology is the most independent variable among the three-wetland criteria, its influence is extremely important. Hydrologic fluctuations not only affect soil formation (Buol and Rebertus 1988) and vegetation growth (Hutchinson 1975), but also every wetland function. Wetland hydrology is described by the Corps as “inundation or saturation to the surface for at least 5% of the growing season in most years.” Saturation exists when the capillary fringe occurs within a major portion of the root zone (ie. within 12 inches of the soil surface). The growing season is defined as the portion of the year when soil temperature at 20 inches below the surface is above 41oF (5oC). Soils Wetland hydrology (saturation and/or inundation) results in soil anaerobiosis as biological and chemical processes deplete oxygen in the soil. Soils developed in anoxic conditions are called hydromorphic (Buol and Rebertus 1988) or hydric (Megonigal, Patrick, and Faulkner 1993). The Natural Resource Conservation Service defines hydric soils as “saturated, flooded or ponded long enough during the growing season to develop anaerobic conditions in the upper part of the soil (SCS 1991). Vegetation For most species of vegetation, oxygen deprivation is an extreme condition limiting survival. For certain adapted species, however, anoxic rooting conditions are an environmental condition allowing them the ecological advantage. The National Technical Committee for Hydric Soils (SCS 1991) defines hydrophytic vegetation as “plant life growing in water or on a saturated substrate that is at least periodically deficient in oxygen as a result of excessive water content.” The keystone to regulatory consideration of hydrophytic vegetation is inundation or saturation sufficient to exert a controlling influence on the plant species present. The Corps requires a predominance (>50%) of hydrophytic species. In January of 2001, a U.S. Supreme Court ruling added another characteristic as a requirement for a wetland to come under the Corps regulatory jurisdiction. In essence, a wetland is now required to have a surface water connection to a “navigable waterway” in order to be protected by the wetland provisions of the CWA. This ruling was reinforced in the 2006 U.S. Supreme Court case, United States v. Rapanos. State Wetlands Legislation The Illinois Interagency Wetland Policy Act of 1989 establishes a state goal that there be, “no overall net loss of the state's existing wetland acres or their functional values due to state supported activities” (20 ILCS 830). To accomplish this goal, the Act established a review process for all projects being pursued by a state agency or being accomplished with state funds, that have the potential to adversely affect a wetland. This review consists of a two part process. Projects must first be reviewed by the Division of Natural Resources Review & Coordination to confirm if a wetland impact will occur. If it is determined there will not be an impact, the project will be approved and funds may be released. If it is determined an impact is going to occur, the entity requesting approval must prepare a plan which details how it will compensate for the impact before the project may move forward (20 ILCS 830). All compensation plans must be approved by IDNR. The Act does not require wetlands to have a surface water connection to a navigable waterway in order for those wetlands to fall within the state's regulatory jurisdiction. The Illinois Rivers, Lakes, and Streams Act (615 ILCS 5) grants the IDNR Office of Water Resources (IDNR/OWR) the authority to regulate construction activities in floodplains. According to the Act, persons proposing such activities must first secure a permit from IDNR/OWR.  Related regulations recognize six northeastern counties (Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry, and Will) separately from the rest of "downstate" Illinois. The purpose of both programs is to, "protect the rights, safety, and welfare of private and public landowners by the regulation of floodway development, [because] construction activities which restrict a stream's capacity to carry flood flows may result in channel instability and increased flood damages to neighboring properties" (State of Illinois 1994). The downstate regulatory program requires permits for construction in the floodway of any stream serving a tributary area of 640 acres in urban areas or 6,400 acres in rural areas. The Northeastern Illinois Program does not limit the tributary area (State of Illinois 1994). IDNR/OWR uses a joint application form entitled Protecting Illinois Waters for its floodplain, public waters, and dam safety permits. STUDY AREA Meteorological Tower The meteorological tower will be installed on a small strip of pasture located approximately 230 feet west of the soil-gas monitoring station, SG-1 (Illustration 1). Planned coordinates are 90.060917W and 39.813090N. Soil disturbance for the meteorological tower includes one concrete footing, approximately 2 feet wide, 2 feet long, and 3 feet deep. Also, a pad of landscape pavers (approximately 4 feet wide by 4 feet long) will be used to minimize vegetative growth around the tower and solar panel. Soil-Gas Monitoring Network The soil-gas monitoring network will consist of six spatially distributed monitoring locations (SG-1 through SG-6, Illustration 2), and one additional location at the site of an abandoned oil and gas well (SG-OGW-1, Illustration 2). A second abandoned well, SGOGW-2, will be accessed for a one-time soil gas measurement but no permanent soil gas collector will be installed. The soil gas monitoring points SG-1 through SG-6 are located adjacent to county roads on what is thought to be the public right–of-way between the road surface and private property. However, selected locations may actually extend onto private property. All locations are sited on high ground where saturation of the soil is least likely to occur. Monitoring point SG-OGW-1 is located in the middle of a fenced pasture. The soil disturbance caused by installation of the soil-gas monitoring collector at each site will be approximately 2 feet wide, 2 feet long, and 3 feet deep. Illustration 1: Proposed meteorological towerlocation. Illustration 2: Proposed locationsof soil-gasmonitoring points.FutureGen – Soil-Gas Monitoring & Meteorological Tower 6 Wetland Delineation PURPOSE & PROCEDURE The purpose of this investigation was to determine the extent of regulated wetlands at each of the soil-gas monitoring locations in the proposed network and at the proposed meteorological tower site. The wetlands investigation was conducted in conformation with the guidelines found in the Corps’ Wetlands Delineation Manual (Environmental Laboratory 1987). The following tasks have been completed and the results are reported below: • Using available reference materials determine the presence of previously identified wetland hydrology, hydric soils, and/or hydrophytic vegetation. • Perform a field survey to ground-truth data gathered through available references. Preliminary Data Collection & Review Prior to conducting the wetland determination, the following resources were reviewed: US Fish & Wildlife Service National Wetland Inventory Map The National Wetland Inventory (NWI) map data (USFWS 2011) for the project site were examined to obtain a preliminary estimate of potential wetlands occurring at the proposed power plant site, related new construction areas, and the region of influence. Given that wetland identification criteria differ between the US Fish & Wildlife Service (USFWS) and the Corps, wetlands shown on a NWI map may not be under the jurisdiction of the Corps. Similarly, jurisdictional wetlands may not always be identified on NWI maps. Consequently, wetland presence based on NWI maps alone cannot be assumed to be an accurate assessment of jurisdiction. USGS Topographic Map The project site was superimposed on the corresponding topographic map (updated in 1990) (Microsoft 2011). These maps indicate topography, land use, water bodies, drainage ways, and other basic information pertinent to the project area. Of obvious importance for wetland research is the topographic and hydrologic information available on USGS map. National Cooperative Soil Survey Soils maps from the National Cooperative Soil Survey website (NCSS 2011) were examined to determine the characteristics of soils at the project site. County hydric soils lists from Morgan County were also reviewed prior to fieldwork. Field Survey Pedestrian surveys for jurisdictional wetlands and protected species were conducted on the subject property on November 1, 2011. Surveys were performed by Specialized Ecological Services’ Consulting Ecologist, Robert Rinella. Vegetation identification was performed by Specialized Ecological Services' Senior Botanist, James Lang. Qualifications are provided in Attachment A. Wetland field investigations were performed based on the guidelines of the 1987 Corps of Engineers Wetlands Delineation Manual (Environmental Laboratory 1987). The manual recommends a minimum of three transects through a project area aligned perpendicular to the longest axis. In this study, a single sample site was established at each soil-gas monitoring location.  Because the ground cover of these areas was primarily cool-season turf grasses and common weeds and pasture grass and because the areas' sizes are limited, it was possible to observe any variance in habitat type from a single sampling point. Routine Wetland Determination Data Forms were completed to characterize the jurisdictional wetland areas and adjacent uplands (Attachment B). At these locations, vegetation, hydrologic indicators, and soil conditions were recorded. Vegetation Plant identifications and nomenclature were based on Flora of Missouri (Steyermark 1963).  The USFWS wetland indicator status of species follows Reed (1988). Soils Site-specific data were examined to determine the characteristics of soils of the project area. A Munsell soil color chart (Munsell Soil 1975) was used to describe soil color and other significant characteristics. Field observations were used to verify mapped soils survey information.  Hydrology During field investigations, hydrologic indicators were observed and used to verify reference data shown on NWI maps, USGS topographic maps, soils surveys, and other sources. Specific field indicators may include, but are not limited to: inundation, saturation, watermarks, drift lines, sediment deposits, and water-stained leaves. RESULTS Preliminary Data Collection & Review US Fish & Wildlife Service National Wetland Inventory Map Review of the National Wetland Inventory (NWI) map (USFWS 2011) revealed only those wetland areas associated with Indian Creek. These are all well outside the project area. NWI and USGS topographic maps are provided in Attachment C. USGS Topographic Map USGS topographic maps revealed no waterways or wetlands within the project boundaries. National Cooperative Soil Survey Soils maps (NCSS 2011) show several soil types in the proposed project area. The soil map and county hydric soils list are included in Attachment D.  Four of the project areas are mapped with Ipava silt loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes. Ipava silt loam may contain hydric listed Denny, Sable, or Virden soils in depressions. Field Survey Vegetation The project areas associated with the soil-gas monitoring wells contain primarily cool-season grasses and common weeds, but also areas of agricultural row crop. Grassed Pasture and Road Right-of-Way This terrestrial community was observed at all locations with the exception of SG-OGW-2. Various grasses (Festuca arundinaceae, Setaria spp.) and broadleaf weeds (e.g. Plantago rugelii, Taraxacum officinale, and Trifolium spp.) were the dominant herbaceous species. No woody species were observed. Agricultural Row Crop This terrestrial community type is most common throughout the project area. In season, it would be planted in agricultural row crops. During field observations, there were no live cultivated species present. Evidence of Glycine max and Zea mays from previous plantings was observed. Soils The soils observed coincide with those soils shown in the soil survey maps. The native vegetation of the majority of the project site would have been a mix of tall-grass prairie and deciduous hardwoods. Hydrology Indian Creek and its unnamed tributaries drain all areas of the proposed project site westward into the Illinois River. The Illinois River terminates in the Mississippi River. Summary of Jurisdictional Areas No  jurisdictional wetlands were observed within the project area. DISCUSSION The impact of proposed FutureGen Industrial Alliance, Inc project was evaluated for the presence of jurisdictional wetlands and other U.S. waters during November 2011 by Specialized Ecological Services. This work was conducted using the standards of practice for wetland delineation. No jurisdictional wetlands were observed in the study area. As proposed, the actions of this project should not have impacts to wetlands or require wetland fill permits. LIMITS OF RESEARCH As Cowardin et al. (1979) point out, “there is no single, correct, indisputable, ecologically sound definition for wetlands, primarily because of the diversity of wetlands and because the demarcation between dry and wet environments lies along a continuum.” Wetlands, by their nature are dynamic systems. A single field investigation cannot possibly enable any investigator to have an absolutely complete understanding of the complex ecological interactions and components of a site.  However, by combining information collected from many sources at many different times, a clearer understanding is attainable. The results and conclusions of this investigation represent the integration of all information and data currently available. Literature and map data were combined with on-site reconnaissance to assure that this report is complete, comprehensive, and accurately reflects conditions at the subject property. Although every effort has been made to conduct this study according to the current standards of practice and to present the results clearly and completely, a one time sampling effort can only depict a ‘snap-shot’ of the complex biological, chemical, and ecological conditions at the study site. Sufficient support can be drawn from this sampling effort and associated analytical results, as well as from the scientific literature, for the discussion and conclusions provided herein. LITERATURE CITED 20 ILCS 830.  1989.

They highlight soil limitations that affect various land uses and provide information about the properties of the soils in the survey areas. Soil surveys are designed for many different users, including farmers, ranchers, foresters, agronomists, urban planners, community officials, engineers, developers, builders, and home buyers. Also, conservationists, teachers, students, and specialists in recreation, waste disposal, and pollution control can use the surveys to help them understand, protect, or enhance the environment. Various land use regulations of Federal, State, and local governments may impose special restrictions on land use or land treatment. Soil surveys identify soil properties that are used in making various land use or land treatment decisions. The information is intended to help the land users identify and reduce the effects of soil limitations on various land uses. The landowner or user is responsible for identifying and complying with existing laws and regulations. Although soil survey information can be used for general farm, local, and wider area planning, onsite investigation is needed to supplement this information in some cases. Examples include soil quality assessments (http://soils.usda.gov/sqi/) and certain conservation and engineering applications. For more detailed information, contact your local USDA Service Center (http://offices.sc.egov.usda.gov/locator/app? agency=nrcs) or your NRCS State Soil Scientist (http://soils.usda.gov/contact/ state_offices/). Great differences in soil properties can occur within short distances. Some soils are seasonally wet or subject to flooding. Some are too unstable to be used as a foundation for buildings or roads. Clayey or wet soils are poorly suited to use as septic tank absorption fields. A high water table makes a soil poorly suited to basements or underground installations. The National Cooperative Soil Survey is a joint effort of the United States Department of Agriculture and other Federal agencies, State agencies including the Agricultural Experiment Stations, and local agencies. The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) has leadership for the Federal part of the National Cooperative Soil Survey. Information about soils is updated periodically. Updated information is available through the NRCS Soil Data Mart Web site or the NRCS Web Soil Survey. The Soil Data Mart is the data storage site for the official soil survey information. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) prohibits discrimination in all its programs and activities on the basis of race, color, national origin, age, disability, and where applicable, sex, marital status, familial status, parental status, religion, sexual orientation, genetic information, political beliefs, reprisal, or because all or a part of an individual's income is derived from any public assistance program.

They include a description of the soils and miscellaneous areas and their location on the landscape and tables that show soil properties and limitations affecting various uses. Soil scientists observed the steepness, length, and shape of the slopes; the general pattern of drainage; the kinds of crops and native plants; and the kinds of bedrock. They observed and described many soil profiles. A soil profile is the sequence of natural layers, or horizons, in a soil. The profile extends from the surface down into the unconsolidated material in which the soil formed or from the surface down to bedrock. The unconsolidated material is devoid of roots and other living organisms and has not been changed by other biological activity. Currently, soils are mapped according to the boundaries of major land resource areas (MLRAs). MLRAs are geographically associated land resource units that share common characteristics related to physiography, geology, climate, water resources, soils, biological resources, and land uses (USDA, 2006). Soil survey areas typically consist of parts of one or more MLRA. The soils and miscellaneous areas in a survey area occur in an orderly pattern that is related to the geology, landforms, relief, climate, and natural vegetation of the area. Each kind of soil and miscellaneous area is associated with a particular kind of landform or with a segment of the landform. By observing the soils and miscellaneous areas in the survey area and relating their position to specific segments of the landform, a soil scientist develops a concept, or model, of how they were formed. Thus, during mapping, this model enables the soil scientist to predict with a considerable degree of accuracy the kind of soil or miscellaneous area at a specific location on the landscape. Commonly, individual soils on the landscape merge into one another as their characteristics gradually change. To construct an accurate soil map, however, soil scientists must determine the boundaries between the soils. They can observe only a limited number of soil profiles. Nevertheless, these observations, supplemented by an understanding of the soil-vegetation-landscape relationship, are sufficient to verify predictions of the kinds of soil in an area and to determine the boundaries. Soil scientists recorded the characteristics of the soil profiles that they studied. They noted soil color, texture, size and shape of soil aggregates, kind and amount of rock fragments, distribution of plant roots, reaction, and other features that enable them to identify soils. After describing the soils in the survey area and determining their properties, the soil scientists assigned the soils to taxonomic classes (units). Taxonomic classes are concepts. Each taxonomic class has a set of soil characteristics with precisely defined limits. The classes are used as a basis for comparison to classify soils systematically. Soil taxonomy, the system of taxonomic classification used in the United States, is based mainly on the kind and character of soil properties and the arrangement of horizons within the profile. After the soil scientists classified and named the soils in the survey area, they compared the individual soils with similar soils in the same taxonomic class in other areas so that they could confirm data and assemble additional data based on experience and research. The objective of soil mapping is not to delineate pure map unit components; the objective is to separate the landscape into landforms or landform segments that have similar use and management requirements. Each map unit is defined by a unique combination of soil components and/or miscellaneous areas in predictable proportions. Some components may be highly contrasting to the other components of the map unit. The presence of minor components in a map unit in no way diminishes the usefulness or accuracy of the data. The delineation of such landforms and landform segments on the map provides sufficient information for the development of resource plans. If intensive use of small areas is planned, onsite investigation is needed to define and locate the soils and miscellaneous areas. Soil scientists make many field observations in the process of producing a soil map. The frequency of observation is dependent upon several factors, including scale of mapping, intensity of mapping, design of map units, complexity of the landscape, and experience of the soil scientist. Observations are made to test and refine the soil-landscape model and predictions and to verify the classification of the soils at specific locations. Once the soil-landscape model is refined, a significantly smaller number of measurements of individual soil properties are made and recorded. These measurements may include field measurements, such as those for color, depth to bedrock, and texture, and laboratory measurements, such as those for content of sand, silt, clay, salt, and other components. Properties of each soil typically vary from one point to another across the landscape. Observations for map unit components are aggregated to develop ranges of characteristics for the components. The aggregated values are presented. Direct measurements do not exist for every property presented for every map unit component. Values for some properties are estimated from combinations of other properties. While a soil survey is in progress, samples of some of the soils in the area generally are collected for laboratory analyses and for engineering tests. Soil scientists interpret the data from these analyses and tests as well as the field-observed characteristics and the soil properties to determine the expected behavior of the soils under different uses. Interpretations for all of the soils are field tested through observation of the soils in different uses and under different levels of management. Some interpretations are modified to fit local conditions, and some new interpretations are developed to meet local needs. Data are assembled from other sources, such as research information, production records, and field experience of specialists. For example, data on crop yields under defined levels of management are assembled from farm records and from field or plot experiments on the same kinds of soil. Predictions about soil behavior are based not only on soil properties but also on such variables as climate and biological activity. Soil conditions are predictable over long periods of time, but they are not predictable from year to year. For example, soil scientists can predict with a fairly high degree of accuracy that a given soil will have a high water table within certain depths in most years, but they cannot predict that a high water table will always be at a specific level in the soil on a specific date. After soil scientists located and identified the significant natural bodies of soil in the survey area, they drew the boundaries of these bodies on aerial photographs and identified each as a specific map unit. Aerial photographs show trees, buildings, fields, roads, and rivers, all of which help in locating boundaries accurately. Soil Map The soil map section includes the soil map for the defined area of interest, a list of soil map units on the map and extent of each map unit, and cartographic symbols displayed on the map. Also presented are various metadata about data used to produce the map, and a description of each soil map unit. Custom Soil Resource Report MAP LEGEND Very Stony Spot Wet Spot Other MAP INFORMATION Map Scale: 1:12,200 if printed on A size (8.5" × 11") sheet.

The map unit descriptions, along with the maps, can be used to determine the composition and properties of a unit. A map unit delineation on a soil map represents an area dominated by one or more major kinds of soil or miscellaneous areas. A map unit is identified and named according to the taxonomic classification of the dominant soils. Within a taxonomic class there are precisely defined limits for the properties of the soils. On the landscape, however, the soils are natural phenomena, and they have the characteristic variability of all natural phenomena. Thus, the range of some observed properties may extend beyond the limits defined for a taxonomic class. Areas of soils of a single taxonomic class rarely, if ever, can be mapped without including areas of other taxonomic classes. Consequently, every map unit is made up of the soils or miscellaneous areas for which it is named and some minor components that belong to taxonomic classes other than those of the major soils. Most minor soils have properties similar to those of the dominant soil or soils in the map unit, and thus they do not affect use and management. These are called noncontrasting, or similar, components. They may or may not be mentioned in a particular map unit description. Other minor components, however, have properties and behavioral characteristics divergent enough to affect use or to require different management. These are called contrasting, or dissimilar, components. They generally are in small areas and could not be mapped separately because of the scale used. Some small areas of strongly contrasting soils or miscellaneous areas are identified by a special symbol on the maps. If included in the database for a given area, the contrasting minor components are identified in the map unit descriptions along with some characteristics of each. A few areas of minor components may not have been observed, and consequently they are not mentioned in the descriptions, especially where the pattern was so complex that it was impractical to make enough observations to identify all the soils and miscellaneous areas on the landscape. The presence of minor components in a map unit in no way diminishes the usefulness or accuracy of the data. The objective of mapping is not to delineate pure taxonomic classes but rather to separate the landscape into landforms or landform segments that have similar use and management requirements. The delineation of such segments on the map provides sufficient information for the development of resource plans. If intensive use of small areas is planned, however, onsite investigation is needed to define and locate the soils and miscellaneous areas. An identifying symbol precedes the map unit name in the map unit descriptions. Each description includes general facts about the unit and gives important soil properties and qualities. Soils that have profiles that are almost alike make up a soil series. Except for differences in texture of the surface layer, all the soils of a series have major horizons that are similar in composition, thickness, and arrangement. Soils of one series can differ in texture of the surface layer, slope, stoniness, salinity, degree of erosion, and other characteristics that affect their use. On the basis of such differences, a soil series is divided into soil phases. Most of the areas shown on the detailed soil maps are phases of soil series. The name of a soil phase commonly indicates a feature that affects use or management. For example, Alpha silt loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes, is a phase of the Alpha series. Some map units are made up of two or more major soils or miscellaneous areas. These map units are complexes, associations, or undifferentiated groups. A complex consists of two or more soils or miscellaneous areas in such an intricate pattern or in such small areas that they cannot be shown separately on the maps. The pattern and proportion of the soils or miscellaneous areas are somewhat similar in all areas. Alpha-Beta complex, 0 to 6 percent slopes, is an example. An association is made up of two or more geographically associated soils or miscellaneous areas that are shown as one unit on the maps. Because of present or anticipated uses of the map units in the survey area, it was not considered practical or necessary to map the soils or miscellaneous areas separately. The pattern and relative proportion of the soils or miscellaneous areas are somewhat similar. Alpha-Beta association, 0 to 2 percent slopes, is an example. An undifferentiated group is made up of two or more soils or miscellaneous areas that could be mapped individually but are mapped as one unit because similar interpretations can be made for use and management. The pattern and proportion of the soils or miscellaneous areas in a mapped area are not uniform. An area can be made up of only one of the major soils or miscellaneous areas, or it can be made up of all of them. Alpha and Beta soils, 0 to 2 percent slopes, is an example. Some surveys include miscellaneous areas. Such areas have little or no soil material and support little or no vegetation. Rock outcrop is an example. Morgan County, Illinois 19C3—Sylvan silty clay loam, 5 to 10 percent slopes, severely eroded Map Unit Setting Elevation: 440 to 670 feet Mean annual precipitation: 22

Soil Information for All Uses Suitabilities and Limitations for Use The Suitabilities and Limitations for Use section includes various soil interpretations displayed as thematic maps with a summary table for the soil map units in the selected area of interest. A single value or rating for each map unit is generated by aggregating the interpretive ratings of individual map unit components. This aggregation process is defined for each interpretation. Land Classifications Land Classifications are specified land use and management groupings that are assigned to soil areas because combinations of soil have similar behavior for specified practices. Most are based on soil properties and other factors that directly influence the specific use of the soil. Example classifications include ecological site classification, farmland classification, irrigated and nonirrigated land capability classification, and hydric rating. Hydric Rating by Map Unit This rating indicates the proportion of map units that meets the criteria for hydric soils. Map units are composed of one or more map unit components or soil types, each of which is rated as hydric soil or not hydric. Map units that are made up dominantly of hydric soils may have small areas of minor nonhydric components in the higher positions on the landform, and map units that are made up dominantly of nonhydric soils may have small areas of minor hydric components in the lower positions on the landform. Each map unit is designated as "all hydric," "partially hydric," "not hydric," or "unknown hydric," depending on the rating of its respective components. "All hydric" means that all components listed for a given map unit are rated as being hydric, while "not hydric" means that all components are rated as not hydric. "Partially hydric" means that at least one component of the map unit is rated as hydric, and at least one component is rated as not hydric. "Unknown hydric" indicates that at least one component is not rated so a definitive rating for the map unit cannot be made. Hydric soils are defined by the National Technical Committee for Hydric Soils (NTCHS) as soils that formed under conditions of saturation, flooding, or ponding long enough during the growing season to develop anaerobic conditions in the upper part (Federal Register, 1994). Under natural conditions, these soils are either saturated or inundated long enough during the growing season to support the growth and reproduction of hydrophytic vegetation. The NTCHS definition identifies general soil properties that are associated with wetness. In order to determine whether a specific soil is a hydric soil or nonhydric soil, however, more specific information, such as information about the depth and duration of the water table, is needed. Thus, criteria that identify those estimated soil properties unique to hydric soils have been established (Federal Register, 2002). These criteria are used to identify map unit components that normally are associated with wetlands. The criteria used are selected estimated soil properties that are described in "Soil Taxonomy" (Soil Survey Staff, 1999) and "Keys to Soil Taxonomy" (Soil Survey Staff, 2006) and in the "Soil Survey Manual" (Soil Survey Division Staff, 1993). If soils are wet enough for a long enough period of time to be considered hydric, they should exhibit certain properties that can be easily observed in the field. These visible properties are indicators of hydric soils. The indicators used to make onsite determinations of hydric soils are specified in "Field Indicators of Hydric Soils in the United States" (Hurt and Vasilas, 2006). References: Federal Register.

Our investigation includes two possible characterization pad areas (the Beilschmidt Property and the Hoagland Property), several truck pull-offs and road modifications on Beilschmidt Road, and widening and extending an existing farm access road. Wetlands The ecological functions and social values associated with wetland habitats afford them special regulatory protection. In keeping with the regulatory requirements of the Clean Water Act (CWA), wetlands on properties to be altered by commercial activities must be identified and impacts to those wetlands mitigated. As authorized by Section 404 of the CWA, the US Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) and US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) jointly define wetlands as “those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, the prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions (Corps 33 CFR 328.3 and EPA 40 CFR 230.3).” This definition is currently the standard for jurisdictional wetland delineation. To be a jurisdictional wetland and therefore fall under federal and state regulatory limitations, an ecological community must exhibit three wetland characteristics: (1) wetland hydrology, (2) hydric soils, and (3) hydrophytic vegetation. Hydrology Because hydrology is the most independent variable among the three-wetland criteria, its influence is extremely important. Hydrologic fluctuations not only affect soil formation (Buol and Rebertus 1988) and vegetation growth (Hutchinson 1975), but also every wetland function. Wetland hydrology is described by the Corps as “inundation or saturation to the surface for at least 5% of the growing season in most years.” Saturation exists when the capillary fringe occurs within a major portion of the root zone (ie. within 12 inches of the soil surface). The growing season is defined as the portion of the year when soil temperature at 20 inches below the surface is above 41oF (5oC). Soils Wetland hydrology (saturation and/or inundation) results in soil anaerobiosis as biological and chemical processes deplete oxygen in the soil. Soils developed in anoxic conditions are called hydromorphic (Buol and Rebertus 1988) or hydric (Megonigal, Patrick, and Faulkner 1993). The Natural Resource Conservation Service defines hydric soils as “saturated, flooded or ponded long enough during FutureGen  –  Morgan County 1 Wetland Delineation the growing season to develop anaerobic conditions in the upper part of the soil (SCS 1991). Vegetation For most species of vegetation, oxygen deprivation is an extreme condition limiting survival. For certain adapted species, however, anoxic rooting conditions are an environmental condition allowing them the ecological advantage. The National Technical Committee for Hydric Soils (SCS 1991) defines hydrophytic vegetation as “plant life growing in water or on a saturated substrate that is at least periodically deficient in oxygen as a result of excessive water content.” The keystone to regulatory consideration of hydrophytic vegetation is inundation or saturation sufficient to exert a controlling influence on the plant species present. The Corps requires a predominance (>50%) of hydrophytic species. In January of 2001, a U.S. Supreme Court ruling added another characteristic as a requirement for a wetland to come under the Corps regulatory jurisdiction. In essence, a wetland is now required to have a surface water connection to a “navigable waterway” in order to be protected by the wetland provisions of the CWA. This ruling was reinforced in the 2006 U.S. Supreme Court case, United States v. Rapanos. State Wetlands Legislation The Illinois Interagency Wetland Policy Act of 1989 establishes a state goal that there be, “no overall net loss of the state's existing wetland acres or their functional values due to state supported activities” (20 ILCS 830). To accomplish this goal, the Act established a review process for all projects being pursued by a state agency or being accomplished with state funds, that have the potential to adversely affect a wetland. This review consists of a two part process. Projects must first be reviewed by the Division of Natural Resources Review & Coordination to confirm if a wetland impact will occur. If it is determined there will not be an impact, the project will be approved and funds may be released. If it is determined an impact is going to occur, the entity requesting approval must prepare a plan which details how it will compensate for the impact before the project may move forward (20 ILCS 830). All compensation plans must be approved by IDNR. The Act does not require wetlands to have a surface water connection to a navigable waterway in order for those wetlands to fall within the state's regulatory jurisdiction. The Illinois Rivers, Lakes, and Streams Act (615 ILCS 5) grants the IDNR Office of Water Resources (IDNR/OWR) the authority to regulate construction activities in floodplains. According to the Act, persons proposing such activities must first secure a permit from IDNR/OWR.  Related regulations recognize six northeastern counties (Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry, and Will) separately from the rest of "downstate" Illinois. The purpose of both programs is to, "protect the rights, safety, and welfare of private and public landowners by the regulation of floodway development, [because] construction activities which restrict a stream's capacity to carry flood flows may result in channel instability and increased flood damages to neighboring properties" (State of FutureGen  –  Morgan County 2 Wetland Delineation Illinois 1994). The downstate regulatory program requires permits for construction in the floodway of any stream serving a tributary area of 640 acres in urban areas or 6,400 acres in rural areas. The Northeastern Illinois Program does not limit the tributary area (State of Illinois 1994). IDNR/OWR uses a joint application form entitled Protecting Illinois Waters for its floodplain, public waters, and dam safety permits. STUDY AREA Beilschmidt Characterization Pad The Beilschmidt Characterization Pad is located approximately 6 miles north of Alexander, Illinois. This property occupies a 700 ft X 700 ft portion of the northeastern quarter of the southeastern quarter of Section 25, Township 16 North, Range 9 West, 3rd Prime Meridian, in Morgan County. The area of the site is approximately 11.25 acres. Topography within the site ranged between 540 and 570 feet msl. The property contains agricultural fields. Hoagland Characterization Pad The Hoagland Characterization Pad is also located approximately 6 miles north of Alexander, Illinois. This property occupies a 500 ft X 1340 ft portion of the eastern half of the northwestern quarter of Section 25, Township 16 North, Range 9 West, 3rd Prime Meridian, in Morgan County. The area of the site is approximately 15.38 acres. Topography within the site ranged between 540 and 570 feet msl. The property contains agricultural fields and grassed pasture. Beilschmidt Road Improvements Improvements to Beilschmidt Road include 5 truck pull-off areas and modifications to three curves. These improvements are necessary to allow large trucks to safely access Characterization Pads during construction. The first truck pull-off is located at the intersection of County Highway 123 and Beilschmidt Road, on the south side of Beilschmidt Road. Another pull-off is located approximately 1750 feet west of County Highway 123 on the south side of Beilschmidt Road. A third pull-off is located approximately 3540 feet west of County Highway 123 on the south side of Beilschmidt Road. A fourth pull-off is located approximately 1 mile west of County Road 123 on the south side of Beilschmidt Road. The fifth truck pull-off is located adjacent to the Hoagland Characterization Pad on the east side of Beilschmidt Road. Each of these pull-off sites measures approximately 30 ft by 150 ft. Between County Highway 123 and the existing farm access road (described below), Beilschmidt Road makes three 90o curves. Modifications to the road alignment would affect areas on the inside of these curves. The first corner area of impact includes a triangular area 150 feet wide by 150 feet long south and east of Beilschmidt road approximately 4500 feet west of County Highway 123. Approximately 500 feet south from the first curve, a second area of impact includes a triangular area 150 feet wide by 150 feet long on the north and west sides of Beilschmidt Road. Approximately 1350 feet further west, an area of impact approximately 150 feet wide by 150 feet long is located on the south and east sides of Beilschmidt Road. Farm Road Improvement and Extension The existing farm access road begins near the northwest corner of the Beilschmidt farm. This unnamed road extends south from its intersection with Beilschmidt Road for approximately 2580 feet along the wester border of the Beilschmidt farm. The road continues east, bisecting the Martin Property, approximately 2170 feet. An extension of this road northward approximately 870 feet, roughly parallel to the eastern border of the Beilschmidt farm, would allow access to the Beilschmidt Characterization Pad. PURPOSE & PROCEDURE The purpose of this investigation was to determine the extent of regulated wetlands within the proposed characterization pad sites, Beilschmidt Road improvement areas, and areas affected by the improvement and extension of an existing farm access road. The wetlands investigation was conducted in conformation with the guidelines found in the Corps’ Wetlands Delineation Manual (Environmental Laboratory 1987). The following tasks have been completed and the results are reported below: • Using available reference materials determine the presence of previously identified wetland hydrology, hydric soils, and/or hydrophytic vegetation. • Perform a field survey to ground-truth data gathered through available references. Preliminary Data Collection & Review Prior to conducting the wetland determination, the following resources were reviewed: US Fish & Wildlife Service National Wetland Inventory Map The National Wetland Inventory (NWI) map data (USFWS 2011) for the project site were examined to obtain a preliminary estimate of potential wetlands occurring at the proposed power plant site, related new construction areas, and the region of influence. Given that wetland identification criteria differ between the US Fish & Wildlife Service (USFWS) and the Corps, wetlands shown on a NWI map may not be under the jurisdiction of the Corps. Similarly, jurisdictional wetlands may not always be identified on NWI maps. Consequently, wetland presence based on NWI maps alone cannot be assumed to be an accurate assessment of jurisdiction. USGS Topographic Map The project site was superimposed on the corresponding topographic map (updated in 1990) (Microsoft 2011). These maps indicate topography, land use, water bodies, drainage ways, and other basic information pertinent to the project area. Of obvious importance for wetland research is the topographic and hydrologic information available on USGS map. National Cooperative Soil Survey Soils maps from the National Cooperative Soil Survey website (NCSS 2011) were examined to determine the characteristics of soils at the project site. County hydric soils lists from Morgan County were also reviewed prior to fieldwork. Field Survey Pedestrian surveys for jurisdictional wetlands and protected species were conducted on the subject property on April 27, 2011. Surveys were performed by Specialized Ecological Services’ Consulting Ecologist, Robert Rinella. Vegetation identification was performed by Specialized Ecological Services' Senior Botanist, James Lang. Qualifications are provided in Attachment A. Wetland field investigations were performed based on the guidelines of the 1987 Corps of Engineers Wetlands Delineation Manual (Environmental Laboratory 1987). The manual recommends a minimum of three transects through a project area aligned perpendicular to the longest axis. In this case, three transects were aligned perpendicular to the western border of both the Beilschimdt and Hoagland Characterization Pads. For the areas affected by improvements to Beilschmidt Road, the entire length of each area was traversed. Similarly, the entire length of the farm access road and its proposed extension were traversed. Because the ground cover of these areas was primarily agricultural weeds and pasture grass and because the areas' widths are limited, it was possible to observe any variance in habitat type while walking the length of the corridors. Within the proposed characterization pad sites, sample plots were established at each vegetation community along the transects. Routine Wetland Determination Data Forms were completed to characterize the jurisdictional wetland areas and adjacent uplands (Attachment B). At these locations, vegetation, hydrologic indicators, and soil conditions were recorded. In related areas affected by improvements to Beilschmidt Road and by the improvement and extension of an existing farm access road, Routine Wetland Determination Data Forms were completed for each vegetation community encountered. Vegetation Plant identifications and nomenclature were based on Flora of Missouri (Steyermark 1963).  The USFWS wetland indicator status of species follows Reed (1988). Soils Site-specific data were examined to determine the characteristics of soils of the project area. A Munsell soil color chart (Munsell Soil 1975) was used to describe soil color and other significant characteristics. Field observations were used to verify mapped soils survey information. Hydrology During field investigations, hydrologic indicators were observed and used to verify reference data shown on NWI maps, USGS topographic maps, soils surveys, and other sources. Specific field indicators may include, but are not limited to: inundation, saturation, watermarks, drift lines, sediment deposits, and water-stained leaves.  FutureGen  –  Morgan County 8 Wetland Delineation RESULTS Preliminary Data Collection & Review US Fish & Wildlife Service National Wetland Inventory Map Review of the National Wetland Inventory (NWI) map (USFWS 2011) revealed only those wetland areas associated with Indian Creek. These are all well outside the project area. NWI and USGS topographic maps are provided in Attachment C. USGS Topographic Map USGS topographic maps revealed the presence of an unnamed tributary to Indian Creek located on the eastern border of the Beilschmidt Property. This tributary is mapped flowing north across the Beilschmidt farm. This waterway is outside the project area; approximately 300 feet east of the Beilschmidt Characterization Pad boundary. National Cooperative Soil Survey Soils maps (NCSS 2011) show several soil types in the proposed project area. The soil map and county hydric soils list are included in Attachment D.  None of the soils associated with either the Beilschmidt Characterization Pad or Hoagland Characterization Pad are listed as hydric. A portion of of the Hoagland Characterization Pad site contains Clarksdale silt loam, 0 to 3 percent slopes which may contain hydric listed Virden soils in depressions.  None of the soils associated with Beilschmidt Road improvements are listed as hydric. A small area of the farm access road is mapped with a Sable Silty Clay Loam. This soil type is listed as hydric. Another portion of the farm access road is mapped with Ipava silt loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes. Ipava silt loam may contain hydric listed Denny, Sable, or Virden soils in depressions.  Field Survey Vegetation The Beilschmidt Characterization Pad supports a single vegetation community, agricultural row crops. The Hoagland Characterization Pad supports pasture composed of cool season grasses and common weeds. Project areas associated with improvements to Beilschmidt Road support cool-season grasses and weeds common in road right-of-way. The project areas associated with the improvement and extension of the existing farm access road contain primarily cool-season grasses and common weeds, but also areas of agricultural row crop.    Agricultural Row Crop This terrestrial community type is most common throughout the project area. In season, it would be planted in agricultural row crops. During field observations, there were no cultivated species present.  Only bare soil and common agricultural weeds were observed. Common species observed include Barbarea vulgaris, Capsella bursa-pastoris, Conium maculatum, Erigeron canadensis, Lamium amplexicaule, Rananculus abortivus, and Stellaria media. Grassed Pasture and Road Right-of-Way This terrestrial community was observed at the Hoagland Characterization Pad, along Beilschmidt Road, and along the farm access road. Various grasses (Festuca arundinaceae, Phalaris arundinacea, Setaria spp.) and broadleaf weeds (Barbarea vulgaris, Lamium amplexicaule, Rumex chrispus, Taraxacum officinale, and Thalaspia arvense) were the dominant herbaceous species.  No woody species were observed. Soils The soils observed coincide with those soils shown in the soil survey maps. The native vegetation of the majority of the project site would have been a mix of tall-grass prairie and deciduous hardwoods. Hydrology Indian Creek and its unnamed tributaries drain all areas of the proposed project site westward into the Illinois River. The Illinois River terminates in the Mississippi River. Summary of Jurisdictional Areas No  jurisdictional wetlands were observed within the project area. FutureGen  –  Morgan County 10 Wetland Delineation DISCUSSION The impact of proposed FutureGen Industrial Alliance, Inc project was evaluated for the presence of jurisdictional wetlands and other U.S. waters during April and May 2011 by Specialized Ecological Services. This work was conducted using the standards of practice for wetland delineation. No jurisdictional wetlands were observed in the study area. As proposed, the actions of this project should not have impacts to wetlands or require wetland fill permits. LIMITS OF RESEARCH As Cowardin et al. (1979) point out, “there is no single, correct, indisputable, ecologically sound definition for wetlands, primarily because of the diversity of wetlands and because the demarcation between dry and wet environments lies along a continuum.” Wetlands, by their nature are dynamic systems. A single field investigation cannot possibly enable any investigator to have an absolutely complete understanding of the complex ecological interactions and components of a site. However, by combining information collected from many sources at many different times, a clearer understanding is attainable. The results and conclusions of this investigation represent the integration of all information and data currently available. Literature and map data were combined with on-site reconnaissance to assure that this report is complete, comprehensive, and accurately reflects conditions at the subject property. Although every effort has been made to conduct this study according to the current standards of practice and to present the results clearly and completely, a one time sampling effort can only depict a ‘snap-shot’ of the complex biological, chemical, and ecological conditions at the study site. Sufficient support can be drawn from this sampling effort and associated analytical results, as well as from the scientific literature, for the discussion and conclusions provided herein. LITERATURE CITED 20 ILCS 830.  1989.

Our previous investigation, dated 25 May 2011, included two possible characterization pad areas (the Beilschmidt Property and the Hoagland Property), several truck pull-offs and road modifications on Beilschmidt Road, and widening and extending an existing farm access road. The project plan was recently modified to accommodate a temporary water line extending from Beilschmidt Road southward to the Beilschmidt characterization pad. Project Description The temporary waterline will begin just outside an existing water meter located south Beilschmidt Road approximately 3,250 feet west of County Road 123. An existing pipe has been stubbed out of the meter pit and is extending out of the ground. Above ground, the temporary waterline will be connected to the stub with a valve and a backflow preventer. The temporary water line will then extended approximately 3,077 feet southward on the grass surface immediately east of the agriculture field. Immediately east of the drilling pad the piping will turn westward into the agricultural field and extend to the pad where a second valve will be placed. In areas where the grass strip between the edge of cultivation and the top of the bank of the drainage ditch is greater than 10 feet a low ground pressure single seat all terrain vehicle will be used to transport pipe, fittings, and other necessary items. In other areas all materials will be hand carried. The water line will be either “Lay Flat Hose” or Schedule 40 PVC pipe. In either case, the pipeline will be staked with bent rebar or wooden stakes in order to keep the water line in place. Upon completion of the drilling operations the temporary water line, valves, backflow preventer and staking will be completely removed from site. No above-ground piping will remain. The only subsurface disturbance will be at the meter where the section of piping extending upwards from the pit will be cut off and capped below ground. STUDY AREA Temporary Water Supply to Beilschmidt Characterization Pad The temporary waterline will extend southward from an existing water meter located on the south side of Beilschmidt Road to the Beilschmidt Characterization Pad; a distance of approximately 3,077 feet. Activities related to the placement of this water line will affect the grass buffer zone immediately east of the agriculture field. The vegetation of this area is dominated by cool-season grass. Common weeds and trees are present but not prevalent. PURPOSE & PROCEDURE Pedestrian survey for the area described in this Addendum was completed on 1 June 2011 by Specialized Ecological Services’ personnel, Robert Rinella and James Lang and Patrick Engineering's, Jeff Deckard. As recommended by the 1987 Corps of Engineers Wetlands Delineation Manual (Environmental Laboratory 1987) the entire length of the proposed water supply pipeline was traversed. Sample plots were established at each vegetation community type. Each community type was characterized using Routine Wetland Determination Data Forms (Attachment A). Because the ground cover of the area was primarily pasture grass with common weeds and and because the area's width is limited, it was possible to observe any variance in vegetation community type while walking the length of the area. Otherwise, the purpose and procedure of this research are identical to that described in our original report, dated 25 May 2011. RESULTS Preliminary Data Collection & Review National Wetland Inventory maps, USGS topographic map, and soils surveys used for this research are identical to those described in our original report, dated 25 May 2011. US Fish & Wildlife Service National Wetland Inventory Map No new data. USGS Topographic Map No new data. National Cooperative Soil Survey Now new data. Field Survey Vegetation The temporary water line area-of-impact supports a grassed buffer zone composed of cool season grasses and common weeds.  Trees are also intermittently present. Grassed  Buffer Zone Tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) is the most common species. All other species are present with clumped distribution. Other common herbaceous species include various grasses (Phalaris arundinacea, Setaria spp.) and broadleaf weeds (Solidago gigantea, Conium maculatum, Cirsium vulgare, Impatiens capensis, Ambrosia trifida, Thalaspi arvense). Woody species are present as isolated individuals or in small groupings (2-10 individuals). Common tree species include Maclura pomifera, Morus rubra and Gleditsia triacanthos. Soils The soils observed coincide with those soils shown in the soil survey maps. The native vegetation of the project site would have been tall-grass prairie. Hydrology No new data. Summary of Jurisdictional Areas No  jurisdictional wetlands were observed within the project area. FutureGen  –  Morgan County 5 Wetland Delineation – Addendum 1 DISCUSSION The impact of proposed FutureGen Industrial Alliance, Inc project was evaluated for the presence of jurisdictional wetlands and other U.S. waters during early-June 2011 by Specialized Ecological Services. This work was conducted using the standards of practice for wetland delineation. No jurisdictional wetlands were observed in the study area. As proposed, the actions of this project should not impact wetlands or require wetland fill permits. Although the non-jurisdictional grassed buffer is typically more than 10 feet wide, it is approximately 5 feet wide (between the tilled ground and the top of the unnamed tributary channel) at its thinnest point. Construction activity should be restricted to that smallest width to protect the integrity of the tributary channel. The grassed buffer is not jurisdictional wetland and its vegetation is not sensitive; however, this area does act as an important barrier, protecting the waterway. Construction impacts should be minimized. Materials could be hand delivered or delivered on a low ground pressure single seat all-terrain vehicle without adversely impacting the vegetation in this area. LITERATURE CITED Environmental Laboratory. 1987. “Corps of Engineers Wetlands Delineation Manual.” Technical Report Y-87-1.

Pasfield Springfield, IL 62704 ICF SURVEY METHODS 2012 Nocturnal audible surveys were conducted in March 2012, to determine the presence/absence of Illinois Chorus Frogs within the project boundaries. Surveys started after 19:30 hours on evenings with air temperatures over 50 degrees Fahrenheit, during times ICF’s were known to be out calling.  A known ICF reference site (Illinois Sands Area) was also monitored to confirm that ICFs were calling within this same region of Illinois.  For this study, areas south of Beardstown were used as the reference site. Surveys were conducted by automobile, by driving to each location, turning the automobile off and listen for breeding frogs calling.  Weather, temperature, time, and frog results were recorded from each survey point for this investigation. Survey points were laid out during daylight hours to locate possible ICF habitat and to confirm the ICF Habitat Model (IDNR 2009) locations (See Map #1).  The ICF Habitat Model was created by Illinois Department of Natural Resources in 2008 and 2009.  It is based on the presence of small ponds and hydric sandy soils and on the occurrence of a wet spring weather pattern. On the Meredosia Energy Center site, ten survey points were established: three along the Illinois River, two along the northern settling pond, and four along the east side of the plant (See Map #2) where the pipeline is to be located, to monitor for calling ICFs.   Along the proposed pipeline route, 30 survey points were established and monitored.  These included surrounding ICF Habitat Model areas and opportunistic points along 10-miles of the proposed pipeline alignment back through to the town of Chaplin on Illinois Route 67 (See Map #3 and 4). ICF SURVEY METHODS 2013 Nocturnal audible surveys were conducted in March 2013, to determine the presence/absence of Illinois Chorus Frogs within the project boundaries. Surveys started after 19:30 hours on evenings with air temperatures over 50 degrees Fahrenheit, during times ICF’s were known to be out calling.  A known ICF reference site (HS7) was also monitored to confirm that ICFs were calling within this same region of Illinois.  For this seasons study, areas east of Naples were used as the reference site. Surveys were conducted by automobile, by driving to each location, turning the automobile off and listen for breeding frogs calling.  Weather, temperature, time, and frog 2| Page results were recorded from each survey point for this investigation. Survey points were laid out during daylight hours to locate possible ICF habitat and to confirm the ICF Habitat Model (IDNR 2009) locations (See Map #1-3).  The ICF Habitat Model was created by Illinois Department of Natural Resources in 2008 and 2009.  It is based on the presence of small ponds and hydric sandy soils and on the occurrence of a wet spring weather pattern. Since no ICF’s were documented on the Meredosia Energy Center site, two survey points were established around the Plant, to monitor for calling ICFs.   Along the proposed pipeline route, 40 survey points were established and monitored.  These included surrounding ICF Habitat Model areas and opportunistic points along the entire pipeline route to the injection site (See Map #1, #2 and 3). RESULTS 2012 Surveys were conducted on the evenings of 15, 19, 23 & 24 March 2012.  Only three species of amphibians were heard calling during this investigation.  The Plains Leopard Frog, Rana blairi was heard calling from the Illinois River.  The American Toad, Bufo americanus, and the Western Chorus Frog, Pseudacris triserrata, were heard calling from the very southern settling pond and from a small creek (points 29) north of Chaplin.   No ICFs were documented during this survey, including within the ICF Habitat Model zones. This is possibly due to high temperatures and drought conditions present this spring.  All historic occurrences occur within the predicted ICF Habitat Model zones.  The ICF Habitat model shows no potential habitat to be impacted along the alignment except for P-133.  I believe this is a slight mapping error and P-133 should be connected to the settling pool on the plant.  Also within this survey, all ICF Habitat Model areas that could be driven to, were investigated for a three-mile buffer of the Meredosia Energy Center and the first 10 miles of the proposed CO2 pipeline route.  One perceived flaw in the ICF Habitat Model is that it does not consider roadside or agricultural ditch habitat.  There is one potential ICF Habitat east of the Meredosia Energy Center along Yeck Road.  There is a small agricultural ditch south of where Yeck Road curves north. It did not have much water present this spring, but during a wet year, this would be a possible breeding pool. Two other ICF investigators from IDNR have monitored that same ditch for the past two years and had negative results for the presence of ICF’s (Personal conversation with Eric Golden 2012). RESULTS 2013 Surveys were conducted on the evenings of 2, 9 & 10 April 2013.  Only Four species of amphibians were heard calling during this investigation.  The Plains Leopard Frog, Rana blairi, the American Toad, Bufo americanus, and the Western Chorus Frog, Pseudacris triserrata, and the Illinois Chorus Frog, Pseudacris streckeri illinoensis, were heard calling during this survey period  Five breeding pools with ICFs were documented during this survey, including within the ICF Habitat Model zones. Most of these were historic breeding pool sites in this area.  This is 3|Page possibly due to low temperatures and wet spring conditions present this spring.  The ICF Habitat model shows no potential habitat to be impacted along the alignment except for P-133.  I believe this is a slight mapping error and P-133 should be connected to the settling pool on the plant.  After investigating this we found a small wetland north of the south cooling pool.  None of the pools appeared to contain suitable ICF habitat present.  Also within this survey, most ICF Habitat Model areas that could be driven to, were investigated for a three-mile buffer of the Meredosia Energy Center. One perceived flaw in the ICF Habitat Model is that it does not consider roadside or agricultural ditch habitat. The small agricultural ditch south of where Yeck Road curves north was investigated and no ICF’s were documented.   DISCUSSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS 2013 Five breeding pools containing ICFs were documented in this survey.  The closest active breeding pool observed during this survey was P-132, a small wetland from a historic barrow sand pit located east of the Old Naples Road (See survey sample #1).   As for P-133, I do not believe it to have proper ICF habitat because of its lack of any wetland vegetation or sandy soils. No other habitat was observed on the Meredosia Energy Center site, the proposed pipeline alignment, or the bluffs on the east side of the Illinois River Valley.).  4|Page 5|Page 6|Page 7|Page 8|Page AMEREN POWER PLANT ILLINOIS CHORUS FROG DATA SHEET LaGesse & Associates Inc. 2013 DATE: __4/2/2013______ INVESTIGATORS: ___V.

D-1 1.0 Project The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is preparing an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the FutureGen 2.0 Project. The FutureGen Project is a public-private partnership, with costs shared by DOE, the FutureGen Industrial Alliance (Alliance), and other project partners. The Project consists of the repowering of an existing electricity generator with clean coal technologies integrated with a pipeline that would transport carbon dioxide (CO2) to a sequestration site where it would be injected and stored in a deep geologic formation. As currently envisioned, the Alliance would be responsible for constructing and operating an advanced oxy-combustion system to repower an existing steam turbine generator (Unit 4) at the Meredosia Energy Center (MEC) in west-central Illinois, which is currently owned by Ameren Energy Resources. A concentrated and compressed CO2 stream produced in the process would be transferred to a pipeline for transmission to the Alliance’s proposed storage location located approximately 30 miles east of the Meredosia Energy Center. Historic occurrences of the Illinois state threatened regal fritillary butterfly, Speyeria idalia, (Drury), have been recorded in the Illinois River Valley in the vicinity of the proposed project.  This study was conducted to document the occurrence of the regal fritillary and potential habitat within the project area and to assist in any future permitting required for the FutureGen project.  The investigation also documented occurrences of state listed species within the project area.  This report addresses both the Meredosia Energy Center and the proposed pipeline corridor in the Illinois River Valley. 2.0 Project Locations This project lies just south of the town of Meredosia, Illinois, and crosses the east side of the Illinois River Valley heading across to the bluff line and across central Morgan County in Illinois. The project is located within the Illinois/Mississippi Sand Areas Natural Division and portions of the Grand Prairie Natural Division (IDNR 2005; Schwegman 1997).  The sand prairies of Meredosia, Illinois, are some of the most southerly sand prairies in Illinois.  Suitable habitat for the regal fritillary butterfly occurs in the Illinois River Valley and areas east to the bluff-line.  These areas were the focus of the surveys and this report. 2.1 Meredosia Energy Center The Meredosia Energy Center is located just south of the town of Meredosia, Illinois, and covers 263 acres along the east side of the Illinois River.  The features of the plant include a power plant, coal stock pile areas, cinder areas, and settling pools.  The plant area includes approximately 72 acres of degraded sand prairie.  This 72-acre site was investigated for the presence/absence of the regal fritillary butterflies. 2.2 Pipeline The proposed pipeline runs east from the MEC to central Morgan County.  It is proposed to cross a 62-acre Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) grassland field in the Illinois River Valley that has been planted with warm season grasses.  This is the only suitable regal fritillary habitat within the proposed pipeline route.  A 300 foot corridor (15.7 acres) of the planting was investigated for the presence/absence of the regal fritillary butterflies.  3.0 Regal Fritillary Butterfly 3.1 Introduction-Regal Fritillary Butterfly The regal fritillary has been historically documented from 33 states.  Historic loss, fragmentation, and degradation of prairie landscape have been the primary factors contributing to the decline of the regal fritillary populations.  The regal fritillary is listed as endangered in Michigan, New York, Ohio, Indiana, and Wisconsin; and is listed as threatened in Illinois; and is listed as a species of concern in four states.  It is presumed extirpated in seven states, and possibly extirpated in an additional ten states (Selby 2007).  Regal fritillary populations have declined in Illinois, causing this butterfly to be listed as threatened under the Illinois Endangered Species Act (Herkert 1992).  Currently, Mason and Cass counties contain the largest known metapopulations of regal fritillary butterflies in Illinois (Wiker 2004).  Large populations exist around the towns of Meredosia, Beardstown, and Arenzville, in Cass and Morgan Counties, in the Illinois River Valley.  The purpose of this study was to document suitable habitat within the study area by surveying the occurrences of regal fritillary butterflies and their host plant populations.  3.2 Natural History of the Regal Fritillary The large strong flying regal fritillary is a member of the family Nymphalidae, or brush-footed butterflies.  Its flight dates are 4 June–16 September (Sedman and Hess 1985; Wiker 2004).  In the spring, larvae begin feeding on birds-foot violet (Viola pedata L.), arrow-leaved violet (Viola sagittata Air), and prairie violet (Viola pedatifida G. Don) (WDNR 2000) and they have been documented to use the annual, Johnny jump-up (Viola rafinesquii Greene) in central Illinois (LaGesse et.al. 2004).  Larvae of Lepidoptera, in general, are very specific in their feeding requirements and, in many cases, require a specific species (Ehrlich and Raven 1964). After feeding and completing six instars, they pupate.  In early June adult males emerge and are followed by adult females approximately two weeks later (Scudder 1889; Kopper 2001).  Mating begins soon after female emergence with each female copulating once.  After two weeks of mating, the male regal fritillaries die (Nagel et al. 1991; Kopper 2001), and fertilized females enter reproductive diapause for the next two months (Kopper et al. 2001).  During this period females nectar on common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca L.), butterfly milkweed (Asclepias tuberosa L.), dogbane (Apocynum spp.), bull thistle (Cirsium pumilum (Nutt.) Spreng.), and boneset (Eupatorium perfoliatum L.) (Sedman and Hess 1985; LaGesse et al. 2006).  The diapause period between mating and oviposition is the most precarious time in the life span of the regal fritillary.  If drought, disease, predation, parasitism, or other environmental catastrophes occur, the entire brood for the following year is at risk.  By early September females begin oviposition, depositing over 1,000 eggs in clusters on violets (Wagner et al. 1997; Kopper 2001).  The eggs hatch and larva feed on the egg case and enter winter dormancy (Scudder 1889; Mattoon et al. 1971; Kopper 2001; Zercher 2002). 3.3 Adult Regal Fritillary Census Report Surveys were conducted 15 times during the growing season of 2012.  Surveys started on May29th and proceeded approximately once until September 10th.  Adult regal fritillary butterflies (♀ and ♂) were observed emerging and flying from May 29th through July 3rd on the four survey transects. Methods Four transects were established in areas identified in the violet surveys with an emphases on areas where regal fritillary butterflies might be observed. Transects were established within the degraded sand prairies and CRP grass planting fields of the Meredosia Energy Center and the pipeline right-of-way (ROW).  Methods of observation followed Panzer (1992) and Zercher et al. (2002).  The observer was trained to walk at a uniform pace and observe butterflies up to 10 meters on each side of the transects.  All butterflies encountered were identified to the species level and the sex of each regal fritillary was recorded.  Behaviors of each individual fritillary observed were recorded. Transects were walked once per week from 8:00 to 14:00 and observations were ceased when temperatures rose over 90 degrees Fahrenheit.   Figure 1. Map showing locations of Transects 1–4. Temperature and wind speed data were collected with a Kestrel ™ 3000 weather kit before and after each transect was surveyed and cloud cover was estimated at the beginning of each walk. Time was recorded at the beginning and end of each transect walked (See Survey Tables).  Nectar plants were noted for each transect segment (See Bloom Period Table).  Observations were made through the growing season of 2012 (May 29th through July 3rd).  Nomenclature for butterflies follows Miller and Brown 1981, and nomenclature for plants follows Mohlenbrock 2002. 3.3.1 Results A total of 57 regal fritillary butterflies were observed during the surveys conducted May 29th through July 3rd, 2013. Results for each transect are described below and summarized in Table 1. Table 1. Summary of Butterfly Adult Census Results Transect #1 Transect #1 was established in the southeast corner of the Ameren Power Plant property in the degraded sand prairies where the highest densities of violets had been documented earlier that year.  Transect #1 was approximately 1293 meters in length.  A total of nine regal fritillary butterflies were observed on this transect.  Five male regal fritillary butterflies were observed emerging and establishing territorial patrols on 29 May and three males were observed flying territorial patrols on 6 June.  One female was observed emerging on 15 June.  No regal fritillary butterflies were observed on this transect after the 15 June date. Transect # 2 Transect #2 was established in the middle of the Ameren Power Plant property in degraded sand prairie areas where violet populations had been documented earlier that year.  These areas were located around the old railroad tracks, the communication tower, coalfields, and fuel tank areas.  This transect was approximately 1699 meter in length.  A total of two regal fritillary butterflies were observed on this transect.  One male regal fritillary butterfly was observed on 15 June, flying on territorial patrol, and one female was flushed on 3 July.  No regal fritillary butterflies were observed after the 3 July date.  Transect #3 Transect #3 was established in the northern 300 feet of the 62-acre CRP grass planting field where violet populations had been documented earlier that year.  This transect was approximately 989 meters in length.  A total of 45 regal fritillary butterflies were observed on this transect.  Twenty-three regal fritillary butterflies were observed on 29 May, flying on territorial patrols.  On 6 June, eleven male regal fritillary butterflies were observed flying on territorial patrols and two female regal fritillary butterflies were observed being flushed on maiden flights.  On 15 June, two male regal fritillary butterflies were observed flying on territorial patrols and one female regal fritillary butterfly was observed nectaring.  On 19 June, four female regal fritillary butterflies were observed flying in search of nectar.  On 26 June, one female regal fritillary butterfly was observed flying in search of nectar, On 2 July one female regal fritillary butterfly was observed flying in search of nectar.  No regal fritillary butterflies were seen after the 3 July. Transect #4 Transect #4 was established in the northeast corner of the Ameren Power Plant.  These were the sand prairies associated with the main entrance of the Power Plant where violet populations had been documented earlier that year.  This transect was approximately 673 meters in length.  Only one female regal fritillary butterfly was observed nectaring on 26 June on this transect.  No regal fritillary butterflies were observed after the 26 June date. 3.3.2 Discussion Regal fritillary butterflies were documented on and near the Ameren Power Plant property in May and June of 2012, but they had moved off-site by 11 July 2012 (author’s observations).  Regal fritillary butterflies were observed in the Beardstown area in July and then were not observed throughout the rest of the butterfly season in 2012.  The regal fritillary butterfly was not documented returning to lay its eggs in areas near or in violet populations on-site.  At this moment, we feel that due to the 2012’s extreme drought, that there are currently no regal fritillary butterflies present in the Meredosia area.  Drought has been documented to have negative effects for this species (Herkert, 1992).  The regal fritillary butterfly is a large strong flier and we feel that they will repopulate this area over time.  We will continue to conduct surveys for the presence/absence of the regal fritillary butterfly throughout the next few years. 4.0 Violet Population Survey Methods All violets populations were documented on the MEC and throughout the northern 300 foot end of the CRP field (15.7 of 62 acres).  The perimeter and area of each violet population were determined.  Wire flags were used to mark the perimeters of all populations to facilitate violet monitoring and mapping.  Area mapping was completed using a Trimble® Pro-XR backpack global positioning system (GPS) with sub-meter accuracy to determine the size of each violet population (LaGesse et al. 2004). Violet populations were classified based on patch size.  Areas that were >1,000/m² were classified as “Large”, patches from 100-1000/m² were classified as “medium”, and patches <100/m² were classified as “small”. Then using a random numbers chart, populations within each size class were selected for intensive transect sampling of violets (described below).  Violets were also inspected for leaf damage and flagged for larval investigations if damage was observed. In selected populations, random one meter-square plots were established for sampling, violets, cactus, woody plants, grasses, other forbs, thatch and/or bare ground.  Twenty plots were sampled in large violet populations, 10 plots were sampled in medium-sized populations, and 5 plots were sampled in small populations. A cover class was assigned for each plant group, using a modified Daubenmire method to determine plant percent frequency (%), relative frequency (Rel. Freq.), relative cover (Rel. Cov.) and Importance Values (IV) (Rel. Cov. + Rel. Freq.) for each plant group (Ebinger 1998). 4.1 Results–Violet Population Study Johnny jump-up plants (Viola rafinesquii) dominated areas that have not been disturbed for 7 years or more.  A new road was constructed in 2005 on the MEC property, and the disturbance from that project limits the current distribution of Johnny jump-up on the plant property.  A series of aerial photographs shows the past disturbance history (Google Earth 2012) (See photos # 1–5).  The new road was planted with prairie grasses and flowers.  That planting has matured, but lacks any colonization of Johnny jump-up plants.  Johnny jump-up plants seem to be associated with a thick grass thatch build up.  The author has observed a thatch layer seems to repress other spring plant competition and this is when Johnny jump-up can reach high plant densities. A total of 104 populations of Johnny jump-up, and only one population of Viola pratincola (Greene), common blue violet (found in the timber on the MEC) were located during this investigation.  Sixty-five violet populations were documented inside the Meredosia Energy Center and 7 populations outside the Meredosia Energy Center (See maps # 1, 2, and 4) and 33 violet population in the 300 foot northern edge of the CRP prairie field (See maps # 3 and 5).  A total of 14 large (>1,000m2) populations were documented on the MEC property.  A total of 42 medium (100-1,000m2) violet populations were documented: 33 on the Meredosia Energy Center property, 5 outside the power plant property and 4 in the CRP field.  Forty-nine small violet populations were documented: 18 on the MEC property, 3 outside the MEC property (3 populations) and 28 in the CRP field.  Five- large, 16- medium, and 18 small violet populations were selected for plot sampling. Among populations on MEC property, there was considerable variation in the density of violets and habitat conditions within violet patches.  Violet density and IV of violets were somewhat lower in small patches.  Evidence of grazing of violets (by larval regal fritillaries, likely also rabbits, deer, etc.) was higher weakly related to population size but more frequently observed in large populations (27%) compared to medium (16%) or small populations (12.5%).  Ranges of vegetation IV’s are provided in the tables below. Table 2.  Summary Data of IV’s from Plots within Meredosia Energy Center Violet Density  Population size  (per sq meter)  IV Grass  IV Forbs  IV Thatch  IV Violets  Large (n=5)  12.5–54.8  37.4–97.3  32.6–60.2  20.8–51.2  14.9–44.1  Medium (n=10)  8.6–102.1  28.3–80.5  33.9–80.1  24.4–39.1  18.4–43.8  Small (n=10)  3.8–33.8  35.1–84.6  32.9–91.7  23.7–37.8  13.6–30.1  Table 3.

Habitat conditions from populations outside the Meredosia Energy Center were even more variable than those within.  Grazing was not observed in any of the medium populations, but was observed in 20% of small populations in the pipeline area. The author observed that areas with violet densities of 40 violets per square meter appeared to have enough violet density to facilitate habitat for regal fritillary butterflies, with 33% of all large plots sampled had over 40 violets per meter and 37% of all medium plots sampled (See Table 4). Table 4.  Percent of Plots Sampled that had 40 Violets or more Per Square Meter MEC Large  MEC Med  MEC Small  Pipeline Med  Pipeline Small  Plots > 40 violet/m²  33%  25%  10%  57%  25%  (N=100)  (N=100)  (N=50)  (N=60)  (N=40)  4.2 Larval Habitat on Meredosia Energy Center/Pipeline Properties Male regal fritillary butteries were observed emerging on 24 & 25 May 2012 and females on 4 and 6 June 2012 on the Meredosia Energy Center and pipeline properties.  On the Meredosia Energy Center site male and female regal butterfly emergent flights were observed from violet populations 1.11, 1.27, 1.28, and 1.34.  On the pipeline prairie site male and female regal butterfly emergent flights were observed from violet populations 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.13, 2.21, 2.27, 2.25, 2.31, and 2.32 on the same dates.  On 4 June 2012, I was accompanied with Tim Kelley, Natural Heritage Biologist IDNR and we walked through the pipeline prairie and observed female regal butterflies emerging throughout the rest of the pipeline field.  Later that same day an investigation throughout the surrounding area was established including other CRP fields and degraded sand prairies north and south of Meredosia.  Ten other CRP fields and sand prairies were observed from the road to have emerging regal fritillary butteries (See Map #6).  All CRP fields documented were warm season prairie plantings that were seven years old or more in their CRP contracts (Pers. Conv. Eric Golden IDNR 2012).  This follows the same pattern of stability and lack of disturbance that I have observed at the sand prairies at the Meredosia Energy Center and the pipeline prairie. Other fritillary butterflies were observed during this investigation.  The variegated fritillary butterfly, Euptoita claudia, was the dominate fritillary observed follow by the regal and a few great spangle fritillary’s, Speyeria cybele, were observed in both areas.  5.0 Johnny Jump-Up Investigation 5.1 Methods During the late spring, Johnny jump-up plants were collected to document flower production, investigate seed production, and collect violet seeds.  Johnny jump-up is an annual violet species.  Like all violets, its seeds are expelled from its seed pods once the pods dry.  In order to investigate seed production and collect seeds, violet plants were hand-pulled from the MEC site.  Plants were later separated into five gallon buckets with cloth covers so that the plants could continue to dry and the seeds could be captured in the buckets.  For the Johnny jump-up plant investigation, 36 plants that had all of their stems and intact roots were pressed and dried for later investigation. 5.2 Results – Johnny Jump-Up Investigation Thirty-three violet specimens were collected for this investigation.  Only plant specimens that had all stems and intact roots were used.  These specimens were pressed, dried and later measured and counted.  Of the violets sampled, they had an average height of 208.03 millimeters, with a range of 170–260 millimeters tall.  The violets sampled had an average 15.1 flowers per plant and had a range of 4–35 flowers per plant.  Each flower produced 27 seeds per flower, 9 seeds per ovary.  For Johnny jump-up plants, one plant could produce from 108 to 948 seeds in one year, with an average of 407 seeds produced per plant.  Approximately 12 ounces of Johnny jump-up seed was collected during this investigation. 6.0 Astragalus distortus, Bent-Leave Milkvetch Figure 2. Bent-Leave Milk Vetch, Photo by V. LaGasse During investigation of the violet species on the Meredosia Energy Center, three subpopulations of the Illinois State Endangered plant, Astragalus distortus, Bent-Leaved Milk Vetch were documented.  This perennial, tap-rooted herb is currently known from only three counties (Mason, Cass, and Morgan) in Illinois with only six known populations (IESPB 2004).  The Meredosia Energy Center population is a new documented population.  The three subpopulations occur near the front gate and along the east fence line near the front gate.  The distribution appears to be scattered along the disturbance of the road construction for the haul road and entrance gate that was constructed in 2005-2006.  A total of 95 plants were documented during the week of 23 April through 25 April 2012.  All plants were flagged and there locations were mapped using the Trimble Pro-X GPS.  Two plants were collected, dried and pressed as vouchers.  There are no state laws to protect state listed plant species in Illinois.  Therefore, preservation and protection of these plant species is the responsibility of the landowner.  There are only seven known populations of this species currently known to exist in Illinois, including the population on the Meredosia Energy Complex. If possible, avoiding the known population of Astragulus distortus during project activities at the Meredosia Energy Complex is recommended.  If the population will be impacted during construction and operation activities, it is recommended that the project work with IDNR to move the plants prior to construction and/or collect seed for future plantings.  Figure 3. Map showing the distribution of Bent-Leave Milkvetch, Meredosia Energy Center 2012. 7.0 Discussions  Regal fritillary habitat did not seem to depend on violet population patch size, but there is a relationship between violet density and the presence of the butterfly.  Violet populations with densities of 40 violets per square meter or more were found to be possible regal habitat.  Variegated fritillary butterflies were observed utilizing most violet populations and the Great spangled fritillary butterflies were observed from both study sites.  Both of these species host on any violet species, and in Morgan County they appear to be utilizing the annual Johnny jump-up violet.  7.1 Recommendations The FutureGen II project may impact potential regal fritillary habitat.  The following recommendations are made to avoid, minimize, and mitigate impacts to the regal fritillary that might result from project activities: 1. When possible, avoid documented regal fritillary habitat destruction during design and layout of the project elements (e.g., laydown yard, access road) 2. If documented areas of potential regal fritillary habitat will be impacted with this project,  adjacent areas, with mature grass stands and a developed thatch layer, should be over seeded with Johnny jump-up seed to mitigate project impacts.  Based on the findings of this study, a seed rate of 40 seeds per square meter is adequate.  Restoration/mitigation ratios will be determined in the Conservation Plan for this project.  This will be written with input from Illinois Department of Natural Resources.  3. All contractors and employees working on the project should be trained to recognize the Regal Fritillary; to understand its significance to the project and the public; and be instructed how to respond to an observation or encounter with this species. 4. All sightings of possible or actual regal fritillaries during project activities should be reported to IDNR. 5. In areas where the regal fritillary is present, during the construction phase project, vehicles should reduce speed to minimize the risks of taking butterflies through collision, or find alternate routes posing less risk. 7.2 Acknowledgments I wish to thanks, Jeff Walk, The Nature Conservancy, for assisting with sampling protocols and statistics reviews and Ted Prescott, Illinois Environmental Protection Agency for assistance with GPS and GIS issues with this study.

The current proposed action involvestheinstallation ofameteorological tower and soil-gas collection network in support of the FutureGen 2.0 Morgan County carbon sequestration site. The network will provide samples of soil gas for evaluating baseline CO2 concentrations and, once site operations begin, ameans of assessing possible increases in CO2 concentrationorco-injectedtracercompounds. Thenetworkincludesonemeteorologicaltower and seven soil-gas monitoring chambers. The EndangeredSpecies Act of 1973(as amended),16USC1531-1544 The Endangered Species Act (16 USC 1531-1544) provides for the conservation of threatened and endangeredplants and animals and thehabitats in which they are found. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) maintains a list of endangered and threatened species. Species includebirds, insects, fish, amphibians, reptiles, mammals, crustaceans, flowers,grasses,andtrees. Thelawprohibits anyaction, administrative or real, that results in a “taking” of listed species or an adverse impact to their habitat. Likewise, import, export, interstate, and foreign commerce of listed species are all prohibited. EndangeredSpeciesProtection Act of 1972,520ILCS 10/11 TheIllinoisEndangeredSpeciesProtectionAct(520ILCS10/11)isadministeredbythe Illinois Department of Natural Resources, Endangered Species Protection Board.

Planned coordinates are 90.060917W and 39.813090N. Soil disturbance for the meteorological tower includes one concrete footing, approximately2feetwide,2feetlong,and3feetdeep. Also,apadoflandscapepavers (approximately 4feet wide by4feet long) willbe used to minimize vegetative growth around the tower and solar panel. Soil-Gas Monitoring Network The soil-gas monitoring network will consist of six spatially distributed monitoring locations(SG-1throughSG-6,Illustration2),andoneadditionallocationatthesiteofan abandonedoilandgaswell(SG-OGW-1,Illustration2). Asecondabandonedwell,SGOGW-2,willbeaccessedforaone-timesoilgasmeasurementbutnopermanentsoilgas collector will be installed. The soilgasmonitoringpoints SG-1 throughSG-6are located adjacent to countyroads on what is thought to be the public right–of-way between the road surface and private property. However, selected locations may actually extend onto private property. All locations are sited on high ground where saturation of the soil is least likely to occur. Monitoring point SG-OGW-1 is located in the middle of a fenced pasture. Thesoildisturbancecaused by installation ofthesoil-gasmonitoringcollectorateach sitewillbe approximately2 feetwide,2 feetlong,and 3 feetdeep. Illustration 1:Proposed meteorologicaltowerlocation. Illustration 2:Proposed locations ofsoil-gas monitoringpoints. FutureGen – Meteorological Tower & Soil_Gas Monitoring 5 Protected Species Survey PURPOSE&PROCEDURE A survey for protected species and their critical habitat was conducted using best professional practice. BoththeUSFishandWildlifeServiceandIllinois DepartmentofNaturalResources, DivisionofEcosystemsandEnvironmentwerecontactedforalistofpotentialprotectedspecies. Based on this list, the flora and fauna of the proposed impact area were surveyed. PreliminaryData Collection &Review Prior to conducting theprotected species survey, the Illinois NaturalHeritageDatabase was reviewed using the EcoCAT website (IDNR 2011a) and an inquiry to the IDNR Division of Ecosystems and Environment. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife's “County Distribution of Federally Threatened, Endangered, Proposed and Candidate Species (USFWS 2011)” was also reviewed. FieldSurvey Pedestrian surveys for jurisdictional wetlands and protected species were conducted on the subject property on November 1, 2011. Surveys were performed by Specialized EcologicalServices’ConsultingEcologist,RobertRinella. Vegetationidentificationwas performed by Specialized Ecological Services' Senior Botanist, James Lang. Qualifications are provided in Attachment A. RESULTS PreliminaryData Collection &Review The Illinois Department of Natural Resources website lists 14 state and/or federally protected species as potentially occurring in Morgan County (Table 1) (IDNR 2011b). Consultation with the Ecological Compliance Assessment Tool, “EcoCAT”, found no record of State-listed threatened or endangered species in the vicinity of the project location. Genus species Agalinis skinneriana Bartramia longicauda Boltonia decurrens1 Buchnera americana Fundulus dispar Fusconala ebena Hesperia ottoe Lanius ludovicianus Melanthium virginicum Polygala incarnata Pseudacris illinoensis Schoenoplectus hallii Speyeria idalia Tropidoclonion lineatum Common name pale false foxglove upland sandpiper decurrent false aster blue hearts starhead topminnow ebonyshell ottoe skipper loggerhead shrike branchflower pink milkwort Illinois chorus frog Hall's bulrush regal fritillary lined snake State Status threatened endangered threatened threatened threatened threatened endangered endangered threatened endangered threatened threatened threatened threatened Table 1: Threatened and endangered species potentially occurring in Morgan County(asofSeptember 13,2011). The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's “County Distribution of Federally Threatened, Endangered, Proposed and Candidate Species (USFWS 2011)” lists the Threatened decurrent false aster (Boltonia decurrens) with a range that includes Morgan County. USFWS (2011) also lists the Endangered Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis) with “potential habitatstatewide”butnoknownoccurrenceinMorganCounty. Finally,USFWS(2011) lists the Threatened eastern prairie fringed orchid (Platanthaera leucophaea) with an historic range that includes Morgan County. Lah (2003) notes that the orchid once occurred in 33 counties of northern Illinois but is now only found in 9. There are no known occurrences in Morgan County (IDNR 2011c). 1Boltonia decurrens is also Federally threatened. Of the protected species known to inhabit Morgan County, noneare known by state or federal authorities to inhabit the subject area. None of these species were observed during the site visits.  Because no impacts are expected, no mitigation is required. FieldSurvey No state or federally protected species were observed during field investigation. The meteorological tower site supports cool-season grasses and common weeds. Various grasses(Festuca arundinaceae, Phalaris arundinacea, Setaria spp.)andbroadleafweeds (e.g. Plantago rugelii, Taraxacum officinale, and Trifolium spp.) were the dominant herbaceous species.  No woody species were observed.  Soil-Gas monitoring sites, SG-1-SG-6 as well as SG-OGW-1 supported cool-season grasses and common weeds. Various grasses (Festuca arundinaceae, Setaria spp.) and broadleaf weeds(e.g. Plantago rugelii, Taraxacum officinale, and Trifolium spp.) were the dominant herbaceous species.  No woody species were observed.  At the soil-gas monitoring site, SG-OGW-2,only remnants ofagricultural species were observed. In season, it would be planted in agricultural row crops. During field observations,therewerenolivecultivatedspeciespresent. Evidenceof Glycine max and Zea mays from previous plantings was observed. Decurrent False Aster (Boltonia decurrens) The decurrent false aster is a federally threatened species found on moist, sandy floodplainsandprairiewetlandsalongtheIllinoisRiver.Itreliesonperiodicfloodingto scourawayotherplants thatcompete forthesame habitat. Itrequiresdisturbed alluvial soils. Fieldsurveyrevealednosuitablehabitatforthedecurrentfalseasterwithintheproposed project area. Therefore, FutureGen Alliance has determined the project will have no effect on the decurrent false aster. Indiana Bat (Myotis sodalis) The federally endangered Indiana bat may be found throughout most of the eastern United States. Almost half of all Indiana bats hibernate in caves in southern Indiana. Other states within the current range of the Indiana bat include Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey,NewYork,NorthCarolina,Ohio,Oklahoma,Pennsylvania,Tennessee,Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia. Indiana bats weigh approximately one-quarter of an ounce with a wingspan of 9 to 11 inches. Their fur is dark-brown to black. They hibernate during winter in caves or, occasionally, in abandoned mines. During summer they roost under thepeelingbarkof dead and dying trees. The migratory bat forms nursery colonies under the loose bark and/or in cavities of trees during the summer months (between April 1 and September 30). Thesenurseriesarefrequentlywithinstreamcorridorswithwell-developedriparian woods. Field surveyrevealed nosuitable habitat fortheIndiana bat within theproposedproject area. Therefore, FutureGen Alliance has determined theproject willhave noeffect on the Indiana bat. Eastern Prairie FringedOrchid (Platanthaera leucophaea) Thefederally threatened eastern prairie fringed orchid requires sun and agrassyhabitat with little or no woody vegetation. The orchid can be found in mesic to wet prairies. Mostpopulationsoccurinsilt-loamsoilsderivedfromloessor glacialtill(Bowles1999). Reproduction from seed is accomplished only with pollination by hawkmoths (Bowles 1999). Seedling establishment is also associated with the development of mycorrhizae with soil-inhabiting fungi (Bowles 1999). The eastern prairie fringed orchid flowers from lateJune to early July. Flowering may last 7 to 10 days. Seed capsulesmature over the growing season and are dispersed by the wind from late August through September. Originallythespecieswaspresentin33Illinoiscountiesinthenortherntwothirdsofthe state. Today, 20 populations may occur in six Illinois counties “concentrated in the Chicago region, and single populations occur in cemetery prairies in eastern and west-central Illinois counties (Bowles 1999 citing Bowles et al 1992). The decline of this species is due to loss of habitat, mainly conversion of natural habitats to cropland and pasture and the drainage and development of wetlands. Other reasons for the current declineincludesuccession towoody vegetation,competitionfromnon-nativespeciesand over-collection. The eastern prairie fringed orchid was not observed during threatened and endangered speciesfieldsurveysinNovember2011(norwasitobservedinpreviousvisitstothesite in April of 2011). These surveys revealed no suitable habitat for the eastern prairie fringed orchid within the areas affected by proposed project actions. The Hoagland pasture, proposed as a site for the meteorological tower, may contain habitat suitable forthe eastern prairie fringed orchid. Soils atthis siteinclude silt-loam and silty clay loam soils formed in loess. (NRCS 2011).  The primary soil type of the area is Tama silt loam, 5to 10percent slopes, eroded(NCSS2011). The native vegetation community of this soil is tall grass prairie (NRCS 2011).  The Hoagland Property has been converted to pasture. Conversion of habitat to agriculture and pasture is one of the main causes of species decline. During field investigation, cool-season grasses were thedominant vegetation type. Regular mowing duringthegrowingseasonisrequiredtomaintainthisvegetationcommunity. Interview with thepropertyowner,ButchHoagland(Hoagland2011)revealed that thepropertyis mowed twice per year andbaledfor cattle fodder. Bowles (1999,citingSheviak1990) notes that mowing during the growing season may result in “failure to form the next season's flower bud, inducing dormancy or even death the following season.” Although suitable soils for the eastern prairie fringed orchid may occur on the project site, the habitat associated with these soils has been converted to cool-season pasture grasses. Maintenance activities associated with this vegetation communitypreclude the presenceoftheeasternprairiefringedorchid. Therearenorecordedoccurrencesofthis species nthevicinityof theproject and recent field surveys indicate it is notpresent in the project area (IDNR 2011b,c). Therefore, FutureGen Alliance has determined the project will have no effect on the eastern prairie fringed orchid. LITERATURECITED 16 USC 1531-1544.  1973.  “Endangered Species Act of 1973”.

Our investigation includes two possible characterization pad areas (the Beilschmidt Property and the Hoagland Property), several truck pull-offs and road modifications on Beilschmidt Road, and widening and extending an existing farm access road. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (as amended), 16 USC 1531-1544 The Endangered Species Act (16 USC 1531-1544) provides for the conservation of threatened and endangered plants and animals and the habitats in which they are found. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) maintains the list of endangered and threatened species. Species include birds, insects, fish, amphibians, reptiles, mammals, crustaceans, flowers, grasses, and trees. The law prohibits any action, administrative or real, that results in a “taking” of a listed species or an adverse impact to their habitat. Likewise, import, export, interstate, and foreign commerce of listed species are all prohibited. Endangered Species Protection Act of 1972, 520 ILCS 10/11 The Illinois Endangered Species Protection Act (520 ILCS 10/11) is administered by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, Endangered Species Protection Board. Procedures for coordination and consultation with the Board are described in the Illinois Administrative Code, Consultation Procedures for Assessing Impacts of Agency Actions on Endangered and Threatened Species. Species are protected if they meet at least one of four definitions: ● Federally Endangered Species: Any species that is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range. ● Federally Threatened Species: Any species that is likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range. ● State Endangered Species: Any species that is in danger of extinction as a breeding species in Illinois. ● State Threatened Species: Any breeding species that is likely to become a state endangered species within the foreseeable future in Illinois. This Act requires agencies of state and local governments to evaluate, through a consultation process with IDNR, whether actions authorized, funded, or implemented by them are likely to jeopardize the continued existence of Illinois-listed threatened or endangered species or are likely to result in the destruction or adverse modification of the designated essential habitat of such species. When an agency has so consulted, and its action is determined not to adversely impact any Illinois listed species or critical habitat of such species, the agency shall be deemed to have complied with its obligations under the Act. STUDY AREA Beilschmidt Characterization Pad The Beilschmidt Characterization Pad is located approximately 6 miles north of Alexander, Illinois. This property occupies a 700 ft X 700 ft portion of the northeastern quarter of the southeastern quarter of Section 25, Township 16 North, Range 9 West, 3rd Prime Meridian, in Morgan County. The area of the site is approximately 11.25 acres. Topography within the site ranged between 540 and 570 feet msl. The property contains agricultural fields. Hoagland Characterization Pad The Hoagland Characterization Pad is also located approximately 6 miles north of Alexander, Illinois. This property occupies a 500 ft X 1340 ft portion of the eastern half of the northwestern quarter of Section 25, Township 16 North, Range 9 West, 3rd Prime Meridian, in Morgan County. The area of the site is approximately 15.38 acres. Topography within the site ranged between 540 and 570 feet msl. The property contains agricultural fields and grassed pasture. Beilschmidt RoadImprovements Improvements to Beilschmidt Road include 5 truck pull-off areas and modifications to three curves. These improvements are necessary to allow large trucks to safely access Characterization Pads during construction. The first truck pull-off is located at the intersection of County Highway 123 and Beilschmidt Road, on the south side of Beilschmidt Road. Another pull-off is located approximately 1750 feet west of County Highway 123 on the south side of Beilschmidt Road. A third pull-off is located approximately 3540 feet west of County Highway 123 on the south side of Beilschmidt Road. A fourth pull-off is located approximately 1 mile west of County Road 123 on the south side of Beilschmidt Road. The fifth truck pull-off is located adjacent to the Hoagland Characterization Pad on the east side of Beilschmidt Road. Each of these pull-off sites measures approximately 30 ft by 150 ft. Between County Highway 123 and the existing farm access road (described below), Beilschmidt Road makes three 90o curves. Modifications to the road alignment would affect areas on the inside of these curves. The first corner area of impact includes a triangular area 150 feet wide by 150 feet long south and east of Beilschmidt road approximately 4500 feet west of County Highway 123. Approximately 500 feet south from the first curve, a second area of impact includes a triangular area 150 feet wide by 150 feet long on the north and west sides of Beilschmidt Road. Approximately 1350 feet further west, an area of impact approximately 150 feet wide by 150 feet long is located on the south and east sides of Beilschmidt Road. Farm RoadImprovement and Extension The existing farm access road begins near the northwest corner of the Beilschmidt farm. This unnamed road extends south from its intersection with Beilschmidt Road for approximately 2580 feet along the wester border of the Beilschmidt farm.  The road continues east, bisecting the Martin Property, approximately 2170 feet.  An extension of this road northward approximately 870 feet, roughly parallel to the eastern border of the Beilschmidt farm, would allow access to the Beilschmidt Characterization Pad. PURPOSE &PROCEDURE A survey for protected species and their critical habitat was conducted using best professional practice. Both the US Fish and Wildlife Service and Illinois Department of Natural Resources, Division of Ecosystems and Environment were contacted for a list of potential protected species. Based on this list, the flora and fauna of the proposed impact area were surveyed. Preliminary Data Collection &Review Prior to conducting the protected species survey, the Illinois Natural Heritage Database was reviewed using the EcoCAT website (IDNR 2011a) and an inquiry to the IDNR Division of Ecosystems and Environment. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife's “County Distribution of Federally Threatened, Endangered, Proposed and Candidate Species (USFWS 2011)” was also reviewed. Field Survey Pedestrian surveys for jurisdictional wetlands and protected species were conducted on the subject property on April 27, 2011. Surveys were performed by Specialized Ecological Services’ Consulting Ecologist, Robert Rinella. Vegetation identification was performed by Specialized Ecological Services' Senior Botanist, James Lang. Qualifications are provided in Attachment A. RESULTS Preliminary Data Collection &Review The Illinois Department of Natural Resources website lists 14 state and/or federally protected species as potentially occurring in Morgan County (Table 1) (IDNR 2011b). Consultation with the Ecological Compliance Assessment Tool, “EcoCAT”, found no record of State-listed threatened or endangered species in the vicinity of the project location. Genus species Agalinis skinneriana Bartramia longicauda Boltonia decurrens1 Buchnera americana Fundulus dispar Fusconala ebena Hespeia ottoe Lanius ludovicianus Melanthium virginicum Polygala incarnata Pseudacris illinoensis Schoenoplectus hallii Speyeria idalia Tropidoclonion lineatum Common name State Status pale false foxglove threatened upland sandpiper endangered decurrent false aster threatened blue hearts threatened starhead topminnow threatened ebonyshell  threatened  ottoe skipper  endangered  loggerhead shrike  endangered  branchflower  threatened  pink milkwort  endangered  Illinois chorus frog  threatened  Hall's bulrush  threatened  regal fritillary  threatened  lined snake  threatened  Table 1: Threatened and endangered species potentially occurring in Morgan County(asof April 12, 2011). The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's “County Distribution of Federally Threatened, Endangered, Proposed and Candidate Species (USFWS 2011)” lists the Threatened decurrent false aster (Boltonia decurrens) with a range that includes Morgan County. USFWS (2011) also lists the Endangered Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis) with “potential habitat statewide” but no known occurrence in Morgan County. Finally, USFWS (2011) lists the Threatened eastern prairie fringed orchid (Platanthaera leucophaea) with an historic range that includes Morgan County. Lah (2003) notes that the orchid once occurred in 33 counties of northern Illinois but is now only found in 9. There are no known occurrences in Morgan County (IDNR 2011c). 1Boltonia decurrens is also Federally threatened. Of the protected species known to inhabit Morgan County, none are known by state or federal authorities to inhabit the subject area. None of these species were observed during the site visits.  Because no impacts are expected, no mitigation is required. Field Survey No state or federally protected species were observed during field investigation. The Beilschmidt Characterization Pad supports a single vegetation community, agricultural row crops. Common species observed include Barbarea vulgaris, Capsella bursapastoris, Conium maculatum, Erigeron canadensis, Lamium amplexicaule, Rananculus abortivus, and Stellaria media. The Hoagland Characterization Pad and project areas associated with improvements to Beilschmidt Road support cool-season grasses and common weeds. Various grasses (Festuca arundinaceae, Phalaris arundinacea, Setaria spp.) and broadleaf weeds (Barbarea vulgaris, Lamium amplexicaule, Rumex chrispus, Taraxacum officinale, and Thalaspia arvense) were the dominant herbaceous species. No woody species were observed. The project areas associated with the improvement and extension of the existing farm access road contain primarily cool-season grasses and common weeds, but also areas of agricultural row crop. Decurrent False Aster (Boltonia decurrens) The decurrent false aster is a federally threatened species found on moist, sandy floodplains and prairie wetlands along the Illinois River. It relies on periodic flooding to scour away other plants that compete for the same habitat. It requires disturbed alluvial soils. Field survey revealed no suitable habitat for the decurrent false aster within the proposed project area. Therefore, FutureGen Alliance has determined the project will have no effect on the decurrent false aster. Indiana Bat (Myotis sodalis) The federally endangered Indiana bat may be found throughout most of the eastern United States. Almost half of all Indiana bats hibernate in caves in southern Indiana. Other states within the current range of the Indiana bat include Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia. Indiana bats weigh approximately one-quarter of an ounce with a wingspan of 9 to 11 inches. Their fur is dark-brown to black. They hibernate during winter in caves or, occasionally, in abandoned mines. During summer they roost under the peeling bark of dead and dying trees. The migratory bat forms nursery colonies under the loose bark and/or in cavities of trees during the summer months (between April 1 and September 30). These nurseries are frequently within stream corridors with well-developed riparian woods. Field survey revealed no suitable habitat for the Indiana bat within the proposed project area. Therefore, FutureGen Alliance has determined the project will have no effect on the Indiana bat. Eastern Prairie Fringed Orchid (Platanthaera leucophaea) The federally threatened eastern prairie fringed orchid requires sun and a grassy habitat with little or no woody vegetation. The orchid can be found in mesic to wet prairies. Most populations occur in silt-loam soils derived from loess or glacial till (Bowles 1999). Reproduction from seed is accomplished only with pollination by hawkmoths (Bowles 1999). Seedling establishment is also associated with the development of mycorrhizae with soil-inhabiting fungi (Bowles 1999). The eastern prairie fringed orchid flowers from late June to early July. Flowering may last 7 to 10 days. Seed capsules mature over the growing season and are dispersed by the wind from late August through September. Originally the species was present in 33 Illinois counties in the northern two thirds of the state. Today, 20 populations may occur in six Illinois counties “concentrated in the Chicago region, and single populations occur in cemetery prairies in eastern and west-central Illinois counties (Bowles 1999 citing Bowles et al 1992). The decline of this species is due to loss of habitat, mainly conversion of natural habitats to cropland and pasture and the drainage and development of wetlands. Other reasons for the current decline include succession to woody vegetation, competition from non-native species and over-collection. The eastern prairie fringed orchid was not observed during threatened and endangered species field surveys in April 2011. These surveys revealed no suitable habitat for the eastern prairie fringed orchid at the Beilschmidt Characterization Pad, Beilschmidt Road improvement areas, or farm access road improvement/extension areas. The Hoagland Characterization Pad may contain habitat suitable for the eastern prairie fringed orchid. Soils at this site include silt-loam and silty clay loam soils formed in loess. (NRCS 2011). The primary soil type of the area is Tama silt loam, 5 to 10 percent slopes, eroded (NCSS 2011). The native vegetation community of this soil is tall grass prairie (NRCS 2011).  The Hoagland Property has been converted to pasture. Conversion of habitat to agriculture and pasture is one of the main causes of species decline. During field investigation, cool-season grasses were the dominant vegetation type. Regular mowing during the growing season is required to maintain this vegetation community. Interview with the property owner, Butch Hoagland (Hoagland 2011) revealed that the property is mowed twice per year and baled for cattle fodder. Bowles (1999, citing Sheviak 1990) notes that mowing during the growing season may result in “failure to form the next season's flower bud, inducing dormancy or even death the following season.” Although suitable soils for the eastern prairie fringed orchid may occur on the project site, the habitat associated with these soils has been converted to cool-season pasture grasses. Maintenance activities associated with this vegetation community preclude the presence of the eastern prairie fringed orchid. There are no recorded occurrences of this species n the vicinity of the project and recent field surveys indicate it is not present in the project area (IDNR 2011b,c). Therefore, FutureGen Alliance has determined the project will have no effect on the eastern prairie fringed orchid. LITERATURE CITED 16 USC 1531-1544.  1973.  “Endangered Species Act of 1973”.

When aparcel is indicated as “Applied for,” the property was either occupied or intended to be occupied at the time of the survey. Typically, the occupant or “squatter” expressed, tothe GLOsurveyor, his interestin purchasingthepropertyonce itbecame available fromthefederalgovernment. Usuallyitisunknownifthepropertywasactuallyimprovedwitha permanent building (such as ahouse or cabin) at the time the survey was conducted. The GLO platsthatincludetheAPEdonotindicateanyculturallandmarks(suchastrails,fords,orroads), structuresorfarmfieldswithinthe projectboundaries. Thissourcedoesindicatethatthemajority ofthe parcelwassituatedwithin prairie(Figure3). The Illinois Public Domain Land Tract Database indicates the land parcels associated with the project areas were purchased by five individuals (William O’Rear, Isaac Robinson, Peter Robinson, Thomas F. Stout, andJacob Yaple) between 1827 and 1833. All land was purchased fromthefederalgovernmentattherateof$1.25 peracre(Figure4). The 1872 historical atlas indicates the parcels associated with the project areas as owned by William O’Rear, Joel Corrington, and Lucretia Green (Figure 5). This source does not indicate anystructureswithintheAPE. The1894historicalatlasindicatestheparcelsassociatedwiththeprojectareasasownedbyL.M. Thomas, Henry W. Beilschmidt, and Lucretia Green (Figure 6). While this source indicates a structure intersecting the project area on the Beilschmidt property, this is most likely due to mapping inconsistencies. No evidence of a structure or associated materials was recovered duringthisinvestigation. Previous Surveys/ Reported Sites: AreviewofIHPArecordsindicatesthatno previoussurveysorsites have beenreportedwithintheAPE. Regional Archaeologists Contacted: Databases maintained by the Illinois State Museum, the Illinois Departmentof NaturalResources,andtheIllinoisHistoricPreservationAgencywerereviewed. Investigation Techniques: Pedestrian reconnaissance at 5meter intervals was conducted within the projectarea. Field Time Expended: 10manhours Sites/Find Spots Located: NONE Cultural Material: NONE (Curated at): N/A Collection Techniques: N/A Area Surveyed(Acres &Square Meters): Approximately15.3acres(61935.36m2). RESULTS OF INVESTIAGATIONS ANDRECOMMENDATIONS (CHECK ONE) Phase I Archaeological Reconnaissance Has Located No Archaeological Material; Project Clearance is Recommended. • Phase IArchaeological Reconnaissance Has LocatedArchaeological Materials: Site(s)Does (Do)Not Meet requirements for the National Register Eligibility; Project Clearance is Recommended. • Phase IArchaeological Reconnaissance Has LocatedArchaeological Materials; Site(s)MayMeet Requirements for National Register Eligibility; Phase IITestingisRecommended. • Phase II Archaeological Investigations Has Indicated that Site(s) Does (Do) Not Meet Requirements for National Register Eligibility; Project Clearance is Recommended. • Phase II Archaeological Investigations Has Indicated that Site(s) Meet Requirements for National Register Eligibility; Formal Report is Pending and a Determination of Eligibility is Recommended. Comments: An intensive cultural resource survey of the area proposed to be impacted by site characterizationactivitiesassociatedtheFutureGenprojectinMorganCounty,Illinoiswasconductedon April 25, 2011. The project area is composed of approximately 15.3acres in agricultural use where 8095 percentofthegroundsurfacewasvisibletofieldinvestigators. The current investigation included an examination of historical maps and atlases pertinent to the subject property, a computer database search of the archaeological site files maintained by the Illinois State Museum, a review of the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), and a review of the Illinois Register of Historic Sites (IRHS) maintained by the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency. Examination of archival and historical sources and resource databases did not identify that known prehistoric or historicsites,areas,orartifactsmaybepresentwithintheboundariesoftheAPEorwithintheimmediate vicinityoftheAPE. Archaeological and cultural resource field examination of the APE included the use of pedestrian reconnaissance at 5meter intervals to located evidence of unknown or unreported archaeological, historical or cultural sites, area, and artifacts. Under excellent field conditions and ground surface exposure, field surveyors failed to find evidence of archaeological or historical resources, sites, or structures within the boundaries where characterization activities will be conducted. Due to the APE’s locationwithintheinterioruplandsofMorganCounty,itisunlikelythatalluvialorcolluvialdepositional conditionshaveresultedinthedeepburialofculturaldepositsorremains. Asaresult,geomorphological investigative techniques to locate and assess deeply buried archaeological and historical resources or artifactsweredeemedunnecessary. Management Summary and Conclusions AculturalresourceinventoryoftheareaproposedforcharacterizationactivitiesrelatedtotheFutureGen Industrial Alliance facility in Morgan County, Illinois included an examination of historical maps and atlases pertinent to the subject property, a computer database search of the archaeological site files maintained by the Illinois State Museum, and a review of the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), a review of the Illinois Register of Historic Sites (IRHS) maintained by the Illinois Historic PreservationAgency,andfieldinvestigationsutilizinga pedestrianreconnaissanceat5meterintervals. Based ontheresults of field investigations andon information collected duringarchival andbackground research, the APE does not contain evidence for the presence of archaeological, historical, or cultural resources,sites,areas,orartifacts. Aspresentlyconceptualized,activitiesrelatedto thecharacterization of the Morgan County, IL FutureGen facility will not impact cultural resources. Further, additional culturalresourceinvestigationsareneitherwarrantednorrecommend.

Theprojectareaiscomposedofapproximately5acresinagriculturalusewhere2050 percent of the ground surface was visible to field investigators and 1acre of fallow fields with 0 percentgroundsurfacevisibility. The current investigation included an examination of historical maps and atlases pertinent to the subject property, a computer database search of the archaeological site files maintained by the Illinois State Museum, a review of the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), and a review of the Illinois Register of Historic Sites (IRHS) maintained by the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency. Examination of archival and historical sources and resource databases did not identify that known prehistoric or historicsites,areas,orartifactsmaybepresentwithintheboundariesoftheAPEorwithintheimmediate vicinityoftheAPE. Archaeological and cultural resource field examination of the APE included the use of pedestrian reconnaissance at 5meter intervals and shovelprobe investigations at 15meter intervals to locate evidence of unknown or unreported archaeological, historical or cultural sites, area, and artifacts. Field surveyors failed to find evidence of archaeological or historical resources, sites, or structures within the boundarieswheresoilgasmonitoringactivitieswill be conducted. Duetothe APE’slocationwithinthe interior uplands of Morgan County, it is unlikely that alluvial or colluvial depositional conditions have resulted in the deep burial of cultural deposits or remains. As aresult, geomorphological investigative techniques to locate and assess deeply buried archaeological and historical resources or artifacts were deemedunnecessary. Management Summary and Conclusions A cultural resource inventory of the area proposed for soil gas monitoring activities related to the FutureGen Industrial Alliance facility in Morgan County, Illinois included an examination of historical maps and atlases pertinent to the subject property, acomputer database search of the archaeological site files maintained by the Illinois State Museum, and areview of the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), a review of the Illinois Register of Historic Sites (IRHS) maintained by the Illinois Historic PreservationAgency,andfieldinvestigationsutilizinga pedestrianreconnaissanceat5meterintervals. Based ontheresults of field investigations andon information collected duringarchival andbackground research, the APE does not contain evidence for the presence of archaeological, historical, or cultural resources, sites, areas, or artifacts.

(Alliance)	identified	a	site	in	Morgan	County,	Illinois	as	its	preferred	location	for	a	permanent,	safe,	underground	carbon	dioxide	(CO2)	storage	site.	The	Morgan	County	CO2	storage	site	is	a	component	of	the	FutureGen	2.0	Project,	a	large‐scale	oxy‐combustion	repowering	project	that	will	use	carbon	capture	and	storage	technology.		The	FutureGen	2.0	Project	is	a	public‐private	partnership,	with	costs	shared	by	the	U.S.	Department	of	Energy	(DOE),	the	Alliance,	and	other	project	partners. The	Alliance	plans	to	acquire	a	portion	of	the	existing	Meredosia	Energy	Center	in	 Meredosia,	Illinois,	andrepower	one	of	its	units	with	oxy‐combustion	and	carbon	capture	technology.		An	oxy‐combustion	system	burns	coal	with	a	mixture	of	oxygen	and	CO2,	 instead	of	air,	to	produce	a	concentrated	CO2	stream	that	can	be	captured	for	geologic	storage.		The	oxy‐combustion	boiler,	air	separation	unit,	and	CO2	purification	andcompression	unit	will	allow	the	plant	to	capture	at	least	90	percent	of	its	CO2	emissions	and reduce	other	emissions	to	near	zero.			 The	captured	CO2will	be	transported	from	the	power	plant	through	an	underground	pipeline	to	injection	wells	drilled	into	the	Mount	Simon	Sandstone—sandstone	that	underlies	central	Illinois—so	that	the	CO2	can	be	sequestered	within	that	geologic	formation.		The	Alliance	plans	to	inject	approximately	1.1	million	metric	tons	(MMT)	of	CO2 annually	into	the	Mount	Simon	Sandstone	where	it	will	be	permanently	stored.	Visitor,	research,	and	training	facilities	located	near	the	CO2	storage	site	will	provide	public	education	and	outreach,	as	well	as	training	and	research	opportunities	associated	with	CO2 capture	andstorage. Working	with	Battelle	and	its	Pacific	Northwest	Division,	the	Alliance	has	identified	the	approximate	area	in	which	the	injection	wells	will	be	located,	and,	based	on	published	and	site‐specific	data,	has	estimated	the	size	of	the	expected	undergroundarea	in	which	the	 injected	CO2	will	be	permanently	stored.	The	Alliance	has	used	this	information	to	(1)	 obtain	the	necessary	property	rights	from	local	landowners,	(2)	provide	information	for	DOE’s	National	Environmental	Policy	Act	(NEPA)	process,	and	(3)	prepare	Class	VI	 Underground	Injection	Control	(UIC)	permit	applications	that	were	submitted	to	the	U.S.	Environmental	Protection	Agency	(EPA)	pursuant	to	the	Safe	Drinking	Water	Act.1 For	DOE’s	NEPA	process,	the	Alliance	identified	the	area	within	which	the	CO2	plume	will	be	located	as	the	“NEPA	study	area.”	The	NEPA	study	area	is	approximately	6,800	acres,	as	shown	in	Figure	1. 1  The Alliance submitted its Class VI UIC Permit Applications and Supporting Documentation to EPA on March 15, 2013. Responding to EPA’s completeness review, the Alliance submitted updated Supporting Documentation to EPA on May 13, 2013. This Technical Report has been updated with the information and graphics from the May 13, 2013 submittal to EPA. Figure 1.  NEPA Study Area for the Morgan County CO2 Storage Site Based	on	computational	modeling,	the	Alliance	has	determined	that	the	comingled	CO2 plume	after20	years	of	injection	at	an	annual	rate	of	approximately	1.1	MMT	(a	total	of	22	MMT)	will	be	an	area	of	approximately	4,000	acres.	The	CO2	plume	will	be	contained	within	 the	6,800‐acre	NEPA	study	area. The	Alliance	evaluated	several	injection	well	 A vertical well is drilled from the ground surface to a specified configurations	using	both	vertical	and	horizontal	 completion depth in a straight line.   wells	at	one	or	two	injection	sites	within	the	NEPA	study	area.	The	Alliance’s	original	configuration	was	 A horizontal well is drilled from the for	two	vertical	injection	wells	to	be	located	on	 ground surface to a specified depth separate	injection	well	pads	located	0.5	to	1	mile	 and then curved to proceed in a horizontal direction. apart. After	consideration	of	site‐specific	data	from	the	stratigraphic	well,	the	Alliance	is	now	proposing	to	construct	and	operate	up	to	four	horizontal	injection	wells	for	the	annual	injection	of	1.1	MMT	of	CO2	over	a	20‐year	period	(a	total	of	22	MMT).		The	Alliance	proposed	this	configuration	in	the	UIC	permit	applications	it	filed	with	EPA.2 All	four	horizontal	wells	will	originate	from	a	common	drilling	pad	and	will	operate	independently	of	each	other	(i.e.,	separate	wellheads).		The	injection	well	pad	will	also	accommodate	one	or	two	monitoring	wells.	 The	well	pad	will	be	a	rectangle	measuring	approximately	640	feet	by	500	feet,	orapproximately	7	acres	(by	comparison,	the	well	pad	for	the	Alliance	stratigraphic	well	is	approximately	350	feet	by	350	feet,	or	approximately	3	acres).	Surface	facilities	in	close	 proximity	to	the	injection	well	pad	will	consistof	a	Site	Control	Building	and	a	Well	Annulus	Maintenance	and	Monitoring	System	Building.	Surface	facilities	associated	with	the	injection	wells	will	require	less	than	25	acres	for	planned	structures	and	access	to	monitoring	points. Each	horizontal	well	will	include	a	vertical	section	that	extends	through	the	Potosi	Formation	to	an	approximate	depth	of	3,150	feet	and	a	1,500‐	to	2,000‐foot‐long	horizontal	section	in	the	Upper	Mount	Simon	Formation	at	an	approximate	depth	of	4,030	feet	below	 2 		It	is	possible,	however,	that	the	Alliance	could	propose	a	fewer	number	of	horizontal	wells	at	a	later	time.	Any	proposed	injection	well	configuration	will	result	in	a	CO2	plume	that	will	be	located	within	the	NEPA	 study	area. ground	surface	(bgs).3 	Each	horizontal	well	will	be	oriented	along	a	different	azimuth	to	 facilitate	efficient	distribution	of	the	CO2and	pore	space	use.			 Figure	2	shows	an	injection	well	schematic	with	a	cased‐hole	completion	scenario.	Figure	3	shows	a	conceptual	arrangement	of	the	four	horizontal	injectionwells.	Table	1	shows	the	length	of	each	lateral	leg	and	the	mass	rate	of	CO2	injection	for	each	well.	 Table 1.

Conceptual Arrangement of Four Horizontal Injection Well Configuration As	currently	planned,	the	injection	wells	will	include	the	following	casing	strings:		a	24‐in.diameter	conductor	string	set	at	a	depth	of	approximately	140	feet	bgs;	a	16‐inch‐diameter	surface	string	set	at	a	depth	of	approximately	570	feet	bgs;	a	10‐3/4‐inch‐diameter	intermediate	string	set	at	a	depth	of	approximately	3,150	feet	bgs;	and	a	7‐inch‐diameter	long	string	set	at	an	approximate	(measured)	depth	of	7,004	feet	bgs	(approximate	true	vertical	depth	of	4,030	feet	bgs)	for	a	cased‐hole	completion	scenario.	The	injection	tubing	will	have	anouter	diameter	of	3.5	inches	and	an	inner	diameter	of	2.992	inches.4 Prior	to	construction	of	the	injection	wells	and	injection	of	CO2,	the	Alliance	will	obtain	a	 Class	VI	(CO2	injection)	UIC	permit	for	each	injection	well	as	is	required	by	EPA’s	Geologic	Sequestration	regulations	(40	CFR	§§	146.81	–	146.95).	The	information	in	thistechnical	report	is	consistent	with	the	information	that	was	provided	to	EPA	as	part	of	the	Alliance’s	UIC	permit	applications.	It	should	be	noted	that	the	well	configuration	proposed	in	the	Alliance’s	UIC	permit	applications	could	change.	For	example,	the	Alliance	may	propose	a	fewer	number	of	horizontal	wells.	However,	any	injection	well	configuration	proposed	by	the	Alliance	in	its	UIC	permit	applications	will	result	in	anunderground	CO2	plume	of	approximately	4.000	acres	and	it	will	be	located	within	the	NEPA	study	area. The	remainder	of	this	technical	report	describes	how	regional	and	site‐specific	geologic	and	hydrologic	information	was	used	in	a	computational	model	to	delineate	the	CO2	plume.	It	provides	an	overview	of	the	geologic	setting	and	describes	the	computational	model,	including	a	description	of	the	simulator	and	the	physical	processes	modeled,	along	with	a	description	of	the	conceptual	model	and	numerical	implementation.			 2.0 Overview of the Geologic Setting The	Alliance	proposes	to	inject	CO2 Injection Zone into	the	Mount	Simon	Sandstone.

The	Illinois	Basin	covers	an	area	of about	110,000	mi2	over	Illinois	and	parts	of	Indiana	and	Kentucky.		The	Illinois	Basin	contains	approximately	120,000	mi3	of	Cambrian	to	Pennsylvanian	marine	and	terrestrial	sedimentary	rocks	with	a	maximum	thickness	of	about	15,000	feet	(Buschbach	and	Kolata	1991;	Goetz	et	al.	1992;	McBride	and	Kolata	1999). More	than	900	wells,	mostly	pre‐1980,	have	been	drilled	into	the	Mount	Simon	Sandstone	in	the	Illinois	Basin	(ISGS	2011);	about	50	of	these	wells	in	Illinois	extend	to	the	Precambrian	basement	underlying	the	Mount	Simon.

The	low‐permeability	Lombard	and	Proviso	members	of	the	Eau	Claire	form	an	effective	confining	layer	at	38	natural‐gas	storage	reservoirs	in	Illinois	(Buschbach	and	Bond	1974;	Morse	and	Leetaru	2005).		The	confining	members	of	Eau	Claire	overlie	the	Elmhurst	Sandstone	member.	 Regionally,	the	Lombard	member	of	the	Eau	Claire	Formation	consists	of	glauconitic	and	sandy	dolomite	interbedded	with	mudstones	and	shale;	the	shale	content	increases	to	the	south	and	sand	content	increases	to	the	west	and	north	(Willman	et	al.	1975).		The	Lombard	member	is	overlain	by	the	Proviso	member,	which	is	characterized	by	limestone,	dolomite,	sandy	siltstone,	and	shale	beds.		The	Lombard	and	Proviso	members	are	continuous	and	extend	across	several	buried	Precambrian	highs	in	the	region.	In	addition	to	the	Eau	Claire	Formation,	the	widespread,	low‐permeability	Franconia	Dolomite	Formation	(Kolata	and	Nimz	2010),	is	a	secondary	confining	zone	for	the	containment	of CO2	within	the	region. The	regional	geology	of	Illinois	is	well	known	from	wells	and	borings	drilled	in	conjunction	with	hydrocarbon	exploration,	aquifer	development	and	use,	and	coal	and	commercial	mineral	exploration.

Stratigraphic Column at the Morgan County CO2 Storage Site Based	on	publicly	available	regional	data	and	site‐specificdata	obtained	by	the	Alliance	from	its	stratigraphic	well	drilled	near	the	proposed	injection	site,	the	Mount	Simon	Sandstone	at	the	site	is	sufficientlydeep	and	has	sufficientthickness,	porosity,	and	permeability	to	store	up	to	22	MMT	of	CO2.		In	addition,	the	Eau	Claire	Formation	caprock	 at	the	site	is	of	sufficient	thickness,	lateral	continuity,	andhas	low	enough	permeabilities	to	serve	as	the	primary	confining	zone	or	caprock.			 The	site	affords	additional	containment	withseveral	secondary	confining	zones,	including	the	Franconian	Formation.		The	basement	rock	was	encountered	at4,430	feet	and	is	a	rhyolite,	which	will	act	as	an	impermeable	lower	boundary	for	the	injection	zones	within	the	Mount	Simon	Sandstone.		 3.0 Computational Modeling Computational	modeling	comprises	two	elements:		a	computer	code,	or	simulator,	that	implements	the	mathematics	of	scientific	understanding,	and	implementation	of	the	simulator	as	an	analytical	tool. 		These	elements	result	in	the	ability	to	predict	the	quantity	 and	distribution	of	CO2	injected	into	saline	reservoirs	for	permanent	storage.		This	requires	solving	the	mathematical	equations	that	describe	the	migrationand	partition	behavior	of	CO2	as	it	is	injected	intogeologic	media	for	which	the	pore	space	is	initially	filled	with	an	 aqueous	saline	solution	(brine). 		The	equations	that	describe	these	flow	and	transport	processes	are	too	complex	to	solve	directly.		 Therefore,	the	governing	flow	and	transport	equations	are	solved	indirectly	where	space	and	time	are	divided	into	discrete	elements.		Space	discretization	involves	dividing	the	storage	reservoir	into	grid	blocks	and	time	discretization	involves	moving	through	time	using	finite	steps. 		The	discretization	process	transforms	the	governing	flow	and	transport	equations	into	forms	that	are	solvable	on	high‐speed	computers.		Both	of	the	elements	of	the	computational	model	that	were	used	to	 determine	the	CO2	plume	for	the	Morgan	County	CO2	storage	site	are	described	in	the	 sections	that	follow.	 4.0 Description of Simulator Numerical	simulation	of	CO2injection	into	deep	geologic	reservoirs	requires	the	modeling	of	complex,	coupled	hydrologic,	chemical,	and	thermal	processes,	including	multi‐fluid	flow	and	transport,	partitioning	of	CO2into	the	aqueous	phase,	and	chemical	interactions	with	 aqueous	fluids	and	rock	minerals. 		The	simulations	conducted	for	this	investigation	were	 executed	using	the	STOMP‐CO2	simulator	(White	et	al.	2012;	White	and	Oostrom	2006;	White	and	Oostrom	2000).		STOMP‐CO2	was	verified	against	other	codes	used	for	simulation	of	geologic	disposal	of	CO2	as	part	of	the	GeoSeq	code	intercomparison	study	 (Pruess	et	al.	2002).	 Partial	differential	conservation	equations	for	fluid	mass,	energy,	and	salt	mass	compose	the	fundamental	equations	for	STOMP‐CO2.		Coefficients	within	the	fundamental	equations	 are	related	to	the	primary	variables	through	a	set	of	constitutive	relationships.		The	salt	transport	equations	are	solved	simultaneously	with	the	component	mass	and	energy	conservation	equations.		The	solute	and	reactive	species	transport	equations	are	solved	sequentially	after	the	coupled	flow	and	transport	equations.		The	fundamental	coupled	flowequations	are	solved	using	an	integral	volume	finite‐difference	approach	with	the	 nonlinearities	in	the	discretized	equations	resolved	through	Newton‐Raphson	iteration.		The	dominant	nonlinear	functions	within	the	STOMP‐CO2	simulator	are	the	relative	permeability‐saturation‐capillarypressure	(k‐s‐p)	relationships.	 TheSTOMP‐CO2simulatorallows	the	userto	specify	these	relationships	through	a	large	 variety	of	popular	and	classic	functions.		Two‐phase	(gas‐aqueous)	k‐s‐p	relationships	can	be	specified	with	hysteretic	or	nonhysteretic	functions	or	nonhysteretic	tabular	data.		Entrapment	of	CO2	with	imbibing	water	conditions	can	be	modeled	with	the	hysteretic	twophase	k‐s‐p	functions.		 Two‐phase	k‐s‐p	relationships	span	both	saturated	and	unsaturated	conditions.		The	aqueous	phase	is	assumed	to	never	completely	disappear	through	extensions	to	the	s‐p	function	below	the	residual	saturation	and	a	vapor‐pressure	lowering	scheme.		CO2	has	the	function	of	a	gas	in	these	two‐phase	k‐s‐p	relationships.	 For	the	range	of	temperature	andpressure	conditions	present	in	deep	saline	reservoirs,	four	phases	are	possible:		1)	water‐rich	liquid	(aqueous),	2)	CO2‐rich	vapor	(gas),	3)	CO2rich	liquid	(liquid‐CO2)	and	4)	crystalline	salt	(precipitated	salt).		The	equations	of	state	express	1)	the	existence	of	phases	given	the	temperature,	pressure,	and	water,	CO2,	and	salt	 concentration;	2)	the	partitioning	of	components	among	existing	phases;	and	3)	the	density	of	the	existing	phases.		Thermodynamic	properties	for	CO2	are	computed	via	interpolation	from	a	property	data	table	stored	in	an	external	file.		The	property	table	was	developed	from	the	equation	of	state	for	CO2	published	by	Span	and	Wagner	(1996).		Phase	equilibria	calculations	in	STOMP‐CO2	use	theformulations	of	Spycher	et	al.	(2003)	for	temperatures	below	100°C	and	Spycher	and	Pruess	(2010)	for	temperatures	above	100°C,	withcorrections	for	dissolved	salt	provided	in	Spycher	and	Pruess	(2010).	 	The	Spycher	formulations	are	based	on	the	Redlich‐Kwong	equation	of	state	with	parameters	fitted	 from	published	experimental	data	for	CO2‐H2O	systems.		 Additional	details	regarding	the	 equations	of	state	used	in	STOMP‐CO2	can	be	found	in	the	guide	by	White	et	al.	(2012).	 A	well	model	is	defined	as	a	typeof	source	term	that	extends	over	multiple	grid	cells,	where	the	well	diameter	is	smaller	than	the	grid	cell.		A	fully	coupled	well	model	in	STOMP‐CO2	was	used	tosimulate	the	injection	of	CO2	under	a	specified	mass	injection	rate,	subject	to	a	pressure	limit.		When	the	mass	injection	ratecan	be	met	without	exceeding	the	specified	pressure	limit,	then	the	well	is	considered	to	be	flow	controlled.		Conversely,	when	the	mass	injection	rate	cannot	be	met	without	exceeding	the	specified	pressure	limit,	then	the	well	is	considered	to	be	pressurecontrolled	and	the	mass	injection	rate	is	determined	 based	on	the	injection	pressure. 		The	well	model	assumes	a	constant	pressure	gradient	within	the	well	and	calculates	the	injection	pressure	at	each	cell	in	the	well.		The	CO2injection	rate	is	proportional	to	the	pressure	gradient	between	the	well	and	surrounding	formation	in	each	grid	cell.		By	fully	integrating	the	well	equations	into	the	reservoir	field	 equations,	the	numerical	convergence	of	the	nonlinear	conservation	and	constitutive	 equations	is	greatly	enhanced.		 5.0 Physical Processes Modeled Physical	processes	modeled	in	the	reservoir	simulations	included	non‐isothermal	multifluid	flow	and	transport	for	a	number	of	components	(e.g.,	water,	salt,	and	CO2)	and	phases	 (e.g.,	aqueous	and	gas). 		The	preliminary	reservoir	model	assumes	isothermal	conditions,	which	are	appropriate	if	the	temperature	of	the	injected	CO2	is	similar	to	the	formation	temperature.		Reservoir	salinity	is	considered	in	the	simulations	because	salt	precipitation	can	occur	near	the	injection	well	in	higher	permeability	layersas	the	rock	dries	out	during	 CO2	injection.		This	can	completely	plug	pore	throats,	making	the	layer	impermeable,	thereby	reducing	reservoir	injectivity	and	affecting	the	distribution	of	CO2in	the	reservoir.		 Injected	CO2	partitions	in	the	reservoir	between	the	free	(or	mobile)	gas,	entrapped	gas,	and	aqueous	phases.		SequesteringCO2	in	deep	saline	reservoirs	occurs	through	four	mechanisms:		1)	structural	trapping,	2)	aqueous	dissolution,	3)	hydraulic	trapping,	and	4)	mineralization.		Structural	trapping	is	the	long‐term	retention	of	the	buoyant	CO2	phase	in	 the	pore	space	of	the	reservoir	rock	held	beneath	one	or	more	impermeable	caprocks.		Aqueous	dissolution	occurs	when	CO2	dissolves	in	the	brine	resultingin	an	aqueous‐phase	density	greater	than	the	ambient	conditions.		 Hydraulic	trapping	is	the	pinch‐off	trapping	of	the	CO2	phase	in	pores	as	the	brine	re‐enters	pore	spaces	previously	occupied	by	the	CO2 phase.		Generally,	hydraulic	trapping	only	occurs	upon	the	cessation	of	CO2	injection. Mineralization	is	the	chemical	reaction	that	transforms	formation	minerals	to	carbonate	minerals.		In	the	Mount	Simon	Sandstone,	the	most	likely	precipitation	reaction	is	the	 formation	of	iron	carbonate	precipitates.		A	likely	reaction	between	CO2	and	shale	is	the	dewatering	of	clays.		Laboratory	investigations	are	currently	quantifying	the	importance	of these	reactions	at	the	Morgan	County	CO2	storage	site.		 Therefore,	the	simulations	 described	here	did	not	include	mineralization	reactions.		 However,	the	STOMP‐CO2	 simulator	does	account	for	precipitation	of	salt	during	CO2	injection. The	CO2	stream	provided	by	the	plant	to	the	storage	site	is	97	percent	dry	basis	CO2.		 Because	the	amount	of	impurities	is	small,	for	the	purposes	of	modeling	the	CO2	injection	and	redistribution	for	this	project,	it	was	assumed	that	the	injectate	was	pure	CO2.		 6.0 Geologic Model A	stratigraphic	conceptual	model	of	the	geologic	layers	from	the	Precambrian	basement	to	ground	surface	was	constructed	using	the	EarthVision®	software	package	(Figure	5).	The	geologic	setting	and	site‐specific	characterization	data	were	the	basis	for	the	Morgan	County	CO2storage	site	model.		Borehole	data	from	the	Alliance’s	stratigraphic	well	and	data	from	regional	boreholes	and	published	regional	contour	maps	were	used	as	input	data.		However,	units	below	the	Shakopee	Dolomite	and	above	the	Eau	Claire	Formation	 were	assumed	to	have	a	constant	thickness	based	on	the	stratigraphy	observed	at	the	stratigraphic	well.		 Figure 5.  EarthVision® Solid Earth Model for the Proposed Morgan County CO2 Storage Site.  View to the southwest.  For clarity, only the main formations have been labeled. An	expanded	100‐mile	x	100‐mile	geologic	model	was	constructed	to	represent	units	below	the	Potosi	including	the	Franconia,	Ironton,	Eau	Claire	(Proviso,	Lombard	and	Elmhurst),	Mount	Simon,	and	Precambrian	formations.		 These	surfaces	were	gridded	in	EarthVision®	based	on	borehole	data	and	regional	contour	maps	and	make	up	the	stratigraphic	layers	of	the	computational	model.			 6.1 Hydrogeologic Layers The	geologic	model	hydrogeologic	layers	were	defined	for	each	stratigraphic	layer	based	on	zones	of	similar	hydrologic	properties.		The	hydrologic	properties	(permeability,	porosity)	were	deduced	from	geophysical	well	logs	and	side‐wall	cores.		The	lithology,	deduced	from	wireline	logs	and	core	data,	was	also	used	to	subdivide	each	stratigraphic	layer	of	the	model.		Based	on	these	data,	the	Mount	Simon	Sandstone	was	subdivided	into	17	layers,	and	the	Elmhurst	Sandstone	(member	of	the	Eau	Claire	Formation)	was	subdivided	into	7	layers	as	shown	in	Figure	6.	These	units	form	the	injection	zone.		The	Lombard	and	Proviso	members	of	the	Eau	Claire	Formation	were	subdivided	respectively	into	14	and	5	layers.		 The	Ironton	Sandstone	was	divided	into	four	layers,	the	Davis	Dolomite	into	three	layers,	and	the	Franconia	Formation	into	one	layer.		One	can	also	note	that	some	layers	(“split”	label	in	Figure	6)	have	similar	properties	but	have	been	subdivided	to	maintain	a	reasonable	thicknessof	layers	within	the	injection	zone	as	 represented	in	the	computational	model.	 Figure 6.  Division of Stratigraphic Layers to Create Computational Model Layers The	thickness	of	the	layers	varies	from	4	to	172	feet,	with	anaverage	of	26	feet.		The	assignment	of	hydrologic	properties	to	these	layers	is	described	in	the	next	sections.		 6.2 Hydrologic and Porous Media Properties Continuous	wireline	logresults	are	commonly	calibrated	using	discrete	laboratory	core	measurements	to	provide	a	more	continuous	record	for	the	particular	characterization	parameter	(e.g.,	permeability,	porosity).		From	these	calibrated	wireline‐survey	 measurements,	statistical	or	average	values	forthe	hydrologic	parameter	can	be	assigned	to	layers	used	in	numerical	models	for	the	purpose	of	predicting	fluid	movement	within	targeted	reservoirs.		 A	number	of	characterization	data	sources	and	methods	were	usedto	assign	hydrologic	properties	to	the	various	model	layers.		Available	data	sources	for	the	Morgan	County	site	include	results	from	continuous	wireline	surveys	(compensated	magnetic	resonance	[CMR],	ELAN),	standard	and	side‐wall	cores	(SWCs),	and	hydrologic	tests	(Modular	Formation	Dynamics	Tester	[MDT]	and	packer	tests).	 Because	of	differences	in	lithology	and	in	the	borehole	construction,	the	method	used	to	assign	properties	varied	for	different	vertical	zones	of	the	conceptual	model.	 Horizontal Permeability Intrinsic	permeability	is	the	property	of	the	rock/formation	that	relates	to	its	ability	to	transmit	fluid,	and	is	independent	of	the	in	situ	fluid	properties.		For	modeling	of	sedimentary	rock	formations,	two	permeabilities	are	commonly	used:		permeability	in	the	horizontal	direction,	kh	(permeability	parallel	to	sedimentary	layering	[also	Kh])	and	permeability	in	the	vertical	direction,	kv	(permeability	perpendicular	to	layering	[also	Kv]).			The	subsequent	discussion	pertains	to	assigned	horizontal	permeability	values	for	the	various	borehole	sections.	 Intrinsic	permeability	data	sources	for	the	FutureGen	2.0stratigraphic	well	include	computed	geophysical	wireline	surveys	(CMR	and	ELAN	logs),	and	where	available,	laboratory	measurements	of	rotary	SWCs,	core	plugs	from	the	whole	core	intervals	and	hydrologic	tests	(including	wireline	[MDT]),	and	packer	tests.	 Intrinsic Permeability in the Injection Zone (Mount Simon and Elmhurst Sandstone) For	model	layers	within	the	injection	zone	(i.e.,	Elmhurst	Sandstone	and	Mount	Simon	Sandstone;	3,852	to	4,432	feet)	a	correlation/calibration	approach	was	applied.		 Wireline	log	CMR‐	and	ELAN‐computed	permeability	model	responses	were	first	correlated	with	and	then	calibrated	to	rotary	side‐wall	and	core	plug	permeability	results.		The	correlation	process	was	facilitated	using	natural	gamma	ray	responses	and	clay	or	shale	abundance	to	establish	correlation	data	sets.		This	calibration	provided	a	continuous	permeability	 estimate	over	the	entire	injection	reservoir	section	(curve	permKCal). Intrinsic Permeability in the Confining Zones (Franconia to Lombard Formations) The	sources	of	data	are	similar	to	those	for	the	injection	zone	reservoir.	For	each	model	layer	the	core	data	were	reviewed,and	a	simple	average	of	the	available	horizontal	 Klinkenburg	permeabilities	was	then	calculated	for	each	layer.	 Core	samples	that	were	noted	by	Core	Lab	as	having	potential	cracks	and/or	were	very	small	were	eliminated	if	the results	appeared	to	be	unreasonable	based	on	the	sampled	lithology.		If	no	core	samples	were	available	and	the	arithmetic	mean	of	the	PermKCal	was	below	0.01	mD,	a	default	value	of	0.01	mD	was	applied	(Lombard9	is	the	only	layer	with	a	0.01‐mD	default	value).			 Because	the	sandstone	intervals	of	the	Ironton‐Galesville	Sandstone	have	higher	permeabilities	that	are	similar	in	magnitude	to	the	modeled	reservoir	layers,	the	IrontonGalesville	Sandstone	model	layer	permeabilities	were	derived	from	the	arithmetic	mean	of	 the	PermKCal	permeability	curve.		 Figure 7	shows	the	depth	profile	of	the	horizontal	permeability	assigned	to	each	layer	of	the	model	(actual	values	assigned	are	listed	in	Table 7).	 Figure 7.  Horizontal Permeability Versus Depth in Each Model Layer Vertical Permeability Sedimentation	can	create	an	intrinsic	permeability	anisotropy,	caused	by	sediment	layering	and	preferential	directions	of	connected‐pore	channels.		Kv/Kh	ratios	were	successfully	determined	for	20	vertical/horizontal	siliciclastic	core	plug	pairs	cut	from	intervals	of	whole	core	from	the	stratigraphic	well.		Horizontal	permeability	data	in	the	stratigraphic	well	far	outnumber	vertical	permeability	data,because	vertical	permeability	could	not	be	 determined	from	rotary	SWCs.		 Effective	vertical	permeability	in	siliciclastic	rocks	is	primarily	a	function	of	the	presence	of	mudstone	or	shale	(Ringrose	et	al.	2005).		The	siliciclastic	lithologies	(sandstones,	siltstones,	mudstones	and	shales)are	heterolithic	in	the	cored	interval	of	the	lower	Lombard,	and	in	rotary	SWCs	from	the	upper	Lombard	and	non‐carbonate	Proviso.		Core	plug	samples	of	heterolithic	siliciclastics	are	poorly	representative	of	larger	vertical	intervals	(Meyer	and	Krause	2006).	 Because	the	vertical	permeability	anisotropy	of	the	model	layers	is	not	likely	to	be	represented	by	the	sparse	data	from	the	stratigraphic	well,	the	following	lithology‐specific	permeability	anisotropy	averages	from	literature	studies	representing	larger	sample	sizes	 are	used	forthe model layers (Table 2). The	literature‐based	permeability	anisotropy	values	listed	in	Table	3	were	used	to	assignKv/Kh	to	each	layer	of	the	model.		Figure	8	shows	the	depth	profile	of	the	anisotropy	assigned	to	each	layer	of	the	model.		Actual	values	assigned	for	each	layer	are	listed	in	Table	7. Table 2.

Only	the	Proviso	member	(Eau	Claire	Formation)	has	been	divided	in	two	sublayers	to	be	consistent	with	the	lithology	changes.		Figure10	shows	the	calculated	grain	density	with	depth.		The	actual	values	assigned	to	each	layer	of	the	model	are	listed	in	Table	7.		Grain	density	is	the	input	parameter	specified	in	the	simulation	input	file,	and	STOMP‐CO2	calculates	the	bulk	density	from	the	grain	density	and	porosity	for	each	model	layer. Capillary Pressure and Saturation Functions Capillary	pressure	is	the	pressure	difference	across	the	interface	of	two	immiscible	fluids	(e.g.,	CO2	and	water).		The	entry	capillary	pressure	is	the	minimum	pressure	required	for	 an	immiscible	non‐wetting	fluid	(i.e.,	CO2)	to	overcome	capillary	and	interfacial	forces	and	 enter	pore	space	containing	the	wetting	fluid	(i.e.,	saline	formation	water).		Capillary	pressure	data	determined	from	site‐specific	cores	were	not	available	atthe	time	the	model	was	constructed.		However,	tabulated	capillary	pressure	data	were	available	for	several	Mount	Simon	gas	storage	fields	in	the	Illinois	Basin.		 The	data	for	the	Manlove	Hazen	well	were	the	most	complete.	Therefore,	these	aqueous	saturationand	capillary	pressure	values	were	plotted	and	a	user‐defined	curve	fitting	was	performed	to	generate	Brooks‐Corey	parameters	for	four	different	permeabilities	(Figure	11).		These	parameters	were	then	assigned	to	layers	based	on	a	permeability	range	as	shown	in		 Table 4.	 Figure 11.

The	Pe	for	the	 air‐water	system	is	further	converted	to	that	for	the	CO2‐brine	system	by	multiplying	the	 interfacial	tension	ratioof	a	CO2‐brine	system	cb	to	an	air‐water	system	aw.		An	 approximate	value	of	30	mN/m	was	used	for	cb	and	72	mN/m	for	aw.	 Formation CompressibilityLimited	information	about	formation	(pore)	compressibility	estimates	is	available.		The	best	estimate	for	the	Mount	Simon	Sandstone	(Table	6)	is	that	back‐calculated	by	Birkholzer	et	al.	(2008)	from	a	pumping	test	at	the	Hudson	Field	natural‐gas	storage	site,	found	80	miles	northeast	of	the	Morgan	County	CO2	storage	site.		The	back‐calculated	porecompressibility	estimate	for	the	Mount	Simon	of	3.71E−10	Pa−1	was	used	as	a	spatially	constant	value	for	their	basin‐scale	simulations.		In	other	simulations,	Birkholzer	et	al.	(2008)	assumed	a	pore	compressibility	value	of	4.5E−10	Pa−1	for	aquifers	and	9.0E−10	Pa−1for	aquitards.		Zhou	et	al.	(2010)	in	a	later	publication	used	a	pore	compressibility	value	of	7.42E−10	Pa−1	for	both	the	Eau	Claire	Formation	and	Precambrian	granite,	which	were	also	used	for	these	initial	simulations	(Table	6).	 Because	the	site‐specific	data	are	limited	to	a	single	reservoir	sample,	only	these	two	published	values	have	been	used	for	the	model.		The	first	value	(3.71E‐10	Pa‐1)	has	been	used	for	sands	that	are	compressible	because	of	the	presence	of	porosity.		The	second	value	(7.42E‐10	Pa‐1)	is	assigned	for	all	other	rocks	that	are	less	compressible	(dolomite,	limestone,	shale,	and	rhyolite).

Sampling	was	attempted	at	22	discrete	depths	using	the	MDT	tool	in	the	Quicksilver	Probe	configuration	and	from	one	location	using	the	conventional	(dual‐packer)	configuration.		Pressure	data	were	obtained	at	7	of	the	23	attempted	sampling	points,	including	one	duplicated	measurement	at	a	depth	of	4,048	feet	bkb	(Table	8).	 Table 8.

Two	confirmatory	discrete	probe	depth	measurements	that	were	taken	prior	to	the	active	injection	phase	(using	colder	brine)	corroborate	the	survey	results.		The	two	discrete	pressure	probe	temperature	measurements	have	been	plotted	on	the	temperature/depth	profile	plot	(Figure 12).			 CO2 Plume Delineation (5-31-2013) The	discrete	static	measurement	for	the	depth	of	3,712	feet	is	a	pressure	probe	 temperature	gauge	that	has	been	installed	below	the	tubing	packer	used	to	facilitate	running	of	the	dynamic	flow	meter	survey.		It	is	in	the	well	casing	so	there	is	very	little	to	no	vertical	movement	of	fluid	and	we	have	static	measurements	at	this	depth	for	more	than	12	hours	before	starting	any	testing	within	the	borehole.		The	value	for	this	depth	(3,712	feet)	was	95.9°F.		This	value	plots	exactly	on	the	static,	continuous	fluid	temperature	survey	results	for	this	depth.	 The	second	discrete	static	probe	temperature	measurement	is	from	the	MDT	probe	for	the	successful	sampling	interval	of	4,048	feet.		 This	sample	is	perhaps	less	“static”	in	that	fluid	was	produced	through	the	tool	for	a	period	of	time	as	part	of	the	sampling	process;	however,	it	does	provide	a	consistent	value	with	the	continuous	fluid	temperature	survey.		So	the	bottom	line	is	that	the	static	fluid	temperature	of	February	9,	2012,	looks	to	be	a	valid	representation	of	well	fluid	column	conditions.	 CO2 Plume Delineation (5-31-2013) Based	on	that	conclusion,	a	linear‐regression	temperature/depth	relationship	was	developed	for	use	by	modeling.		The	regression	data	set	analyzed	was	for	temperature	data	over	the	depth	intervalof	1,300	to	4,547	feet.		 Based	on	this	regression	a	projected	temperature	for	the	reference	datum	at	the	top	of	the	Mount	Simon	(3,918	feet	bkb)	of	96.60°F	is	indicated.		A	slope	(gradient)	of	6.72‐3°F/foot	and	intercept	of	70.27°F	is	also	 calculated	from	the	regression	analysis.	 Brine Density Although	this	parameter	is	determined	by	the	simulator	using	pressure,	temperature,	and	salinity,	based	on	the	upper	and	lower	Mount	Simon	reservoirs	tests,the	calculated	in	situ	 reservoir	fluid	density	is	1.0315	g/cm3.	 Salinity During	the	process	of	drilling	the	well,	fluid	samples	were	obtained	from	discrete‐depth	intervals	in	the	St.	Peter	Formation	and	the	Mount	Simon	Formation	using	wirelinedeployed	sampling	tools	(MDTs)	on	December	14,	2011.		 After	the	well	had	been	drilled,	additional	fluid	samples	were	obtained	from	the	open	borehole	section	of	the	Mount	Simon	Formation	by	extensive	pumping	using	a	submersible	pump.		 The	assigned	salinity	value	for	the	Mount	Simon	(upper	zone)	47,500	ppm	is	as	indicated	by	both	the	MDT	sample	(depth	4,048	feet)	and	the	multiple	samples	collected	during	extensive	composite	pumping	of	the	open	borehole	section.	 6.4 Chemical Properties EPA	(2011a)	identified	a	number	of	chemical	properties	asrelevant	parameters	formultiphase	flow	modeling.		These	include	the	aqueous	diffusion	coefficient,	aqueous	solubility,	and	solubility	in	CO2.		The	properties	change	significantly	relative	to	temperature,	pressure,	salinity,	and	other	variables,	and	are	predicted	by	equations	of	state	used	by	the	model	to	calculate	properties	at	conditions	encountered	in	the	simulation	as	 they	change	with	location	and	time.		 7.0 Numerical Model Implementation As	described	above,	the	model	domain	for	the	Morgan	County	CO2	storage	site	consists	of	the	injection	zone	(Mount	Simon	and	Elmhurst),	the	primary	confining	zone	(Lombard	and	Proviso),	the	Ironton‐Galesville,	and	the	secondary	confining	zone	(Davis‐Ironton	and	theFranconia).		Preliminary	simulations	were	conducted	to	determine	the	extent	of	the	model	domain	so	that	lateral	boundarieswere	distant	enough	from	the	injection	location	so	as	not	 to	influence	the	model	results. 		The	three‐dimensional,	boundary‐fitted	numerical	model	grid	was	designed	to	have	constant	grid	spacing	with	higher	resolution	in	the	area	 CO2 Plume Delineation (5-31-2013) influenced	by	the	CO2	injection	(3‐mile	by	3‐mile	area),	with	increasingly	larger	grid	spacing	moving	out	in	all	lateral	directions	toward	the	domain	boundary.	 Figure13	shows	the	numerical	model	grid	for	the	entire	100‐mile	by	100‐mile	domain	and	also	for	the	3‐mile	by	3‐mile	area	with	higher	grid	resolution	and	uniform	grid	spacing	of	200	feet	by	200	feet.		 The	model	grid	contains	125	nodes	in	the	x‐direction,	125	nodes	in	the	y‐direction,	and	51	nodes	in	the	z‐direction	for	a	total	number	of	nodes	equal	to	796,875.		The	expanded	geologic	model	was	queried	at	the	node	locations	of	the	numericalmodel	to	determine	the	elevation	of	each	surface	for	the	stratigraphic	units	at	the	numerical	model	grid	cell	centers	(nodes)	and	cell	edges.		Then	each	of	those	layers	was	subdivided	into	the	model	layers	by	scaling	the	thickness	to	preserve	the	total	thickness	of	each	stratigraphic	unit.		Once	the	vertical	layering	was	defined,	material	properties	were	 mapped	to	each	node	in	the	model.		 Figure 14	shows	the	distribution	of	horizontal	and	vertical	permeability	as	it	was	assigned	to	the	numerical	model	grid.	  (a) (b) CO2 Plume Delineation (5-31-2013)  (a) (b) Figure 14. Permeability Assigned to Numerical Model a) Horizontal Permeability; b) Vertical Permeability 7.1 Initial Conditions The	reservoir	is	assumed	to	be	under	hydrostatic	conditions	with	no	regional	or	local	flow	conditions.	 	Therefore	the	hydrologic	flow	system	is	assumed	to	be	at	steady	state	until	the	 start	of	injection.		To	achieve	this	with	the	STOMP‐CO2	simulator	one	can	either	run	an	 initial	simulation	(executed	for	a	very	long	time	period	until	steady‐state	conditions	are	 achieved)	to	generate	the	initial	distribution	of	pressure,	temperature,	and	salinity	conditions	in	the	model	from	an	initial	guess,	or	one	can	specify	the	initial	conditions	at	a	reference	depth	using	the	hydrostatic	option,	allowing	the	simulator	to	calculate	and	assign	the	initial	conditions	to	all	the	model	nodes.		 Site‐specific	data	were	available	for	pressure,	temperature,	and	salinity,	and	therefore	the	hydrostatic	option	was	used	to	assign	initial	conditions.	 	A	temperature	gradient	was	specified	based	on	the	geothermal	gradient,	but	the	initial	salinity	was	considered	to	be	constant	for	the	entire	domain.		A	summary	of	the	initial	conditions	is	presented	in	Table 9.	 Table 9. Summary of Initial Conditions Reference	 Parameter	 Depth	(bkb)	 Value	 Reservoir	Pressure 4,048	ft 1,790.2	psi Aqueous	Saturation 1.0 Reservoir	Temperature 3,918	ft 96.6°F Temperature	Gradient 0.0672°F/ft Salinity 47,500	ppm CO2 Plume Delineation (5-31-2013) Boundary Conditions Boundary	conditions	were	established	with	the	assumption	that	the	reservoir	is	 continuous	throughout	the	region	and	that	the	underlying	Precambrian	unit	is	impermeable.		Therefore,	the	bottom	boundary	was	set	as	a	no‐flow	boundary	for	aqueous	fluids	and	for	CO2	gas.		The	lateral	and	top	boundary	conditions	were	set	to	hydrostatic	pressure	using	the	initial	condition	with	the	assumption	that	each	of	these	boundaries	is	distant	enough	from	the	injection	zone	to	have	minimal	to	no	effect	on	the	CO2	plume migration	and	pressure	distribution.		 7.3 Simulation Time Period The	EPA	Geologic	Sequestration	regulations	require	that	owners	or	operators	must	“Predict,	using	existing	site	characterization,	monitoring	and	operational	data,	and	computational	modeling,	the	projected	lateral	and	vertical	migration	of	the	CO2	plume	and	 formation	fluids	in	the	subsurface	from	the	commencement	of	injection	activities	until	the	plume	movement	ceases,	until	pressure	differentials	sufficient	to	cause	the	movement	of	injected	fluids	or	formation	fluids	into	an	underground	source	of	drinking	water	are	no	longer	present,	or	until	the	end	of	a	fixed	time	period	as	determined	by	the	Director.”		40	CFR	§ 	146.84(c)(1).	Preliminary	simulations	were	conducted	to	determine	the	total	simulation	time	needed	to	satisfy	the	required	conditions,	and	those	results	are	presented	 in	this	section.		 Figure15	shows	the	plume	area	over	time	relative	to	the	plume	extentat	30	years,	with	the	plume	area	being	defined	as	the	areal	extent	containing	99	percent	of	the	separate‐phase	(gas‐phase)	CO2	mass.		 While	the	CO2	is	still	redistributing	long	after	injection	ceases,	it	canbe	seen	that	the	change	in	the	areal	extent	of	the	plume	becomes	insignificant	after	the	end	of	the	injection	period.		The	pressure	differential,	however,	dissipates	much	more	slowly.	As	indicated	in	Figure	16,	the	pressure	dissipates	more	than	90	percent	within	the	first	100	years.		Hence,	the	final	representative	case	simulations	were	executedfor	a	period	of	100	 years.		 CO2 Plume Delineation (5-31-2013) Figure 16.

The	predicted	area	of	the	20‐year	CO2	plume	that will	result	from	injecting	a	total	of	22	MMT	of	CO2	into	four	horizontal	injection	wells	is	estimated	to	be	approximately	3,970	acres.	The	area	of	the	CO2	plume	50	years	after	injection	ceases	(i.e.,	70	years)	is	predicted	to	be	slightly	larger	at	approximately	3,980	acres. Figure 17.  CO2 Plume Outline after 20 Years of Injection and 50 Years after Injection Ceases CO2 Plume Delineation (5-31-2013) 8.0 Sensitivity Analysis Modeling	underground	CO2	storage	involves	many	conceptual	and	quantitative	uncertainties.		The	major	problem	is	the	uncertainty	in	parameters	such	as	permeability	and	porosity,	and	the	geologic	description	of	the	injectionzone	and	confining	zone.		To	fullyaddress	these	uncertainties,	Monte	Carlo	simulation	was	conducted.		Because	the	model	results	serve	as	a	basis	for	calculating	the	plume	delineation,	the	sensitivity	analysis	focuses	on	a	set	of	parameters	that	strongly	influence	the	plume	calculation.	 The	effects	of	scaling	factors	associated	with	porosity,	permeability,	and	fracture	gradient	were	evaluated.		 The	three	scaling	factors	are	independent	variables,	while	the	rock	type	and	other	mechanical/hydrological	properties	for	the	geological	layers	are	dependent	variables,	which	vary	according	to	scaling.	 The	sensitivity	of	selected	output	variables	including	the	percent	ofCO2	mass	injected,	the	acreage	of	the	plume,	the	acreage	of	the	projected	plume,	and	the	percent	variation	of	plume	area	relative	to	the	representative	case	(4	horizontal	injection	wells,	20	years	of	injection)	was	analyzed.		The	projected	acreage	of	the	plume	is	calculated	for	cases	where	less	than	100	percent	of	the	CO2	mass	was	injected,	providing	a	normalization	of	the	plume	area	for	direct	comparison	across	cases.		Both	marginal	(individual)	and	joint	(combined)	effects	were	evaluated. Whether	a	response	curve	(2D)	or	response	surface	(3D	or	higher	dimension)	is	 representative	or	reliable	depends	on	the	efficiency	of	the	sampling	approach.		A	good	sampling	approach	should	be	able	to	explore	the	parameter	spacewithout	clumping	or	gapping.		As	can	be	seen	Figure	18,	the	quasi	Monte	Carlo	(QMC)	approach	(right),	with	controlled	locations	of	the	samples,	has	better	scatters	than	regular	Monte	Carlo	(left)	and	Latin‐hypercube	samples	(right).		 CO2 Plume Delineation (5-31-2013)     B 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 Monte Carlo samples B 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 Latin Hypercube samples B 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 quasi Monte Carlo samples 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 AAA  Figure 18. Scatter Plots of Monte Carlo, Latin-Hypercube, and Quasi Monte Carlo Samples.  QMC samples are well dispersed in the parameter space and therefore are exploratory and efficient without clumping points and gapping. The	scaling	factors	used	for	generating	these	samples	were	based	on	an	evaluation	of	the	site	characterization	data	to	determine	reasonable	bounding	values.		These	scaling	factors	 are	shown	in	Table	10.		 Table 10.  Scaling Factors Evaluated for Parameter Sensitivity Analysis Parameter Minimum Representative Case Maximum Porosity .75 1.0 1.25 Permeability .75 1.0 1.25 Fracture .88 1.0 1.10 Gradient Thirty‐two	cases	were	defined	from	the	representative	case	model	using	the	QMC	sampling	technique	to	represent	a	statistical	distribution	of	possible	cases	based	on	the	parameters	varied.		All	other	inputs	were	the	same	as	in	the	representative	case.		 Simulation	results	show	that	increasing	the	porosity	results	in	a	smaller	predicted	plume	area,	while	decreasing	the	fracture	gradient	results	in	an	increase	in	the	predicted	plume	 area.		 Varying	the	permeability	has	very	little	effect	on	the	plume	area.		The	reason	for	this	is	that	injectivity	is	mainly	controlled	by	the	injection	rate,	and	as	long	as	the	average	permeability	is	large	enough	and	the	injection	pressure	permitted	is	large	enough,	the	 injection	rate	is	the	limiting	factor	in	predicted	plume	size.	  CO2        Plume Delineation (5-31-2013)       A	generalized	linear	model	analysis	was	performed	for	the	simulated	CO2	plume	area	and	the	final	model	was	obtained	through	AIC	(Akaike	information	criterion)	‐based	step‐wise	backward	removal	approach	and	the	statistical	t‐values	and	P‐values	were	obtained.		When	a	P‐value	is	larger	than	the	significance	level	(e.g.,	0.05),	the	corresponding	variable	(input	parameter)	is	relatively	insignificant.		Considering	only	the	marginal	linear	effects,	the	fracture	gradient	and	porosity	are	the	most	significant	parameters	for	determining	plume	size.		However,	when	the	interactions	are	included,	the	combination	of	permeability	and	 fracture	gradient	becomes	significant. The	injectivity	varied	from	the	representative	base	case	by	about	50	percent	for	cases	 either	with	low	permeability,	low	fracture	gradient,	or	a	combination	of	both.		Because	the	injection	rate	was	specified	as	a	maximum	rate,	it	was	not	possible	to	determine	if,	in	some	cases,	more	than	100	percent	of	the	mass	could	be	injected	and	if	so,	how	much	more.		The	predicted	plume	area	varied	from	the	representative	caseby	about	80	to	120	percent,	which	is	approximately	the	same	as	the	variation	in	permeability	and	porosity.	 CO2 Plume Delineation (5-31-2013) 9.0 References Birkholzer	JT,	J	Apps,	L	Zhenge,	Y	Zhang,	T	Xu	and	C	Tzang.		2008.

DOE published the NOA for the Draft EIS in the Federal Register on May 3, 2013 (78 FR 26004), which provided the website to access the Draft EIS online, the location and timing of the public hearing, and the various methods for submitting comments (see Appendix I3 for a copy of the NOA). On the same date, the USEPA published its NOA for the Draft EIS (78 FR 26027), which initiated the 45-day public comment period (from May 3 to June 17, 2013). PUBLIC HEARING AND COMMENT PERIOD On May 21, 2013, DOE held a public hearing in Jacksonville, Illinois, to offer the public an opportunity to comment on the Draft EIS for the FutureGen 2.0 Project. The hearing was held at Jacksonville High School, 1211 N. Diamond Street. An informational session was held from 5:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m., followed by the formal presentations and comment period from 6:00 p.m. to approximately 8:00 p.m. DOE posted notices in three area newspapers announcing the public hearing date, time, location, and purpose, which were published during the three weeks prior to the hearing as shown in Table 1. Copies of the affidavits of publication for these notices are included in the administrative record. The notices invited individuals to submit written comments or give oral comments at the hearing and included contact information for the DOE NEPA Document Manager. Individuals wishing to give oral comments were invited to submit a request to speak to DOE in advance or to sign up at the public hearing. Seven individuals contacted DOE expressing their intent to speak at the hearing. Table 1. Public Hearing Notices in Regional Media Newspaper Dates of Publication Jacksonville Journal-Courier  Sunday 5/5/13; Wednesday 5/8/13; Sunday 5/12/13; Wednesday 5/15/13;  Sunday 5/19/13  Springfield State Journal-Register Sunday 5/5/13; Wednesday 5/8/13; Sunday 5/12/13; Wednesday 5/15/13; Sunday 5/19/13 Illinois Farm Week  Monday 5/6/13; Monday 5/13/13; Monday 5/20/13  The same information was also provided in notification letters that were sent on April 26, 2013, to interested parties, elected officials, federal and state agencies, and non-governmental organizations based on the distribution list in the Draft EIS. DOE distributed notifications including 147 letters each with a hardcopy of the Draft EIS, 164 notification letters alone, and 180 notifications by email. A total of 46 people signed the attendance sheets for the public hearing, and a total of seven individuals were signed up to give oral comments. During the informational session, the public was invited to view various displays about the NEPA process and the FutureGen 2.0 Project staffed by DOE and Alliance representatives, and the public was encouraged to ask questions of the subject matter experts. The DOE NEPA Document Manager opened the public hearing with welcoming remarks and introduced the Alliance’s Chief Executive, who presented an overview of the FutureGen 2.0 Project. The DOE NEPA Document Manager followed with a brief overview of DOE’s role in the NEPA process and discussed the various methods by which the public could provide comments on the Draft EIS during the official 45-day comment period. A court reporter recorded the formal presentations and oral comments, as documented in the transcript beginning on page I2-13 in Appendix I2. In addition to the oral comments, a representative of one organization submitted a written comment at the public hearing. During the official 45-day comment period, DOE ultimately received comments from two federal agencies, two state agencies, one local elected official, four non-governmental or public-private organizations, and seven members of the public, including the oral comments at the hearing. DOE also accepted and considered comments that were received after the June 17, 2013 closing date for public comments. METHODOLOGY FOR ADDRESSING COMMENTS In preparing the Final EIS, DOE considered all comments to the extent practicable. An identification code was assigned to each originator of a comment (i.e., each commentor), including those given orally at the public hearing. One individual, who submitted comments in multiple separate submissions, was assigned a separate commentor code for each submission. Each specific comment by the same commentor was assigned a sequential comment number (e.g., 11-10 is the tenth comment by commentor 11). A transcript of the public hearing and scanned images of the original comment submissions are included in their entirety in Appendix I2. The commentors and their comments are identified and labeled on each comment submission image. All comments received on the Draft EIS, as well as any supporting attachments, have been entered into the administrative record for this EIS. DOE’s response to each comment is included on the right side of the page in Appendix I2 in close proximity to the corresponding comment. In cases where subsequent comments address the same issue, references are made to the earlier comment number for appropriate responses. Based on the comments received on the Draft EIS, DOE modified the Summary, Final EIS (Volume 1), and Appendices (Volume 2) as appropriate. The EIS was also revised based on DOE’s internal technical and editorial review of the Draft EIS (i.e., changes made to the EIS that were not in response to a comment received). In most of these instances, the revisions were based on events that took place or actions that occurred between the publication of the Draft EIS and the preparation of the Final EIS. IDENTIFICATION OF COMMENTORS Table 2 lists commentors in order of their first appearance in the comment and response document in Appendix I2, their assigned identification codes, their affiliations, and the page numbers where the respective comments and DOE’s responses can be found in Appendix I2. Table 2.

The largest proportion of comments related to the adequacy of information provided about the project and potential impacts. The majority of resource-specific comments focused on socioeconomic issues, geology, and climate and greenhouse gas emissions. Another substantial group of comments were distributed relatively evenly among concerns about health and safety, biological resources, NEPA requirements, and air quality. The balance of comments addressed eleven other subject areas: alternatives, land use, purpose and need, cumulative impacts, environmental justice, regulatory issues, surface water, wetlands, groundwater, physiography and soils, and utilities. The categories and principal issues expressed in the comments are summarized below based on the full text of comments in Appendix I2. Adequacy of Information about the Project • The Draft EIS did not provide adequate details about project components and engineering features. • The Alliance withheld important information about the project from the public or provided inconsistent information about the project and made revisions to prior information. • Questioned the Alliance’s qualifications to successfully complete the project. • The Draft EIS did not provide adequate information about financial assurances and monitoring for the geologic CO2 storage component. • Concerned about the use of bounding conditions in the impact analysis, counties excluded from the region of influence for analysis, the proposed depth of the CO2 pipeline, insufficient pipeline design details, and the unexplained poor generation efficiency of the project. Socioeconomic Conditions • Stated support for the FutureGen 2.0 Project based on the potential for economic stimulus, job creation, promotion of clean fossil fuel development, and opportunities for educational and technology advancement. • Concerned about the potential for project cost overruns and excessive costs to be borne by taxpayers and ratepayers. • Concerned about whether a full cost-benefit analysis would show that the project could be justified in comparison to potential risks. • Concerned about the economic risks from inadequate financial assurances for the project and the questionable economic and job creation benefits of the project and the visitor center. Geology • Concerned about whether the selection of the proposed CO2 storage site was justified based on geologic data and whether the geologic storage formation could adequately support the project. • Questioned the integrity of the caprock formation and whether it could withstand the chemical effects of CO2 injection and storage. • Concerned about the potential for land deformation from CO2 injection and storage with adverse effects on agricultural drainage and whether the displacement of brine in the storage

DRAFT EIS AND DOE RESPONSES INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK Commentor - USEPA Commentor - USEPA USEPA-01 Thank you for your comment. USEPA-02 Modeling analysis for particulate matter of 2.5 micrometers or less (PM2.5) has been added to Section 3.1, Air Quality, of the Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). USEPA-03 The Department of Energy (DOE) analyzed the impacts of the gross and net emissions of the oxy-combustion facility, with and without taking into account the reduction from historic emissions from the Meredosia Energy Center. This analysis, presented in Section 3.1, Air Quality, of the Draft EIS, indicates that the emissions from the energy center would not violate the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Based on the analysis, DOE determined that a Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) increment USEPA-01 analysis was not required and, therefore, was not conducted. The discussion referred to in the comment has been clarified in Section 3.1, Air Quality, of the Final EIS, specifically in Section 3.1.3.2 under Emissions Analysis. USEPA-04 A discussion of the contemporaneous decreases in net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the Meredosia Energy Center operations USEPA-02 in relation to the PSD significance increase threshold has been added to Section 3.2, Climate and Greenhouse Gases, of the Final EIS, specifically in Section 3.2.3.2 under GHG Emissions Impact Summary in Relation to Historical Baseline Conditions at the Meredosia Energy Center. USEPA-03 USEPA-04 Commentor - USEPA USEPA-05 Thank you for your comment. DOE and the Alliance have given close consideration to the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s (USEPA’s) recommended measures to reduce pollutant emissions during construction for the FutureGen 2.0 Project. The Alliance would minimize worker exposures to diesel emissions to USEPA-04 the fullest extent practicable, along with following best management con’t practices and meeting all regulatory requirements. The Alliance maintains a strong safety focus and implementation of these and other best management practices would allow the Alliance to prevent workplace accidents and exposures to potentially hazardous materials. The Alliance is committed to developing and implementing workplace safety measures including reducing exposure to diesel fuel emissions. The actions committed to by the Alliance and DOE are presented in Table 4.2-1 (under Air Quality) and in Section 3.1.3 of the Draft EIS. DOE believes these measures will adequately protect worker and public health. USEPA-05 Commentor - USEPA USEPA-06 DOE updated the Final EIS to reflect the locations and configuration of injection wells and associated facilities based on the Underground Injection Control (UIC) Class VI permit applications submitted by the Alliance on March 15, 2013 (updated May 13, 2013 following USEPA’s completeness review). New text has been added in Section 2.5.2.1 describing the proposed injection well site as depicted on Figure 2-20. The descriptions of impacts for injection well sites have been updated where appropriate in the Final EIS; however, none of the impacts would be greater than those described in the Draft EIS for the bounding conditions and assumptions about the sites. USEPA-05 con’t USEPA-07 Thank you for your comment. USEPA-08 Thank you for your comments. DOE and the Alliance continue to collaborate on the incorporation of green design concepts into FutureGen 2.0 facilities with the objective of obtaining Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification. The Alliance considered the use of pervious pavement wherever possible in its conceptual designs and will continue to consider this option as the detailed design progresses. In areas where impervious pavement must be used, the Alliance will consider using reclaimed aggregate or glassphalt (a variety of asphalt that uses crushed glass). Reasons why the Alliance has not proposed the use of pervious pavement in some areas at this time include: USEPA-06  Some roads and parking areas need to be built to handle very heavy construction traffic. Pervious pavement typically has permeable gravel underneath; but for construction equipment, it is preferable that the underlying layer be “road pack” gravel to withstand heavy construction traffic. When construction is complete, only a thin layer of asphalt would be placed over the compacted rock that makes up the construction traffic areas. Similarly, the injection well and monitoring well pads also require a compacted, impermeable gravel layer as a base. USEPA-07  At this stage of design, the Alliance has not determined the infiltration potential of the affected soils. If, as expected, clayey soils underlie the areas to be paved, there may be difficulty in obtaining the proper infiltration rates. Water should be able to infiltrate quickly USEPA-08 so as to protect the road surfaces from freeze and thaw effects.  Hard pavement is required in some areas in order to support ice and snow removal by snowplows, which can damage some permeable pavements. With respect to the use of solar power at the injection well surface facilities, the planned site control and maintenance building is small in size and would be nestled behind southerly trees to minimize Commentor - USEPA visual impacts on the surrounding landowners; hence, solar power may not be sufficiently effective. The Alliance will investigate and consider the use of bio-diesel generators at the injection well site. As noted in the Draft EIS, the Alliance is considering the use of photovoltaic solar panels with battery storage at each monitoring well location. This would decrease the total construction impact in supplying power by overhead electric lines, although it would entail higher maintenance costs and activity over the life of the project due USEPA-08 to battery maintenance and solar cell cleaning. con’t Commentor - USEPA Commentor - USDOI Commentor - USDOI Fish and Wildlife Resources Information in the DEIS indicates that the Southern pipeline route will cross 2 perennial streams, 89 intermittent streams, and will impact no wetlands and that the Northern pipeline route will cross 8 perennial streams, 75 intermittent streams, and potentially impact 0.2 acres of wetlands. We would recommend that impacts to wetlands be avoided or impacts minimized to the greatest extent possible. Activities in the project area that would alter these wetlands may require a Section 404 permit from the US Army Corps of Engineers. Pipelines installed in wetland areas and at stream crossings should be directional bored rather than trenched if possible and installed with sufficient depth below stream bottoms so that they will not become exposed. According to the DEIS (Table 3.8-4), 33 acres of forested habitat may potentially be lost at the Meredosia Energy Center, 8 acres of forested habitat may potentially be lost along the proposed Southern CO2 pipeline route, and 21 acres of forested habitat may potentially be lost along the proposed Northern CO2 pipeline route. We are concerned about the potential loss of forested habitat from the proposed project and the potential impact to the Indiana bat and migratory birds. We recommend that forest impacts be minimized or avoided if possible. • Table 4.1-1. Summary of Environmental Impacts by Alternative for the FutureGen 2.0 Project: The Biological Resources Section discusses clearing of forested habitats and habitat fragmentation along the proposed pipeline routes; however, this section does not include a discussion regarding the potential clearing of 33 acres of forested habitat at the Meredosia Energy Center. The potential habitat loss at the Meredosia Energy Center should be discussed in this section. Federally Threatened and Endangered Species To facilitate compliance with Section 7(c) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended, Federal agencies are required to obtain from the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) information concerning any species, listed or proposed to be listed, which may be present in the area of the proposed action. The list for Morgan County includes the endangered Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis), threatened decurrent false aster (Boltonia decurrens), and threatened eastern prairie fringed orchid (Platanthera leucophaea). There is no designated critical habitat in the project areas at this time. A current list of species in Illinois by county can be found at the following website: http://www.fws.gov/midwest/endangered/lists/illinois-cty.html. Information in the DEIS (Table 3.8-1) indicates that the suitable habitat for the Indiana bat, decurrent false aster, and the eastern prairie fringed orchid exists in the Region of Influence (ROI). According to the DEIS (Table 3.8-4), 33 acres of forested habitat may potentially be lost at the Meredosia Energy Center, 8 acres of forested habitat may potentially be lost along the proposed Southern CO2 pipeline route, and 21 acres of forested habitat may potentially be lost along the proposed Northern CO2 pipeline route. The USFWS is concerned about the potential loss of forested habitat from the proposed project and the potential impact to the Indiana bat. We 2 USDOI-01 The southern pipeline route is the Alliance’s proposed alternative for the carbon dioxide (CO2) pipeline. Minor adjustments continue to be made to the route to avoid biological and cultural resources, to avoid constructability issues, and to accommodate the concerns of landowners. The proposed southern route would cross 2 perennial streams, 13 intermittent streams (as classified by the U.S. Geological USDOI-01 Survey [USGS]), and many ephemeral streams, swales, and ditches. A wetland survey of the southern pipeline route was completed in spring 2013. The delineation was completed in accordance with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Regional Supplement to the Corps of Engineers Wetland Delineation Manual: Midwest Region (Version 2.0) along with the Midwest 2012 Final Regional Wetland Plant List (USACE 2010; Lichvar 2012). Based on the delineation, 14 wetland areas (excluding open waters), ranging in size from about 0.02 to 0.1 acre for a total of approximately 0.5 acre of wetland, were identified within the ROW along the approximately USDOI-02 30 miles of pipeline. The Alliance is coordinating with USACE for a determination with respect to wetlands that are considered waters of the U.S. and to identify permitting requirements. The Alliance intends to avoid wetlands by boring under them where appropriate using directional drilling methods described in the Draft EIS in order to meet the requirement of Nationwide Permit No. 12 (Utility Line Activities) that “the activity does not result in the loss of greater than ½-acre of waters of the United States.” The Alliance plans to trench through only 0.03 acre of wetland, as authorized by the USACE, in an area that is currently and will return to agriculturally cultivated land. Stream and wetland information has been updated in Section 3.6, Surface Water, Section 3.7, Wetlands and Floodplains, and Section 4.1, Comparative Impacts of Alternatives, of the Final EIS. USDOI-02 Through ongoing refinements in siting plans, the amount of forested habitat that could be lost will likely be significantly lower than the upper bound identified in the Draft EIS (i.e., 33 acres at the Meredosia Energy Center site and 8 acres along the southern pipeline route). Based on current plans, it is estimated that USDOI-03 impacts could range from less than 1 acre to as many as 9 acres of forested lands (depending on availability of construction areas) at the Meredosia Energy Center. Refinements to the alignment of the southern pipeline route would also avoid forested areas. Where complete avoidance would not be possible, the pipeline would be routed to avoid additional habitat fragmentation by skirting the edges of forest patches or by minimizing the crossing distance at linear forested areas. Some of the linear forested areas would be avoided by boring under them Commentor - USDOI recommend that forest impacts be minimized or avoided if possible to reduce impacts to potential habitat for the Indiana bat. If forest impacts are necessary, than we recommend that Indiana bat habitat assessments be conducted in the forested areas potentially impacted by the proposed project in order to assess the value of the habitat to Indiana bats. These results should be coordinated with the USFWS and depending on the results of the habitat assessments it may be necessary to conduct additional acoustic or mist net surveys to ascertain whether Indiana bats occur in the proposed project area. • Section 3.8.2.5 CO2 Pipeline: We recommend that the Indiana bat be included in the protected species section since the species could potentially occur within the CO2 pipeline corridor. Information in the DEIS indicates that the decurrent false aster is known to occur approximately 1.5 miles northwest and approximately 2.5 miles south of the proposed project area. Surveys of the project area were unclear if the species may or may not be present in the project area. Since the decurrent false aster is known to occur in the vicinity of the project area and given the opportunistic nature of the decurrent false aster to colonize open moist or wet areas that experience natural or man-made disturbances and its ability to disperse over shorter distances by seeds carried by wind or animals, we recommend that additional surveys for the decurrent false aster be conducted in areas of suitable habitat within the ROI. Should the species be found, than additional coordination with the USFWS should occur. Information in the DEIS indicates that it is possible that the eastern prairie fringed orchid could occur in lowland or wetland areas in the ROI. We recommend that searches for this species be conducted if wet prairie remnants are encountered in the ROI. Should the species be found, than additional coordination with the USFWS should occur. In accordance with section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, it is the responsibility of the Federal action agency; in this case the DOE, to determine if the action may adversely affect listed species. If the DOE determines that the action is not likely to adversely affect these listed species, and the USFWS concurs with this finding, section 7 consultation is concluded. If it is determined that the action may adversely affect listed species, the DOE is required to initiate formal section 7 consultation with the USFWS. At the conclusion of formal consultation, the Service issues a biological opinion that determines whether the action is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the listed species. Biological opinions also may contain measures to minimize the incidental take of listed species resulting from the action. Migratory Birds The forested wetlands along the Illinois River provide nesting habitat for the bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), which has officially been removed from the List of Endangered and Threatened Species as of August 8, 2007. Although the bald eagle has been removed from the threatened and endangered species list, it continues to be protected under the MBTA and the BGEPA. The USFWS developed the National Bald Eagle Management (NBEM) Guidelines to provide landowners, land managers, and others with information and recommendations regarding how to minimize potential project impacts to bald eagles, particularly where such impacts may 3 using directional drilling methods for the pipeline, because they are associated with streams, wetlands, or road crossings. Over the 30mile pipeline route, there are approximately 10 areas of forested lands, the majority of which would be unaffected because boring under the forested areas would be employed to avoid wetland areas within the forest. Because the forested areas are scattered along the route, the impact at each area would be small and range from about 0.03 acres to 1.7 acres, for an approximate total loss of 6 acres compared to the upper bound of 8 acres provided in the Draft EIS. In all cases, the small areas of forest that would be affected are part of larger swaths of available forested habitat. The forested areas along the pipeline and at the Meredosia Energy Center site would be cleared between September and February to avoid disturbing the Indiana bat and migratory birds. Based on the revised estimate of affected forested lands in the Final EIS and because only a small amount of forested habitat would be affected USDOI-03 con’t in relation to the available habitat in the region, DOE does not consider that a conservation plan for restoration and enhancement of migratory bird habitat in the vicinity of project area would be warranted. In consideration of the reduced forest acreage impacts, the USFWS concurred with DOE’s position at a meeting held on June 28, 2013. DOE has updated Section 3.8, Biological Resources, and Section 4.1, Comparative Impacts of Alternatives, of the Final EIS to reflect the most recent data. Table 4.1-1 has been revised to list the acreages of forest habitat that would be lost permanently for construction at the Meredosia Energy Center, the Alliance’s proposed southern CO2 pipeline route, and the alternative northern CO2 pipeline route. Text has also been added for “Biological Resources” under “Construction” in Table 4.1-1, summarizing the impacts on forests and explaining how potential impacts would be reduced as discussed in this response. USDOI-03 DOE has been engaged in ongoing consultations with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) regarding updates to the project footprint and the status of threatened or endangered species surveys. Also, DOE will continue to consult with the Illinois Department of Natural Resources regarding state-listed species. DOE is preparing a Biological Assessment for submission to the USFWS that addresses USDOI-04 the three federally-listed species for which suitable habitat occurs in the project area: the Indiana bat, decurrent false aster, and eastern prairie fringed orchid. In the spring and summer of 2013, Indiana bat habitat assessment surveys were completed at the Meredosia Energy Center and along the current southern pipeline route. Bat Commentor - USDOI constitute “disturbance,” which is prohibited by the BGEPA. A copy of the guidelines is available at: http://www.fws.gov/migratorybirds/CurrentBirdIssues/Management/BaldEagle/NationalBaldEagleManagementGui delines.pdf The USFWS is unaware of any bald eagle nests in the proposed project area; however, given that there is suitable habitat within the ROI we recommend that surveys be conducted to ascertain whether bald eagle nests occur in the proposed project area or vicinity of the proposed project area. If a bald eagle nest is found then the USFWS should be contacted and the guidelines implemented. In addition to habitat for bald eagles, habitat for a variety of other migratory birds species also occur in the project vicinity. This includes the Illinois River, the forested habitat along the Illinois River, and Meredosia National Wildlife Refuge. We are concerned about the potential loss of forested habitat from the proposed project and the potential impact to migratory bird trust resources. Per Executive Order 13186 (Responsibilities of Federal Agencies to Protect Migratory Birds), appropriate measures should be taken during construction to avoid or minimize take of migratory birds. In addition, the USFWS recommends that a conservation plan be developed to restore or enhance migratory bird habitat in the vicinity of the project area to mitigate for any forested habitat loss caused by the proposed project. Consultation Questions or comments for the USFWS can be directed to Mr. Matt Mangan at the Ecological Services Sub-Office, 8588 Route 148, Marion, Illinois 62959-4555; telephone 618-997-3344, ext. 345; facsimile: 618-997-8961. Conclusion Given the increased potential for impacts upon fish and wildlife resources from the proposed Northern pipeline route, the USFWS would concur with the Southern pipeline route as the preferred option. We appreciate the opportunity to review the DEIS and provide these comments. Sincerely, Lindy Nelson Regional Environmental Officer 4 surveys were conducted according to methods outlined in the 2013 Indiana Bat Summer Survey Guidance Overview (USFWS 2013). As described in response to Comment USDOI-02, the affected forested areas would be limited in size as practicable, and all affected areas would be adjacent to larger areas of available forest habitat. Decurrent false aster surveys will be conducted during flowering in autumn 2013 where potential habitat has been identified in the areas that would be impacted by project activities. DOE oversaw an initial survey for the eastern prairie fringed orchid in the project area where USDOI-04 con’t potential habitat was identified. The soil types found in this area are not suitable for this species, and no individuals were found. Appendix E to the Final EIS has been updated to include the status of surveys completed since the Draft EIS was published. The Biological Assessment was not yet completed for inclusion in the Final EIS. However, DOE understands its obligations under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act to determine whether the proposed action may adversely affect listed species. Based on the progress of the Biological Assessment at publication of the Final EIS, DOE believes that the proposed action is not likely to adversely affect any of the listed species. The Biological Assessment, when submitted, will inform DOE’s final determination and will identify measures as appropriate to minimize impacts to federally listed species. The Biological Assessment would also support the USFWS in issuing its Biological Opinion for the project, if one is needed. USDOI-04 DOE conducted bald eagle surveys on the Meredosia Energy Center site in June 2013 and determined that there are no nesting bald eagles onsite. These results will be communicated to USFWS in the Biological Assessment as part of the Section 7 consultations. As described in response to Comment USDOI-02, the forested acreage USDOI-05 expected to be disturbed has been substantially reduced, and the forested areas along the pipeline and at the Meredosia Energy Center site would be cleared between September and February to avoid disturbances to the Indiana bat and migratory birds. Because only a small amount of forested habitat would be affected in relation to the available habitat in the region, DOE does not consider that a conservation plan for restoration and enhancement of migratory bird habitat in the vicinity of the project area would be warranted as was suggested in the comment. USDOI-05 DOE and the Alliance appreciate the concerns of the USDOI regarding the potential impacts of the FutureGen 2.0 Project on fish and wildlife resources, threatened and endangered species, and migratory birds. This is one of the factors that led to selection of the southern option as the proposed pipeline route. Commentor IDOA IDOA-01 Thank you for your comment. The Final EIS has been updated in Section 3.3, Physiography and Soils, and Section 4.1, Comparative Impacts of Alternatives, to identify the acreage of prime farmland that would be affected based on the proposed injection well site and final CO2 pipeline route. Also, DOE added the AIMA to the Final EIS as Appendix H. If required, DOE and the Alliance will work with the State NRCS office to complete the USDA NRCS Forms AD-1006. DOE understands that the forms may not be required for lands that would be leased only during the period of construction and returned to their prior use after completion. IDOA-01 Commentor IDOA PUBLIC COMMENT MEETING 5/21/2013 Page 1 1 UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY 2 3 IN RE: 4 FUTUREGEN 2.0 DRAFT 5 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 PUBLIC COMMENT MEETING 17  MAY 21, 2013 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 PUBLIC COMMENT MEETING 5/21/2013 Page 2 1  I N D E X 2 SPEAKERS: PAGE 3 Cliff Whyte     5 4 Ken Humphreys   7 5 Cliff Whyte    12 6 Adam Pollet    16 7 Betty Niemann  21 8 Richard Johnson    36 9 Pamela Hardwicke   37 10 Axel Steuer    42 11 Terry Denison       45 12 Tom Grojean    48 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 MIDWEST LITIGATION SERVICES MIDWEST LITIGATION SERVICES www.midwestlitigation.com Phone: 1.800.280.3376 Fax: 314.644.1334 www.midwestlitigation.com Phone: 1.800.280.3376 Fax: 314.644.1334 PUBLIC COMMENT MEETING 5/21/2013 1   UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY 2 3 IN RE: 4 FUTUREGEN 2.0 DRAFT 5 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 PUBLIC COMMENT MEETING, on the 21st day of 17 May, 2013, between the hours of 5:00 P.M. and 7:15 18 P.M. of that day, at the Jacksonville High School, 19 1211 North Diamond Street, Jacksonville, Illinois 20 62650, before Robin A.

HUMPHREYS:  Well, thanks. 20 First of all, I just really want to 21 thank all of you for taking time out of your 22 evening to be here tonight, and while I'm going 23 to talk for a few minutes right at the beginning, 24 certainly our primary objective here tonight is PUBLIC COMMENT MEETING 5/21/2013 Page 8 1 to listen to your input that you're providing to 2 the Department of Energy. 3 And it's been about 24 months since 4 the Department of Energy started the 5 environmental impact statement process.  We're, 6 of course, quite pleased with the draft 7 conclusions that suggest the project has very, 8 very low negative environmental impact and 9 significant positive benefits.  Ultimately you 10 get to be the judge of that. 11 But while the environmental impact 12 statement process was ongoing over the past 24 13 months, our engineering work continued in the 14 background; and we had a tremendous opportunity 15 to learn a lot from the engineering work, learn 16 from the geologic characterization work we did at 17 the storage site and scientific investigations, 18 learn from talking to regulators at various 19 agencies to understand the performance and 20 expectations they have of this project -- we can 21 take those learnings and feed them back into the 22 design -- and, quite importantly, having the 23 opportunity to talk with so many local landowners 24 as well as community leaders.  I think they MIDWEST LITIGATION SERVICES MIDWEST LITIGATION SERVICES www.midwestlitigation.com Phone: 1.800.280.3376 Fax: 314.644.1334 www.midwestlitigation.com Phone: 1.800.280.3376 Fax: 314.644.1334 PUBLIC COMMENT MEETING 5/21/2013 Page 9 1 provided valuable perspectives that helped us 2 shape the project. 3 Next slide, please. 4 So our goal remains the same, and 5 that is to take the Meredosia Energy Center, 6 which is now an idle plant, and turn it into the 7 cleanest coal-fired power plant in the U.S. and 8 most likely the world. 9 Next slide, please. 10 A number of things have been 11 accomplished over the past 24 months.  The 12 conceptual design work is complete. 13 We have a whole portfolio of permit 14 applications that sit in front of various 15 agencies.  Behind each of those permit 16 applications is a tremendous amount of 17 engineering work and reflects the learnings of 18 the past two years.  So as you can see on the 19 chart, air permit, water permit, permission to 20 connect to the transmission grid, pipeline 21 permit, CO2 storage permit all pending before 22 regulatory agencies. 23 We've made tremendous strides in 24 terms of acquiring subsurface rights from local PUBLIC COMMENT MEETING 5/21/2013 1 landowners to store the CO2.  Talk a little bit 2 more about that later. 3 We also last December had a major 4 success with the Illinois Commerce Commission 5 when the primary terms of our power purchase 6 agreement were approved.  And the power purchase 7 agreement is incredibly important because it 8 governs the long-term sales of electricity from 9 the plant, and it's the basis by which you can 10 get commercial financing to complement the DOE 11 funding to begin to start construction. 12 And, of course, draft EIS was 13 released. 14 And right now the second phase of 15 work:  $140 million of design and permitting 16 activities are now underway. 17 Next slide. 18 So if you don't mind a bit, I have a 19 bit of a bad leg here.  So I'm going to take a 20 seat while I go through a few of these slides. 21 As many of you know, we drilled a 22 geologic characterization well at the storage 23 site over 4,000 feet deep.  We spent about $10 24 million characterizing the geology and getting Page 10 MIDWEST LITIGATION SERVICES MIDWEST LITIGATION SERVICES www.midwestlitigation.com Phone: 1.800.280.3376 Fax: 314.644.1334 www.midwestlitigation.com Phone: 1.800.280.3376 Fax: 314.644.1334 PUBLIC COMMENT MEETING 5/21/2013 1 ourselves comfortable that it's a high quality 2 storage reservoir.  That storage reservoir is 3 located about two miles northwest of Old State 4 Road and Route 123.  We've been really privileged 5 that more than 45 individual landowners, all 6 through mutual transaction, have agreed to allow 7 us to acquire their subsurface storage site -8 space. 9 Next slide, please. 10 And so, as we look ahead to next 11 spring, we will complete the permitting and the 12 final designs.  Early summer we'll move to 13 commercial financing and construction.  By the 14 fall of 2015, the pipeline, the storage site, 15 and, quite importantly, visitor, research, and 16 training facilities here in Jacksonville will be 17 constructed.  By the spring of 2017, the power 18 plant will complete construction, and by the fall 19 of that year, will be in full commercial power 20 generation. 21 Next slide, please. 22 And so just to wrap up, we're working 23 on building the cleanest coal-fired power plant 24 in the U.S.  Some of the local benefits that are Page 11 PUBLIC COMMENT MEETING 5/21/2013 1 extremely important are the construction and 2 permanent jobs that can be an economic shot in 3 the arm to Morgan County.  It increases property 4 tax revenue to the county by million or millions 5 of dollars.  We'll be investing more than $25 6 million in visitor, research, and training 7 facilities in Jacksonville.  That leads to 8 expanded educational opportunities, and it also 9 is a -- spurs tourism and other business growth. 10 And in addition to the local 11 benefits, more broadly in Illinois we have 12 manufacturers and contractors who ultimately 13 support construction.  We'll be using Illinois 14 coal.  That spurs broader growth across the 15 state.  So all in all, in our view, we see this 16 as a win-win project for industry, for the folks 17 in Morgan County, as well as the nation. 18 And so thanks very much for your 19 time, and I will spend the rest of my evening 20 listening to you. 21 MR. WHYTE:  Thank you, Mr. Humphreys. 22 I have just a few slides on the NEPA 23 process that we'll move through this evening. 24 Go ahead, Jamie. Page 12 MIDWEST LITIGATION SERVICES MIDWEST LITIGATION SERVICES www.midwestlitigation.com Phone: 1.800.280.3376 Fax: 314.644.1334 www.midwestlitigation.com Phone: 1.800.280.3376 Fax: 314.644.1334 PUBLIC COMMENT MEETING 5/21/2013 1 The very, very brief history of NEPA. 2 This is a federal law.  It's been effective since 3 1970.  It applies to all federal agencies and 4 major federal actions.  It is the national 5 charter for protection of the environment, and it 6 certainly promotes environmental considerations 7 in the decision-making process. 8 Next slide. 9 If you haven't had an opportunity to 10 look at the EIS, very briefly you would see there 11 are basically three documents.  There is a 12 summary, which is about a 50-page document that 13 is sort of the high-level basics, if you will. 14 There is the Volume I, which happens to be the 15 majority of the analysis and more detail with 16 each resource area that was looked at.  And then 17 there is a second volume that is basically the 18 appendixes.  It also includes, for those who 19 might be particularly interested in more detail, 20 maps of the CO2 pipeline routing.  We tried to 21 provide the best scope so that that could be 22 looked at, and that's included, again, in Volume 23 II. 24 All those are available online.  You Page 13 PUBLIC COMMENT MEETING 5/21/2013 1 can see me after the meeting.  I'll be happy to 2 provide with you links.  If you would like a copy 3 of any or all of those documents and you have not 4 received one, please let me know.  Be happy to 5 get those out to you. 6 Next slide, please. 7 As you can see, we are moving through 8 the NEPA process.  The scoping meetings that I 9 spoke of earlier that were held a couple years 10 ago -- they were the first public involvement in 11 the process, at least as far as NEPA is 12 concerned. 13 The public comment period that we're 14 in right now is the second public comment process 15 where we're inviting your participation and 16 comments on the draft documents before they would 17 become final. 18 You can see the rest of the NEPA 19 process there involves the preparation of the 20 final EIS, then a waiting period of at least 30 21 days, and then the potential for a ROD or record 22 of decision to be issued at that point. 23 This is the basic schedule that we 24 are on.  As you've heard me say, comments are due Page 14 MIDWEST LITIGATION SERVICES MIDWEST LITIGATION SERVICES www.midwestlitigation.com Phone: 1.800.280.3376 Fax: 314.644.1334 www.midwestlitigation.com Phone: 1.800.280.3376 Fax: 314.644.1334 PUBLIC COMMENT MEETING 5/21/2013 Page 15 1 by June 17th.  So if you don't give comments this 2 evening, there's still plenty of time to do so. 3 You're welcome to supplement your comments that 4 you may give this evening or you may have already 5 given to us with additional comments later on. 6 Okay, Jamie. 7 Logistics for tonight.  We don't have 8 a large number of speakers, I believe, so we 9 probably are going to be able to eliminate the 10 five-minute rule, if you will.  I do want to make 11 sure that everybody who has the opportunity to 12 speak gets that opportunity this evening. 13 Obviously an official transcript is 14 being made.  We have a court reporter here, and 15 please be mindful of that when you're giving your 16 comments.  We ask that you try to keep the pace 17 such that she's able to keep up, and we'll let 18 you know if we need for you to slow down a little 19 bit.  It's not that we're trying to interrupt 20 you, but we want to make sure that all of your 21 comments are accurately recorded. 22 I was very impressed, when I was out 23 here for the scoping meetings, with the respect 24 that was shown at those meetings.

I'll ask that you 4 continue that tonight. 5 And I guess also, in observing some 6 of the destruction and devastation that has 7 happened in the south over the last couple of 8 days, it kind of puts things into perspective. 9 At this time I think we will move to 10 our first registered speaker.  We'll leave this 11 information up for those who want to write down 12 my e-mail or telephone number to provide comments 13 at a later date. 14 The first registered speaker this 15 evening is the acting director of DCEO, Adam 16 Pollet. 17 MR.

And I think that the  21  FutureGen project really does happen to all of  22  that, in particular the innovation to make sure  23  that we are at the forefront of using the energy  24  resources we have in a responsible way while  MIDWEST LITIGATION SERVICES www.midwestlitigation.com Phone: 1.800.280.3376 Fax: 314.644.1334 Commentor 1 - Adam Pollet PUBLIC COMMENT MEETING 5/21/2013 Page 18 1 creating the best jobs for the 21st century 2 economy. 3 I'd just like to talk a little bit 4 about the project, probably things that you 5 already know but just to lay them out.  The 6 FutureGen Alliance is proposing to construct and 7 operate a 168-megawatt, coal-fueled electric 8 generation facility using oxy-combustion 9 technology.  The power side of the project will 10 be located at the old Ameren Energy Resources 11 Meredosia plant based in Meredosia.  It will use 12 the existing infrastructure and is designed to 13 capture at least 90 percent of the carbon dioxide 14 generated at the plant.  The reduced carbon 15 dioxide along with the other emission reductions 16 will make FutureGen, as I think was stated early, 17 the cleanest coal-fueled power plant in the 18 United States, something we're very proud of and 19 love to see happen. 20 COURT REPORTER:  I'm sorry.  Can you 21 slow down? 22 MR. POLLET:  Sure.  The captured 23 carbon dioxide will be compressed and transported 24 by a new underground pipeline to a geologic 1-01 con’t MIDWEST LITIGATION SERVICES www.midwestlitigation.com Phone: 1.800.280.3376 Fax: 314.644.1334 Commentor 1 - Adam Pollet PUBLIC COMMENT MEETING 5/21/2013 Page 19 1 storage area in eastern Morgan County. 2 As important as the low emission 3 electric generation side of the project is, the 4 storage of the carbon dioxide and its long-term 5 monitoring and verification of its permanent 6 storage is equally important to the viability of 7 future energy generation. 8 And I think, just to note again, 9 that's obviously where we're very excited to see 10 new technology applied and proven out in this 11 project. 12 Governor Quinn has made energy 13 conservation and low carbon emission energy a 14 priority in his administration.  Illinois has 15 seen significant growth in renewable resources. 16 And so just to understand, our 17 commitment is very much to a broad portfolio of 18 energy resources.  We've invested in battery 19 technology as well to support renewables by 20 making them even more efficient and reliable. 21 But we do recognize we need a 22 portfolio of energy resources, and the 23 significant reserves of coal under Illinois can 24 play a vital role in providing Illinoisans, 1-01 con’t MIDWEST LITIGATION SERVICES www.midwestlitigation.com Phone: 1.800.280.3376 Fax: 314.644.1334 Commentor 1 - Adam Pollet PUBLIC COMMENT MEETING 5/21/2013 Page 20 1 Americans, and others with energy independence. 2 It is a worthy goal the FutureGen 3 Alliance, the President of the United States, 4 Senator Durbin, Governor Quinn, and the U.S. DOE 5 has set to build a coal plant that operates more 6 cleanly than a natural gas electric generator. 7 When it comes to thinking -- and this 8 is our pitch for Illinois -- big thoughts and 9 when it comes to innovation, we believe you 10 should do what FutureGen has done -- you should 11 come to Illinois. 12 In a recent report called Cyerstates, 13 Illinois outpaced the U.S. by adding 3400 tech 14 jobs in 2012.  The publisher of the report, a 15 high tech trade association known as the 16 TechAmerica Foundation, also noted that Illinois, 17 with nearly 210,000 jobs in the tech sector, 18 outpaced other Midwest states by a large margin. 19 So as we try to sustain this 20 important type of economic growth, the scientists 21 of FutureGen -- the engineers, the geologists, 22 the chemists, and the physicists -- they'll also 23 add their names to the TechAmerica jobs roster, 24 and we recognize that this project has a 1-01 con’t MIDWEST LITIGATION SERVICES www.midwestlitigation.com Phone: 1.800.280.3376 Fax: 314.644.1334 Commentor 1 - Adam Pollet; Commentor 2 - Betty Niemann PUBLIC COMMENT MEETING 5/21/2013 Page 21 1 significant impact on job creation and economic 2 development for this community and for Illinois. 3 So I appreciate the opportunity very 4 much to share with you the importance of the 5 FutureGen project to Illinois and the positive 6 impact it will have on the future of coal as an 7 important fuel source for the United States. 8 Thank you. 9 MR.

I 20 was told to follow the science when FutureGen 21 announced its location in Morgan County, and 22 this, I have done. 23 In my opinion, this risk assessment 24 analysis draft EIS for FutureGen is a work of MIDWEST LITIGATION SERVICES www.midwestlitigation.com Phone: 1.800.280.3376 Fax: 314.644.1334 2-01  The Draft EIS identified the incomplete and unavailable information  at the time of publication in Section 4.4, Incomplete and Unavailable  Information, of the document consistent with the Council on  Environmental Quality (CEQ) National Environmental Policy Act  (NEPA) regulations (40 CFR 1502.22). The NEPA regulations also  direct agencies to “…integrate the NEPA process with other planning  at the earliest possible time to insure that planning and decisions  1-01 con’t  reflect environmental values, to avoid delays later in the process, and to head off potential conflicts“ (40 CFR 1501.2). The incomplete and unavailable information regards specific design details, several  of which have been addressed in the Final EIS. It has long been  accepted that the NEPA process can and should be performed  during the planning phase of a project, before detailed designs are  complete and final decisions about site plans and layouts have been  made.  The NEPA regulations allow for decisions to be made in the  absence of information relevant to reasonably foreseeable  significant environmental impacts, provided that the agency takes  the specific steps (under 40 CFR 1502.22(b)) outlined in the four  bullets listed at the beginning of Section 4.4, Incomplete and  Unavailable Information, of the Draft EIS. The fourth item under  40 CFR 1502.22(b)(4) supports agency “…evaluation of such  impacts based upon theoretical approaches or research methods  generally accepted in the scientific community.” As further stated in  Section 4.4, Incomplete and Unavailable Information, “To account  for uncertainties caused by incomplete and unavailable information,  DOE developed bounding conditions and assumptions based on  the most current and available data and project plans in evaluating  the range of potential impacts that could occur under the proposed  project consistent with the fourth item in the list above.” This  approach ensures informed decision-making. The balance of Section  4.4, Incomplete and Unavailable Information, identifies the nature of  the incomplete and unavailable information and explains how the  potential impacts were analyzed consistent with the regulations in  the absence of the information.  The Final EIS includes additional information for some of the items  identified in Section 4.4, Incomplete and Unavailable Information,  which has not substantially affected the analyses and descriptions of  2-01  impacts. Section 4.4, Incomplete and Unavailable Information, has been updated in the Final EIS to reflect the status of information  at the time of Final EIS publication, and the analyses in Chapter 3  and 4 have been updated as appropriate. Table S-1 in the Summary  outlines the major changes from the Draft to the Final EIS, some of  Commentor 2 - Betty Niemann PUBLIC COMMENT MEETING 5/21/2013 Page 22 1 opinion and conjecture because of missing data 2 identified in Section 4.4 of Chapter 1 or Volume 3 I.  The data -- the missing data is the oxy4 combustion large scale test design; the oxy5 combustion large scale test general arrangement 6 and site plan; CO2 pipeline routes; CO2 injection 7 and monitoring wells, specifically location and 8 actual number of acres in the storage area; and 9 the educational facilities. 10 I believe these are key components of 11 the entire project and are very crucial for valid 12 site-specific EIS risk assessments in order for 13 the DOE to make an informed, educated, and valid 14 decision.  Instead, the DOE made general risk 15 assessments, and FutureGen announced an opinion 16 that the project will have no significant impacts 17 based on the EIS summary.  If anything, I believe 18 the omission of this data casts more doubts of 19 the validity of the project. 20 By the way, region of influence is 21 missing data for three adjacent counties -22 Greene, Macoupin, and Sangamon Counties -- and 23 should also be identified in Section 4.4 and 24 included in all pertinent region of influence MIDWEST LITIGATION SERVICES www.midwestlitigation.com Phone: 1.800.280.3376 Fax: 314.644.1334 which reflect the availability of new information and data.  2-02  DOE defined the Region of Influence (ROI) as appropriate for each  respective environmental resource in Chapter 3 of the Draft EIS. As  stated in the text box on page 3.0-1, “The Region of Influence (ROI)  defines the extent of the areas where direct effects from construction  and operation may be experienced, and it encompasses the areas  where indirect effects from the proposed project would most likely  occur.” Because the spatial effects of the project would differ  depending upon the specific resource in question, a single ROI was  not considered appropriate for all resources. For example, potential  impacts on cultural resources would occur at locations of direct land  disturbance and within the viewshed of project structures, while  potential impacts on air quality would occur on a regional scale.  The ROI for socioeconomic impacts was defined in Section 3.18.1.1  of the Draft EIS to include the counties of Morgan, Brown, Cass,  Pike, and Scott. The counties of Greene, Macoupin, and Sangamon  2-01 con’t  were omitted from the ROI based on the distances from FutureGen 2.0 Project components to the borders of these respective counties. DOE determined that potential effects on population, housing,  employment, and economic conditions would be experienced most  directly by Morgan County, because all project components would  be located there. Also, because the duration of construction would  be longest and involve the largest workforce at the Meredosia  Energy Center site, DOE determined that other counties closest  to Meredosia may be affected by project activities. As described in  Section 3.18, Socioeconomics, the project would have a net beneficial  effect on socioeconomic conditions, which would be experienced in  Morgan County, other counties in the ROI, and the state as a whole.  Therefore, Greene, Macoupin, and Sangamon counties would  potentially share in the net beneficial impacts, although no project  components would be located in any of the three.  2-02  Commentor 2 - Betty Niemann PUBLIC COMMENT MEETING 5/21/2013 2-03 As explained in response to Comment 2-01, DOE developed bounding conditions and assumptions based on the most current data for the FutureGen 2.0 Project to account for uncertainties Page 23 caused by incomplete and unavailable information. In all such cases, sections. 2 The DOE evaluated the potential range 3 of impacts based upon conceptual design for the 4 missing information so as "to provide 5 decision-makers with information that would 6 support a reasoned choice among all the 7 alternatives."  Conceptual design, in my opinion, 8 is a far cry from reality. 9 It further states, "As the design 10 progresses and new data becomes available, DOE 11 will review the analysis conducted in the draft 12 EIS to confirm that the analysis properly bounds 13 the range of impacts identified with each 14 alternative."  What does this mean?  Is this 15 putting the cart before the horse?  Shouldn't 16 analyses be performed on the new data to identify 17 real impacts and not see if current analyses 18 compare with the new idea -- or new data? 19 It is my believe that the citizens 20 should have all the information available to them 21 in this draft EIS on which to comment here 22 tonight.  Otherwise, I believe that we citizens 23 are denied due process and due diligence when 24 researching to make our comments about this draft the bounding conditions were based on assumptions representing the highest levels in the range of reasonably foreseeable conditions during construction and operation of project components. Where appropriate, and particularly for human health and safety analysis, assumptions considered the most severe reasonably foreseeable conditions to address potential risks and to support design-related decisions to avoid these risks. What DOE meant by the statement, “As the design process progresses, and new data become available, DOE will review the analysis conducted in the Draft EIS to confirm that the analysis properly bounds the range of impacts identified for each alternative” on page 4.4-2 of the Draft EIS, is that DOE will evaluate changes in the project during ongoing design to determine whether the impacts could exceed those described in the Draft EIS. If the anticipated impacts based on changes could exceed the upper bounds described in the Draft EIS, DOE would then update the impacts analysis in the Final EIS accordingly. This approach to impact analysis for the purposes of agency decision-making is consistent with NEPA 2-03 regulations as discussed in the response to Comment 2-01. Section 4.4, Incomplete and Unavailable Information, has been updated in the Final EIS to reflect the status of information at the time of Final EIS publication, and the analyses in Chapters 3 and 4 have been updated as appropriate. Table S-1 in the Summary outlines the major changes from the Draft to the Final EIS, some of which reflect the availability of new information and data. MIDWEST LITIGATION SERVICES www.midwestlitigation.com Phone: 1.800.280.3376 Fax: 314.644.1334 Commentor 2 - Betty Niemann PUBLIC COMMENT MEETING 5/21/2013 Page 24 1 EIS.  Again, how can there be a valid scientific 2 decision when there is missing data? 3 I have found more than one 4 inconsistency in FutureGen documentation.  These 5 inconsistencies are FutureGen's request for site 6 proposal, dated 25 October 2010, was then -- had 7 to be amended on the 11th of November 2010; 8 FutureGen's initial power sourcing agreement 9 first submitted to the Illinois power agency was 10 riddled with inconsistencies, paragraph numbering 11 errors, and reference errors; lack of detailed 12 information on the CO2 pipeline to landowners as 13 well as to the Illinois Commerce Commission in 14 its request for pipeline certification; lack of 15 injection wellhead placement detail on EPA Region 16 5 website in the Class VI UIC permitting; and the 17 pertinent data missing to the DOE for this draft 18 environmental impact statement. 19 This is not the first time -- and I 20 can go on too. 21 This is not the first time the 22 Alliance has gone through this EIS process.

As explained in response to  Comment 2-03, the Draft EIS used bounding assumptions when  determining the significance of potential impacts in cases where  certain information was incomplete or unavailable. The Final EIS  has been updated as appropriate based on data available from the  ongoing detailed design effort. Table S-1 in the Summary outlines  the major changes from the Draft to the Final EIS, some of which  reflect the availability of new information and data.

The Alliance participated with  DOE on both efforts. As stated in response to Comment 2-04, the  regulatory and permitting requirements for a complex power plant  that would also involve geologic storage of CO2 are substantial.  Also, during the process of meeting the regulatory and permitting  requirements, needs and priorities for a proposed action may  change, and the funding agency must adapt to accommodate these  changes.  2-05  Commentor 2 - Betty Niemann PUBLIC COMMENT MEETING 5/21/2013 Page 25 1 company with this kind of reputation? 2 My research discovered a revealing 3 letter Exelon wrote to Senator Durbin explaining 4 why it dropped out as an Alliance member.

I 3 will touch on those I feel are very important and 4 file a longer report containing all of my 5 concerns. 6 First, the impact on air.  The CO2 7 mitigation in the name of climate change. 8 Chris Horner, in his book "Red Hot 9 Lies," said that CO2 emissions do not contribute 10 to global warming, but global warming releases 11 more CO2 from the ocean. 12 The FutureGen project is to 13 demonstrate a way to mitigate, in the name of 14 climate change, the amount of CO2 released to the 15 atmosphere during the burning of coal for 16 electric power generation.  Or, in other words, 17 reduce the amount of CO2 released to the 18 atmosphere. 19 When talking about CO2 in the 20 atmosphere, the unit of parts per million is 21 used.  When talking about carbon sequestered in 22 land, metric tons are used.  For a true impact of 23 FutureGen's CO2 mitigation from the atmosphere, 24 the number of metric tons of CO2 sequestered into MIDWEST LITIGATION SERVICES www.midwestlitigation.com Phone: 1.800.280.3376 Fax: 314.644.1334 2-06 DOE acknowledges that the direct contribution of any single coal-fueled power plant equipped with carbon capture and storage to reducing worldwide atmospheric concentration of CO2 would be negligible and the incremental impacts on global climate change cannot be determined effectively. Therefore, DOE considered the impacts of CO2 emissions on global climate to be a subject for cumulative impact analysis addressed in Section 4.3, Potential Cumulative Impacts of the Draft EIS. As stated on page 4.3-25 of the Draft EIS, “These reductions in emissions alone would not appreciably reduce global concentrations of GHG emissions. However, these emissions changes would incrementally affect (reduce) the atmosphere’s concentration of GHGs, and, in combination with past and future emissions from all other sources, contribute incrementally to future change in atmospheric concentrations of GHGs.” As stated under Climate and Greenhouse Gases in Table 4.3-3 of the Draft EIS, “the successful implementation of the project may lead to widespread acceptance and deployment of oxy-combustion technology with geologic storage of CO2, thus fostering a beneficial long-term reduction in the rate of CO2 emissions from power plants across the United States.” DOE agrees with the scientific community that the cumulative effects of CO2 emissions on global climate change cannot be ignored, which is why the agency is participating in the FutureGen 2.0 Project and continues to fund other demonstration projects involving carbon capture and storage. Please refer to DOE’s response to Comment 14-01 for further discussion on this topic. 2-06 Commentor 2 - Betty Niemann PUBLIC COMMENT MEETING 5/21/2013 Page 27 1 the ground has to be converted to parts per 2 million.  I calculated what the parts per million 3 would be for one metric ton of CO2 sequestered. 4 This calculates out to be .00047 parts per 5 million removed from the atmosphere per one 6 million metric tons of coal per year. 7 Therefore, the annual impact of the 8 CO2 mitigation by FutureGen for its 1.1 metric 9 tons is .005 [sic] parts per million to the air 10 environment.  This amount is so small that the 11 impact is so negligible that it's almost 12 nonexistent.  The draft EIS even states this on 13 page 4.3-25 of Volume I. 14 Second, sequestration impact to 15 agricultural surface land. 16 To understand the impact of the 1.1 17 million metric tons of CO2 captured, injected, and 18 stored in the Mt. Simon layer of northeastern 19 Morgan County per year, I calculated the number 20 of gallons per metric ton of CO2 using Praxair's 21 MSDS for liquefied CO2 from Duke Energy's 22 Edwardsport IGCC CCS project.  My calculations 23 resulted in approximately 350 gallons of 24 supercritical CO2 per metric ton.  Scott MIDWEST LITIGATION SERVICES www.midwestlitigation.com Phone: 1.800.280.3376 Fax: 314.644.1334 2-07  CO2 would be injected into the Mt. Simon Formation as a supercritical  fluid. The actual volume of the injected CO2 would be a function of  fluid density, temperature, and pressure. While volumes of up to 1.1  million metric tons would be injected per year, the properties of the  supercritical CO2 would allow it to behave similar to both a gas and a  liquid, enabling the CO2 to permeate through and fill the pore space  of the target storage formation. Injection of a fluid into the deep  subsurface can under certain circumstances result in very small  topographic changes at the surface. Measuring the rate of very small  surface changes is a standard method for measuring the extent of  the CO2 plume, and can provide an early indication of permeable  pathways through any existing fracture networks (NETL 2012b).  2-06  Because any changes to the surface would be very small and  con’t  can be obscured by seasonal changes or other activities, satellite  remote sensing and stationary tiltmeters are used to measure  these changes. Surface deformation from injection does not  appear to occur at a set rate, so some areas may experience a  positive or negative displacement, which would be limited to the  plume extent. The ground surface levels also routinely change  from agricultural practices, water well withdrawals, and gas well  withdrawals. Therefore, the agricultural drainage is not anticipated  to be affected by CO2 injection. As part of the monitoring, verification,  and accounting (MVA) plan, deformation monitoring would provide  an indirect method to measure the plume development. Note that  the value of 0.3 inch per year as measured in the Algerian gas field  was the observed maximum at the In Salah CO2 injection site and  is intended as an upper bound for this analysis and is not a direct  prediction of the potential deformation rate at the proposed site in  Morgan County.  2-07  Commentor 2 - Betty Niemann PUBLIC COMMENT MEETING 5/21/2013 Page 28 1 MacDonald, Archer Daniels Midland's sequestration 2 project manager, confirmed my calculation in 3 March of 2012. 4 Therefore, the 1.1 million metric 5 tons of CO2 sequestered under Morgan County's 6 prime farmland will approximately be 385 million 7 gallons per year.  This, I do believe, will have 8 impact on land surface. 9 This 380 [sic] million gallons as the 10 potential to cause land deformation, defined as a 11 rise in the surface or to cause sinkholes within 12 the CO2 storage area.  Land deformation can be 13 used to monitor the CO2 plume movement by 14 satellite telemetry from sensors buried just 15 beneath the surface and out of the reach of 16 agricultural machinery in an agricultural 17 sequestration field. 18 Page 3.4-20 of the EIS indicates a 19 potential rise of three tenths of an inch per 20 year.  Over 20 years, this could have a potential 21 six-inch rise to upset drainage and/or tiling of 22 those agricultural areas over time. 23 If satellite telemetry can be used to 24 monitor the CO2 plume through detection of land 2-07 con’t MIDWEST LITIGATION SERVICES www.midwestlitigation.com Phone: 1.800.280.3376 Fax: 314.644.1334 Commentor 2 - Betty Niemann PUBLIC COMMENT MEETING 5/21/2013 Page 29 1 deformation, then the impact of sequestered CO2 is 2 substantial and has the potential to compromise 3 agricultural drainage which may not be able to be 4 mitigated. 5 In summary, it is my firm belief 6 that, in the haste to sign the first documents by 7 Farmers State Bank to commit 600 of the 1,000 8 acres of Morgan County to FutureGen 2.0, there 9 was lack of due diligence and knowledge of the 10 agricultural impact mitigation agreement by the 11 bank.  Pore space landowners who signed options 12 may have been denied those rights accorded 13 pipeline landowners to protect their land with 14 agricultural impact mitigation agreements. 15 Thus, if the FutureGen project does 16 go forward -- and I pray that it doesn't -- those 17 landowners who committed their land to the 18 sequestration pore space or carbon storage area 19 must be granted the same protections as those 20 landowners impacted by FutureGen's pipeline in 21 that each landowner shall be able to negotiate an 22 agricultural mitigation agreement to cover 23 damages from the construction of injection and 24 monitoring wells, electricity right of way to MIDWEST LITIGATION SERVICES www.midwestlitigation.com Phone: 1.800.280.3376 Fax: 314.644.1334 2-08  As discussed in Section 2.5.1, Section 3.3, Physiography and  Soils, and Section 3.10, Land Use, of the Draft EIS, the Alliance  has entered into an Agricultural Impact Mitigation Agreement with  the Illinois Department of Agriculture in consultation with the Illinois  Farm Bureau. The agreement is required by the Illinois Carbon  2-07  Dioxide Transportation and Sequestration Act (220 ILCS 75/20(b)  con’t  (6)), and it applies specifically to the effects from construction of a  CO2 pipeline. Under the agreement, the FutureGen 2.0 Project is  committed to implementing important mitigation measures to protect  farmland and compensating farmers for crop damages. Although the  agreement is not applicable to the surface or subsurface areas in the  CO2 storage study area, the agreements between the Alliance and  participating landowners for subsurface CO2 storage rights provide  similar protection for agricultural land and are specifically designed  for impacts pertaining to CO2 storage. The landowner agreements  provide compensation for damages resulting from adverse  impacts to the land (including deformation), groundwater, crops,  land improvements, livestock, timber, buildings, fences, drainage  systems, and equipment that could occur as a result of CO2 injection  and storage activities.  2-08  Commentor 2 - Betty Niemann PUBLIC COMMENT MEETING 5/21/2013 Page 30 1 wells and/or monitoring equipment, and potential 2 future damage to their individual surface 3 property.  And this doesn't even cover the 4 educational facility. 5 I'm sorry.  I'm recovering from 6 bronchitis. 7 Third, the impact of CO2 on the Eau 8 Claire and Mt. Simon formations. 9 The name looks like Faye Liu, but 10 it's Faye Liu, Ph.D. of hydrogeochemistry, from 11 Indiana University, has study the CO2-brine12 caprock interaction and has stated "The 13 experimental study of the Eau Claire shale under 14 the influence of CO2 injection is scarce..." 15 "Under CO2 invasion" -- and he has 16 three points. 17 "Under CO2 invasion, shale caprock is 18 geochemically reactive at temperatures near the 19 high end of geological sequestration" -- this is 20 150 to 200 degrees C -- "but unlikely near the 21 lower end," which is 50 to 80 degrees C. 22 Well-designed experiments are needed to verify 23 these chemical reactions. 24 Second of his conclusions: 2-09 2-08 con’t 2-09 Formation temperature measurements were taken throughout the stratigraphic well that was drilled in the CO2 storage study area. The temperature measured at the top of the injection interval (approximately 4,000 feet below ground surface) was 105 degrees Fahrenheit (40.5 degrees Celsius), which is below the lower end (5080 degrees Celsius) stated by the author in the study cited, and was consistent with the modeled temperature prediction and temperature data collected at the Illinois Basin-Decatur Project. The author is pointing out that shale may be more chemically reactive at the upper end of the cited temperature range and is alluding to the fact that, at lower temperatures, shale is less chemically reactive. The deep underground conditions at the FutureGen 2.0 storage site would not approach the temperatures at which the author has recommended the need for additional research. MIDWEST LITIGATION SERVICES www.midwestlitigation.com Phone: 1.800.280.3376 Fax: 314.644.1334 Commentor 2 - Betty Niemann PUBLIC COMMENT MEETING 5/21/2013 Page 31 1 "Reactivity in mixed gas systems needs to be 2 measured.  H2S and SO2 are typical impurities in 3 the flue gas for subsurface sequestration.  How 4 the shale caprock would respond to the induced 5 acidic plume is crucial to the sealing integrity 6 in the co-injection scenario." 7 My concerns are what are and at what 8 concentrations make up the remainder of the 3 to 9 10 percent of the supercritical CO2 for 10 sequestration?  Will there be H2S in the 11 supercritical CO2 as stated in the Mattoon final 12 EIS?  Will the concentration of H2S be enough to 13 categorize the supercritical CO2 as sour?  If so, 14 the Illinois Lincoln Project, which is a CO2 15 pipeline study done in 2009, recommends that the 16 self-imposed buffer zone between the pipeline and 17 a public or private occupied building be at 18 least 150 -- or no -- 1,500 feet and not -- what? 19 100 -- what did I say?  150 feet? 20 And the third one is "Moderate 21 brine" -- which is buoyant -- "migration through 22 the caprock" -- and he says it does happen -23 "can be beneficial in terms of the relief of 24 pressure buildup in the reservoir and the MIDWEST LITIGATION SERVICES www.midwestlitigation.com Phone: 1.800.280.3376 Fax: 314.644.1334 2-10  As stated in Table 2-10 of the Draft EIS, the CO2 stream must meet  the acceptance specifications identified by the Alliance before being  allowed to be transported through the pipeline to the sequestration  site. In accordance with these specifications the stream would  contain 97 percent dry basis CO2, with inert constituents consisting  of 1 percent, and trace constituents making up the remaining 2  percent of the stream. Current analysis indicates that there would be  no H2S in the CO2 stream because of the oxidizing nature of the oxy combustion process. However, for purposes of analysis, the Alliance  used the commercially accepted CO2 pipeline standard of less than  20 parts per million (ppm) H2S by weight, which is the standard  specification for pipeline quality gas and below the threshold for sour  gas. Even if the oxy-combustion process resulted in the production  of H2S, the CO2 captured at the Meredosia Energy Center would  be cleaned and preconditioned before entering the pipeline and no  detectible amounts of H2S would be expected in the CO2 stream  from the energy center.  2-10  2-11  The Draft EIS discusses potential impacts from lateral and vertical  brine migration in Section 3.4.3.2, under the subheading “CO2  Migration.” DOE used past studies and models of brine migration  during CO2 sequestration to discuss the movement of the brine as  a result of the proposed action (Zhou et al. 2010; Birkholzer et al.  2009; Lemieux 2011). Any brine movement through the confining  zone would be in response to the pressure buildup as a result of  injection, not density differentials. These studies have determined  that diffuse amounts of brine would have no impact to the overlying  groundwater resources because of the very small flow velocity and  displacement length (Zhou and Birkholzer 2011).  2-11  Commentor 2 - Betty Niemann PUBLIC COMMENT MEETING 5/21/2013 Page 32 1 geomechanical stresses to the sealing caprock," 2 but the consequences have not been explored, and 3 further study is needed to fully elucidate or 4 find out about this problem. 5 My fourth concern is the longevity 6 effects of acidic plume in the Eau Claire and Mt. 7 Simon layers. 8 This is one of my greatest fears, and 9 this is from Faye Lui's and others research paper 10 entitled "Coupled Reactive Flow and Transport 11 Modeling of CO2 Sequestration in the Mt. Simon 12 Sandstone Formation, Midwest, U.S.A.," which 13 discusses long-term risk assessment of the acidic 14 plume. 15 There's several points on this.  Acid 16 plume forms from the interaction between brine, 17 which is salt water, and the supercritical CO2 -18 in chemical terms, it's called CO2 dissolution -19 in the storage layer and could persist for a long 20 time even after there is complete dissolution of 21 the CO2.  Replenishment of the upstream 22 groundwater flow -- the brine movement -- through 23 the storage sandstone facilitates the spread of 24 the CO2 plume and promotes and replenishes the MIDWEST LITIGATION SERVICES www.midwestlitigation.com Phone: 1.800.280.3376 Fax: 314.644.1334 2-12  The “acidic plume” discussed in the study cited by the commentor  is the portion of the native brine that would have a reduced pH as a  result of CO2 dissolution into the brine within the injection zone (Liu  et al. 2011). This is the same as the solubility trapping mechanism,  2-11 con’t  which is described in Draft EIS Section 3.4.3.2 under the subheading “CO2 Migration.” Once CO2 is dissolved into the formation water, it no longer exists in a separate phase (i.e. supercritical), so there would  be no buoyant forces pushing the dissolved CO2 upwards (IPCC  2005). In fact, brine with dissolved CO2 has a higher density than the  native brine and will tend to sink in the injection zone. While the deep  groundwater flow through the Mt. Simon could increase the brine CO2 plume interaction, the flow is gradual, on the order of inches  in a hundred years (Birkholzer et al. 2009). Figure 2-26 has been  updated in the Final EIS with the latest modeled subsurface plume  extent (i.e., the Area of Review of the UIC permit applications), which  includes the furthest extent of all phases of the injected CO2 stream  (e.g., 99 percent of the separate-phase of CO2 mass).  As the CO2 dissolves into the brine, it starts a series of chemical  reactions, as the weak acid reacts with minerals within the injection  zone formation and gradually increases the pH (Liu and Maroto- Valer 2011). Eventually, on a scale of 1,000 to 10,000 years, CO2  precipitates out of the brine by forming carbonate minerals, which is  considered the most stable of all of the CO2 trapping mechanisms.  The Mt. Simon Formation is a quartz-rich sandstone, which is also  2-12  cemented with silica-rich minerals that are less likely to react to the increased acidity in the brine. Minerals that would be more likely  to react, such as feldspar, clay and mica, are found in much lower  concentrations in the Mt. Simon Formation (O’Connor and Rush  2005). As a result of the formation composition, the simulations of  Liu et al. (2011) found that the Mt. Simon Formation would have a  relatively low reactivity, with the conclusion that substantial chemical  changes are very unlikely to occur as a consequence of CO2  injection.  As explained in Section 3.4.3.2 of the Draft EIS, under the subheading  “CO2 Migration,” the cement to be used in well construction through  the injection and confining zones is specially formulated to prevent  dissolution from contact with the acidic brine. This specially  formulated cement would be used in the injection and monitoring well  casings progressively up to the ground surface, which would prevent  the buoyant CO2 from migrating up the borehole and into drinking  water aquifers or to the land surface. Aside from the stratigraphic  well, which was also constructed with CO2-resistant cement, there  are no other wells that penetrate the Eau Claire Formation in the  Commentor 2 - Betty Niemann PUBLIC COMMENT MEETING 5/21/2013 UIC Survey Area (as discussed in response to Comment 12-20).

I won't 5 even go into all that. 6 Since this plume persists in the 7 storage area longer than the buoyant CO2, it has a 8 very prolonged damage potential, longer than any 9 discussed liability.  The acid plume impact, 10 therefore, in my opinion, is substantial. 11 In other words, the long-term effects 12 of the acid plume exist long after the 13 supercritical CO2 is dissolved, even after a 14 hundred years.  We're even talking 10,000. 15 Therefore, who assumes the liability for damages 16 a hundred years or more from now?  Has man 17 created a larger environmental risk that can't be 18 mitigated in order to mitigate CO2 for the short 19 term? 20 The Government Accounting Office 21 thought that a cost analysis of cost versus 22 benefit should be done on FutureGen's 23 reorganization, but it was not done as the DOE 24 then felt that it would not come to an agreement MIDWEST LITIGATION SERVICES www.midwestlitigation.com Phone: 1.800.280.3376 Fax: 314.644.1334 2-13 In response to comments submitted during the scoping phase of the EIS, DOE explained its position on a life-cycle cost analysis in Section 1.6.2 of the Draft EIS as follows: “Among the purposes for DOE’s involvement in the FutureGen 2.0 Project are the demonstration of the technologies involved, the identification of potential efficiencies, and the development of a reference base for the costs associated with an oxy-combustion facility integrated with CO2 capture and storage. Thus, the life-cycle cost of the project relative to other technologies is not currently known with certainty, but it is not relevant in DOE’s decision-making process for the proposed action.” With respect to a cost-benefit analysis, the CEQ NEPAregulations state: “For purposes of complying with the Act, the weighing of the merits and drawbacks of the various alternatives need not be displayed in a monetary cost-benefit analysis and should not be when there are important qualitative considerations.” DOE has not completed a cost-benefit analysis for the FutureGen 2.0 Project because of the uncertainties involved in estimating the potential costs and benefits on a demonstration project for which a key purpose is to establish 2-12 the reference base for those costs and benefits. con’t 2-13 Commentor 2 - Betty Niemann PUBLIC COMMENT MEETING 5/21/2013 Page 35 1 with the Alliance.

Our review of the  7  EIS is forthcoming.   We may file more substantive  8  comments on the EIS prior to the close of the  9  public comment period on June 17.  10  Tonight I would like to take [sic]  11  more general comments on the need for oxy 12  combustion technology demonstrations like those  13  proposed for FutureGen because of the importance  14  that technology plays in addressing CO2 emissions  15  that drive climate change.  16  Last week CO2 concentrations in the  17  atmosphere approached 400 parts per million as  4-01  18  measured at the Mauna Loa observatory in Hawaii,  19  a level not seen on Earth in three million years.  20  More alarming than this one measurement is the  21  larger concentration trend.   Atmospheric CO2  22  concentrations have been growing since the start  23  of the industrial revolution, and this rate has  24  increased even more rapidly in the past few  MIDWEST LITIGATION SERVICES www.midwestlitigation.com Phone: 1.800.280.3376 Fax: 314.644.1334 Commentor 4 - Pamela Hardwicke  PUBLIC COMMENT MEETING 5/21/2013  1  decades.  Left unchecked, growing CO2 emissions  2  from human activity will drive increases in  3  global temperatures and changes in the Earth's  4  climate that will profoundly alter the  5  environment as well as pose grave dangers to  6  public health in this country and abroad.  7  COURT REPORTER:  Okay.  Slow down.  8  MS. HARDWICKE:  Reducing CO2  9  emissions will not be easy.  In 2012 global  10  carbon dioxide emissions grew by 2.6 percent.  11  Power sector emissions accounted for a large  12  share of this increase, with the world bringing  13  on line each year more than 100 gigawatts of new  14  coal- and gas-fired generating capacity.  Despite  15  an annual expenditure for wind and solar energy  16  of more than $150 billion, coal remains the  17  fastest growing world fuel by volume.  In 2011  18  coal use climbed 20 times faster than wind and  19  solar and three times faster than gas.  Today  20  fossil energy provides about 87 percent of total  21  global primary energy demand, an amount which the  22  IEA projects will drop only slightly to about 80  23  percent by 2035.  24  So while it's important to find and  Page 39 4-01 con’t MIDWEST LITIGATION SERVICES www.midwestlitigation.com Phone: 1.800.280.3376 Fax: 314.644.1334 Commentor 4 - Pamela Hardwicke PUBLIC COMMENT MEETING 5/21/2013 Page 40 1 deploy low-carbon alternatives to fossil fuels, 2 it is also true that fossil fuels are not going 3 away.  In fact, our reliance on fossil fuels, 4 including coal, is growing by a staggering 5 amount.  To avoid the worst aspects of climate 6 change, technologies like carbon capture and 7 storage must be widely deployed to limit carbon 8 emissions when fossil fuels are used.  CCS can 9 capture up to 90 percent of the carbon emissions 10 from large, stationary sources.  It can be 11 applied to plants that use coal, gas, or oil as a 12 fuel, and CCS can be used on both new plants and 13 to retrofit existing ones as well. 14 COURT REPORTER:  All right.  You're 15 not slowing down at all. 16 CATF asserts that it is important to 17 demonstrate a large number of CCS technologies, 18 including oxy-combustion with saline storage, if 19 we are going to avoid the worst consequences of 20 climate change both here and abroad. 21 As part of the EIS, the U.S. 22 Department of Energy examined several 23 alternatives to FutureGen 2.0.

They 3 have higher heat rates and therefore incur more 4 costs to operate.  Demonstrations typically 5 involve more situations in which ideal 6 functioning may be disrupted, and they run less 7 often than fully commercial plants, precisely so 8 that research can be conducted. 9 But demonstrations are a tangible 10 step forward.  They enable gains in cost savings, 11 environmental benefits, and technology know-how 12 that could dwarf the initial investment in and 13 associated costs of the project itself. 14 If the Alliance and U.S. DOE can 15 finish what they have started at FutureGen 2.0 16 and prove out this oxy-combustion saline 17 injection for carbon pollution reduction, the 18 potential benefits to climate protection will be 19 huge.

They've always been open, 3 transparent in answering questions that we might 4 have about the project -- all aspects of the 5 project. 6 And I think it's also fair to say 7 that I see a role for education in this project, 8 and we have begun.  We've begun to, I guess -- I 9 wouldn't say an involvement in the project, but 10 rather a role in the monitoring of the project by 11 training some of our faculty and some of our 12 students to play a role in the monitoring 13 process, and I think that's an important 14 educational function to have chemists from the 15 collage, geology students, and others play a role 16 in this particular monitoring of the project. 17 The college is not taking a position 18 on FutureGen, but I did just want to say formally 19 here that the transparency, the willingness to 20 meet with all the citizens, and to answer 21 questions as we pose them to FutureGen, I think, 22 has been very refreshing.

As I just  6  mentioned, when the Meredosia power plant ceased  7  generating power in December of 2011, the county  8  faced the potential loss of more than a half a  9  million dollars per year in property taxes or  10  real estate taxes.   Most of that money goes to  6-01  11  the Meredosia school district, and without those  con’t  12  funds and with the economy going on nowadays, it  13  was really going to create an uncertain financial  14  future for that school district.  15  However, with FutureGen's project and  16  their active maintenance of the plant and the  17  preparation for the future construction, those  18  property taxes have continued to be paid, and  19  that makes a real difference -- real financial  20  difference for the county and for our schools.  21  And then just to kind of summarize  2223  up, we are -- we are in rural America.

So coal is very important to rural 4 America and to all of us for the power.

Public input meeting Tuesday 21 May 2013 at Jacksonville High School. This past month my Ameren/Illinois bill included an electricity sourcing statement that said two-thirds of my power game from coal. Out of all the comments from tonight's meeting none touched on what NOT building FutureGen would mean — that coal emissions, with its CO2 NOx SOx Mercury and other pollutants, would continue unabated. 9-01 FutureGen 2.0 will make it such that my electricity usage doesn't contribute Carbon Dioxide emissions. The process will also drastically cut back on Nitrogen, Sulphur, Mercury and other emissions.

I am also aware that this project is going to increase the amount I pay for my electricity. I am extremely concerned. As a person on a low income, the increase in electricity rates (supposedly only a dollar a month) to me will stress my limited income even more. I live on an extremely tight budget where every dollar is accounted for. I am opposed to the FutureGen Project not only because of the financial impact but as the public has not been completely informed of its hazards. I think the hazards far out weigh the so called benefits for climate change mitigation. Are you aware that over time that CO2 that is being pumped into the ground could eventually become sulfuric acid or that it can cause sink holes. The draft EIS that has been provided even states that the reduction (by the project) will have no impact on CO2 mitigation for climate change...so why spend the money and harm the environment. I love the beautiful farm land of Illinois and of our other great states. I don't want to see it destroyed because of some misguided attempt of affecting climate change. Sincerely, Elizabeth Rigor 1 10-01  The Illinois Commerce Commission approved a 20-year power  purchase agreement for the FutureGen 2.0 Project. As part of  the approval process, the cost of the FutureGen 2.0 Project was  independently evaluated against a cost benchmark designed to  protect Illinois ratepayers. The costs are estimated to be less than  the cost benchmark. Under the power purchase agreement, Ameren  10-01  and Commonwealth Edison (an Exelon subsidiary) would enter into contracts with the Alliance to purchase the electricity generated  by the FutureGen 2.0 Project. The average monthly bill impact for  residential customers serviced by either Ameren or Commonwealth  Edison is estimated to be less than $1.50 per month. Customers  of rural electric cooperatives would see no impact to their monthly  10-02  electric bills.  10-02  The Draft EIS described and summarized potential hazards and  impacts of the FutureGen 2.0 Project in Chapters 3 and 4. Section  3.4.3.2 of the Draft EIS addressed the potential impacts from the  injection of CO2 into the Mt. Simon Formation under the subheading  “CO2 Storage Study Area” and determined that significant effects  would not be experienced at the land surface. The CO2 would be  injected at a depth of more than 3,900 feet below ground surface  (bgs) and confined by a 400-foot thick layer of low-permeability  siltstone and shale (the Eau Claire Formation) above the storage  formation. There is also a secondary confining layer (Franconia  Dolomite) above the Eau Claire at the CO2 injection site. The  response to Comment 2-10 provides additional information in  response to concerns about the potential acidity of the CO2 plume.  There is no scientific basis for concluding that sinkholes would  develop in a sandstone formation. The MVA program for the CO2  storage area would identify any unanticipated changes in conditions  during operations that would be addressed expeditiously to avoid  significant impacts. The response to Comment 2-06 addresses the  points regarding CO2 emissions and global climate change.         June 17, 2013 Mr. Cliff Whyte, M/S: 07, at on I07, National Energy Technology Laboratory 3610 Collins Ferry Road P.O.

The plant would utilize some existing infrastructure at Ameren Energy Resources’ (“Ameren”) Meredosia Energy Center, which ceased operations in 2011. The proposed project would capture at least 90% of the carbon dioxide from the new coal-fired plant, compress it, and transport it 30 miles away via an underground pipeline to Morgan County, where it would be injected and stored in the Mt. Simon Formation.  The project would include a visitor and research center and training facility in Jacksonville Illinois. The Draft Environmental Impact Statement for FutureGen 2.0 (“DEIS”) is legally and technically flawed. Most egregiously, the DEIS relieson a fictional “no action” alternative that pretends the Meredosia facility is operating like it did between 2007-2009. The Meredosia facility, however, has not been operating for the last two years. Ameren shut down operations because it is an old, uncontrolled, and uneconomic plant. The facility could not simply flip a switch and resume operations; it does not even have a valid operating permit. Comparing the proposed project to this fictitious baseline, the DEIS concludes that the FutureGen project will be 1 11-01 Thank you for your comment. DOE prepared the Draft EIS in accordance with Council on Environmental Quality regulations (40 CFR 1500 through 1508) and DOE regulations for implementing NEPA (10 CFR 1021). The Sierra Club’s comments as summarized here (Comment 111) are individually addressed in DOE’s comment responses 11-02 through 11-16. Specifically, for Purpose and Need (see responses to Comments 11-02 and 11-03); Alternatives (see responses to Comments 11-04, 11-05, and 11-06); and Environmental Impacts (see responses to Comments 11-07 through 11-16). DOE’s response to Comment 11-06 explains that the Draft EIS compares impacts of the proposed action with the current non-operational status, and when appropriate, with historic conditions, in order to provide reviewers with meaningful scale and perspective. Also, please see DOE’s response to Comment 11-07, which specifically discusses that Section 3.1, Air Quality, in the Draft EIS states that “DOE evaluated potential air quality impacts using current baseline conditions where the energy center is no longer in operation, as well as using historical baseline conditions prior to the 2011 suspension of operations at the energy center.” 11-01 Commentor 11 - Andrea Issod, Sierra Club beneficial because the new coal plant will have lower emissions than the old plant that already shut down. A federal agency should not espouse such an absurd, biased analysis.  The residents surrounding the Meredosia facility have breathed air free from its pollution for the last two years.  DOE must reevaluate the full impacts of the proposed project from this current baseline and “no action” benchmark of zero emissions.   The DEIS also narrowly constrains the project’s purpose and need to a choice between FutureGen 2.0 or a “no action” alternative, and it fails to consider and analyze reasonable, available, and less environmentally harmful alternatives. Further, the Department of Energy (“DOE”) failed to adequately assess all of the direct, indirect, and cumulative environmental impacts of the project.  Among other failures of the DEIS: • The purpose and need is defined narrowly as a demonstration of one specific technology, oxy-combustion, which arbitrarily constrains the alternatives analysis. • The purpose and need is based on the false premise that coal will be a vital part of this country’s future energy supply. • The DEIS considers no alternatives to the project other than no-action, which defeats NEPA’s primary purpose to compare environmental consequences of different alternatives. • The DEIS’s analysis of potential environmental impacts relies on FutureGen obtaining Clean Air Act and Class VI injection permits that it does not currently hold.  • The DEIS fails to address the cumulative impacts of a successful FutureGen 2.0 project, such as construction of additional coal plants.  The DEIS should consider the foreseeable environmental impacts of continued coal mining, transportation, and emissions. 11-01 con’t The Sierra Club is the nation’s oldest and largest grassroots environmental group, with over 1.3 million members and supporters nationwide, and 23,000 members in Illinois.

The purpose should not be limited to simply demonstrating commercial feasibility of one oxy-combustion technology for carbon capture, but should rather be expanded to include consideration of other technologies and alternative projects such as renewable energy plants that would address the environmental and climate impacts related to coal. The limited purpose and need constrained the alternatives analysis to an analysis of FutureGen as proposed or a “no action” alternative. Because of the narrow purpose and need, the DEIS does not assess alternatives such as alternative technologies or projects, renewable energy projects, conservation and efficiency, or using other sources or blends of fuel.   DOE has effectively ensured that construction of the FutureGen plant as proposed is the only means of achieving the stated purpose and need in the DEIS. If the agency constricts the definition of the project's purpose and thereby excludes what truly are reasonable alternatives, the EIS cannot fulfill its role.14  This is a completely impermissible construction of “purpose and need” that taints the remainder of the DEIS.   11 DEIS, at p. 1-6. 12 Id. at 1-7. 13 Id. at 1-6 – 7. 14 Simmons v.

As explained in Section 1.2 of the Draft EIS, DOE originally undertook the proposed action in response to the President’s FutureGen Initiative to create a near-zero emissions power plant fueled by coal. DOE defined its purpose and need for action consistent with the FutureGen Initiative. In Section 1.4 of the Draft EIS, DOE acknowledged the current and expected future importance of coal within the national mix of fuels for electric power generation based on predictions by the Energy Information Administration. DOE also acknowledged that the aging national power generation infrastructure is or soon will be in need of refurbishment or replacement. DOE further acknowledged in Section 1.4 that potential rules limiting future CO2 emissions could significantly affect the development of coal-based power generation 11-02 unless methods to reduce CO2 emissions are successfully demonstrated and adopted. Within the context of the purpose and need as consistent with the President’s FutureGen Initiative, DOE’s consideration of alternatives was necessarily limited to the reasonable alternatives that could fulfill the objectives of that initiative. In Section 1.2, the Draft EIS explains the history of the FutureGen Project and its evolution leading to the FutureGen 2.0 Project. The Draft EIS describes the alternatives DOE considered and the reasons for their elimination in Section 2.3.1, Alternative Fuel Sources, Section 2.3.2, Alternative Advanced Coal-based Electric Generating Technologies, Section 2.3.3, Alternative Retrofitting Technologies, Section 2.3.4, Alternative Sites for the Oxy-Combustion Large Scale Test, and Section 2.3.5, Alternative CO2 Pipeline and Storage Reservoir Locations. DOE considered all reasonable alternatives and mitigation measures suggested in comments on the Draft EIS. Responses to such specific comments are provided in this Final EIS. 5 Commentor 11 - Andrea Issod, Sierra Club b. Thehe DEIS Arbitrarily Assumes DEIS that Coal is a Necessary Part of b. Th the Nation’s Energy Supply The DEIS is based on the assumption that coal “serves an important role in the nation’s energy supply.”15 This is an arbitrary conclusion that is not supported by the DEIS, and it ignores the increasing availability and economic viability of cleaner energy sources, including solar and wind power. According to a 2009 Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) report, the United States will be able to meet projected consumer demand for electricity over at least the next 20 years without building any new coal-fired power plants.16 Increasing renewable energy and improving energy efficiency can completely eliminate the need for new coal power plants and shut down the oldest, dirtiest plants without adverse effects to our electricity supply.17 Coal is an inefficient and outdated source of energy, and coal-fired power plants are the dirtiest source of energy that we use today. Using coal for electricity scars lungs, tears up the land, pollutes water, devastates communities, and makes global warming worse.  Using coal for energy has devastating environmental impacts during every point in its lifecycle. Mining coal from the ground damages lands, water, and air. Transporting and burning it releases toxic air and greenhouse gas pollution, and coal-combustion waste contaminates land and water.  From cradle to grave, the damages coal causes to our environment and society are too large to ignore. The Sierra Club strongly espouses the abundant non-coal alternatives that avoid the toxic problems of mining and coal waste disposal while creating sustainable, family-supporting jobs. In order to improve our nation’s energy infrastructure, federal taxpayer dollars should focus on energy sources that do not cause health problems and global warming pollution. Renewable energy sources are increasing nationwide, and federal investments in renewables will help lower energy prices and help create a cleaner energy future. 15 DEIS, at p.

DOE acknowledges that the national mix of energy sources will vary over time, and the reductions attainable from conservation measures will continue to affect demand. As stated in Section 2.3.1 of the Draft EIS, DOE oversees a diverse portfolio of energy research, development, and demonstration efforts, including alternative fuels, renewable energy sources, and energy conservation improvements. However, none of these other efforts support the specific objective of the President’s FutureGen Initiative to demonstrate a coal-based power generation facility with near-zero emissions. 11-03 6 Commentor 11 - Andrea Issod, Sierra Club III. Alternativeserna III. es a. he or Alternativete ti The DOE Failed to Consider Renewable Energy or Projects NEPA requires federal agencies to consider reasonable and feasible alternatives to the proposed action. “A thorough study and a detailed description of alternatives . . . is the linchpin of the [EIS].”18 The DEIS is flawed because it fails to consider any meaningful alternatives to the proposed action.19 The DEIS only considers two alternatives: the “no-action alternative” and the building of the proposed FutureGen 2.0 project.  Where, as here, an agency considers only the preferred alternative and the no action alternative, courts usually find the resulting EIS is deficient.20 Because the DOE created a restrictive purpose and need for the proposed action, the DEIS does not consider any reasonable alternative technology. The DEIS has constrained the review to one project – the oxycombustion carbon capture sequestration. It does not consider alternative technologies or design plans such as alternative fuel sources or blends, locations, alternative electric generating technologies, or alternative retrofitting technologies. The DEIS also completely lacks any mention of using renewable power resources in place of building a new boiler and constructing carbon capture sequestration technology. The DOE has a broad mandate to consider all reasonable alternatives, even those that are “not within the jurisdiction of the lead agency.”21 b.b. The DOE Failed to Adequately Consider Alternative Locationsoc tion for the CO2 Storage The DOE has an obligation under NEPA to consider alternative sites to host the project. DOE is required to “[r]igorously explore and objectively evaluate all reasonable alternatives, and for alternatives which were eliminated from detailed study, briefly discuss the reasons for their having been eliminated.”22 18 Monroe County Conservation Council, Inc. v.

As explained in response  to Comment 11-03, alternatives involving different fuel sources  (other than coal), renewable energy, and energy conservation  improvements would not support the specific objectives of the  President’s FutureGen Initiative.  11-05  Alternatives considered by DOE originate as private-party (e.g.,  electric power industry) applications submitted to DOE in response to  requirements specified by respective Presidential or Congressional  directives and resulting programs, in this case the Presidential  FutureGen Initiative.  The Draft EIS explains the FutureGen  11-04  Industrial Alliance’s process for the identification and consideration of alternative locations for the CO2 storage facility in Section 2.3.5.  DOE reviewed and monitored the process for fairness, technical  accuracy, and compliance with the intent of NEPA. DOE does not  consider alternative sites or locations that have been removed from  consideration by the Alliance to be reasonable alternatives.  11-05  7 Commentor 11 - Andrea Issod, Sierra Club DOE directed FutureGen to pick two alternative sites for the carbon storage. FutureGen picked Christian County and Douglas County, but then dismissed those sites on the basis that they were not economically viable.23 The DEIS does not address additional sites raised as carbon storage possibilities in the public scoping process, such as Fayette County, which was alleged to have more available area to store CO2 than the proposed Morgan County.24 The DOE should consider these alternate locations. c.c. The No-Action Alternative is Based on the Fiction that the he Facility is Still Operating As required by law, the DEIS includes a “no-action” alternative.25 This provides “the standard by which the reader may compare the other alternatives’ ‘beneficial and adverse impacts related to the applicant doing nothing.’”26  To fulfill this requirement, DOE must “compare the potential impacts of the proposed major federal action to the known impacts of maintaining the status quo.”27 The analysis of the no-action benchmark in the DEIS is severely flawed because it is based on the fiction that the Meredosia facility is operating when it has in fact been dormant since 2011.  Maintaining the “status quo” means the facility would not operate and it would not generate any emissions. Ameren ceased operation of the Meredosia Energy Center in 2011.28 Nevertheless, the DOE compares the potential impacts from the proposed new plant to a no-action benchmark that pretends the old facility is still operating. The DEIS then concludes that building a new cleaner plant is a better option than the fictitious status-quo.29  This improper baseline taints the DEIS’ analysis of environmental impacts, as described in detail below. 23 DEIS, at p. 2-5. 24 Transcript of FutureGen 2.0 Public Scoping Meeting at 69-70, in Jacksonville, Illinois (June 9, 2011), http://www.netl.doe.gov/publications/others/nepa/FG2_scoping%20transcript_Jackso nville06092011.pdf 25  40 C.F.R. § 1502.14(d). 26 Kilroy v.

For each environmental resource in Chapter 3 of the  Draft EIS, DOE described the impacts of the no action alternative  based on status quo conditions with a non-operational energy  center. For the proposed action, DOE described the impacts for each  respective resource in Chapter 3 both in terms of the changes from  the current non-operational status and in comparison to conditions  during historical operations at the facility. These comparisons were  intended to provide reviewers with meaningful scale and perspective  for the proposed action. Also, in Table 4.1-1 of the Draft EIS, DOE  summarized the potential impacts of no action and the proposed  action for each environmental resource. Table 4.1-1 compares the  uses, demands, emissions, and/or discharges as appropriate for the  11-06  proposed action to the historical operating conditions for purposes of providing scale and perspective.

EnEnvironmental Impacts The DOE Used a Fictitious Baseline for Analyzing the Environmental Imp cta. The DOEacts of FutureGen 2.0 The DEIS’s analysis of air quality and climate impacts rests on the false premise that the existing facility continues to operate and generate pollution. Elsewhere, however, the DEIS acknowledges that this is not true. The facility voluntarily chose to shut down operations two years ago because it is very old and inefficient and cannot comply with Clean Air Act regulations.  It has no plans to continue operations.  It does not even have a valid Title V operating permit. Yet the DEIS assumes the new facility would decrease emissions by comparing the proposed facility’s potential emissions to emissions that the old plant generated between 2007-2009.  This is an improper analysis under NEPA, as well as the Clean Air Act.  The Meredosia plant shut down operations in March 2011.30 According to Ameren, the plant was closed due to stricter air pollution regulations on fine particulate matter and ozone, including the cross-state rule.31 The plant was also very old, the least efficient in the company's fleet, and could not be run economically.32 According to Steven R. Sullivan, the head of Ameren Energy Resources Co.: We cannot continue to economically operate these units. Numerous options to bring these units into compliance were explored, including installing additional environmental controls, but the costs were just too high to be justified.33 Data from EPA databases confirms that this plant generated zero emissions in 2012.34 30 DEIS, at p.

Given the two scenarios, DOE opted to present both in the Draft EIS. Section 3.1, Air Quality, in the Draft EIS states that “DOE evaluated potential air quality impacts using current baseline conditions where the energy center is no longer in operation, as well as using historical baseline conditions prior to the 2011 suspension of operations at the energy center.” DOE evaluated estimated emissions from the FutureGen 2.0 Project combined with regional “current” data to determine whether projected emissions from operation of the FutureGen 2.0 Project would cause or contribute to NAAQS exceedances. Historical emissions from the energy center prior to the 2011 shutdown were presented in the Draft EIS for the purpose of explaining why a PSD permit would likely not be required in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act as implemented by Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA). 11-07 As explained in the response to Comment 11-06, the comparisons of future conditions (with the FutureGen 2.0 Project operating) to historical conditions (with the pre-2011 Meredosia Energy Center operating) were intended to provide reviewers with meaningful scale and perspective for the impacts of the proposed action. DOE did not intend to imply that the Meredosia Energy Center was still operating or that it would be restarted in its prior configuration in the future. 9 Commentor 11 - Andrea Issod, Sierra Club Ameren does not plan to restart the facility. According to the DEIS, “Ameren has no current plans to resume operation of the power generation infrastructure at the energy center.”35  In fact, Ameren disclosed to investors in its most recent annual report that the company has been required by the Illinois Pollution Control Board “to refrain from operating the Meredosia . . . energy center through December 31, 2020” in order to obtain a waiver for its failure to bring SO2 emissions at its remaining facilities into compliance with state standards.36  The company also announced it would exit the Illinois merchant energy business altogether in a recent SEC filing.37 Among other factors, Ameren cited the reduced energy demand from advances such as energy efficiency, the level of volatility of future prices for power, and of course, environmental compliance as part of its decision to exit the merchant business. Ameren has now proposed to sell its coal-fired power plants to Dynegy.38 The DEIS ignores all of this information.  It contains no analysis of whether the plant could legally resume operations under the existing permits aside from the conclusory statement that that Ameren is “complying with applicable permits and their associated requirements.”39 In fact, the facility does not have a valid Title V operating permit.  According to the DEIS, The Meredosia Energy Center Title V Operating Permit (called a CAA Permit Program permit in Illinois) was originally issued in September 2005 but was appealed to the Illinois Pollution Control Board by Ameren. As a result of the appeal, Ameren was granted a stay of the permit and the permit never took effect. Ameren is currently in negotiation with the IEPA to resolve the issues identified in the appeal of the permit so that a Title V Operating Permit can be put into effect. Until the appeal is resolved and the stay is lifted by the Illinois Pollution Control Board, IEPA cannot modify the Title V Operating Permit.40 35 DEIS, at p. 2-13. 36 Ameren Corporation, Form 10-K Annual Report for the Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2012, available at http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/18654/000144530513000414/aee2012x1231x10k.htm 37 Ameren Corporation.

Many of these regulations have changed significantly in the past seven years since the original permit was issued, including more stringent ambient air quality standards, and the requirement to regulate emissions of greenhouse gases. Because the operating permit has been stalled at the administrative agency for the last seven years, it is unreasonable to assume the matter will be settled any time soon. Additionally, the stalled 2005 operating permit is already outdated and cannot ensure compliance with updated regulations. Meredosia cannot legally resume operations without a valid operating permit. The DOE’s assumption that the plant could restart operations under existing permits is pure fiction.  The plant is shut down and Ameren has announced publicly to shareholders and the SEC that the company is exiting the coal plant business.  The company has no plans to resume operations nor could it legally restart under current permits or its agreement with the Illinois Pollution Control Board. The DOE must redo its analysis of environmental impacts in the DEIS based on a zero emissions baseline. i. Air Quality Impacts DOE must evaluate the potential air quality impacts of the proposed facility from current baseline conditions. Local residents have not breathed in pollution from the Meredosia facility for the past two years, nor are they in any danger of the plant resuming operations. The DOE must evaluate the impacts of increasing pollution in the area from these current conditions, not conditions that occurred over five years ago. In reliance on Ameren’s application for an air permit,41 the DEIS erroneously gives FutureGen credit for “contemporaneous emissions decreases” from shutdown of the existing boilers, even though they shutdown voluntarily two years ago and cannot resume operations. By comparing potential emissions to historical emissions from the facility, the DEIS finds that, “overall the net emissions of the Meredosia Energy Center would decrease in comparison to historical emissions rates.”42  The DOE should not rely on Ameren’s biased analysis, which is not permissible under the Clean Air Act or NEPA.  As described in the DEIS, the facility will in fact increase pollution in the area by 292 tons per year (tpy) of sulfur dioxide (SO2), 1,482 tpy of nitrous oxide, 1,266 tpy of carbon monoxide, 105 tpy of particulate matter 11-07 con’t 41 Id. at p. 3.1-24. 42 Id. at p. 3.1-23. 11 Commentor 11 - Andrea Issod, Sierra Club less than 10 microns (PM10), 35 tpy of particulate matter less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5), and 30.3 tpy of volatile organic compounds (VOCs).43 These are significant emissions that must be evaluated in the DEIS, and which will require a major source permit under the Clean Air Act. The DEIS must evaluate the full emissions from the facility from a zero emissions baseline.   ii. Climate Change and Greenhouse Gases The make-believe baseline also taints the DEIS’ characterization of greenhouse gas emissions. By relying on the fiction that the old plant is emitting CO2, the DEIS wrongfully concludes that the project would have an overall beneficial cumulative impact on reducing CO2 emissions. As explained, the Meredosia Energy Center’s operations were suspended at the end of 2011, at which point it ceased to emit any CO2.44 Since the FutureGen 2.0 project will be an entirely new source of CO2 emissions, the DEIS must analyze its potential CO2 emissions compared to a zero emission baseline.  Although FutureGen proposes to capture 90% of its CO2 emissions, it does not have an air permit or any other enforceable requirement to actually capture any percentage of the new plant’s CO2 emissions.  Without such enforceable requirements, the DEIS cannot assume any CO2 emissions will actually be captured.  DOE must analyze the environmental and climate impact of the full amount of CO2 emissions from the Meredosia Energy Center. The DEIS must be redone to evaluate the true climate change impacts of this proposal. b. Because FutureGen 2.2.0 Does Not have a Valid Clean Air Act ermi or ea on ns, DOE Must Evaluate the Permit with Enforceable Conditions, D Full Emissions From the Project The proposed FutureGen oxy-combustion boiler does not have Clean Air Act permit from the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency. Ameren submitted an application to the agency for a construction permit on February 6, 2012,45 and an update to the application is needed because of changes to the project.46 The DOE’s analysis of FutureGen’s air quality and climate change impacts improperly assumes that the facility will limit its emissions by including control equipment and through other operational measures.

DOE’s decision with respect to  the proposed action of providing federal funding for the FutureGen  2.0 Project is based on the project as so described. Furthermore,  the FutureGen 2.0 Project must ensure the capture and geologic  storage of at least 90 percent of CO2 for it to be fully compliant with  11-08  the Power Purchase Agreement and the Illinois Clean Coal Portfolio Standard Law (20 ILCS Part 3855).

Without actual permits containing enforceable conditions requiring controls or otherwise limiting emissions, however, the DEIS must analyze the environmental impact of the full potential amount of emissions from the FutureGen project. The DOE cannot limit the scope of its review based on permits that do not exist. As explained previously, Ameren’s application for a Clean Air Act permit is significantly flawed because it takes credit for emissions reductions from the old plant that is not currently operating and cannot legally resume operations. c. he DOE Fa ed Adequately Address Potential The DOE Failed to Adequa el Th te ti Environmental Impacts of Long Term Carbon Storage The DOE should evaluate the environmental impacts of large scale CO2 sequestration for potentially significant impacts to the environment, public health, and private property. Improper storage or long term monitoring could lead to health risks to nearby populations, harm flora and fauna and agriculture, create pressure changes causing ground heave, and even trigger seismic events. CO2 leakage can also lead to groundwater contamination by leaking into potable aquifers or causing saline intrusion. Accidental releases of CO2 will also impact climate change.  The DOE does not sufficiently address these possibilities in the DEIS. The DOE Impermissibly Failed to Address Financial Assurance d. he dre nanci As rance and Long-nd rmTerm Monitoring Plans The DEIS does not address a future monitoring or a financial assurance plan to insure the long-term stability of the CO2 sequestration.  Though FutureGen will need both a monitoring and financial responsibility plan before obtaining a permit for the Class IV injection wells, that permit has not yet been issued. The lack of financial assurance and monitoring can lead to negative environmental impacts and therefore must be assessed in the DEIS.   The FutureGen 2.0 project proposes a demonstration period beginning in 2017 and ending in 2022, with active injection and monitoring, and commercial operations potentially continuing beyond this DOE-funded period.47  The CO2 injection will operate for a total of 20 years, and the monitoring and verification process will continue for another 50 years afterwards.48 47 DEIS, at p. S-20. 48  Id. at p. S-20. 13 11-10  The Draft EIS addressed potential environmental impacts of long term carbon storage in a number of sections. Section 3.4.3.2 of  the Draft EIS describes the analysis and modeling that have been  conducted for CO2 injection and storage in the Mt. Simon Formation,  11-09  the expected integrity of the primary and secondary confining  con’t  formations, seismicity risks, and the monitoring and verification  activities that would be required for compliance with the UIC Class  VI permits for the injection wells. Section 3.5.3.2 of the Draft EIS  describes the analysis and modeling that have been conducted  relevant to the potential for leakage from the CO2 storage formation  into underground sources of drinking water. Section 3.17.3.2  addresses the potential risks for leakage of CO2 from pipeline and  CO2 injection wells during operations. Section 3.17.3.3 addresses  the potential risks for leakage of CO2 from the CO2 storage formation  after injection, including after CO2 injection has ceased.  11-10  11-11  The Draft EIS addressed long-term monitoring plans for CO2 storage in Section 2.5.2.4. The Draft EIS describes the anticipated  MVA program for the FutureGen 2.0 Project that would be required  by the UIC regulations to obtain a Class VI permit for each well.  Unavailable at the time the Draft EIS was published, the Alliance  has since submitted its consolidated UIC permit application in March  2013 (updated May 2013), including the long-term monitoring and  financial assurance requirements. The application has been posted  by the USEPA at its UIC website for public access (http://www.epa.  gov/r5water/uic/futuregen/index.htm). Based on the analysis and  modeling conducted by the Alliance (see response to Comment 11 10), DOE concluded that the CO2 storage effort would not cause  significant impacts to the natural and human environment. DOE  assumes that if UIC Class VI permits would not be approved the  11-11  project would not be able to comply with other permit and project requirements and the FutureGen 2.0 Project would not proceed as  planned; hence, concerns raised in this comment about risks and  negative impacts in the absence of an MVA program and financial  assurance plan would be moot.  The Final EIS has been revised to include a discussion of financial  assurance in Section 2.5.2.4. The Alliance would be responsible  for post-injection site care and monitoring. The Alliance would also  be responsible for any emergency or remedial actions that might  be necessary. The Alliance would establish a trust fund and would  obtain insurance to ensure that sufficient funds are available to meet  its responsibilities to protect underground sources of drinking water  and public health and safety. The Alliance’s proposed post-injection  site care and monitoring and financial responsibility for emergency  Commentor 11 - Andrea Issod, Sierra Club The DEIS does not address who will remain responsible for the project past the demonstration period.  Instead, it relies on a financial responsibility plan that will eventually be developed under the Safe Drinking Water Act regulations.49  Effective financial assurance mechanisms are necessary to ensure that closure and post-site care, such as monitoring, are conducted.  Without an adequate financial assurance mechanism, the site is at risk of environmental contamination, adverse human health effects, and a danger of abandonment. Similarly, the DEIS does not address a monitoring plan, which is necessary to ensure that the CO2 stays sequestered. There is no plan that ensures that the CO2 will stay sequestered during the planned 50-year monitoring period or beyond. Public scoping comments indicated local residents’ fear of a potentially dangerous CO2 leak and the lack of adequate evacuation procedures. Yet, the DEIS fails to provide any sort of emergency procedures regarding a CO2 leak, instead stating that they will be determined by Alliance in the future.50 The DOE must analyze the full impacts of the project, including potential future impacts, and cannot rely on permits that do not currently exist. The DEIS must analyze the financial assurance of FutureGen and the future monitoring program. e. The DOE Does Not Assess Future Costs of the FutureGen 2.0 Project The DEIS does not consider who will be responsible for covering possible escalating costs of FutureGen 2.0.  This is particularly important because “advanced” coal technologies and carbon capture and sequestration projects have a history of exceeding expected costs. For example, the first FutureGen project was abandoned in 2010 due to increased expenses, from a beginning budget of $1.3 billion to $1.8 billion.51 Mississippi Power Company’s Kemper IGCC plant’s costs have doubled throughout the course of the project.52 Although the DOE contributed enough funds to help the Kemper project get started, most of Kemper’s $4 billion dollar price tag will be paid by ratepayers in economically depressed, communities of color in Mississippi. The Edwardsport coal gasification plant in Indiana started with 49  Id. at p. S-23. 50  Id. at p.

As stated in the Final EIS Cover Sheet, DOE’s decision with respect to the FutureGen 2.0 Project relates to the provision of approximately $1 billion in federal funding. This Final EIS is intended to support 11-11 DOE’s decision whether to provide that funding. No additional federal funding is anticipated. con’t 11-12 14 Commentor 11 - Andrea Issod, Sierra Club an estimated cost of $1.985 billion and ended up costing $3.5 billion total.53 The increased costs for Edwardsport have resulted in extensive litigation over financial responsiblity. Like Kemper and Edwardsport, FutureGen has unknown total project costs and unproven technology, and poses a significant risk of cost overruns. The DEIS does not consider this risk, evaluate the potential for cost overruns or who will be responsible for covering the potential increases. The DEIS also does not consider how this project will impact future electricity rates in Illinois.  This issue was the subject of much controversy in the public scoping comments.54  The state of Illinois has bound its utilities to purchase electricity from FutureGen 2.0 for 20 years, without any commitment regarding the rates that will be charged to customers.55  Local ratepayers are rightfully concerned that the state has locked them into higher energy fees.  DOE must consider the interests of Illinois ratepayers, who would ultimately have to bear the costs of implementing this new technology. The DOE should not be demonstrating new technology to the detriment of the local ratepayers. The DEIS is incomplete because it fails to address these concerns. f. The DOE Failed to Adequately Address Environmental Justice Ju ce Concerns and Socioeconomic Impacts of FutureGen 2.0.0 The DEIS ignores the socioeconomic impact of the high rates that local residents will be required to pay for energy from FutureGen 2.0. The DEIS should evaluate which ratepayers will be forced to pay for FutureGen, and how much their utility bills will increase as a result of paying for this demonstration project.  When utility bills rise, low and limited-income families can suffer health problems because they are not able to pay for heat or air conditioning.56 The DEIS should consider the potential for these impacts. 53 Indianapolis Star, “Duke Energy Customers Owe $2.5 Billion Plus for Edwardsport Plant,” 12/27/2012, available at http://www.indystar.com/article/20121227/BUSINESS/121227022/Duke-Energycustomers-owe-2-5-billion-plus-Edwardsport-plant 54 See DEIS, at p. 1-11. 55 Illinois Commerce Committee Press Release, “Illinois Regulator Approves Futuregen 2.0 Power Purchases,” available at http://www.bloomberg.com/article/2012-12-19/auxH8eXyQ6co.html 56 See Health Impact Project, “Case Study: Low Income Energy Assistance Program” available at http://www.healthimpactproject.org/hia/us/massachusetts-low-incomeenergy-assistance-program (“The assessment found that many families in Massachusetts were struggling to pay for rapidly rising energy bills, and that low-income families were being forced to make difficult and sometimes dangerous choices between heat, food and paying for medical care.”) 11-13  As explained in response to Comment 10-01, the Illinois Commerce  Commission approved a 20-year power purchase agreement for the  11-12 con’t  FutureGen 2.0 Project. The Illinois Commerce Commission’s Final Order implemented the power purchase agreement in a manner that did not preferentially burden any affected customer regardless  of location or electricity supplier. As part of the approval process,  the cost of the FutureGen 2.0 Project was independently evaluated  against a cost benchmark designed to protect Illinois ratepayers. The  costs were estimated to be less than the cost benchmark. Under the  power purchase agreement, Ameren and Commonwealth Edison  (an Exelon subsidiary) would enter into contracts with the Alliance to  purchase the electricity generated by the FutureGen 2.0 Project. The  average monthly bill impact for residential customers serviced by  either Ameren or Commonwealth Edison is estimated to be less than  $1.50 per month. Customers of rural electric cooperatives would see  no impact to their monthly electric bills.  11-13  15 Commentor 11 - Andrea Issod, Sierra Club The CO2 pipeline for FutureGen 2.0 will be constructed mainly under farmland.  The effects of the pipeline’s construction will be felt most heavily by those living in rural communities.  The residents of the farming communities impacted by the pipeline are concerned about the possible risks of having the pipeline under their homes, along with other negative environmental impacts on the surrounding area. Another concern mentioned in the scoping comments was the possibility that coal companies would buy up properties for construction and force the families living there out of their homes.  The DOE fails to address these effects in the DEIS.   Instead, it states that there is no significant environmental justice issue, citing findings that the population nearby the FutureGen 2.0 project is slightly more affluent and slightly more white than the national average.57  The DEIS, however, ignores the fact that the project is mostly built near members of rural farming communities.  The DEIS should have addressed these concerns put forth by local farmers. g. ng The DOE Failed to Consider Impacts Caused by Coal Mining Coal mining is only addressed in a cursory manner in the DEIS. The DOE must consider all connected actions including the full spectrum of impacts from mining coal.  No matter how clean the technology to burn the coal, there are still significant environmental and public health harms caused by digging it out of the earth in the first place.  The addition of the new boiler to the Meredosia Energy Center will, by definition, require that additional coal be mined.  The EIS should consider, among others, the following environmental impacts from coal mining: • Hydrogeologic impacts to surface and ground water resources; • Degradation and pollution to streams and wetlands; • Impacts to wildlife, biodiversity, and forests; • Impacts to prime farmland and other agricultural lands; • Impacts on surrounding communities, including local residences; • Impacts to cultural and historic resources; and • Impacts of coal transport (e.g. diesel train or truck emissions, coal dust dispersal from trucks or trains, etc.) 57 DEIS, at p. 3.19-4 – 3.19-5. 11-14  The potential impacts from the construction and operation of the CO2  pipeline are addressed in the Draft EIS under all resource categories  in Chapter 3 and particularly in Section 3.17.3.2 with respect to  human health and safety impacts in the unlikely event of a pipeline  leak. As described in response to Comment 2-08, the Alliance has  entered into an Agricultural Impact Mitigation Agreement with the  Illinois Department of Agriculture in consultation with the Illinois Farm  11-14  Bureau. The agreement is required by the Illinois Carbon Dioxide Transportation and Sequestration Act (220 ILCS 75/20(b)(6)) and it  applies specifically to the effects from construction and operation of  a CO2 pipeline. Under the agreement, the FutureGen 2.0 Project is  committed to implementing important mitigation measures to protect  farmland, including compensation for crop damages. As explained in  response to the following comment (Comment 11-15), no new coal  mines would be required to support the FutureGen 2.0 Project, and  no project decisions to be made by DOE would affect coal mining.  Potential future acquisitions of local properties by coal companies  are not anticipated but are beyond the scope of this EIS.  11-15  In Section 1.6.2 of the Draft EIS, DOE stated its position on subjects  considered to be beyond the scope of the EIS, which included the  environmental and safety impacts of coal mining. The Draft EIS  explains that no specific mine has been identified as a source of coal,  no new mines would be developed specifically to support the project,  no changes in mining techniques would be required to support the  11-15  project, and no decisions to be made by DOE for the project would affect coal mining techniques. Coal is a commercial fuel commodity  produced by a regulated industry, and the environmental impacts  of coal mining are well known, well described, and the industry is  accountable for them. As coal is an abundant global resource bought  and sold as an international commodity, the FutureGen 2.0 Project  would not change nationwide coal production and would not change  the impacts of coal mining.  While DOE maintains that the effects of coal mining is outside  the scope of this EIS, DOE described and analyzed the impacts  of transportation and conveyance of coal for the FutureGen 2.0  Project on respective resources in Chapter 3 of the Draft EIS. These  specifically included air emissions associated with truck traffic  and conveyance of coal and process materials in Section 3.1.3.2,  greenhouse gas emissions from truck transport in Section 3.2.3.2,  traffic impacts from coal delivery and waste removal in Section  3.13.3.2, and noise impacts from truck transport in Section 3.14.3.2.  16 Commentor 11 - Andrea Issod, Sierra Club Cumulative Impacts - The DEIS Does Not Recognize the Foreseeable Future Impact of Increas ngV.um he ing Construction of New Coal ntPlants and Carbon Sequestration Projects The purpose of this project, as outlined in the DEIS, is “to demonstrate the commercial feasibility of an advanced coal-based energy technology (oxycombustion) that can serve as a cost-effective approach to implementing carbon capture at new and existing coal-fueled energy facilities.”58  If the project is successful, a foreseeable future effect is that it will stimulate development of new carbon capture based coal plants around the nation. DOE admits that without this project, the development of oxy-combustion repowered plants integrated with CO2 capture and storage would happen more slowly, but it fails to address in the DEIS the cumulative environmental impacts that increased development would bring.59 An EIS must consider the cumulative impacts of the proposed federal agency action together with past, present and reasonably foreseeable future actions, including all federal and non-federal activities.60  It is entirely foreseeable that the success of this project would lead to construction and operation of new coal plants, more coal mining, more coal waste, and all the associated impacts of using more coal. The DEIS fails to address these additional cumulative environmental impacts.   The environmental impacts of encouraging new coal plant development would be substantial. Coal burning produces hundreds of millions of tons of solid waste products annually, including fly ash, bottom ash, and flue-gas desulfurization sludge. Coal particulate pollution increases asthma events and can shorten people’s lifespan. Mining the coal used in these plants has severe environmental effects such as eliminating existing vegetation, displacing or destroying wildlife and habitat, loss of natural aesthetics, degradation and depletion of natural water sources, producing greenhouse gas emissions, along with other deteriorating environmental effects. The overall impact that the continued use of coal as an energy source would have on the environment is quite considerable, and the DEIS’s failure to address this cumulative impact is a major flaw in the analysis. Furthermore, carbon capture sequestration technology is often used to for enhanced oil recovery. This process allows access to oil stores that would otherwise be inaccessible. By increasing the availability of oil and lowering the cost, carbon capture sequestration technology is helping to prolong the 58  Id. at p. S-3. 59  Id. at p. 2-2. 60  40 C.F.R. § 1508.7. 11-16 As stated under Climate and Greenhouse Gases in Table 4.3-3 of the Draft EIS, “the successful implementation of the project may lead to widespread acceptance and deployment of oxy-combustion technology with geologic storage of CO2, thus fostering a beneficial long-term reduction in the rate of CO2 emissions from power plants across the United States.” Also, as stated under Air Quality in Table 4.1-1, “…electricity generated by this project may displace electricity generated by traditional coal-fired power plants that emit significantly higher levels of pollutants.” DOE anticipates that, should carbon emissions be regulated from coal-fired power plants, the successful demonstration of oxy-combustion technology with CO2 capture and storage in the FutureGen 2.0 Project could provide a cost-effective basis for the power industry to retrofit existing, outdated and inefficient pulverized coal-fueled generating facilities. DOE believes that over time, significant net benefits may be achieved through reductions in pollutant emissions and greenhouse gases by displacement of traditional pulverized coal plants. Based on Energy Information Administration data and predictions, and without substantial legislative and regulatory changes, DOE 11-16 assumes that a substantial proportion of national electric generating capacity will continue to depend on coal, and the demand for electricity will increase irrespective of electricity conservation measures. However, if carbon regulation should come to pass, DOE anticipates that the availability of a technology that can be used to retrofit existing pulverized coal power plants causing a reduction in pollutant emissions and greenhouse gases would result in a net beneficial cumulative impact. Based on Energy Information Administration predictions, DOE assumes that coal-based electricity generation from existing and, to a lesser extent, new coal-fueled power plants will continue into the foreseeable future. Thus, impacts from coal utilization would otherwise occur irrespective of the proposed action for the FutureGen 2.0 Project, and DOE believes that, if carbon emissions were to be regulated, successful deployment of oxy-combustion technology would displace older, less efficient and uncontrolled existing power plants. Please note that the use of CO2 for enhanced oil recovery is not anticipated as part of the Future 2.0 project and was therefore not analyzed in the Draft EIS. 17 Commentor 11 - Andrea Issod, Sierra Club  use of oil as an energy source.

The comments made in this document are my own and are of my own opinion if not actually stated. The opinions are implied as being my own. These comments were made after scanning or reading all 1242 pages of the FutureGen 2.0 DOE/EIS‐0460D. FutureGen is a proposed Morgan County Illinois carbon dioxide sequestration demonstration project. The goal is the capture of carbon dioxide products from the coal fired generation of electricity converting the gas to a gas/liquid interface and then injecting it for underground storage. It is by definition a touchy feely program that is highly political. Ethics: This article from Penn State “Ethical Issues Entailed by Geologic Carbon Sequestration”1 written after the 2007 meeting in Rio de Janeiro raises ethical questions about the geologic storage of CO2. To quote the article, “A proper ethical analysis of geologic carbon storage must begin with a description of known environmental, economic, and social impacts and risks of geologic storage.” Even though this article was written in 2007, it also states that as technology progresses in this field, the ethical conclusions in the article may change. I feel that the Penn State article identifies the many ethic points, concerns, and issues which need to be addressed by FutureGen and NEPA when assessing the FutureGen project for the Final EIS. Not all of the ethic points in my opinion are included in the EIS‐0460D. I do feel that there are ethical points identified in the article have not been followed by FutureGen. Site Selection and Storage Risk Assessment Concerns: I found this from the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act funding of DOE projects: “Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois (Champaign, IL) – An Evaluation of the Carbon Sequestration Potential of the Cambro-Ordovician Strata of the Illinois and Michigan Basins. The University of Illinois will evaluate the carbon storage potential of the Cambro-Ordovician Strata of the Illinois and Michigan Basins which encompass most of the states of Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, and Michigan. A best practices manual for site characterization, to be developed during the project, will help reduce storage risk by documenting the uncertainties related to fracturing, injectivity, and geochemical interactions for these specific formations. DOE share: $4,803,000; Recipient share: $1,469,759; Duration: 36 months.” 2 This would seem to indicate there was no site selection criteria available for Carbon Capture and Storage at the time of the FutureGen 2.0 site selection competition in 2010 and that the competition of applicants by which the Morgan County site was not a valid selection method. I have felt all along that each applicant for FutureGen competition did not have proper geologic data from which to decide that their location would meet the specific site criteria. To me, even though FutureGen’s RFP included criteria, the criteria were not geologically valid to insure a DOE/EIS‐0460D Additional Comments Page 1 of 26 12-01 DOE has been at the forefront of scientific research into geologic storage of CO2 for many years. DOE prepared the Draft EIS for the FutureGen 2.0 Project to address the full range of impacts on the natural and human environment in conformance with the CEQ NEPA regulations (40 CFR Parts 1500 to 1508). 12-02 Selection of the proposed storage site for FutureGen 2.0 was solely the responsibility of the Alliance, based on efforts completed to date by DOE as well as partners in the Department’s Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnerships. DOE provided the Alliance minimum site suitability criteria that included elements related to adequate geologic data, suitability of the surface land, sufficiency for the accommodation of a CO2 pipeline, as well as factors related to the regional communities. The Alliance included these criteria, among many others, in their open site competition leading up to site selection. The final site selection was the result of thorough evaluation of site offeror’s proposals against the published site selection criteria, augmented with additional data acquired by the 12-01 Alliance after initial site proposal screening and down-select to four very promising sites. Much of the site selection process, including the site selection criteria, is publically available on the FutureGen Industrial Alliance’s website (www.futuregenalliance.org). 12-02 Commentor 12 - Elizabeth (Betty) Niemann successful project. Specific research resources for the FutureGen application limited to those on the FutureGen website and other pertinent resource information sources were banned to the applicants because of “conflict of interest”.3 To me, Site selection was made by the “money” criteria.4 The December 2005 map prepared by the Midwest Geologic Sequestration Consortium entitled “CO2 Storage Potential for the Mt. Simon and St. Peter Sandstones in the Illinois Basin” indicates areas of idea locations of CO2 storage. (Note: This map is no longer available on line.) County lines are also on the map and Morgan County is NOT one of the ideal areas for CO2 storage. I believe the green spot indicates 10‐25 million tons of C02 potential. Trying to scale this MGSC map to Beacon Schneider puts the FutureGen 2.0 Project is within 5 miles of this green dot in Section 15 N 9 West. (I attempted to scale green dot location and have it 7.44 miles south of the Morgan County northern county line and 5 miles west of the Morgan County eastern county line in sections 2,3,10, and 11 of township 15 N and range 9 West in Morgan County. Note: I am awaiting actual location from Sally Greensburg of the ISGS/MGSC.) Given that this map was printed in 2005, it seems that Morgan County area has a potential BUT only for 10 to 25 million tons of CO2 such that the initial 30 year project forecast exceeded the capacity of the storage area. A FutureGen 2.0 20 DOE/EIS‐0460D Additional Comments Page 2 of 26 12-03  The 2005 Midwest Geological Sequestration Consortium map  illustrates a regional conceptual model of the geology in the Illinois  Basin based on geographic information system (GIS) data for the  12-02  oil field boundaries and target formation characteristics. The map  con’t  was intended for predictive purposes to aid in regional planning  and not as a detailed characterization of the local geology or as a  basis for eliminating potential geologic storage locations. The Mt.  Simon formation is a well-described, deep saline formation that has  been studied extensively for CO2 storage, and the site selection  process is designed to ensure that geologic storage is conducted  safely and effectively (NETL 2013c; USEPA 2013a). The effective  CO2 storage capacity for the Morgan County geologic study area is  based on the site-specific characteristics of the injection zone and  anticipated injection characteristics during operation. Site-specific  data was collected through the Alliance’s geologic characterization  efforts, including the completion of a stratigraphic well in the CO2  storage study area. This data was used to characterize the injection  zone and support site-specific modeling of the CO2 plume, which  was presented to the USEPA in the UIC permit applications.  12-03  Commentor 12 - Elizabeth (Betty) Niemann year project with an injection of 22 metric tons may exceed the storage capacity as well so the storage site should be characterized extensively. This also seems to imply that there is carbon storage risk to FutureGen 2.0 project. Supposedly when there is “NO” risk so WHY is there a need for risk assessment? There is no real project risk assessment in the EIS‐0460D that I could find. A cost analysis, risk assessment, and remediation plan should be the first things performed on a CCS project before any money, land acquisition, and permitting is started, in my opinion. (There is more discussion below.) Given the construction of the Draft Environmental Impact Statement EIS‐460D with its many sections, it is hard to obtain a true overall risk analysis of the FutureGen 2.0 project. Can environmental impact be equated with risk analysis? I think not. The summary of impact conclusions in each section is like looking at a jig saw puzzle with each section’s conclusions a piece. Until the entire puzzle it put together, entire impact picture is not clear but this is not a risk analysis of the entire project itself. Price and Oldenburg in their article “The consequences of failure should be considered in siting geologic carbon sequestration projects”5. The article contains charts from which to compare risks and costs and from these charts one can determine based upon risks and costs if the project should be rejected. I feel that at this point in time, since costs have not yet been determined, and risks are not identified, the FutureGen 2.0 project should be rejected. Concerns over the FutureGen Alliance itself: First, my husband and I believe the Alliance was formed by venture capitalists who saw a chance to get federal funding in the name of climate change and then in the name of job creation under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Second, the financial loss FutureGen took in Coles County. FutureGen had purchased 440 acres of land needed for the Mattoon project for about 3.5 million dollars. Since Coles Together pulled out of the CCS aspect of the project when the DOE pulled the funding for the power plant aspect, FutureGen was left holding the land. Rather than using the land as collateral on a loan, FutureGen sold the land for $700,000 or about 20 cents on the dollar taking a loss of 2.8 million dollars.6 What kind of company would take this kind of loss when it is so desperate for money for its project in Morgan County, Illinois? Third, the Alliance allowed its Certificate in Good Standing with the State of Illinois (under the Secretary of State) to be revoked on 13 July 2012. According to the Secretary of State of Illinois, when the status of a corporation is revoked, it is revoked for the following reason: REVOCATION: Failure to file an Annual Report and pay the annual franchise tax, and failure to file any other report or document required by statute will result in the revocation of the Authority to Transact Business in Illinois. This revocation may have severe consequences, including loss of the registration of the corporate DOE/EIS‐0460D Additional Comments Page 3 of 26 12-04  As explained in response to Comment 12-01, DOE prepared the  Draft EIS for the FutureGen 2.0 Project to address the full range of  12-03 con’t  impacts on the natural and human environment in conformance with the guidelines for content and format contained in the CEQ NEPA regulations (40 CFR Parts 1500 to 1508). Concerns about project  risks to the public are best reflected in the analysis of impacts to  public health and safety in Section 3.17, Health and Human Safety,  of the document. The Draft EIS cannot and does not claim that there  are “no risks” from geologic CO2 storage. As in the case of any risk  assessment, the EIS can only identify potential risks, estimate their  12-04  probabilities based on historical data, and evaluate the potential consequences of risks for the purpose of supporting decisions, which  DOE maintains that the Draft EIS for the FutureGen 2.0 Project has  done. The USEPA ultimately holds the regulatory authority to issue  UIC Class VI permits for the proposed CO2 injection wells and will  base its permitting decision on the adequacy of information about  the potential risks and consequences of the project.  12-05  In response to comments submitted during the scoping phase of the  EIS, DOE explained its position on a life-cycle cost analysis in Section  1.6.2 of the Draft EIS as follows: “Among the purposes for DOE’s  involvement in the FutureGen 2.0 Project are the demonstration of  the technologies involved, the identification of potential efficiencies,  and the development of a reference base for the costs associated with  an oxy-combustion facility integrated with CO2 capture and storage.  Thus, the life-cycle cost of the project relative to other technologies  is not currently known with certainty, but it is not relevant in DOE’s  decision-making process for the proposed action.”  In terms of cost-benefit analysis as part of the NEPA process, the  CEQ NEPA regulations state: “For purposes of complying with  the Act, the weighing of the merits and drawbacks of the various  12-05  alternatives need not be displayed in a monetary cost-benefit analysis and should not be when there are important qualitative  considerations.” DOE has not completed a cost-benefit analysis for  the FutureGen 2.0 Project because of the uncertainties involved  in estimating the potential costs and benefits on a demonstration  project for which a key purpose is to establish the reference base for  those costs and benefits.  With respect to the Government Accountability Office (GAO)  report cited in Comment 12-6 of this appendix and presumably the  GAO report referenced here, the GAO findings are not relevant to  FutureGen 2.0. The cited study was conducted in the context of the  original FutureGen Project.  Commentor 12 - Elizabeth (Betty) Niemann name with the Secretary of State, loss of the right to maintain lawsuits in Illinois, imposition of liens on corporate property, and possible personal liability of directors and officers.7 FutureGen’s status with the State of Illinois was changed on 5 March 2013 to active. How many legal or transactions documents may have been impacted by the revocation from 13 July 2013 to 5 March 2013? For confirmation of the revocation information, a telephone credit card order may be placed by phoning the Illinois Secretary Of State Business/Not‐for‐Profit Corporations Division (217) 782‐4104 or may write to: Business/Not‐for‐Profit Corporations Corporations Division 501 S.

Slowly since 2006 the Alliance has gone from 13 members to now just 5 members. Exelon stated in a letter to Richard Durbin on 18 February 20138 that the reason it pulled out from the alliance was for several reasons: a. There were supposed to be 20 alliance members at an expenditure of 30 million dollars apiece to fund the project with a total of cost of the FutureGen project to be 1.6 billion dollars and that cost to consumers were in line with the anticipated market. b. The original structure in 1. (above) was scrapped with few corporate contributions to customers funding 150 million dollars annually above anticipated markets for a 30 project year payout of 4.5 billion. (Author’s note: this makes the total funding for the project 5.5 billion dollars adding in the DOE’s almost a billion. The Illinois Commerce Commission has only approved the Power Sourcing Agreement for 20 years, so if the life of the project is reduced to 20 years, the cost to consumers is then 3 billion plus the 1 billion for a total of 4 billion dollars.) Fifth: No “one” alliance member is actively participating in this project other than by investment or as members of the Alliance Board of Directors…. Sixth: FutureGen is an on/off on again type of project beginning in 2003. The project was pulled under President Bush’s administration for cost overruns. This decision to pull the funding for the FutureGen’s IGCC Mattoon project, I believe, has been vindicated by what has happened with a similar project of Duke Energy’s Edwardsport, Indiana, CCS IGCC project. Initially Duke’s project costs were estimated to be 1.985 billion dollars rose to over 3.5 billion which Duke DOE/EIS‐0460D Additional Comments Page 4 of 26 Conversely, the Congressional Research Service (CRS) report cited in Comment 12-6 of this appendix and presumably the CRS report referenced here does have direct relevance to the FutureGen 2.0 project. The CRS report provides a chronicle of the history of the FutureGen Program from its beginning through February 2013. While focusing on the current status of the FutureGen 2.0 project, the CRS report presents the project in the broader context of challenges related to cost shared demonstrations of carbon capture and sequestration technologies. The issues related to project cost growth and other risks both within and outside the control of either DOE or the Alliance are commonplace for first-of-a-kind projects regardless of the industry, developer, or funding source. DOE acknowledges these issues as significant risks to FutureGen 2.0 but also sees meaningful public benefits upon completion of the project. 12-05 con’t Commentor 12 - Elizabeth (Betty) Niemann Energy’s customers will have to pay all but 900 million which Duke itself will have to pay. 9 Now with the projected costs to Illinois consumers of 4 to 5.5 billion dollars, just how much more will consumers have pay? Seventh: Speaking of the money for FutureGen, one government agency and one independent research agency have both studied FutureGen and its costs. The Government Accounting Office (GAO) has made this conclusion on FutureGen, “Before implementing significant changes to FutureGen or before obligating additional funds for such purposes, the Secretary of Energy should direct DOE staff to prepare a comprehensive analysis that compares the relative costs, benefits, and risks of a range of options that includes (1) the original FutureGen program, (2) incremental changes to the original program, and (3) the restructured FutureGen program. “10 The Congressional Research Service has made the following conclusion “Nearly ten years and two restructuring efforts since FutureGen’s inception, the project is still in its early development stages. Although the Alliance completed drilling a characterization well at the storage site in Morgan County, IL, and installed a service rig over the well for further geologic analysis, issues with the power plant itself have not yet been resolved. Among the remaining challenges are securing private sector funding to meet increasing costs, purchasing the Meredosia power plant from Ameren, obtaining permission from the DOE to retrofit the plant, performing the retrofit, and then meeting the goal of 90% capture of CO2.” 11 Both of these reports are critical of the costs associated with the FutureGen project. Eighth: Timothy Carney, senior political columnist for the Washington Examiner had written an article about FutureGen being the “costliest” earmark in Washington.12 What will be the cost overruns for FutureGen? Remember, the projection is at already from 4 to 5.5 billion. Ninth: My research for public comments for this EIS‐0460D have also uncovered some discrepancies what FutureGen is saying about the project especially with respect to: a.

The information and analyses in the Final EIS have been updated based on the following data:  a. Based on site-specific data from the stratigraphic well and  modeling conducted for the UIC permit applications to the USEPA,  the underground CO2 plume after 20 years would encompass approximately 4,000 acres. The total acreage of contiguous  properties at the land surface above the subsurface CO2 storage area would be 6,800 acres as described in Chapter 2 of the Final  EIS, specifically Section 2.5.2. See also response to Comment 15 02 on this same topic.  12-06  b. The Alliance’s proposed CO2 injection well configuration would consist of a single site encompassing approximately 14 acres  occupied by surface facilities for four horizontally drilled injection  wells, plus monitoring wells and access roads. The site location and  configuration are described in Chapter 2 of the Final EIS, specifically  Sections 2.5.2.1 and 2.5.2.2.  c. The alignment of the Alliance’s proposed southern route for the  CO2 pipeline has been refined and updated to include the route to the Alliance’s proposed site for the CO2 injection wells as described in Chapter 2 of the Final EIS.  d. The Alliance’s proposed site for the CO2 injection wells is described  in Chapter 2 of the Final EIS, specifically in Sections 2.5.2.1 and  2.5.2.2.  e.  The “rules” (or regulatory requirements) applicable to the  FutureGen 2.0 Project remain unchanged. However, the information  available for the project has been updated as necessary to reflect  refinements in the project design. The Draft EIS acknowledged the  12-07  evolving nature of the project design in a text box on page 2-2. The  bounding parameters for critical features were established to enable  a conservative analysis of potential impacts in the Draft EIS.  f. Issues pertaining to state funding are not relevant to the DOE  decisions to be supported by the Final EIS.  g. The project impacts were evaluated based on a 20-year project  duration as described consistently throughout the Draft EIS. That  duration stands.  DOE/EIS‐0460D Additional Comments Page 5 of 26 Commentor 12 - Elizabeth (Betty) Niemann In 2010, Jacksonville, Tuscola, City of Vandalia, and Christian County vied for the new location of the FutureGen project after Coles Together pulled out of the Mattoon project when the DOE pulled the funding for the Mattoon IGCC CCS Project. In this competition the Request for Site Proposal Dated 25 October 2010 and amended on 11 November 2010 by FutureGen indicated initially 1000 acres. A letter, dated 10 March 2011, from the Farm Manager in the Trust Department of the bank who is the trustee committed 400 acres of Family Farm Trust Property [plus another 200 acres also held in the same trust (2nd beneficiary) for a total of 600 of 1000 acres} states 2500 acres will be needed for carbon storage. It was noted at the time that a 1000 acre commitment was needed at the time to make the project a “go”. This EIS0460D indicates a CO2 Storage Study Area of 5300 acres. In April of this year, Ken Humphries gave a presentation at West Virginia University that indicated a Carbon Storage Area of 8000 acres. I am quite certain that the farmers in this carbon storage area and Morgan County citizens are not aware of this increase in the number of acres in the storage area. (Note; to me this is a violation of one of the ethic points discussed under Ethics above) My question is what is the correct number of acres in the carbon storage area? b.

Ken Humphrey’s 18 April 2013 Presentation at West Virginia University and EIS‐460D May 2013 page G‐36 both indicate 4 individual injection wells from the same injection pad and that there will be horizontal injection. I am not certain that landowners are aware of this. c.

It is assumed it is at the end of the pipeline indicated on the property maps in this docket. The landowner of this specific property knew nothing about the well(s) location as of 30 May 2013. FutureGen filed for the UIC permit from the USEPA Region 5. There is no specific data posted on the website: http://www.epa.gov/region5/water/uic/futuregen/ and the map show on the website show a red dot at the end of Martin Road. Using Beacon Schneider for Morgan County, Illinois, the Martins’ home (2808 Beilschmidt Road) is at the end of Martin Road so the map on the USEPA Region 5 website has the injection well head right on the homestead. e. When the FutureGen project selected the Morgan County location, FutureGen indicated that they would not change the rules as they go along, but as you can see from my comments above, it appears to me that they have abandoned that train of thought and are changing the rules as FutureGen moves along on the project. The comment is made in the EIS‐0460D that this is an evolving project. f. Initially FutureGen said it would not be requesting funds from the State of Illinois, (Liability FAQ http://www.futuregenalliance.org/wpcontent/uploads/2013/03/FutureGen‐FAQ‐Liability‐Protection‐060811.pdf Last Answer) but received an Energy grant (12‐481006) of $850,000 under the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity’s (DCEO) Coal Competitiveness Program which started on 1 June 2012 and goes to 13 May 2014 according to the IL DCEO Grant Tracker http://granttracker.ildceo.net/ProgramMaps.aspx?GrantNumber=12481006&Comp anyLocationId=13868 . g.

Decommissioning (EIS‐0460D Section 2.5.4 page 2‐73) states, “The Alliance would conduct post‐injection monitoring activities in accordance with the Post‐Injection Site Care and Site Closure Plan approved by the UIC Program Director as discussed above under Injection Well Operations.” The “Post‐Injection Site Care and Site Closure Plan” is DOE/EIS‐0460D Additional Comments Page 7 of 26 12-08 A Post-Injection Site Care and Site Closure Plan is a requirement of the UIC Class VI permit for injection wells and is included in the permit applications. In accordance with the permit, the Alliance would be responsible for post-injection site care and monitoring and would be responsible for any emergency or remedial actions that would be necessary. The Alliance submitted supporting documentation for the UIC permit applications to USEPA in March 2013 (updated May 2013). Section 9.0 (Financial Responsibility) of that documentation describes the Alliance’s proposed CO2 Storage Trust Fund and third party insurance policy. The documentation is posted for public access at the USEPA UIC website: http://www.epa.gov/r5water/uic/ futuregen/index.htm Therefore, the documentation has not been included in this Final EIS. The response to Comment 11-11 also addresses this subject. 12-07 con’t 12-08 Commentor 12 - Elizabeth (Betty) Niemann not discussed anywhere else in the EIS‐0460D. So just what is in this plan and does it include the site specific remediation plan and who is responsible for performing and paying for the remediation? (Please see remediation discussion below.) Since there are long term risks of leakage in the carbon storage area, who is responsible for the monitoring for leaks after the site is closed and if leakage occurs, who performs the remediation and WHO PAYS for the remediation? Tenth: FutureGen tried to circumvent governmental authorizations with the Illinois Power Agency and Illinois Commerce Commission with regard to Prevention of Significant Deterioration Permit (From page 12: PSD request for variance on PSD (Air) Permit to IPA). (http://www.icc.illinois.gov/docket/files.aspx?no=11‐0660&docId=172128 on 3 October 2011) “Finally. the FutureGen Alliance would recommend that the ICC modify the general specification for PSD (Air) Permit to the following: "Demonstrate that a PSD (Air) Permit, if required, has either been issued, or an application has been filed with the Illinois EPA" The FutureGen Alliance believes this change is appropriate because it is possible that a clean coal project may not be required to obtain a PSD permit given the near‐zero level S02, N02, and CO emissions generated by such a project.” Can the Alliance/FutureGen be trusted to follow all the permitting requirements in the EIS‐0460D when it already tried to circumvent the PSD Permit with the Bureau of the State of Illinois? On page 5‐8 of Volume I of the EIS‐0460D is a discussion of the Prevention of Significant Deterioration and the conclusion is “Due to the size of the project, it is not anticipated that a PSD permit would be required (Ameren 2012).” Also see Appendix 4 for another example of FutureGen’s strategy. Eleventh: What INDUSTRY certifications does FutureGen hold that will give some credence to FutureGen’s ability to carry this project through besides the State of Illinois Certificate of Good Standing? Concerns In the Name of Climate Change: Fact: CO2 takes up 0.035% of the gases that compose the Earth’s atmosphere.14 Saadallah Al Fathi, former head of Energy Studies at the Opec Secretariat in Vienna, states in a special for the Gulf News that the first problem in CCS is that it will increase coal use in a coal fired power station just to compensate for the loss of energy due to the carbon capture process. He cites a 25‐40 per cent energy penalty. Second, he cites that safe and permanent storage of CO2 cannot be guaranteed and even the “modest incident may undermine its use to mitigate climate change”. He goes on to say that 2.5 GT (gigatons) must be stored by 2035 … and “CCS is a long way away before it can be relied upon for climate change or abatement. 15 (Author’s Note: By the way this amounts to 875 gigagallons of supercritical CO2.) DOE/EIS‐0460D Additional Comments Page 8 of 26 12-09  The responses to Comments USEPA-03 and USEPA-04 address  the subject of a PSD increment analysis. The FutureGen 2.0 Project  must comply fully with the requirements of the Clean Air Act as  implemented by the IEPA. The Alliance has been in consultations  12-08  with IEPA, which has concurred with the Alliance’s air construction  con’t  permitting approach. The FutureGen 2.0 Project would not operate  without all relevant Clean Air Act permits.  12-10  The issue expressed in this comment is beyond the scope of the  EIS for the FutureGen 2.0 Project. However, the Alliance holds all of  the certifications it needs to operate as a non-profit corporation and  to operate within the state of Illinois. The Alliance’s partners include  the Babcock & Wilcox Company, a U.S.-based power engineering  and equipment supply company that provides design, engineering,  manufacturing, construction and operations services to nuclear,  renewable, fossil power, industrial and government customers  12-09  worldwide; and Air Liquide, the world’s largest build, own, operate and maintain contract provider of industrial gases for manufacturing,  health, power systems, and the environment. Utilizing these  organizations and others, the Alliance would hire well-qualified  engineering, procurement, and construction companies to construct  the FutureGen 2.0 Project. Similar to other power plant development  projects, the FutureGen 2.0 Project would be owned by the Alliance  and operated, maintained, and managed by proven professionals in  the field.  12-11  As with any power plant, a certain amount of energy is consumed  12-10  by auxiliary equipment that is needed to operate the plant. The equipment and energy demand is dependent on a number of factors  including the plant design and technologies being implemented,  but often include pumps, fans, electric motors, pollution control  equipment, and in the case of FutureGen 2.0, equipment related to  air separation and CO2 capture and compression. Energy efficiency  and losses of FutureGen 2.0 are reflected in the EIS in Table 2-3, and  estimated coal consumption is presented in Table 2-4. The auxiliary  12-11  energy requirements would need to be provided through some  means, either through internal generation or supplied to the plant  from the power grid. If auxiliary power needs were to be satisfied by  coal-based electricity generation, then associated coal use would  increase accordingly.  DOE does not anticipate leakage of CO2 from the pipeline, injection  wells, or geological storage. The response to Comment 2-12  addresses concerns about potential leakage from the CO2 storage  reservoir by various pathways.  Commentor 12 - Elizabeth (Betty) Niemann Along these same lines, on March 23, 2013 organizers created “Earth Hour” in the EU to “demonstrate one’s desire to “do something” about global warming by turning off lights for one hour and reduce emissions. However, the United Kingdom’s National Grid Operators found “that a small decline in electrical consumption does not translate to less energy being pumped into the grid and therefore not reduce emissions.” The article went on to say that in reality, there would be an increase in emissions as people switched to candles and that “using two candles means you emit more CO2.” The article went on to say that “because of rising energy prices from green subsidies” many households in Germany and the poor in the United Kingdom will become “fuel‐poor” and not be able to afford electricity. 16 The Houston Chronicle in its Earthweek article entitled “Greenhouse Quandary” on 16 June 2013 page A20, stated that according to the International Energy Agency the level of greenhouse gas (carbon dioxide ‐ CO2) fell in the United States and Europe and that China’s emissions were responsible for a 1.4 percent rise in emissions. That same article reported the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions that methane is 105 times more potent than CO2 as a greenhouse gas which is leaking into the atmosphere from efforts to extract natural gas. The leakage the report alludes to is from compressor stations and at well sites. IF there is leakage of methane or natural gas from well heads and compressor stations, what assurances do the citizens of Morgan County that CO2 will not leak from the well head, monitoring wells, or compressor stations along the pipeline? Instead of concentrating on the greenhouse gas of CO2, why is there also not a concerted effort to stem the release of methane into the atmosphere? If methane is 105 times more potent, then FutureGen is wasting federal, state, and taxpayer money, electric rate payer money, and potentially harming Illinois breadbasket farm land all in the name of climate change mitigation for little potent gas of CO2 that only takes up 0.0035% of the atmosphere. By the way, NOAA debunked the 400 ppm CO2 May reading at the Mauna Loa Station.17 Concerns on FutureGen’s Contribution to Climate Change/Draft EIS Findings: In my opinion, capturing the CO2 during power generation by the production of supercritical CO2 is not “zero emission”. The supercritical CO2 must be dealt with and FutureGen intends to store it in the Mt. Simon layer below Illinois prime farmland thereby it is removed from the power plant and discharged to the land. Hence, this is not “zero emission”. If the CO2 were to be recycled through the plant with the oxygen being removed from the carbon, and then the carbon re‐burned in the removed oxygen, this would meet the definition of “near zero emission”. DOE/EIS‐0460D Additional Comments Page 9 of 26 FutureGen 2.0 touts that this will be a “near zero emission” power plant. The definition of emission is “something given out” and a thesaurus states the following as alternatives of emission: release, production, discharge, emanation, giving out, and giving off. The issue pertaining to the release of methane gas to the atmosphere  resulting from natural gas extraction is not related to the FutureGen  2.0 Project and is outside the scope of this EIS as defined by the  purpose and need in Chapter 1 of the Draft EIS. The response to  Comment 2-06 and Section 3.2, Climate and Greenhouse Gases,  in the Draft EIS address the contribution of CO2 to global climate  change.  12-12  In the context of this EIS, as based on an objective stated in the  President’s FutureGen Initiative, the term “near-zero emission”  relates solely to pollutant emissions being released to the  atmosphere.  In regard to the comment about the FutureGen 2.0 Project’s  contribution to climate change, as discussed on page 3.2-14 of the  12-11  Draft EIS, “Current scientific methods do not enable an evaluation of  con’t  the relationship of reductions or increases in GHG emissions from a  specific source to a particular change in either local or global climate.  Therefore, the potential contribution or removal of anthropogenic  GHGs attributable to this project, and its impact on global climate  change, is discussed within the context of cumulative impacts.  Section 4.3, Potential Cumulative Impacts, presents a discussion  of the potential cumulative impacts related to GHG emissions in  this context.” The response to Comment 2-06 addresses the same  subject.  12-12  Commentor 12 - Elizabeth (Betty) Niemann Putting aside all the political reasons for FutureGen, the primary reason for the FutureGen 2.0 project was/is to demonstrate a way to mitigate, in the name of climate change, the amount of CO2 released to the atmosphere during the burning of coal for electric power generation or in other words, reduce the amount of CO2 released to the atmosphere. The unit of “parts per million” is used when talking about CO2 in the atmosphere. When talking about carbon sequestration “metric tons” are used. For a true impact of FutureGen’s CO2 mitigation from the atmosphere, the number of metric tons of CO2 sequestered into the ground has to be converted to parts per million. I calculated what the parts per million would be for 1 metric ton of CO2 sequestered. This calculates out to be 0.00047 parts per million removed from the atmosphere per one (1) million metric tons per year. Therefore, the annual impact of CO2 mitigation by FutureGen 2.0 for 1.1 metric tons is 0.0005 parts per million to the air environment. (Appendix 1) This amount is so small that the impact is so negligible that it is almost nonexistent. The draft EIS even states there will be no appreciable reduction in global CO2 if this project goes forward. 18 Now, look at the 0.0005 parts per million as it pertains to 1.1 metric tons of supercritical CO2. FutureGen 2.0 reports that 1.1 million metric tons of CO2 will be captured, injected into, and stored in the Mt. Simon layer of Northeastern Morgan County per year. To understand the quantity of CO2 better, I calculated the number of gallons per metric ton of CO2 using Praxair’s MSDS for liquefied CO219 from the Edwardsport IGCC CCS project. My calculations resulted in approximately 350 gallons of supercritical CO2 per metric ton. Scott MacDonald, Archer Daniel Midland’s sequestration project manager, confirmed my calculation in March 2012. Possible Geologic Impact of 385 million gallons of supercritical CO2 per year: As I said at the public hearing, the 1.1 million metric tons of CO2 sequestered in Morgan County will approximately be 385,000,000 (385 million) gallons per year injected under Morgan County’s prime farmland. This, I do believe, will have a major impact to the land environment. I would like to add that the Gulf Oil spill that happened in April of 2011 was an estimated spill of only 210 million gallons of oil. In one year, FutureGen is to inject 1.83 times as much supercritical CO2 into the Mt. Simon layer under Morgan County. The EIS 460D document makes the following statements: “Other planned monitoring may include 10 to 15 permanent surface monitoring stations for measuring injection related ground surface deformation by interferometric sysnthetic aperature radar, gravity surveys, tilt meters, and differential positioning systems…Surface changes for CO2 storage would be measured in millimeters and, if present, would not be visible to the human eye.” 20 In other words, FutureGen 2.0 will be using InSAR21 22 23‐ interferometric sysnthetic aperature radar as part of its MVA. There is no discussion of the impact this might have on tile and drainage systems or what happens if there is a development of sink holes/subsidence. There is also no discussion on the mitigation compensation of such changes of surface deformation to individual landowners during the life of the project or after the project ends. DOE/EIS‐0460D Additional Comments Page 10 of 26 12-13 Please see the responses to Comments 2-07, 2-09, 2-11, and 2-12, which address the same subjects. The use of satellite technology to measure surface displacement would have no impact to drainage or the land surface. Sinkholes would be very unlikely in Morgan County, because the shallowest bedrock is shale and sandstone, not shallow limestone, which is one of the primary indicators for sinkhole formation. As stated in the response to Comment 2-12, the dissolved CO2 and brine phase would be denser than the native formation brine, so would sink within the injection zone. The discussion of the displacement of the formation brine as a result of injection is located in Section 3.4.3.2 in the Draft EIS, under the subheading 12-12 “CO2 Migration.” con’t 12-13 Commentor 12 - Elizabeth (Betty) Niemann There have been studies in the geology of the CO2 Storage Area and these are NOT discussed in great detail in the Geology section of the EIS 460D document. The findings of these studies may have an impact on the CO2 storage area which may or may not be transferred through the layers to the surface. To reiterate my oral comments, Faye Liu’s et al research on Coupled Reactive Flow and Transport Modeling of CO2 Sequestration in the Mt. Simon sandstone formation, Midwest U.S.A. (2011) 24which discusses long term risk assessment of the acidic plume: a. Acid plume forms from the interaction between brine and the supercritical CO2 (CO2 dissolution) in the storage layer and could persist for a long time even after the complete dissolution of CO2. Replenishment of the upstream ground water flow (brine movement) through the storage sandstone facilitates the spread of the CO2 plume and promotes and replenishes the geomechanical reactions. b. “The acidic brine will continuously migrate and react with minerals in the storage formation, dissolving and precipitating minerals and altering porosity and permeability.”25 c. “Our simulations indicate the prolonged existence of an acidic brine plume, which suggests long term risk assessment should transfer from the primary risk of (buoyant) CO2 leakage to secondary risk of acidic plume leakage after all the CO2 is dissolved.”26 d. “The biggest risk associated with this acid plume is the long term effects on geological features (primarily caprocks) and abandon wells…”27 “Leakage of the acidic brine through damaged caprocks, and/or corroded rock‐cement and casing cement interfaces, pre‐existing or abandoned wells, can cause contamination of the adjacent drinking water aquifers and potential releases at land surface.”28 This last concern is also stressed by Dr. Sally Benson (see remediation below) in that the acid plume as it migrates upwards into a potable aquifer may cause the release of heavy metals into the drinking water thereby contaminating the drinking water. The pressures that the supercritical CO2 must be pumped into subsurface reservoirs are substantial and the added fluid must displace ambient fluid as the (CO2) propagates throughout the reservoir. 29 One such study is the study concerning the reactivity of the Eau Claire and Mt. Simon interface. For instance “CO2–brine–caprock reaction would lead to modification of the pore geometry and effective permeability” and “Recent hydrological modeling of pressure build‐up and cap rock permeability indicates that, moderate brine migration through the caprock can be beneficial in terms of relief of pressure build‐up in the reservoir and geomechanical stresses to the sealing caprock (Zhou et al., 2008; Benson and Chabora, 2009; Zhou and Birkholzer, 2011). However, the geochemical consequences of the brine migration through cap rock have not been explored.” 30 This could mean that the CO2 can leach upwards through the cap rock and over time to the surface. In my opinion, there is not just enough information known with the Eau Claire/Mt. Simon interface in the Illinois Basin to provide a true picture for safe storage of CO2. Another study on CO2 storage which finds there are considerable uncertainties in modeling of the CO2 over time. 31 This is discussed by Mike Bickle and Niko Kampman. 32 DOE/EIS‐0460D Additional Comments Page 11 of 26 12-14 Please see the responses to Comments 2-09, 2-11 and 2-12, which address the same subjects. The Eau Claire Formation has been identified as an excellent primary seal for CO2 sequestration because of its thickness (over 400 feet), lateral continuity, low permeability and porosity (Griffith et al. 2011; O’Connor and Rush 2005), and low potential for reactivity with the CO2 plume at the injection site’s pressures and temperatures (Liu et al. 2012). There is also a secondary confining zone (Franconia Dolomite) between the Eau Claire and the lowest underground source for drinking water (USDW), which provides an additional impermeable layer at the CO2 injection site. 12-13 con’t 12-14 Commentor 12 - Elizabeth (Betty) Niemann In addition, the Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory has performed studies on CO2 storage areas even to the extent that it may be necessary to drill wells to remove brine in saline aquifers to keep the CO2 plume within the storage area. 33 If this happens, then where does the brine go, how it is treated as it cannot be used for drinking and agriculture? In the EIS‐0460D, there was little discussion of the CO2 storage area when it came to calculating the capacity of the storage area.

Morgan County residents were first told that 1000 acres would be needed so when landowners first committed to the storage area by signing options, they were under the impression that the storage area was to be 1000 acres. A letter, dated 10 March 2011, from the Trustee who committed 400 acres of one Family Farm Trust Property plus another 200 acres also held in the same trust document to a 2nd beneficiary for a total of 600 of 1000 acres states 2500 acres will be needed for carbon storage. Reading the EIS 460D, the storage area has not yet be identified and yet the EIS 460D discusses a 5300 acre study area for the storage area. FutureGen, when the announcing the geological results, did nothing to dispel the 1000 acre for the storage acre size. Hence, there are probably people who still think of the storage area as 1000 acres until they read the draft EIS 460D. In April of this year, Ken Humphries gave a presentation at West Virginia University that indicated a Carbon Storage Area of 8000 acres. I am quite certain that the farmers in this carbon storage area and Morgan County citizens are not aware of this increase in the number of acres in the storage area. My question is what is the correct number of acres in the carbon storage area? It is very important that the storage area be correctly assessed as to size and storage capacity.34 35With the Mt, Simon sandstone layer not as deep in Morgan County as it was in Coles DOE/EIS‐0460D Additional Comments Page 12 of 26 12-15  There are no plans to extract brine from the Mt. Simon Formation  as part of the injection operating procedures and no expectation of  any need to do so. Brine extraction is a way to prevent excessive  pressurization as a result of injection; see Section 3.4.3.2, under  12-15  subheading “Induced Seismicity,” in the Draft EIS for a discussion of pressure propagation as a result of injection. The study performed  by the Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory on a full-scale,  industrial-sized deployment in the Illinois Basin  was  based  on  modeling an annual injection rate of 5.5 million tons (5 million metric  tons) CO2 per year at 20 injection sites for 50 years. In comparison, the FutureGen 2.0 Project would inject up to 1.2 million (1.1 million  metric tons) per year over 20 years, for a total of 24 million tons  (22 million metric tons). Section 4.3.4.3 of the Draft EIS presents an  analysis of the other carbon sequestration projects that are planned  or operating in the Illinois Basin and the low potential for cumulative  impacts. The geologic conditions outlined in Section 3.4.2.1 were  used by Zhou et al. (2010) to determine that the Illinois Basin offers  favorable conditions for large-scale carbon sequestration when the  researchers analyzed the results of the large-scale, industrial-sized  deployment in the Illinois Basin model.  12-16  Since completing the Draft EIS, additional data has been developed  related to the actual subsurface conditions at the Morgan County  storage site and the Final EIS has been completed in the context  12-16  of all presently available data. As stated in response to Comment 12-07, the underground CO2 plume after 20 years would encompass approximately 4,000 acres. The total acreage of contiguous  properties at the land surface above the subsurface CO2 storage area would be 6,800 acres, as updated and described in Chapter  2 of the Final EIS, specifically Section 2.5.2. See also response to  Comment 15-02 on this same topic. The analyses in the Draft EIS of  potential impacts on underground sources of drinking water and on  public health and safety remain applicable. Refinements have been  included in the Final EIS where appropriate.  Commentor 12 - Elizabeth (Betty) Niemann County (Mattoon), the 1000 acre estimate for size should be reevaluated.

Grain density is 2.65 and Compressibility is 3.7E‐10. I am just a housewife with a chemistry and biology (hence scientific) background trying to understand injecting supercritical CO2 into the Mt Simon layer of sandstone. FutureGen's injection interval is only 7 meters thick which is under the Best Practice reservoir thickness. This bothers me very much as there seems from the EIS data that there the Mt.Simon layer is not uniform but has 17 different layers so to speak. I find the FutureGen's salinity not within the perameters of the Best Practice criteria at 47.5 grams per liter. However it does seem t be within the requirements of the USEPA. The discussion on page 3.4‐8 of the Mt. Simon Formation (Injection Zone), to me, is a text book cut and paste discussion that contains nonspecific information to the FutureGen project. Words like “This suggests that the formation exhibits characteristics, such as sufficient permeability and porosity, which make it suitable for long‐term gas storage.” are most unsettling and not reassuring as this statement makes an assumptions and not Morgan County site specific conclusions. I also wish to point out that it seems that most data has been extrapolated from the gas storage wells and field in Illinois for this project. Gas has different DOE/EIS‐0460D Additional Comments Page 13 of 26 12-17  DOE acknowledges that there are a number of research organizations  and scientific experts that are developing Best Practices for geologic  12-16 con’t  storage site selection, the referenced British Geological Survey’s (BGS) site screening document being one of several. However, the BGS document (and others) can best be viewed as early  guidance in a developing scientific field and does not represent  expert consensus on storage site pre-requisites. The USEPA and  NETL have both produced site selection documents that address  the regulatory requirements that need to be met for underground  sequestration and the best methods for the site selection in the  U.S (USEPA 2013a; NETL 2013c). Section 3.4.3.2 of the Draft EIS  describes the baseline characteristics for the proposed action that  were used in the site selection process, and how site selection  was used to minimize the potential for impacts from injection. The  combined thickness of the proposed injection zone, which includes  the Mt. Simon Formation and the Elmhurst member is 656 feet (172  meters) thick, while the proposed injection interval (the location of  the horizontal well’s injection laterals) would be a small portion of  the overall injection zone. The heterogeneous layers within the Mt.  12-17  Simon Formation would help to reduce the upward movement of the plume by dispersing the CO2 laterally and increasing residual trapping by providing more surface area to interact with the brine  (Berger et al. 2009). The Mt. Simon Formation total dissolved solids  concentration, measured in the stratigraphic well, is approximately  47,000 milligrams per liter, which is higher than the USEPA’s  regulatory maximum of 10,000 milligrams per liter (USEPA 2013a).  Please see the response to Comment 15-08, which discusses the  use of the injection horizon in the plume modeling.  12-18  The discussion of the Mt. Simon Formation in section 3.4.2.1 of  the Draft EIS is intended to describe the regional geologic setting  based on scientific studies and descriptions of well cores throughout  the Illinois Basin. The site-specific geologic information, which is  based on results from the stratigraphic well that was drilled within  the CO2 storage study area, is presented in Section 3.4.2.4. This section provides a more detailed description of the Eau Claire and  Mt. Simon Formations, their measured permeabilities and porosities,  12-18  and the results of two-dimensional seismic studies of the confining and injection zones. Further technical and geologic details are also  presented in the Appendix G, Geological Report.  Commentor 12 - Elizabeth (Betty) Niemann properties than semi‐liquid carbon dioxide. You cannot just “plug and play the data” and say they are the same. I also wish to point out that the farmers in Morgan County in the area of the natural gas storage deposit in the St. Peter Sandstone Formation are experiencing leakage. So If the CO2 does migrate upwards into the St. Peter Formation, there is great potential for leakage into the atmosphere. It really seems to me that the Morgan County Carbon Storage Area has not been properly mapped and characterized and that a lot of the assumptions made for the site have been made from literature research or general descriptions about the Mt. Simon Formation that are not site specific. President Obama has said that one event does not make a trend. One characterization well, with core samples from wells outside the carbon storage area does not make a good characterization of the geologic formation of the Morgan County Injection site. By the way, I found it unscientific for FutureGen to select Morgan County as its carbon storage site without drilling characterization wells in the other two areas. It seems to me that cost has driven FutureGen to take the path of least expense. The EIS 460D overlaid the oil and gas well maps from the ISGS but did not include any water wells in the overlay. ALL of these are potential sources for CO2 leaks from the storage area. Concerns about Storage Leakage and CO2 Leakage Remediation First and foremost, before any leakage can be determined, a baseline study must be carried out. Page 2.66 discusses the baseline study. It does not mention the length of the study. The Midwest Geological Sequestration Consortium conducted an approximate 2 year baseline study prior to starting the injection process. What is the length of the baseline study that FutureGen will conduct? As above, there is the potential for leakage through wells. In Volume I, Page 3.4‐13 is Figure 3.4‐4 Oil, Gas, and Gas Storage Wells in the Underground Injection Control Survey Area. This figure does not represent all ground penetrations by wells. There is this map from the ISGS: DOE/EIS‐0460D Additional Comments Page 14 of 26 12-19  The only natural gas storage field in Morgan County is the Waverly  Storage Field, which is operated by the Panhandle Eastern Pipeline  12-18 con’t  Company. It is located more than 16 miles away from the proposed CO2 injection site. The FutureGen 2.0 Project would include a monitoring well in the St. Peter Formation to ensure that CO2 has  not migrated into it. The injection zone in the Mt. Simon Formation  12-19  is separated by a primary confining layer (Eau Claire Formation), which is 400 feet thick, a secondary confining layer, which is 244 feet  thick, and another 1,100 feet of rock before the base of the St. Peter  Formation is reached. The many injection well BMPs and monitoring  activities that would be used during construction and operation of the  injection wells would ensure that CO2 does not reach the St. Peter  Formation or the land surface.  12-20  DOE stated its position regarding the geologic suitability of the Mt.  Simon Formation in Morgan County for CO2 storage in response to  12-20  Comment 11-10. The stratigraphic well was drilled in close proximity to the proposed location of the injection wells and thus data from  that well can be used to adequately characterize the site-specific  geology and hydrogeology of the injection site. Further, the data  from the stratigraphic well was consistent with existing regional  data, providing additional scientific validity. The Alliance has also  performed a two-dimensional seismic survey through the CO2  storage study area, and used the results to demonstrate that the  stratigraphic layers identified in the stratigraphic well were laterally  continuous. Finally, the Alliance would also collect subsurface data  during the construction of the injection wells, but before CO2 injection  begins. This data would be provided to USEPA as part of the UIC  permit process to confirm the integrity of the site before operations  12-21  may begin.  As described in Section 3.5.2.4 of the Draft EIS, only 5 of the 24  documented groundwater wells that occur within the 25-square mile  UIC survey area were drilled to depths greater than 100 feet and  only one of these was drilled to a depth greater than 400 feet. That  single well was drilled to a depth of 1,056 feet, which is more than  2,000 feet above the upper surface of the Eau Claire Formation  (the primary caprock overlaying the Mt. Simon Formation). Section  3.4.3.2 addresses the potential for migration of CO2 through oil and  gas wells under the subheading “CO2 Migration.” The deepest oil  and gas well within the UIC survey area is drilled to a depth of 1,530  feet. None of the groundwater or oil and gas wells located within the  UIC survey area penetrate the St. Peter Formation or the deeper  confining zones; therefore, it is very unlikely that CO2 would migrate  up through existing well bores or abandoned wells, because it would  Commentor 12 - Elizabeth (Betty) Niemann first have to penetrate the primary and secondary confining zones to reach the shallower wells above. 12-21 The Alliance initiated the baseline geological characterization study within the CO2 storage study area in 2011, which would continue until injection is initiated in 2016; therefore, the study would last for approximately 5 years. Once injection starts, monitoring would continue in accordance with the MVA program as reviewed and approved by the USEPA under the UIC permitting process. Further details on the MVA program are presented in Section 3.4, Geology, of the Final EIS (under the subheading “Monitoring and Verification”) and in the UIC permit applications (as posted publically at the USEPA 12-21 UIC website: http://www.epa.gov/r5water/uic/futuregen/index.htm). con’t The data represented in Figure 3.4-4 of the Draft EIS are based on data exported from the Illinois State Geological Survey Oil and Gas Resources Internet Map Services and only include data for wells located within the UIC survey area. The UIC survey area is a 5- by 5-mile square area that was outlined to ensure that all wells that could exist within the maximum CO2 plume boundary would not intersect the Mt. Simon Formation. The only well within this area that penetrates the Eau Claire and Mt. Simon Formations is the stratigraphic well that was drilled by the Alliance in 2011, and was specifically constructed to be resistant to the acidity of the CO2 plume. The red field in the Illinois State Geological Survey Oil and Gas Resources map is the Prentice field, which is described on page 3.4-9 of the Draft EIS. It contains 25 oil and gas wells, at depths up to 350 feet bgs. There are no oil or gas fields within the UIC survey area; therefore, they are not present in Figure 3.4-4. Section 3.5, Groundwater, of the Final EIS addresses the groundwater wells and major sand and gravel aquifers within the UIC survey area. Figure 3.5-1 identifies the locations of shallow groundwater aquifers for the FutureGen 2.0 Project, and Figure 3.5-2 presents the shallow groundwater wells within the UIC survey area. The injection wells have been designed in accordance with the design standards specified by the Class VI injection well regulations as documented in the UIC permit applications. By using CO2-resistant cement at the base of the wells, and selecting a site that has no known vertical pathways for CO2 migration (e.g., deep wells, faults), the potential for impacts to the shallow USDWs from CO2 injection would be negligible. DOE/EIS‐0460D Additional Comments Page 15 of 26 Note the Carbon Storage Area (Primarily 16N 9W Section 25) has a major sand and gravel aquifer beneath the surface which, if the CO2 migrates upwards, has a potential for large potable water contamination. Mike Bickle and Niko Kampman from the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom state in their article, “Lessons in carbon storage from geological analogues” that “…we can constrain the nature and rates of the processes governing the fate of CO2 in geological storage reservoirs. Interpreting these observations fully, requires understanding the hydrology of the settings, invariably complex where multiphase flows are involved.”38 Given this, will FutureGen have on staff qualified person or person(s) on site to understand the injection process? If not, then the project should be scrubbed. What is really missing from the EIS‐0460D is the remediation plan in case of leakage. The remediation plan is alluded to in the USEPA UIC permitting application reference on page 2‐67. Dr. Sally Benson39 from Stanford University, Benson Laboratory, recommends that when an injection site is selected, the remediation plan should be part of the site selection and determined first ‐ before any construction and injection takes place. In her work along with Ariel Esposito, “Evaluation and development of options for remediation of CO2 leakage into groundwater aquifers from geologic carbon storage”, she states “There are many good reasons to have confidence in the long‐term security of carbon dioxide (CO2) storage in properly selected and operated DOE/EIS‐0460D Additional Comments Page 16 of 26 12-22 The issues expressed in this comment have been addressed in response to Comments 11-10, 11-11, 12-08, and 12-20.

However, the possibility remains that the CO2 leaks out of the formation, for example, up an abandoned well, into an overlying groundwater aquifer. As large scale demonstration projects of carbon capture and storage (CCS) come closer to development in the US, the need for contingency planning to formulate groundwater remediation scenarios in case of a possible leakage event from a geologic storage site is very important. Leakage of CO2 into groundwater aquifers may degrade valuable groundwater resources, may pose a risk to human health if hazardous trace metals dissolve into ground‐water, and may interfere with agricultural activities. “ 40 I have spoken to her and she feels this is very important in the success of Carbon Storage. Ken Humphries’ in many presentations indicates that CO2 storage is safe but in my research for this commentary, I found Dr. Benson’s paper and also her presentation to the contrary. If CO2 storage is completely safe, then why is there a need for a remediation plan? To me the risk to ground water contamination in an agricultural injection site setting is unsettling to say the least. Along with the remediation plan comes costs. These remediation costs must be paid by someone, entity, or alliance. What happens long after FutureGen has completed the project especially when well casings deteriorate due to the acid plume? Who will be in place to activate the remediation plan and from whence shall the money come? Ken Humphries has said that companies or alliances don’t last and states do. So in light of his remark, will the State of Illinois have to remediate a leak? Will the State of Illinois have people in place for a rapid response? Better yet, will the State of Illinois have the monetary resources available for a rapid response? These are all the questions that will need to be answered and told to the landowners. The carbon storage landowners are “ground zero” for CO2 damage and not the “strong community” supporters residing in the city of Jacksonville. CO2 Pipeline Concerns As of the writing of this Draft EIS, actual pipeline routing and details were not available to the authors of this paper. Again conjecture using basic data was used for conclusions as to the discussion and the impacts of the pipeline. I have many concerns and questions over the pipeline. There is a good risk analysis on CO2 pipeline prepared for HECA Project Site, Kern, California,41 which discusses mitigation measures for CO2 pipeline safety. FutureGen has not indicated any of these measures to be undertaken and a risk assessment only discusses a leak or rupture. Other possible pipeline scenarios include the breakdown of the pump and a multiphase flow (supercritical liquid CO2 and gaseous CO2) happens in the pipeline which may lead to pump failure. A piece of good information on CO2 pipelines is “A Policy, Legal, and Regulatory Evaluation of the Feasibility of a National Pipeline Infrastructure for the Transport and Storage of Carbon Dioxide” 42 which states, ”CO2 pipelines are similar in many respects in design and operation to natural gas pipelines; however, because the CO2 is normally transported as a supercritical fluid,32 there are a number of significant differences. To maintain the product in its supercritical state, it is transported at pressures that range from 1,200 to 2,700 psi.33 These pressures are higher than the operating pressures used in most natural gas pipelines, which typically range from 200 to 1,500 psi.34 Booster stations along the pipeline route maintain the DOE/EIS‐0460D Additional Comments Page 17 of 26 12-23 As stated in response to Comment 12-07, the Final EIS has addressed the updated alignment of the Alliance’s proposed southern route for the CO2 pipeline, including the route to the Alliance’s proposed site for the CO2 injection wells. The updated pipeline route and details are contained in Appendix C of the Final EIS. The Final EIS has been updated in Section 2.5.1.2 to state that the pipeline would be constructed of carbon steel that conforms to the American Petroleum Institute (API) Specification 5L, Specification for Line Pipe. The pipeline design and construction, as described in Chapter 2 of the Draft EIS, would comply with all applicable regulations for pipeline safety. DOE maintains that the Draft EIS has described the 12-22 risks associated with CO2 leaks from pipeline failures and accidents con’t and their potential impacts on respective environmental resources appropriately throughout Chapter 3 of the Draft EIS. Potential impacts on public health and safety from pipeline releases are specifically analyzed in Section 3.17, Health and Human Safety. Under the terms of the pipeline ROW agreement to be obtained by the Alliance, the ROW can only be used for a CO2 pipeline. No other substance could be transported in the Alliance’s CO2 pipeline. 12-23 Commentor 12 - Elizabeth (Betty) Niemann necessary pipeline pressure for CO2 pipelines.35 Because the supercritical CO2 behaves as a liquid in the pipeline, pumps, rather than compressors, are used at CO2 pipeline booster stations.36 The increased pressure in CO2 pipelines is typically accommodated with thicker‐walled pipe than that used for natural gas transportation.37” …The pipelines are constructed of carbon steel. I find on page 2‐43 of the EIS 460D that the actual pipe makeup is not decided and specific pipe material is not described. According to the EPA regulations on CO2 sequestration, the tubing or pipeline is only expected to last 20 to 25 five years. Pipeline maintenance is not discussed in the Draft EIS 460 that I could find. The Illinois Project Lincoln on CO2 Pipelines provides very good discussion in its Appendix concerning CO2 pipeline in Illinois. 43 In its discussion, it states, “The elimination of water allows a CO2 pipeline to be made from the same carbon steel as natural gas or oil pipeline while substantially mitigating the risk of corrosion….Where water cannot be eliminated, CO2 pipelines are constructed of stainless steel or carbon steel pipe lined with polyethylene pipe (a liner) to create a barrier between the water/CO2 mix.” Now, if the CO2 pipeline in the FutureGen 2.0 project is made of carbon steel, then there is no guarantee to the right of way grantor that the pipeline will be used for another substance after the project is completed. Pipeline decommissioning is not discussed in the EIS 460D. These are questions that should be answered before any informed decision is to be made: 1. What CO2 pipeline safety mitigation steps will be performed by routinely FutureGen? Does FutureGen actually have a plan? 2. Who determines the damage compensation to landowners along the pipeline should there be a pipeline failure. 3. What is the line pack of the pipeline and how long will it take to purge the line in the event of a failure. 4. Should a mainline block valve close automatically, what criteria does FutureGen have to disengage the valve? 5. Is there valve redundancy? 6. What is the turnover of CO2 in the pipeline per day? 7. What are the pounds of pressure of CO2 in the pipeline? 8. Can the pipeline pumps handle a multiphase (gas and supercritical CO2) event should the pressure drop in the pipeline? Are there pump redundancies? 9. Will FutureGen carry pipeline liability insurance? 10. Will there be and how many vent valves will there be in the length of the pipeline? 11. When negotiating with landowners about vent valves on their property, will FutureGen inform them of the noise hazard? 12. How many by‐passes will be in the pipeline to handle pig launches and retrieval? 13. What type of maintaining system will be used..e.e Cygret Studio. 14. There should be at least one server and there should be a redundancy of the server incase the server has loss of power or malfunctions. DOE/EIS‐0460D Additional Comments Page 18 of 26 12-24  NEPA does not intend the EIS to be a detailed design document or a  comprehensive implementation plan.

The Alliance  would develop and implement a safety plan before the pipeline and  injection well site become operational. DOE has reviewed these  safety features and has not identified a need for further mitigation  measures to protect human health and safety (see Section 4.2.1).  2. A damage claim would most likely be settled between the parties  (or their insurers). A landowner that suffered damages as a result  of a pipeline failure could bring a court action to determine liability,  although it is expected that any damage claim would be settled  without court judgment.  3. The CO2 content of the entire pipeline is approximately 2,980 tons  (2,700 metric tons) of CO2 (based on the current design). The mass  of CO2 between any two mainline block (isolation) valves along the  pipeline would be one third of this amount. It is not expected that  the pipeline would need to be vented. In the event of necessary  maintenance, a segment of the pipeline could be isolated and blown  down. This would be a slow process done in a deliberate manner  12-24  that would take from hours to days to complete.  4. The Alliance would develop operating procedures as part of the  final design, which cannot begin until DOE issues its Record of  Decision. It is expected that review and approval would be required  to re-open a mainline block valve after an automatic shutdown has  occurred.  5. The mainline block valves would be single valves.  6. As much as 1.2 million tons (1.1 million metric tons) of CO2 would  pass through the pipeline per year or 66.9 million standard cubic  feet per day (flow rate at standard temperature and pressure). With  the current design, this would equate to approximately 1.3 pipeline  volume turnovers per day.  Commentor 12 - Elizabeth (Betty) Niemann 15. How many people are to be employed in pipeline control? 16. When the FutureGen project is over, what will happen to the pipe, the pipeline and the right of way granted to FutureGen? This is not really discussed in the EIS. 17. How will small leaks with minimal pressure drop be detected? 18. EIS did not know the diameter of the pipe so when will this determination be made? 19. There are some specifics in the literature that was given to the landowners, but does FutureGen really know how to run a power plant, a pipeline, and a injection well? As I asked before: What INDUSTRY certifications does FutureGen hold that will give some credence to FutureGen’s ability to carry this project through? 20. Supposedly there will be no H2S in the supercritical CO2 stream through the pipeline but if there is a plant malfunction, will there be the H2S in the supercritical CO2? Will the concentration of H2S be enough to categorize the supercritical CO2 as sour? If so, the Illinois Lincoln Project recommends that the self imposed buffer zone between the pipeline and public or private occupied building be at least 1500 feet. 44 Also note: on page 2.45 of the EIS 460D that the CO2 pipeline would be buried at least 4 feet underground. I believe the Agricultural Impact Mitigation Agreement (AIMA) calls for a burial of not less than 5 feet in agricultural areas due to tiling and field drainage, this may be changed due to individual AIMAs with each landowners impacted by the pipeline route. However, normally pipe is buried 8‐10 feet below the surface in 2013 high pressure installations. Five feet is too close to the surface and raises the probability of damage in future earth moving actions on the farms etc. This should be considered in budgeting etc. FutureGen 2.0 filed a request for CO2 pipeline certification with the Illinois Commerce Commission on 29 March 2013 Docket No. 13‐0252.45 Along with that, FutureGen had to file on 18 April 2013 complete information that they attempted to withhold in the initial filing which concerned holding back information on the landowners impacted by the pipeline as required by the state. This supposedly “confidential” information has created what Sheamus McGraw called “the end of country”46 from his book of the same title. This lack of openness and transparency has caused farmers who were friends to cease being friends. Section 4.5 of the EIS‐460D discusses Irreversible and Irretrievable Commitments. In this section it states “After this time and upon future decommissioning, proposed project components could be removed and the surface lands again made available to be re‐used for another purpose.” on page 4.5‐1. Apparently the EIS preparer(s) is/are not familiar with Easement Law. Once an easement for a pipeline is granted and recorded in the land office, it is forever. Once the pipeline is decommissioned, the pipe can be removed, but FutureGen will hold title to those easements and can sell them to whomever for whatever use. Therefore, the irreversible easements are actually irretrievable. Some landowners assumed that if they signed options or granted easements and the FutureGen project fell through, they would get their land back. That is just not so. So the statement quoted above is misleading. DOE/EIS‐0460D Additional Comments Page 19 of 26 7. The CO2 pressure at the energy center metering station is expected to be 2,100 pounds per square inch pressure (psig). The CO2 pressure at the CO2 injection site metering station is expected to be 1,874 psig. 8. The design team is aware of potential issues with multiphase flow. The preliminary design for the pipeline had included an intermediate pumping station as a contingency. Subsequent analyses have shown that an intermediate pumping station would not be necessary. 9. As explained in response to Comment 12-08, the Alliance would 12-24 carry liability insurance as required by the UIC permit. con’t 10. There would be a CO2 blowdown system at the pipeline entrance on the energy center site. There would be a small venting system at the injection well site to vent CO2 during infrequent pigging operations or maintenance. The mainline block valves would have bypass arrangements with the capability to manually vent the system. This would require the removal of blind flanges and installation of vent piping; venting is not anticipated except in the unlikely event that a segment of the pipeline needed to be slowly vented under planned and controlled conditions to conduct pipeline repairs. 11. There would be no routine venting of CO2 along the pipeline. CO2 12-25 could be vented at the energy center site. There would be pressure safety (relief) valves between the isolation valves on the injection well site metering stations. These would not vent CO2 except in the case of an unanticipated upset condition. The Alliance would inform affected landowners of all potential effects, including noise. 12. There would be a pig launcher at the Meredosia Energy Center and a pig receiver at the CO2 injection well site. There would be no 12-26 intermediate pig launching/receiving stations along the pipeline. 13. The pipeline maintenance procedures would be developed during the final design stage of the project, which cannot begin until after DOE issues its Record of Decision. 14. The control system would have redundant servers and redundant uninterruptible power supplies to protect the system both from a loss 12-27 of power and server failure. 15. Approximately 10 to 15 people would be employed to manage and operate the CO2 pipeline and storage facility as discussed under Surface Facilities Operation in Section 2.5.2.2 of the Draft EIS. 16. The easements to be purchased by the Alliance would grant the right to “construct, maintain, operate, inspect, repair, and remove a single pipeline not to exceed 12 inches in diameter for the purpose of transporting carbon dioxide.” The easement may not be used for Commentor 12 - Elizabeth (Betty) Niemann What standards are being followed for design and construction? This is high pressure line pipe requiring special fittings, valves, welding procedures etc. for a safe installation. The delivery of these items is very long. Where is the basic project overall schedule and basic budget estimate. Equipment Comments: Where is the basic equipment list for this project?? Where are the supporting calculations for equipment sizing?? Discussion on this area of the project is missing?? A 710 BHP motor driver for the injection pumps is not logical. There are 700, 750, 800 BHP etc. sized standard motors but a 710 BHP motor would be a very expensive and unique item. It appears that the true motor size is 850 BHP or so for each injection pump to maintain the required pressure of 1200 psi minimum at the given required injection rates. The motor should be sized larger so it will run cooler, and able to respond to its variable speed drive requirements without bogging down. If pressure drops below 1200 psi you will have a state of multi‐phase flow. This is dangerous to equipment and can cause catastrophic equipment failure at these pressures. False instrument readings will occur and bad things happen. Has anyone considered this in the evaluation??? Meredosia Energy Center: Only six (6) hours of UPS power in an emergency for instrumentation. Per code a 24‐hour backup UPS is required on all critical instrumentation. Then there is an emergency generator that is sized for 150% of normal load and a seven (7) day run time. Section 3.15 needs revision. It should reflect power calculations and a true load study for the project. Who will pay for the new required substation, transmission lines, 4160 VAC or 13.8 KV motor supply? The local population should not have to pay for these project infrastructure upgrades. This is not mentioned in the documentation. IEEE and API guidelines are never mentioned and they have major cost effects. The loads on the roads will easily be 100 tons for the deep drilling equipment. Just the draw‐works for the rig will run +90 tons before adding in the special truck. Who is going to pay for this??? Initial water for drilling and fracturing the well laterals should be considered. It could be as high as half a million gallon. The local supply and disposal of the fluids is a logics issue not mentioned. By the way, what is the overall effect on the new boilers etc. thermal plant performance efficiency? The current plant HHV net efficiency is about 21.5%. What is the new value factoring in carbon capture and sequestration? The efficiency will go down because there is more load. How far down did it go? Are there any mass and heat calculations on overall energy efficiencies of the project for review?? DOE/EIS‐0460D Additional Comments Page 20 of 26 any other purpose. Under Illinois law, once a pipeline easement is  abandoned, as by cessation of use and removal of the pipeline, the  easement terminates.  17. The CO2 pipeline design would include a leak detection/  Computational Pipeline Monitoring and modeling system that meets  or exceeds American Petroleum Institute Standard 1130 (API 1130).  In addition, aerial patrols would be conducted on a routine basis to  detect even small leaks.  18. The Alliance determined during preliminary design that a nominal  12-inch diameter pipeline would be sufficient for the volume of CO2  12-28  to be transported and permanently stored. The final diameter for the main CO2 pipeline would be established during the hydraulic  analysis performed as part of the Pipeline Front-End Engineering  Design. It is possible that the final pipe diameter would be less than  12 inches.  19. The subject of this question has been addressed in response to  Comment 12-10.  20. Current analysis indicates that there would be no H2S in the  CO2 stream because of the oxidizing nature of the oxy-combustion  process. However, for purposes of analysis, the Alliance used the  accepted CO2 pipeline standard of less than 20 ppm H2S by weight.  Even if the oxy-combustion process resulted in the production of H2S,  if the level of H2S were found to exceed the acceptable operating  level, as detected at the energy center inlet metering station, the  isolation valve into the pipeline would be closed.  12-25  As stated in Section 2.5.1.3 of the Draft EIS, the CO2 pipeline would  be constructed in conformance with applicable regulations in 49 CFR  Part 195. The pipeline depth (4 feet) would exceed the minimum  depth requirements of the regulations. The depth on agricultural  12-29  lands (5 feet) would be in accordance with Illinois Department of Agriculture Pipeline Construction Standards and Policies and the  Agricultural Impact Mitigation Agreement entered into by the Alliance.  12-26  The issue raised in this comment is viewed to be outside the  scope of the NEPA process. However, DOE acknowledges the  need for compliance with governing law as well as transparency.  DOE understands this situation to be one where the Alliance  requested that personal information of affected landowners (names  and addresses) be maintained as confidential in a non-public  document. In that regard DOE is strongly supportive of protection  of Personally Identifiable Information such as that identified by the  Alliance. A publicly releasable document was also submitted for  the record at the same time, fully disclosing the pipeline route and  Commentor 12 - Elizabeth (Betty) Niemann Funding FutureGen 2.0 There is no cost analysis on cost versus benefit in this Draft EIS. The Government Accounting Office thought there should be one on FutureGen’s reorganization but it was not done and … “DOE added that it had stopped those negotiations because it believed that the Alliance would not be able to financially partner with DOE.” 47 I feel because GAO feels that the DOE has no assurance that the restructured FutureGen is the best option to advance CCS. I believe that before the DOE makes a decision on FutureGen 2.0, it should sit down with the Alliance and perform a comprehensive analysis of costs, benefits, and risks, and that the DOE should share the analysis with Morgan County citizens before anymore citizens commit to this project. US taxpayers and Illinois rate payers are stakeholders in this venture and are owed this accountability. This project was supposed to be a 1.3 billion dollar project. Then it became 1.65 billion, and now since the development of FutureGen’s Power Sourcing Agreement, the cost to has escalated to somewhere from 4 billion to 5.5 billion depending upon the length of the project as stated above according to Exelon’s letter to Senator Richard Durbin (see above) What is really upsetting is the amount of money that has already been spent on this project. For example, Illinois expenditures for Lobbying are: 2008  St. of Illinois FutureGen  Cassidy and Associates 6 Reports  180,000.00  S.1751 and H.R. 2641 Energy and Water Appropriations Bills Funding for FutureGen Commercial Demonstration Project  2007  St. of Illinois  Cassidy and Associates  160,000.00  S.1751 and H.R. 2641 Energy and Water Appropriations Bills Funding for FutureGen Commercial Demonstration Project  Thomas, Dennis  TOTAL  $340,000.00  Then, it spent another $1,320.000 in 2009 on Illinois Grants in its Coal Competitiveness Program to bring FutureGen to Mattoon. (See Footnote 4 and Appendix 2). Starting in 2011, Illinois spent $45,500 on Coal Competitiveness grants to four cities vying for FutureGen when Mattoon did not want the CO2 storage under Coles County land. Jacksonville Regional Economic Development Corporation received the largest grant of $18,000 against Tuscola and the City of Vandalia each receiving $10,000. Christian County Economic Development Corporation for Taylorville only received $7,500. I believe that Jacksonville’s bid of $18,000 sweetened the pot of FutureGen to bring FutureGen to Morgan County. DOE/EIS‐0460D Additional Comments Page 21 of 26 affected parcels. Upon notification by the Administrative Law Judge  ( that information such as landowner’s names and addresses is not  typically viewed to be confidential under the docketed proceedings,  the Alliance made motion to the Administrative Law Judge to make  the information viewed by the Alliance as confidential available to  the public. As such, DOE does not view the Alliance’s efforts as  an attempt to hold back pertinent information related to requested  action.  12-27  In the context of the NEPA regulations (40 CFR 1502.16), the  Draft EIS considered that the surface lands would be irreversibly  12-30  committed for use throughout the 20-year operational life of the  project. If at the end of the project the Alliance were to have no  further use of facilities, project components could be removed and  the surface lands again made available to be re-used for another  purpose. DOE stands by the accuracy of this statement about the  physical reversibility of land uses irrespective of the comment about  easement law that relates to the legal status of a right-of-way. The  response to Question 16 in Comment 12-24 also addresses pipeline  easements.  12-28  As explained in the response to Comment 12-10, the Alliance has  assembled a highly qualified team for the design and operation  of FutureGen 2.0. This team includes all the necessary technical  disciplines and professionals needed for this effort, including  professional engineers, geologists, and various industry experts,  who would be responsible to ensure conformance with accepted  engineering standards and regulatory requirements. Presently the  Alliance has completed preliminary engineering and design activities  sufficient to support the NEPA process. As design work progresses  12-31  additional process engineering and modeling would further specify equipment needs. Final equipment specifications for all aspects of  the project would not be fully defined until the detailed design phase,  which is presently planned to be initiated immediately following a  favorable ROD. As this project would be the first of its kind, many  components would not be commercial “off the shelf” equipment and  as a result would be specially designed for this specific application.  12-29  As explained in the response to Comment 12-28, the Alliance has  assembled a highly qualified team for the design and operation  of FutureGen 2.0.

See Appendix 3 for this amount. This FutureGen 2.0 Project was funded in 2010 by the DOE through the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act with the guise of “Job Creation”. This table summarizes the jobs requirements according to the EIS‐0460D: FutureGen Aspect  Construction  Permanent Operational Jobs  Total  Meredosia Power Plant  425  115  540  Pipeline  300  None given for Monitoring  300  Storage Site (Includes wells)  55  21  76  Educational Center  None Given  22  22  Totals  780  158  938  When Morgan County was first announced by FutureGen, the headlines in the Jacksonville Journal Courier ran to thousands of jobs would be created. Well, 938 is not even one thousand. Perhaps the construction of the Educational Center could push the numbers over one thousand but there are enough empty buildings in Jacksonville that could be repurposed as an educational center…and who is going to pay for the facility? Will FutureGen rent or purchase? IN SUMMARY: It seems that to produce 938 jobs, the spending of $1 billion by the DOE, who knows how much FutureGen is paying PLUS the $3 billion according to the Exelon letter, that a minimum of $4 billion dollars for 938 jobs is outrageous. FutureGen’s Training and Educational Center By virtue that the FutureGen Alliance is a not‐for‐profit entity registered in the State of Delaware, it must provide a training or educational center. ”Contributing Alliance members under the 501(c)(3) structure would not receive any repayment of their contributions from project revenues or a facility sale. Such funds must be directed back to research and development.”48 Initially, this training or educational center was to be at the injection site. To me, since the injection site is far from any urban area, it makes no practical sense to have the training center in the middle of a farm and take precious farmland out of productive service. In addition, there are already seven CO2 sequestration centers the United States with even two in Illinois. Why does there need to be a third. This is redundant and a waste of taxpayer and rate payer money. The newest is in Decatur, Illinois.49 These centers are: University of Illinois (Champaign, IL) DOE/EIS‐0460D Additional Comments Page 22 of 26 design that are beyond the scope of an EIS to provide.  With respect to the weight of drilling rigs, all vehicles associated  with the transportation of material and equipment to and from the  site would comply fully with Illinois Department of Transportation  (IDOT) and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) weight  and permitting regulations. Most trucks delivering equipment and  supplies, including drilling equipment, would be less than 80,000  pounds gross vehicle weight with standard axle spacing; therefore,  they would not be considered overweight by criteria outlined in either  IDOT or FHWA regulations (625 ILCS 5 Chapter 15, Article 1; 23  CFR Part 658.17). However, depending on the exact nature or the  delivery, some trucks may require an overweight permit, a non- divisible load permit, or both.  12-31 con’t  The estimated water demands for drilling the injection wells are described and analyzed with respect to the capacity of local utilities  under the subheading “Water Usage” in Section 3.15, Utilities. The  disposal of fluids from the drilling of injection wells is described and  analyzed under the subheading “Wastewater” in the same section.  12-30  The response to Comment 2-13 explains DOE’s position on the  need for a cost-benefit analysis. The response to Comment 11 12 explains DOE’s decision to be supported by the Final EIS with  respect to funding for the FutureGen 2.0 Project.  12-31  As comparable to Comment 11-12, the issues expressed in this  comment are beyond the scope of the EIS for the FutureGen 2.0  Project. The cost estimate for the project is $1.78 billion, with DOE’s  financial responsibility capped at $1.05 billion. The Draft EIS described  the potential impacts on the local economy and employment from  construction for the FutureGen 2.0 Project in Section 3.18.3.1 and  for operations in Section 3.18.3.2. DOE believes that this analysis  outlines the potential effects on primary and secondary employment  in Morgan County appropriately and fairly.  12-32  As described in Section 2.5.3 of the Draft EIS, the visitor, research,  12-32  and training facilities would be located on as many as two suitable sites in the vicinity of Jacksonville, IL. The Final EIS has been updated  to explain that the Alliance currently plans for these functions to be  housed in a single facility located in Jacksonville.  Commentor 12 - Elizabeth (Betty) Niemann Environmental Outreach and Stewardship (EOS) Alliance (Seattle, WA) New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology (Socorro, NM) Petroleum Technology Transfer Council (PTTC) (Tulsa, OK) Southern States Energy Board (SSEB) (Norcross, GA) University of Texas at Austin (Austin, TX) University of Wyoming (Laramie, WY) CO2 Capture and Storage Project, Education and Training Center (Decatur, IL) The more training centers there are, the less exclusivity they have. Jacksonville, Illinois, is in the middle of the state without adequate air transportation to get to it. Both Champaign and Decatur have regional airports. Springfield, Illinois is the closest airport to Jacksonville and the FutureGen project, but Decatur is also the same distance from Springfield. The Meredosia Power Center is further away still. FutureGen is running way behind in offering this training research center. It would be better off funding one of the other two already located in Illinois. I do believe that one of its selling points when coming to Morgan County is the promise of money to Illinois College. So the question is, where is the training center going to be? Concerns and comments on Socioeconomic Impacts: Cultural: The Illinois Department of Agriculture has a Farm Recognition Program within the state which honors those farms that have been in a family for 100 years and also for 150 years.50 There are over 9200 centennial farms in the state and over 600 sesquicentennial farms. There are 12 centennial farms in Morgan County registered with the Illinois Department of Agriculture. Two farms in the carbon storage area are eligible. The heirs of the Beilschmidt Family Farm where the characterization well was drilled are awaiting transfer of the land to them by the Trustee before submitting the Centennial Farm Application. Page F‐90 in Appendix F of Volume II of the EIS‐460D shows a picture of the 1894 Plat book taken of Section 25 of Township 16N 9W which shows the owner as Henry W. Beilschmidt in the North East corner of the section with a farm of 156 acres. Also on that same map is a James H Martin who maybe an ancestor of the Martin’s who are assumed to beat the end of the pipeline according to ICC docket 13‐0252. If this is the case, then Martin farm is also eligible for Centennial Farm certification. The Martin’s should be asked if they are descendents and IF they are going to seek Centennial Certification. While these farms are not certified yet, this type of certification places the farm in a unique historical perspective. This certification is not part of the National Register of Historic Places. However, it is a part of Illinois history which the Illinois Department of Agriculture is trying to preserve. Economic: The State of Illinois legislators have fallen all over themselves to bring the FutureGen project to Illinois. They have passed laws without really knowing the risks of this project to push the FutureGen agenda. With one law mandating that the Attorney General represent FutureGen in any legal action that may be filed against FutureGen, FutureGen has DOE/EIS‐0460D Additional Comments Page 23 of 26 12-33 Based on the analysis of impacts on prime farmlands in Section 3.3, Physiography and Soils, and on land use in Section 3.10, Land Use, of the Draft EIS, DOE concluded that the effects of the CO2 pipeline and geologic storage components at the land surface would be limited to the right-of-way requirements for the pipeline and the permanent site(s) for the injection well facilities and associated access roads. As none of these activities would alter the lands ability to support agricultural land use or displace any current farm owners and with DOE’s understanding of the Illinois Department 12-32 of Agriculture’s Bureau of Marketing efforts to honor Illinois’ rich con’t agricultural heritage, DOE believes that the project would not affect properties eligible for either the Centennial Farms Program or the Sesquicentennial Farms Program. 12-34 The issues expressed in this comment have been addressed in response to Comments 10-01 and 11-13. 12-33 12-34 Commentor 12 - Elizabeth (Betty) Niemann been elevated to the same level in the state as a department or bureau. What company or corporation do you know has this level of protection in any state? FutureGen has announced that the Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC) approved the Illinois Power Agency’s Power Procurement Plan which includes FutureGen’s Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). This approval is under the ICC’s docket number 12‐0544. However, what FutureGen has not really indicated that under docket 12‐0544 there is a law suit filed contesting the ICC’s power to approve the FutureGen PPA. There was so much discussion that the PPA was moved to a new docket number 13‐0034 such that the terms could be worked out. So far as if this writing, FutureGen’s PPA is not totally approved by the ICC. All of this information can be found on the ICC website under the docket numbers given.51 There is a long discussion about the inclusion of the PPA in the Power Procurement Plan. Again, FutureGen pushed for its inclusion. I could go on, but I won’t. The documents are there to follow. If this PPA is finally approved, then the economic impact to the citizens and rate payers of Illinois need to be addressed in the EIS. As of this writing, the PPA does not have all the costs associated with the project from which the FutureGen can recover its project costs as specified in the PPA. The utilities that sign the PPA will then pass the costs on to the Illinois consumer and federal tax payer. I do not believe that passing the cost to the rate and taxpayers was the intent of the demonstration project when it began. The reason, as stated above, that Exelon pulled out of the alliance was that consumers were going to be stuck paying the bill. In my opinion, FutureGen is getting a free ride to build this project at federal taxpayers’ expense with cost sharing funding from the DOE plus increase electrical rates to Illinois consumers to pay for the cost of the project. Then, FutureGen gets to license its knowledge and sell licenses to the world without reimbursing those who paid for the free ride. Report: In conclusion, looking at the alternatives, plants retrofitted with natural gas as fuel, run cleaner, burn more efficiently, provide less harm to the atmosphere, and not require a disruption to Illinois farmland with a pipeline and sequestration. It has already been documented that with the switch to natural gas, the CO2 emissions have gone down appreciably. With natural gas, power plants can produce electricity cheaper, use less natural resources, is more energy efficient, produces less CO2 emissions thereby producing cheaper electricity for the rate payer requiring less amount of the cap which can be made available for other power projects. Furthermore, why sequester the CO2 when there are several States looking for CO2 to be used in Enhanced Oil Recovery. FutureGen could sell the CO2 to these states to offset construction and operating costs rather than sequester it. Page 4.4.1 of Volume 1 of the EIS‐0460D states “Although the Alliance may still elect to construct and operate the project in the absence of DOE cost‐shared funding, for the purposes DOE/EIS‐0460D Additional Comments Page 24 of 26 12-35 As explained in response to Comment 11-03, alternatives involving different fuel blends, renewable energy sources, and energy conservation improvements would not support the specific objectives of the President’s FutureGen Initiative and were therefore not analyzed in the Draft EIS. 12-34 con’t 12-35 Commentor 12 - Elizabeth (Betty) Niemann of the analysis in the EIS, DOE assumed that the no action alternative is equivalent to a no‐build alternative.” It is my hope that Alliance does not elect to continue. The most of the farmers impacted by the pipeline and some of the carbon storage area farmers of Morgan County will be happy. FutureGen has not voluntarily announced or made public the 45 landowners in the carbon storage area.

Conditions Precedent, allows for waivers of the Governmental Authorizations. Thus FutureGen could also use this approval with the Government Authorities listed in Exhibit 3.1.(a)(i) to say that the ICC approved waiver process of authorizations under Paragraph 3. Conditions Precedent and that FutureGen need not secure these authorizations. For example FutureGen has already tried to circumvent governmental authorizations. From page 12: PSD request for variance on PSD (Air) Permit to IPA.http://www.icc.illinois.gov/docket/files.aspx?no=11‐0660&docId=172128	on	3	October	 2011 “Finally. the FutureGen Alliance would recommend that the ICC modify the general specification for PSD (Air) Permit to the following: "Demonstrate that a PSD (Air) Permit, if reguired, has either been issued, or an application has been filed with the Illinois EPA" The FutureGen Alliance believes this change is appropriate because it is possible that a clean coal project may not be required to obtain a PSD permit given the near-zero level S02, N02, and CO emissions generated by such a project.” I believe it is not within the jurisdiction or power for the IPA and/or the ICC to make such a determination on a permit. Permits should be issued by the appropriate Governmental Authority. Just indicating they applied for the permit is not the same as having one issued. Even though Public Act 97‐0618 states that the State of Illinois shall issue…all necessary and appropriate permits…these permits must follow State and Federal laws about the procedures for obtaining a permit. FYI: Under Illinois Law: http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/publicacts/97/097‐0618.htm 12-36 con’t DOE/EIS‐0460D Commentary Appendix Page 8 of 9 Commentor 12 - Elizabeth (Betty) Niemann Section 40.

I believe the President, the EPA, the DOE, Sen. Durbin, the IL State Legislature, the ICC, and IPA , not to mention the motley Consortium, are utterly deaf to any and all reasoned dissent, and with low regard for ethics. This admitted experiment would be performed on some of our country's most valuable, precious, and dwindling farmland. Opposition by several of the land owners &/or heirs to the land under which the CCS would occur has been stated time and again, but by and large without willingness by any government official to consider the facts and the possible irretrievable and irrevocable consequences of CCS. FutureGen has supposedly established an insurance policy of sorts in the event of damage to the land &/or its inhabitants?, should the project proceed, but coverage amounts and payment terms etc. remain vague, and could not restore the land to its former productive state. I also believe the greater Morgan County community has been duped by promises of vastly increasing employment numbers. The FutureGen Consortium does not yet have its ducks in a row, all the while pretending everything is going smoothly. How many iterations of this Consortium have there been already? If none of the above mentioned government officials, nearly all of whom publicly declared support for the project before its efficacy was even explored, can afford the time or expend the effort to at least speak with and listen to the heirs of the surface and subsurface land involved, and who strongly oppose this project, it speaks volumes. More pork please? FutureGen 2.0 was roundly dismissed from their first chosen (Alexander, IL) site by local landowners. After having then promised to leave Morgan County, they instead subsequently and immediately moved north a few miles in the County, to where much of the current site is controlled by a local bank, which I and others believe is ethically challenged. It is the trustee for the heirs who oppose the project, but continues to ignore their expressed wishes in opposing the CCS project, thereby creating an uneasy relationship, stated in the best terms. But how many government officials know this, or even care? I've seen no hands. In the name of our disappearing farmland and all that it means to present and future generations of local farmers and citizens, I implore the EPA and DOE, DO NOT approve and allow this project to move forward. Respectfully submitted, Marilyn Schutt 13-01 Thank you for your comment. In accordance with your request, DOE has included your comment here stating your opposition to the project. With respect to your question about an insurance policy to pay for potential damages, as explained in response to Comment 1208, the Alliance would be responsible for any emergency or remedial actions that would be necessary in accordance with the Post-Injection Site Care and Site Closure Plan, which is a requirement of the UIC Class VI permit for the injection wells. Section 9.0 (Financial Responsibility) of documentation submitted for the permit applications describes the Alliance’s proposed CO2 Storage Trust Fund and third party insurance policy. 13-01 1 Commentor 14 - Jeffrey Niemann Further Comments on DOE/EIS‐0460D Draft Environmental Impact Statement for FutureGen 2.0 By Jeffrey Niemann An Inconvenient Truth: Global Warming is Not Real New data shows that in fact the Earth has not warmed at all over the last 15 years.  In fact the Daily Mail reports that the Met Office and the University of East Anglia Climatic Research Unit, after taking data from nearly 30,000 stations around the world, have found that the earth stopped warming in 1997. The Sun is the main driver of climate change. Carbon Dioxide has nominal impact on temperature. Carbon dioxide is plant food. CO2 emissions increase crop yields and the forest's productivity. There are no harmful effects. If CO2 has been proven not to be a Greenhouse Gas associated with global warming, then why is there a 1.3 to 4 billion expenditure on carbon storage in Morgan County.  Likewise, ask why Canada has committed billions of dollars for carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions reduction to fight a problem that doesn’t exist.  CO2 emissions have only a tiny effect on temperature, but strongly enhance plant growth. Introduction As a Morgan County landowner, my wife and I are very concerned about the FutureGen 2.0 project. The following are quotes taken from a number of respected Climate professors and researches primarily from Canada and the United Kingdom. Six Things Everyone Should Know about Climate Change (from Friends of Science Website): While Friends of Science does not do any original scientific research, it does extensive literature research and draws on the worldwide body of work by scientists in all fields relating to global climate change. 1. The earth is cooling. 2. The Sun causes climate change. 3. Al Gore was wrong about CO2. 4. Violent weather isn’t getting worse. 5. It’s been hotter. 6. Climate computer models are proven wrong. 1. The Earth is Cooling: Page 1 of 9 14-01 On September 27, 2013 the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) issued a statement that the United States has joined other member nations of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in approving the Fifth IPCC Working Group Report on the Physical Science Basis of Climate Change. In that statement, OSTP Director John P. Holdren acknowledged that the report “reflects a further strengthening of the already robust scientific consensus that the Earth’s climate is changing in ways not explainable by natural variability and that the primary cause is emission of heat-trapping substances by human activities.” Consistent with DOE’s mission to assure America’s security and prosperity through energy and environmental technology solutions, DOE’s Office of Fossil Energy is committed to developing a portfolio of technologies that can capture and permanently store GHGs through ongoing research, development and demonstration projects. The FutureGen 2.0 Project is one of several large-scale demonstration projects that are intended to demonstrate the technical feasibility as well as provide accurate cost and performance data of carbon emission reducing technologies. The outcome of these efforts would provide technically viable and cost competitive options that would allow continued use of the nation’s plentiful and secure coal resources while greatly reducing CO2 emissions associated with today’s current coal utilization technologies. 14-01 Commentor 14 - Jeffrey Niemann The temperature changes of the lower troposphere from the surface up to about 8 km as determined from the average of two analyses of satellite data. The UAH analysis is from the University of Alabama in Huntsville and the RSS analysis is from Remote Sensing Systems. The two analyses use different methods to adjust for factors such as orbital decay and inter‐satellite difference. From January 2002 indicates a small declining trend. Surface temperature data is contaminated by the effects of urban development. The Sun's activity, which was increasing through most of the 20th century, has recently become quiet, causing a change of trend. The magnetic flux from the Sun reached a peak in 1991. The high magnetic flux reduces cloud cover and causes warming. Since then the Sun has become quiet, however it continues to cause warming for about a decade after its peak intensity due to the huge heat capacity of the oceans. So we expect the warming to peak at about 2002. The CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, as measured at Mauna Loa, Hawaii, is a ripple effect in that the CO2 curve is due to the seasonal changes in biomass. There is a far greater land area in the northern hemisphere than the south that is affected by seasons. During the Northern hemisphere summer there is a large uptake of CO2 from plants growing causing a drop in the atmospheric CO2 concentration. Cool periods in 1984 and 1992 were caused by the El Chichon and Pinatubo volcanic eruptions. The temperature spikes in 1998 and 2010 were cause by strong El Ninos, which are unrelated to global warming. 2. The Sun Causes Climate Change There is a correlation between the solar irradiance and the Northern Hemisphere temperatures since 1600. The temperatures to 1850 were derived from proxy records. The temperature curve , shown on the Friends of Science webpage, is from surface temperature records from 1850 to 1980, and from satellite lower troposphere records from 1980. The surface temperature record is contaminated by the effects of urban development. Black soot aerosols have contributed to a portion of the recent warming. Two solar irradiance proxy reconstructions are shown on the Friends of Science webpage. Note the table also shows low solar activity periods occurring during the Maunder Minimum (1645–1715, the Little Ice Age) and during the Dalton Minimum (1795–1825). 3. Al Gore was Wrong about Carbon Dioxide Al Gore presented graphs in the movie "An Inconvenient Truth" showing carbon dioxide (CO2) and temperature change from Antarctic Vostok ice core records as evidence that CO2 causes climate change. 14-01 con’t Page 2 of 9 Commentor 14 - Jeffrey Niemann But he got cause and effect reversed! The record actually shows that the CO2 increase lagged the warming by about 800 years. Temperature increases cause the oceans to expel CO2, increasing the CO2 content of the atmosphere. The ice core data proves that CO2 is not a primary climate driver. 4. Violent Weather Isn't Getting Worse Climate alarmists claim the global warming may increase severe weather events. There is absolutely no evidence of increasing severe storm events in the real world data. The Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) is the 2‐year running sum of the combination of hurricanes' intensity and longevity. Global hurricane activity declined to mid‐2012 to levels not seen since 1978. During the past 40 years, Global and Northern Hemisphere ACE undergoes significant variability but exhibits no significant statistical trend. The global 2013‐02 ACE was 62% of the 1998‐01 ACE. 5. It's Been Hotter Earth's climate has been hotter in the past. Millions of years ago, alligators lived in the Arctic, and palm trees grew in Alberta. Since the last ice age, temperatures were warmer during the Holocene Optimum when the great pyramids were built in Egypt, during the Roman Empire expansion and during the Medieval Warm Period. Climate always changes without any help from man. 6. Climate Computer Models Are Proven Wrong Global warming hysteria is based on climate computer models that don't work. If outgoing radiation from the atmosphere is reduced to less than the incoming radiation from the Sun, heat energy will accumulate in the climate system causing rising temperatures. The models assume CO2 emissions will cause water vapour, the strongest greenhouse gas, to increase in the upper atmosphere, trapping the radiation. They also assume clouds will trap more radiation. But satellite and weather balloon data shows just the opposite of the climate model predictions. Earth Radiation Budget Experiment Satellite (ERBE) observed that more outgoing radiation escapes to space as temperatures rise, rather than being trapped as the UN computer modellers believe. CO2 emissions do not trap much heat and do not cause significant global warming. 14-01 con’t Page 3 of 9 Commentor 14 - Jeffrey Niemann The predicted hot‐spot is entirely absent from the observational record. This shows that most of the global temperature change cannot be attributed to increasing CO2 concentrations. The models fail because they assume both water vapour and clouds strongly increase the CO2 induced temperature changes, whereas recent research shows both water vapour and clouds greatly reduce the temperature changes. The climate models exhibit wildly different trends, with the deep ocean cooling just as often as warming. The Levitus actual observations were made to a depth of 700 m. Most of the models produce too much warming in the layer to 700 m. Many models produce unexpected ocean cooling below 100 m while the surface warms. None of the models even remotely match the Levitus observations. In conclusion, the flowing is a list of the 10 myths of global warming. Please look at each and the associated facts of each to gain a better understanding of CO2 and global warming: TEN MYTHS of Global Warming MYTH 1: Global temperatures are rising at a rapid, unprecedented rate. FACT: Accurate satellite, balloon and mountain top observations made over the last three decades have not shown any significant change in the long term rate of increase in global temperatures. Average ground station readings do show a mild warming of 0.6 to 0.8Cover the last 100 years, which is well within the natural variations recorded in the last millennium. The ground station network suffers from an uneven distribution across the globe; the stations are preferentially located in growing urban and industrial areas ("heat islands"), which show substantially higher readings than adjacent rural areas ("land use effects").  There has been no catastrophic warming recorded. MYTH 2: The "hockey stick" graph proves that the earth has experienced a steady, very gradual temperature increase for 1000 years, then recently began a sudden increase. FACT: Significant changes in climate have continually occurred throughout geologic time. For instance, the Medieval Warm Period, from around 1000 to1200 AD (when the Vikings farmed on Greenland) was followed by a period known as the Little Ice Age. Since the end of the 17th Century the "average global temperature" has been rising at the low steady rate mentioned above; although from 1940 – 1970 temperatures actually dropped, leading to a Global Cooling scare.  14-01 con’t Page 4 of 9 Commentor 14 - Jeffrey Niemann The "hockey stick", a poster boy of both the UN's IPCC and Canada's Environment Department, ignores historical recorded climatic swings, and has now also been proven to be flawed and statistically unreliable as well. It is a computer construct and a faulty one at that. MYTH 3: Human produced carbon dioxide has increased over the last 100 years, adding to the Greenhouse effect, thus warming the earth. FACT: Carbon dioxide levels have indeed changed for various reasons, human and otherwise, just as they have throughout geologic time. Since the beginning of the industrial revolution, the CO2 content of the atmosphere has increased. The RATE of growth during this period has also increased from about 0.2% per year to the present rate of about 0.4% per year,which growth rate has now been constant for the past 25 years. However, there is no proof that CO2 is the main driver of global warming. As measured in ice cores dated over many thousands of years, CO2 levels move up and down AFTER the temperature has done so, and thus are the RESULT OF, NOT THE CAUSE of warming. Geological field work in recent sediments confirms this causal relationship. There is solid evidence that, as temperatures move up and down naturally and cyclically through solar radiation, orbital and galactic influences, the warming surface layers of the earth's oceans expel more CO2 as a result. MYTH 4: CO2 is the most common greenhouse gas. 14-01 con’t FACT: Greenhouse gases form about 3 % of the atmosphere by volume. They consist of varying amounts, (about 97%) of water vapor and clouds, with the remainder being gases like CO2, CH4, Ozone and N2O, of which carbon dioxide is the largest amount. Hence, CO2 constitutes about 0.037% of the atmosphere. While the minor gases are more effective as "greenhouse agents" than water vapor and clouds, the latter are overwhelming the effect by their sheer volume and – in the end – are thought to be responsible for 60% of the "Greenhouse effect". Those attributing climate change to CO2 rarely mention this important fact.  MYTH 5: Computer models verify that CO2 increases will cause significant global warming. FACT: Computer models can be made to "verify" anything by changing some of the 5 million input parameters or any of a multitude of negative and positive feedbacks in the program used.. They do not "prove" anything. Also, computer models predicting global warming are incapable of properly including the effects of the sun, cosmic rays and the clouds. The sun is a major cause of temperature variation on the earth surface as its received radiation changes all the time, This happens largely in cyclical fashion. The number and the lengths in time of sunspots can be correlated very closely with average temperatures on earth, e.g. the Little Ice Age and the Medieval Warm Period. Varying intensity of solar heat radiation affects the surface temperature of the oceans and the currents. Warmer ocean water expels gases, some of which are CO2. Solar Page 5 of 9 Commentor 14 - Jeffrey Niemann radiation interferes with the cosmic ray flux, thus influencing the amount ionized nuclei which control cloud cover. MYTH 6: The UN proved that man–made CO2 causes global warming. FACT: In a 1996 report by the UN on global warming, two statements were deleted from the final draft. Here they are: 1) “None of the studies cited above has shown clear evidence that we can attribute the observed climate changes to increases in greenhouse gases.” 2) “No study to date has positively attributed all or part of the climate change to man–made causes” To the present day there is still no scientific proof that man-made CO2 causes significant global warming.  MYTH 7: CO2 is a pollutant. FACT: This is absolutely not true. Nitrogen forms 80% of our atmosphere. We could not live in 100% nitrogen either. Carbon dioxide is no more a pollutant than nitrogen is. CO2 is essential to life on earth. It is necessary for plant growth since increased CO2 intake as a result of increased 14-01 atmospheric concentration causes many trees and other plants to grow more vigorously. con’t Unfortunately, the Canadian Government has included CO2 with a number of truly toxic and noxious substances listed by the Environmental Protection Act, only as their means to politically control it. MYTH 8: Global warming will cause more storms and other weather extremes. FACT: There is no scientific or statistical evidence whatsoever that supports such claims on a global scale. Regional variations may occur. Growing insurance and infrastructure repair costs, particularly in coastal areas, are sometimes claimed to be the result of increasing frequency and severity of storms, whereas in reality they are a function of increasing population density, escalating development value, and ever more media reporting. MYTH 9: Receding glaciers and the calving of ice shelves are proof of global warming. FACT: Glaciers have been receding and growing cyclically for hundreds of years. Recent glacier melting is a consequence of coming out of the very cool period of the Little Ice Age. Ice shelves have been breaking off for centuries. Scientists know of at least 33 periods of glaciers growing and then retreating. It’s normal. Besides, glacier's health is dependent as much on precipitation as on temperature. Page 6 of 9 Commentor 14 - Jeffrey Niemann MYTH 10: The earth’s poles are warming; polar ice caps are breaking up and melting and the sea level rising. FACT: The earth is variable. The western Arctic may be getting somewhat warmer, due to unrelated cyclic events in the Pacific Ocean, but the Eastern Arctic and Greenland are getting colder. The small Palmer Peninsula of Antarctica is getting warmer, while the main Antarctic continent is actually cooling. Ice thicknesses are increasing both on Greenland and in Antarctica. Sea level monitoring in the Pacific (Tuvalu) and Indian Oceans (Maldives) has shown no sign of any sea level rise. Source: Friends of Science website. Is Carbon Capture a Scam? The Kyoto Protocol is a political solution to a non‐existent problem without scientific justification. Dr. Timothy Ball, a former climatology professor. The Alberta Surface Rights group has this to say about Carbon Capture (http://www.albertasurfacerights.com/articles/?id=1479 ): (a)It has neverworkedonany kind of commercialscale. (b) It was incredibly expensive and would require massive amounts of government money. (c) It was necessary to steal private property. (d) Safe sequestration and liability issues would last for hundreds, if not thousands of years.

What can I say, this comment says it all. Consensus is the business of politics. If it’s concensus, it isn’t science. If it’s science, it isn’t consensus. Period. Michael Crichton. Addendum of further Comments: During the Public Scoping meeting in June of 2011, I indicated that the number of new jobs and influx into Morgan County would not be as publicized in the media. The current numbers from the EIS‐460D is 780 for construction and 158 permanent operational jobs for the entire project. It must be emphasized that construction workers must be transient workers hired for a shor period of time. For example, the iron worker will only be on site for the raising of the structure and vessels. Once that is completed, these people will no longer be needed nor counted. Furthermore, they most likely will come from areas outside of Morgan County. While the numbers seem to be large, they will be a lot less but spread out over the entire project. Therefore the impact on the local economy will minimal at best. Based upon my own experience , I have felt that the operation of such a small plant (injection well) will most likely consist of one board man, one inside operator, and two to three inside operators per 4 shifts to give 24/7 coverage. Along with that I have no further knowledge of the staffing of the Meredosia Energy Center. Regarding training and laboratory services, there should not be a need to staff support people for all three project disciplines, the Meredosia Energy Center, the pipeline, or the injection well. Prior to startup, experienced operators will be brought in to work with the design engineers to commission the Meredosia Energy Center. As experienced operators are brought in, it will not be necessary to set up a curriculum to train operators. Likewise, onsite testing will be simple tests that can be performed by the outside operators. Anymore detailed testing should be performed at a certified laboratory or the experienced ADM plant in Decatur. As far as people coming to see the plant, there will be nothing to see of interest as this is a closed system and the possibility of a CO2 incident will keep non‐production personnel at a distance. Therefore there will be no need to increase the community infrastructure of hotels, restaurants, and buses to the Meredosia Energy Center or the injection well head. Page 8 of 9 14-03 The Draft EIS described the construction workforce for the oxycombustion facility at the Meredosia Energy Center in Section 14-02 2.4.3.3 and the operational workforce for the facility in Section con’t 2.4.4.1. The workforce requirements for construction of the CO2 pipeline are described in Section 2.5.1.3, and for construction of the CO2 storage surface facilities in Section 2.5.2.2. The operational workforce requirements for both the pipeline and CO2 injection wells are described in Section 2.5.2.2. The Draft EIS described the potential impacts on the local economy and employment from construction for the FutureGen 2.0 Project in Section 3.18.3.1 and for operations in Section 3.18.3.2. DOE believes that this analysis outlines the potential effects on primary and secondary employment in Morgan County appropriately and fairly. 14-03 Commentor 14 - Jeffrey Niemann Other plants utilizing the oxy‐combustion process already online or will be commissioned prior to the Morgan County facility. I had a friend review the entire EIS‐0460D. On the construction of the Meredosia Energy Center, he first noted that there were no calculations to show justification of material purchases for the project. Taking what little information that was provided in the EIS, he concluded that the compressors are undersized such that in an emergency they would not be able to prevent a gas/liquid multiphase mix in the pipeline. This will damage and destroy the compressor as well as valves, pumps, and instrumentation. With the loss of instrumentation, the operators will be unable to react in a proper time interval to save any of the equipment. A Worse case scenario will result in a large discharge of CO2 in the plant area. I personally saw a fire pump where I formerly worked that was improperly started that resulted in a liquid/gas multiphase tearing itself apart in a matter of minutes. The fire pump had to be completely rebuilt at considerable cost. At the Meredosia Energy Center, it further appears that the backup generator is not sufficient enough to carry a loss of power to the control room. The backup generator for the injection well control room should also be re‐evaluated to insure that it can handle the instrumentation load in a loss of power. In summary, there is no valid reason for this project to go forward for the flowing reasons: 1. It is unjustified in light of the current research on global warming. 2. It is not needed, not cost effective or energy efficient with its large energy penalty in power generation. 3. Has a great potential to cause permanent damage to farmland. 4. Will not give the community the promised economic impacts. 5. Will cause a rise in consumer electrical rates to the entire customer base in Illinois and place a burden on low income families. 14-04 Issues expressed in this comment have been addressed in the 14-03 response to Comment 12-28. con’t 14-05 Thank you for your comment. 14-04 14-05 Page 9 of 9 Commentor 15 - Elizabeth (Betty) Niemann Third Set of Comments on FutureGen 2.0 DOE/EIS-0460 By Elizabeth (Betty) Niemann By the way, an announcement about the 21 May 2013 meeting was published in the Springfield Journal Register. (http://www.sj-r.com/breaking/x1338686880/FutureGen-2-0-meetingTuesday-in-Jacksonville#axzz2XFclve67) The meeting was called a “public information” meeting.  In my opinion, this was a turn off as so much has been published about the FutureGen project, why would people go to another public information meeting? Nowhere in the announcement did it say that the FutureGen DOE meeting was a public hearing and that people could make comments. Therefore, I feel that residents in eastern Morgan County and residents of Sangamon County were denied the privilege of having the opportunity to speak at the meeting. Who initiated the announcement? Was this a way to eliminate those who may have spoken out against the project? When I submitted my written comments on 17 June 2013, I indicated that there was some missing data for confirmation of my statements those in the written comments. This paper includes that data and some additional comments based upon recent happenings in the State of Illinois. I would also like to say again that these are my comments, opinions and questions.  Why is this EIS-0460 so riddled with lots of inconsistencies?  In my opinion, if these documents were a research paper for a college paper, the grade would have been an “F”.  How can the Department of Energy make a valid decision on whether or not the FutureGen project can be funded if there are inconsistencies, data omissions and invalid conclusions? The conceptual injection well layout does not transfer to the carbon storage area depicted on page 3.5-7 showing Figure 3.5-2: Shallow Ground Wells in the Underground Injection Control Survey or on Page G-2 of Volume II of the EIS-0460D, Figure 1: NEPA Study Area for the CO2 Storage Area. By the way, why is the acreage is this indicated NEPA Study Area identified as the Carbon Storage Area only 4982.96 acres instead of the 5300 acres as discussed in the EIS-0460D?  Where are the remaining 317.04 acres? During the public hearing on 21 May 2013, Ken Humphreys stated that there were 45 committed landowners within the carbon storage area.  I can identify a total of 39 landowners Third Set of Comments FutureGen 2.0 DOE/EIS-0460D Page 1 of 6 Page S-24 of the Summary shows the figure S-15 Monitoring Well Net Work Conceptual Layout. This figure also appears on page 2-69 in Volume 1. This layout contains 2 injection wells.  In my earlier additional written comments, I indicated that the EIS showed 4 wells from one injection site.  With this figure, will there be 8 injection wells, 4 each on two injection pads? I do not think the public is aware of the possible 8 wells. 15-01  DOE published appropriate notices in the Springfield State Journal  Register and the Jacksonville Journal-Courier, which announced  the “Public Hearing” for the FutureGen 2.0 Draft EIS on Sundays,  May 5, 12, and 19; and Wednesdays, May 8 and 15; as well as  in the Illinois Farm Week, on Mondays May 6, 13, and 20. The  “announcement” noted in this comment was a news article published  by the newspaper staff which did not originate from DOE, nor did  DOE otherwise participate in its publication.  15-01  15-02  As explained in Section 2.5.2.2 of the Draft EIS, the Alliance considered two alternative scenarios for the injection well surface  facilities: a dual-site scenario with a single vertically drilled well  at each site or a single-site scenario with four horizontally drilled  wells at one site. Figures 2-22 and 2-23 in the Draft EIS show the  conceptual site layouts for the primary and secondary injection well  sites, respectively, in the dual-site scenario. The conceptual site  layout for the single-site scenario would include all four wells at  the single site with no secondary site required (see Figure 2-21).  Only one of the two scenarios would be selected by the Alliance.  As further explained in Section 2.5.2.3 of the Draft EIS, the Alliance  prefers the single-site scenario including four horizontal wells that  would produce a subsurface CO2 plume as described and illustrated  under subheading “Injection Wells” in the Final EIS. The Final EIS  has been updated with more recent data to reflect the Alliance’s  proposed single-site injection well approach.  Section 2.5.2 of the Draft EIS and the introduction to Chapter 3,  15-02  under the subheading “Injection Well Siting Options,” explain that the Alliance had not selected the exact locations of the injection  well site(s) within the borders of the CO2 storage study area when  the Draft EIS was published. Therefore, the site(s) could not be  illustrated on Figure 3.5-2 of the Draft EIS. The Final EIS has been  updated to show the location of the proposed single injection well  site on the revised version of this figure.  As explained in Section 2.5.2.3 of the Draft EIS, the subsurface extent  of the modeled CO2 plume would reach an estimated 4,000 acres  after 20 years of injection. The Alliance conservatively estimated that  the subsurface CO2 plume could occupy approximately 4,000 acres  in its UIC permit applications. The land area estimate of 5,300 acres  stated in Section 2.5.2 of the Draft EIS was based on the ownership  of surface land parcels potentially affected within the CO2 storage  15-03  study area. The Alliance has expanded the surface land extent for  the CO2 storage study area to 6,800 acres as explained in Section  2.5.2 of the Final EIS to ensure that all properties affected by the  need for subsurface pore space are encompassed. Note, however,  Commentor 15 - Elizabeth (Betty) Niemann of record within the carbon storage area within the NEPA Study Area of which 38 have committed by enthusiasm or by the pressure of inevitability. Can and will there be a landowners poll to see which were pressured or felt that they had to sign because it was inevitable that the project was going to happen since two big (by number of acres) landowners had committed to the project? The outlined NEPA carbon storage area constitutes a total of 88 parcels of land, two of which have not committed to the project. Why is FutureGen not forthcoming in releasing the landowners who have committed? Is this because FutureGen has created “the end of county” or because they really do not have all 45 landowners committed? Why is FutureGen afraid to release the names of the committed landowners?  FutureGen does not freely volunteer information. To me, they are really guarded in what they publish. Also, since the public comment deadline of 17 June 2013 has passed, Governor Quinn of Illinois has passed SB1715 which is now Public Act 98-0022 on Hydraulic Fracking. (http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/publicacts/98/PDF/098-0022.pdf ) Contained within the 123 pages of the bill are restrictions on horizontal drilling permitting. Since this is a new bill, will the FutureGen Alliance have to comply with any of the provisions of the new bill for the FutureGen project?  If Yes, which ones?  Yes, I know that carbon sequestration is not fracking. The FutureGen project will be performing horizontal drilling into the injection interval of Mt. Simon layer 11. In addition to the above new law, Tenaska Inc. pulled the plug on the Taylorville Energy Center (http://www.sj-r.com/breaking/x1292456584/Developer-pulls-plug-on-Taylorville-EnergyCenter#axzz2X9gnGyiG ) and (http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20130621/NEWS11/130629932/its-official-tenaskacoal-plant-is-kaput).  This Taylorville project was to cost an estimated S3.5 billion.  As stated in my written submitted comments, Exelon Corp. in its letter to Senator Durbin on why it pulled out of the FutureGen Alliance estimated that with FutureGen’s power purchase agreement, the consumers of Illinois would be paying $150 million per year and for the life of the project, the consumers would be paying S3 billion PLUS the $1 million equals about $4 billion for the costs to the DOE (federal taxpayer) plus the Illinois rate players.  There is another estimated cost of $65 million from FutureGen bringing the total to and estimated $4.65 billion. ARE these cost estimates valid estimations of project costs for FutureGen? Are there other potential carbon storage projects within the United States or world that have been cancelled or tabled? Was the cancelling due to rising costs and/or lack of support? Can the reasons for the cancelled projects be applied to FutureGen to assess reasons for not continuing with the project? Tenaska was looking for a 30 year power purchase agreement with the state requiring customers and competitive power suppliers paying the costs. With the Illinois Rivers Project tapping into the rate cap along with FutureGen and other energy related projects throughout Illinois, the impact to the Illinois energy consumer would be at the max. Again why wasn’t the economic impact of increased power rates to Illinois power consumers especially those in Morgan County addressed in the EIS? Third Set of Comments FutureGen 2.0 DOE/EIS-0460D Page 2 of 6 that the surface acreage requirements relate to the anticipated  extent of the subsurface CO2 plume to be contained with the Mt.  Simon Formation and confined by the Eau Claire Formation more  15-03  than 3,900 feet below the land surface. Surface land requirements would be limited to the site for the injection well facilities and access  con’t  road as discussed in Chapter 2.  15-03  As stated at the end of Section 2.5.2.1 in the Draft EIS, “The  Alliance is currently entering into agreements with property owners  regarding the use of and appropriate compensation for surface land  and subsurface pore space.” DOE is not an active participant in this  process  15-04  CO2 injection into geologic formations for the purpose of geologic  storage is not the same process as hydraulic fracturing for natural  15-04  gas production and would not be subject to the legislation discussed  in this comment. There are no plans to use hydraulic fracturing at  any time during well construction, including horizontal wells, and  no efforts are intended to use hydraulic fracturing to increase the  permeability within the Mt. Simon Formation.  15-05  DOE’s decision with respect to the proposed action is whether or  not to provide $1 billion in funding under the American Recovery  and Reinvestment Act for the implementation of the FutureGen 2.0  Project as stated in the Cover Sheet, the Summary, and Sections 1.3  and 2.1 of the Draft EIS.  The responses to Comments 11-12 and 12-31 address the subject of  project costs.  With respect to the comment relating to other CO2 storage projects,  DOE tracks the public status of Carbon Capture and Sequestration  15-05  projects through the National Carbon Sequestration Database and Geographic Information System database, which can be accessed  at http://www.natcarbviewer.com/.  The responses to Comments 10-01 and 11-13 address the subject of  monthly costs to ratepayers.  Commentor 15 - Elizabeth (Betty) Niemann By the way, in Volume II of the EIS-0460D, when it came to the Protected Species Survey, FutureGen had Patrick Engineering who contracted to Specialized Ecological Services in Greenville, Illinois, to perform the survey. Why didn’t FutureGen contract with Specialized Ecological Services directly? It states: “A survey for protected species and their critical habitat was conducted using best professional practice. Both the US Fish and Wildlife Service and Illinois Department of Natural Resources, Division of Ecosystems and Environment were contacted for a list of potential protected species. Based on this list, the flora and fauna of the proposed impact area were surveyed.” Patrick Engineering is an engineering firm whose expertise is in engineering not in plant and animal life, let alone, protected or endangered species.  Furthermore, in Volume II, FutureGen, itself, stated the impact conclusions (i.e. …therefore FutureGen concludes there will be little or no impact….) and not Specialized Ecological Services.  Therefore, this is not a valid survey. It is also not valid because it only looked for those upon the list, who knows, they might have missed a endangered or protected species new to the area. Why not have the US Fish and Wildlife and the Illinois Department of Natural Resources perform a second and more valid survey since both are familiar with the flora and fauna of Morgan County? Why didn’t Volume II include the Specialized Ecological Services actual report in Appendix E. Just getting a list and having someone check off the protected species is not a valid survey. By the way, shouldn’t surveys be made at several times during the year to rule out migratory impacts, temperature effects on invertebrates, and hibernation of mammal in the area of reviews? Will these evaluations meet the new ASTM E1527-13 Environment Assessment standard? If not, why not? If there are deficiencies in these evaluations or assessments not conforming to this new standard, should the assessments and surveys be redone or at least the deficiencies completed? Today, Sally Greensburg, of the Illinois State Geological Survey, returned my telephone call about a 2005 map on Illinois Saline Reservoirs for Potential CO2 Storage that was from the Midwest Geological Sequestration Consortium website in 2011. (Note: the map is no longer on the website and I made reference to it in my written comments submitted on the 17 June 2013.) When looking at the map on the computer screen, it appeared that there were no sites indicated for potential CO2 storage in Morgan County, Illinois. Upon on close examination and magnification of the map, there seemed to be a green dot indicating the Carbon Storage Potential Site in North East Morgan County, Illinois.  I called Sally Greensburg to confirm exact the location of this site. Sally indicated to me that the spot on the map in Morgan County was taken from well data in Morgan County. (By the way, why was this well not used in the carbon storage area characterization as well?  Instead, a well in Pike County was used which is over 30 miles away with a geologic structure of a river between the carbon storage site and the Pike County Well.) Third Set of Comments FutureGen 2.0 DOE/EIS-0460D Page 3 of 6 15-06  The Alliance directed its engineering contractor, Patrick Engineering,  to support the efforts needed for compliance with the Endangered  Species Act during project planning and to subcontract with a  specialized biological survey firm as appropriate to achieve this  objective. It is not uncommon and often customary for a project  proponent to have its principal engineering contractor handle  regulatory requirements through such subcontracting arrangements.  Because design engineering firms are not typically specialized in  such studies, they routinely subcontract to firms qualified in the area  of expertise. Federal agencies, including the USFWS for Endangered  Species Act compliance, often rely on the studies and documentation  completed by qualified firms to support an agency determination  whether a proposed action may affect protected species. DOE, as  15-06  the agency preparing the EIS, has the responsibility to coordinate  with the USFWS for compliance with the Endangered Species  Act, and DOE bears responsibility for the oversight of surveys and  assessments conducted by specialized firms in support of this  coordination. DOE included the appropriate supporting information  for compliance with the Endangered Species Act in Appendix E to  the Draft EIS, which has been updated as appropriate in the Final  EIS. As indicated by the comments on the Draft EIS submitted by  the USDOI (the parent department for the USFWS), and DOE’s  responses to those comments, the coordination between the  agencies for compliance with the Endangered Species Act would  continue during the FutureGen 2.0 Project.  15-07  Please see the response to Comment 12-03, which addresses the  same subject. Section 3.4.2.1 of the Draft EIS is intended as an  overview of the regional geologic setting. The site-specific information  for the Mt. Simon Formation is described in Section 3.4.2.4 of the  Draft EIS based on data from the stratigraphic well located within  the CO2 storage study area. For the UIC permit applications, the  Alliance reviewed the available information from previously drilled  15-07  wells in Illinois, including the Archer Daniels Midland carbon capture and sequestration wells.  The Alliance performed a two dimensional seismic survey through  the CO2 storage study area in January 2011, as described in Section  3.4.2.4 of the Draft EIS. The results of the seismic survey along  with the data collected from the stratigraphic well indicate that the  conditions at the selected injection well site are favorable for the  injection and storage of CO2. Images and more detailed results  from the seismic study were provided in the UIC permit applications  (posted at the USEPA UIC website: http://www.epa.gov/region5/  water/uic/futuregen/).  Commentor 15 - Elizabeth (Betty) Niemann Along with that, I asked Sally if there was seismic date to indicate such potential geologic Carbon Storage Site in Morgan County and she replied no.  The map then does not validate Morgan County as a potential geologic Carbon Storage Site nor has any Illinois State Geological Survey been made to that effect. She did indicate that FutureGen had done a seismic study. She did not know the results of the seismic study. Therefore, what are the results of the seismic study?  Do the results indicate that the proposed FutureGen Carbon Storage Area site is an excellent site for carbon storage or not? There should be an independent analysis of the geological and seismic data and the results given to the NEPA process and not FutureGen. I still have the same concerns and questions that I had in my written comments about the injection interval that Sally Greensburg was not able to answer them as she was not at her desk. The injection interval (Mt. Simon Layer 11) as indicated in the Table 7, pages 26 and 27 of Volume II of the EIS-0460D has a porosity of just over 20% and the permeabilities are higher than the other layers above or below layer 11. Yet the compressibility and grain density are like all the other layers in the Mt. Simon layer.  If the compressibility and the grain density are the same for all Mt. Simon layers, and only the porosity and permeabilities are different, could these numbers be incorrect?  I would call this a statistical anomaly. Given the importance of success of this project why not have independent geologists further re-evaluate Mt. Simon layer 11 to see if it is a statistical anomaly or the data in Table 7 for Layer 11 in the Mt. Simon layer is accurate? If the injection interval is only 7 meters thick with the stated porosity and permeabilities in Table 7, then when the supercritical CO2 is in fact injected into the injection interval will the CO2 find it difficult to spread into the above and below layers?  Given the buoyancy of the CO2, most likely the CO2 will spread upwards before it spreads downward. Could this be why the number of acres in the carbon storage area has increased? Is the Mt. Simon Layer and its injection interval of Mt. Simon Layer 11 capable of receiving 385 million gallons of supercritical CO2 per year for 20/30 years? Illinois River Project and FutureGen 2.0 Project At Odds with Each Other. One of the impact studies concerned the Illinois Rivers Project by Ameren Transmission Company. Landowners in the Carbon Storage Area are up in arms over this project as the 340Kv transmission line was going to traverse some of the same landowners impacted by the carbon storage area and FutureGen’s pipeline (northern route).  Starting in the summer of 2012, FutureGen announced in press releases it was contacting pipeline owners but not until March of 2013 did any landowners impacted by the pipeline receive any information on the pipeline from FutureGen.  One landowner I know received letters on the same day from both Ameren on the Illinois Rivers Project and on FutureGen’s pipeline indicating that his land had been selected by both projects. Ameren’s filing with the Illinois Commerce Commission was on 7 November 2012 and is docket number 12-0598.  http://www.icc.illinois.gov/docket/casedetails.aspx?no=12-0598 By clicking Third Set of Comments FutureGen 2.0 DOE/EIS-0460D Page 4 of 6 15-08  Sections 6.1 and 6.2 of Appendix G in the Final EIS, which include  Table 7, present the values and assumptions that were made  to construct the injection model of the subsurface CO2 plume, as  15-07  illustrated in Figure 2-26, “Predicted Areal Extent of CO2 Plume”  con’t  in Chapter 2 of the Final EIS. The model consists of stacked  hydrogeologic layers from the base of the Mt. Simon Formation  upward through the Franconia Dolomite Formation. Most of the  hydrogeologic properties illustrated in Table 7 for these model layers  were determined from the geophysical well logs and side-well cores  taken from the stratigraphic well. The values for compressibility  were estimated based on the results of other published studies  conducted on the geological formations that were modeled. The  values presented in Table 7 are consistent with other studies of the  Illinois Basin and within the range of other geological sequestration  projects (DOE 2008c; O’Connor and Rush 2005; Zhou et al. 2010;  Griffith et al. 2011).  Sedimentary bedrock is often not uniform in the vertical direction,  15-08  especially where deposits were laid by moving water, so each  formation was split into layers having similar lithology and physical  characteristics. However, grain density values have less vertical  variability than porosity and permeability. The injection zone  comprises the Mt. Simon Formation, which was subdivided into 17  model layers, and the Elmhurst member, which was subdivided into  7 model layers. The confining zone (Lombard and Proviso members  of the Eau Claire Formation) was subdivided into a total of 19 layers.  Additional formations above the Eau Claire were also subdivided  and included in the model.  The differences of the hydrogeologic property values in Table 7 are  based on how each property was measured. Formation properties  that can only be calculated in the laboratory from cores will have  fewer data points than properties that can be measured in the field  using continuous measuring techniques (e.g., wireline sampling).  The porosity and horizontal permeability measurements were  15-09  taken from wireline surveys of the stratigraphic well and calibrated with laboratory measurements of side wall cores and core plugs  from selected portions of the Mt. Simon Formation. The vertical  permeability was measured from matching core plugs and using  lithology-specific data from larger studies to apply to the known  lithology changes. The grain density values were measured in the  laboratory from side wall cores taken from the stratigraphic well  and averaged for each formation. Two values were provided for the  Proviso member of the Eau Claire because it has a slightly different  lithology between the upper and lower portions of the member.  Commentor 15 - Elizabeth (Betty) Niemann on the Documents on the webpage, a complete listing of documents comes up with links to click to see the document. FutureGen, despite 3 public informational meetings held in Jacksonville as well as other places, was not aware of the Illinois River Project and the routing of the transmission line.  When made aware of the impact of the Illinois River Project on the carbon storage area, on 21 November 2012 , FutureGen filed to Intervene in this case and the Administrative Law Judge approved the intervention on 3 December 2012. On 28 December 2012, FutureGen then filed “Identification of Alternative Route, in which the Alliance objected to ATXI’s Primary Route, and instead stated a preference for ATXI’s Alternate Route.” Landowners formed a loose knit organization called the Morgan and Sangamon County Landowners and Tenant Farmers or MSCLTF to fight the transmission line and filed as an intervener on 30 November 2012. http://www.icc.illinois.gov/docket/files.aspx?no=120598&docId=190585 Note: two names on the list of members, the Beilschmidt Trust and Bob Talkemeyer have since been removed as their names were included in error. The Motion to remove the names was made on 10 December 2012 http://www.icc.illinois.gov/docket/files.aspx?no=12-0598&docId=190962 and granting of motion by the Administrative Law Judge on 20 December 2012. The FutureGen Alliance filed its Application for Certification to Construct and Operate a Carbon Dioxide Pipeline with the Commission on 29 March 2013 and is Illinois Commerce Commission Docket No. 13-0252. http://www.icc.illinois.gov/docket/Documents.aspx?no=13-0252 The Alliance’s Application is pending. A summary of the actions of FutureGen and the MSCLTF can be found on the latest filing by FutureGen on 10 June 2013 in the Reply to Brief. http://www.icc.illinois.gov/docket/files.aspx?no=12-0598&docId=199315 All of this can be traced through the documents for docket 12-0598. Using the dates referenced in the document, the rest of the documents can be located on the document page. I want to know if FutureGen and the MSCLTF, the carbon storage area and pipeline landowners impacted by the transmission line, made some sort of hand shake agreement (because of the stipulation filings) NOT to oppose FutureGen. I believe this is why at the public hearing, there was only one person speaking in opposition of the FutureGen project. Is this activity a manipulation of those opposing the FutureGen project not to speak out by FutureGen?  Is this FutureGen’s way of  implying community support since there was limited opposition at the meeting FutureGen’s spin on this was that their “outreach” program must be working? Did FutureGen purposely use the same routing as Ameren’s 340 Kv transmission line since FutureGen filed its petition with the Illinois Commerce Commission 4 months after Ameren’s petition for its transmission line. FutureGen kept its route a secret until it filed its petition with the ICC when it had to reveal the route and identify landowners. Is this a ploy to manipulate opposing landowners in to “joining against a common enemy” so to speak in order for them not to speak out against FutureGen? Could the pipeline and transmission routing also be something a simple as looking at the land forms and finding the most direct and expedient Third Set of Comments FutureGen 2.0 DOE/EIS-0460D Page 5 of 6 The injection interval in Table 7 represents the vertical position within  the subsurface where the Alliance intends to inject CO2.

Discussion of the total impact of the Illinois Rivers Project on FutureGen 2.0 was glossed over in the EIS-0460D. This EIS-0460D is an evaluation of not only the suitability of a site for a project, but given processes of the project, it is also an evaluation of FutureGen as to its ability, given its completion of data or lack thereof, of taking the project to completion and with the least amount of environmental impact. Those who wrote this EIS, to me, were not drilling engineers, or reservoir engineers, nor had any equipment engineering in assessing what is needed for the project. In my opinion, the more in depth I read, the more I am convinced that the FutureGen Alliance does not have the scientific methodology for Carbon Storage, nor does it have expertise on a commercial scale in operating any kind of power generating unit, pipeline construction and control, and commercial scale underground injection given its inconsistencies in project details. Does FutureGen really know how to operate any kind of power generating unit on a commercial scale; how to construct and operate a pipeline; and most important of all, perform commercial scale underground injection?  If the answer is no, then the DOE should cease funding this project and the project should not continue with funding from Illinois consumers with increased electric rates. 15-09 con’t  the CO2 pipeline and storage facilities, and there is potential for construction of the two projects to interfere with each other. The pipeline must, of necessity, link the energy center to the injection  well sites. The transmission line would pass from the energy center  east across Morgan County and coincidently would cross the CO2  storage study area. The transmission line was sited after, not before,  the Alliance selected its storage study area. While the Alliance is part  of the Illinois Commerce Commission proceedings and is opposing  a segment of the Ameren transmission line, the Alliance has worked  15-10  collaboratively with Ameren to resolve multiple conflicts between the  transmission line and pipeline (some near the injection well sites as  part of Illinois Commerce Commission proceedings and some near  the energy center prior to the start of the proceedings).  The Alliance announced its CO2 pipeline route in a manner  consistent with federal law, as specified in the Uniform Relocation  Act. The Alliance identified its proposed pipeline route based on  constructability, minimizing impacts on landowners, access to rights of-way, and the desire to avoid, to the extent possible, sensitive  environmental resources such as wetlands, cultural resources, forest  land, and threatened or endangered species and their habitats.  15-10  As explained in the response to Comment 12-28, the Alliance has  assembled a highly qualified team for the FutureGen 2.0 Project.  This team includes all the necessary technical disciplines and  professionals needed for this effort, including professional engineers,  geologists, and various industry experts, who would be responsible  to ensure conformance with accepted engineering standards and  regulatory requirements. DOE considers the information provided  in Chapter 2 of the Draft EIS about project features and conditions  to be appropriate for conformance with the intent of NEPA and to  support the decisions DOE will make with respect to the proposed  action.  Third Set of Comments FutureGen 2.0 DOE/EIS-0460D Page 6 of 6 Commentor 15 - Elizabeth (Betty) Niemann General Review Comments Future Gen 2.0 Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DOE/EIS-0460D) Introduction: The following series of collected comments are those of the writer. They were made after reading all plus 1000 pages of the subject draft EIS for Future Gen.  Future Gen is a proposed Morgan County Illinois carbon dioxide sequestration demonstration project. The goal is the capture of carbon dioxide products from the coal fired generation of electricity converting the gas to a gas/liquid interphase and then injecting it for underground storage.  It is by definition a touchy feely program that is highly political. Geological/Formation Comments: The computer modeling shows a rather uniform plume pattern formed by the injected carbon dioxide into the Mount Simon aqueous brine sandstone formation.  This will not happen because the injected carbon dioxide will have various surface, electro- chemical and mechanical reactions etc. with the formation acidic saline brine. It will take the path of least resistance so the plume will be distorted.  The math algorithms in the simulations does not fully account for these physical phenomena at the 4500 foot injection lateral. Most data has been extrapolated from the gas storage wells and field in Illinois for this project. Gas has different properties than semi-liquid carbon dioxide.  You cannot just “plug and play the data” and say they are the same. The calculated and partially measured porosity of the Mount Simon injection zone is about 9.6 to 17.1 % on page 188 (3.4) and then given as 20% in the Geology Appendix G. Experience shows that porosity has a major impact on formation storage capacity and gas propagation.  This maybe a major cause of the expansion of the required storage field from 1000 to +5000 surface acres. The thickness of the injection lateral injection area is only 26-ft. from the casing in the Geo Appendix?? This is a very small area with a low 20% porosity…????? There is very little comment on local abandoned wells. They appear shallow and maybe plugged. Are they properly plugged and who will pay for this??? Equipment Comments Where is the basic equipment list for this project?? 1 15-11  15-11 15-12  Figure 2-26 of the Draft EIS has been updated in the Final EIS with a revised plume extent, as the model was refined in preparation for submission of the UIC permit applications. The figure shows an areal representation of the furthest extent that the CO2 plume would reach after 70 years, including 99 percent of the separate-phase (gas-phase) of CO2 mass. As discussed in the response to Comment 15-08, the plume model accounts for the different properties of the injection zone, and it included site- and project-specific data for each layer to ensure that the model accurately represents the Morgan County CO2 storage area. The injection wells would be perforated at about 4,030 feet bgs. The ranges of permeability and porosity have been updated in Section 3.4, Geology, of the Final EIS to match the measured data presented in the UIC permit applications and Appendix G of the Final EIS. The model does not rely solely on extrapolation of data from oil and gas wells; however, data from the surrounding area helps to support the measurements taken from the stratigraphic well (Griffith et al. 2011). A basic description of the oil and gas wells in the UIC survey area and their current status can be found in Table 3.4-1 of the Draft EIS. Information on the status of groundwater wells in the UIC survey area is presented in Section 3.5.2.3 of the Draft EIS. Please see the responses to Comments 12-20 and 12-21 for further information on this subject. The specific data requested in this comment pertain to aspects of the detailed design that are beyond the scope of an EIS to provide. Please see DOE’s response to Comment 12-28.  15-12  Commentor 15 - Elizabeth (Betty) Niemann Where are the supporting calculations for equipment sizing?? Discussion on this area of the project is missing?? A 710 BHP motor driver for the injection pumps is not logical.   There are 700, 750, 800 BHP etc. sized standard motors but a 710 BHP motor would be a very expensive and unique item.   It appears that the true motor size is 850 BHP or so for each injection pump to maintain the required pressure of 1200 psi minimum at the given required injection rates.  The motor should be sized larger so it will run cooler, and able to respond to its variable speed drive requirements without bogging down. If pressure drops below 1200 psi you will have a state of multi-phase flow. This is dangerous to equipment and can cause catastrophic equipment failure at these pressures. False instrument readings will occur and bad things happen. Has anyone considered this in the evaluation??? Utilities: Only six (6) hours of UPS power in an emergency for instrumentation.  Per code a 24-hour backup UPS is required on all critical instrumentation.   Then there is an emergency generator that is sized for 150% of normal load and a seven (7) day run time. Who will pay for the new required substation, transmission lines, 4160 VAC or 13.8 KV motor supply? The local population should not have to pay for these project infrastructure upgrades.  This is not mentioned in the documentation.  IEEE and API guidelines are never mentioned and they have major cost effects. The loads on the roads will easily be 100 tons for the deep drilling equipment.  Just the draw-works for the rig will run +90 tons before adding in the special truck.  Who is going to pay for this??? Initial water for drilling and fracturing the well laterals should be considered. It could be as high as half a million gallon.  The local supply and disposal of the fluids is a logics issue not mentioned. By the way, what is the overall effect on the new boilers etc. thermal plant performance efficiency? The current plant HHV net efficiency is about 21.5%. What is the new value factoring in carbon capture and sequestration? The efficiency will go down because there is more load.  How far down did it go? Are there any mass and heat calculations on overall energy efficiencies of the project for review?? Pipe Line Comments: What standards are being followed for design and construction? This is high pressure line pipe requiring special fittings, valves, welding procedures etc. for a safe installation.  The delivery of these items is very long.   Where is the basic project overall schedule and basic budget estimate. Normally pipe is buried 8-10 feet below the surface in 2013 high pressure installations.  Five feet is too close to the surface and raises the probability of damage in future earth moving actions on the farms etc.  This should be considered in budgeting etc. 2 Section 3.15 needs revision.  It should reflect power calculations and a true load study for the project. 15-12 con’t  15-13 15-14 15-15 15-16  The responses to Comments 12-24 and 12-29 are applicable to the subjects of this comment.

Please see the response to Comment 12-11 regarding energy efficiency and losses of the FutureGen 2.0 Project. The CO2 pipeline design is described in Section 2.5.1.2 of the Draft EIS, and construction is described in Section 2.5.1.3. These sections have been refined and updated as appropriate in the Final EIS.

It will be a hundred (100-ft) feet wide in actuality when built.  Report: If a drilling engineer, reservoir engineer, and equipment engineer would have been involved in the various sections, the writing would be more specific and direct.  Many ambiguities would not be present. The areas on the specific environmental issues were thoughtful and detailed.

The Draft EIS describes DOE’s coordination to date with USFWS for compliance with the Endangered Species Act and the analysis of potential impacts in Section 3.8, Biological Resources, under several subheadings titled “Protected Species.” The response to Comment 15-06 also addresses the subject of protected species. The Final EIS has been updated to reflect current developments.  15-17  3 Commentor 16 - Betty Niemann From: Sent: To: Subject: Importance: High Cliff, Don't know if you have seen this. http://www.epa.gov/region5/water/uic/futuregen/ Further down the page is a pdf of the application. Interesting reading, expecially on the insurance coverage. As I interpret it, the coverage, if granted for the start up, can be withdrawn (not renewed) after a period of 5 years. This goes byond the DOE's involvement period. If there is no insurance, then what impact will this have on the project, and the financial burden to the rate payers of Morgan County and Illinois citizens? Thanks, Betty Niemann 16-01 Under Financial Responsibility in 40 CFR 146.85, the UIC regulations specifically require that the owner or operator of the injection facility must demonstrate and maintain financial responsibility as determined by the Director of the USEPA UIC Program. The supporting documentation for the Alliance’s UIC permit applications (posted at the USEPA UIC website: http://www.epa.gov/region5/ water/uic/futuregen/) states under Section 9.4.2.5, Renewal, that the insurance market will not guarantee renewal of a policy after the initial 3- to 5-year term at the present time. However, third-party insurance is only one of several financial instruments listed as qualifying under the UIC regulations, and permit applicants may use multiple instruments. The Alliance has also proposed a trust 16-01 fund as described in Section 9.3 of the UIC permit applications. The information included in Section 9.0 (Financial Responsibility) of the permit application documentation is intended to meet the requirements of the UIC regulations for approval of the Class VI permits. The Director of the USEPA UIC Program has the authority and responsibility to make the final determination whether the requirements have been satisfied before issuing the permits. 1 APPENDIX I3 DOE’S NOTICE OF AVAILABILITY INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK 26004 Federal Register / Vol. 78, No. 86 / Friday, May 3, 2013 / Notices consistent with its approved application and budget.

You may also call Ms. Borgstrom at (800) 472–2756. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: DOE proposes to provide financial assistance (approximately $1 billion), through two cooperative agreements, to the Alliance for its proposed FutureGen 2.0 Project. FutureGen 2.0 is a public-private partnership formed for the purpose of developing and sharing the cost of the world’s first commercial-scale oxy- combustion electricity generation plant integrated with carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and storage. Babcock & Wilcox Power Generation Group, Inc. and Air Liquide Process and Construction, Inc., among others, would participate in the project by supplying technology, major components, and construction services. The project would use oxy- combustion technology to generate electric power and would capture CO2 for permanent storage underground. The plant would generate 168 megawatts (MW) (gross) of electricity. The Alliance would design and construct the plant to capture at least 90 percent of the CO2 generated (up to 98 percent could be captured). Captured CO2 would be transported through a 30-mile pipeline to a facility where it would be injected into the Mount Simon formation for permanent storage. This saline rock formation is approximately 4,000–4,500 feet below ground. The project would be designed to capture, transport, and inject approximately 1.1 million metric tons of CO2 annually, or a total of approximately 33 million metric tons over 30 years of operation. The Alliance would also construct and operate a visitor and research center and training facilities related to carbon capture and storage in the vicinity of Jacksonville, Illinois. The DOE-funded demonstration period would last for 56 months, from the start of operations (July 2017) through February 2022, but the plant is expected to continue commercial operations after this date. The oxy-combustion plant would be built on a 263-acre existing power plant site in Morgan County, Illinois, approximately one mile south of the Village of Meredosia. Ameren Energy Resources (Ameren) has agreed to sell to the Alliance the assets at the Meredosia Energy Center that are necessary for the FutureGen 2.0 Project. These assets include Unit 4, which was constructed in 1975. The Unit 4 steam turbine, material and fuel handling facilities, process water sources, cooling systems, high-voltage interconnection lines, and certain other facilities would be used for the new plant. Ameren would continue to own the three other electricity generation units at the Meredosia Energy Center. Operation of these units has been suspended since 2011. The CO2 storage site would be located 30 miles east of the plant site, on the eastern side of Morgan County. A new 12-inch diameter pipeline would be sited and constructed using an 80-foot construction right-of-way and a 50-foot permanent right-of-way. The Alliance has identified two possible routes for the pipeline and has proposed to use the route that would minimize impacts to landowners and the environment. The Alliance has not identified a final location for the proposed injection wells, but has identified an approximately 5,300-acre site in which the wells would be located and under which the CO2 would be permanently stored. Up to 25 acres of land would be used for the injection facilities, associated infrastructure and buildings, and access roads. The draft EIS evaluates the potential impacts of the proposed project, connected actions, and reasonable alternatives. Because the proposed project may affect wetlands, the draft EIS includes an assessment of impacts to wetlands in accordance with DOE’s regulations under Compliance with Floodplains and Wetlands Environmental Review Requirements (10 CFR part 1022). DOE analyzed two alternatives in the draft EIS: the proposed action and the no action alternative. Under the proposed action, DOE would provide approximately $1 billion in cost-shared ARRA funding to the proposed project. Under the no action alternative, DOE would not provide continued funding. Without DOE funding, it is unlikely that the Alliance, or the industry in general, would undertake the utility-scale integration of CO2 capture and geologic storage with a coal-fueled power plant using oxy-combustion. Therefore, the no action alternative also represents a ‘‘no- build’’ alternative. Without DOE’s investment in a utility-scale facility, the development of oxy-combustion repowered plants integrated with CO2 capture and geologic storage would occur more slowly or not at all. The draft EIS considers the environmental consequences that may result from the proposed project and describes additional mitigation that might be used to reduce various impacts. Availability of the Draft EIS: Copies of the draft EIS have been distributed to members of Congress; Native American tribal governments; federal, state, and local officials; and agencies, organizations, and individuals who may be interested or affected. The draft EIS will be available on the Internet at: http://energy.gov/nepa/nepa- documents. Copies of the draft EIS are available for public review at the following locations: M–C River Public Library District, 304 Main Street, Meredosia, Illinois; Jacksonville Public Library, 201 West College Avenue, Jacksonville, Illinois; Taylorville Public Library, 121 West Vine Street, Taylorville, Illinois; Arcola Public Library, 407 East Main Street, Arcola, Illinois; and Tuscola Public Library, 112 Sale Street, Tuscola, Illinois. Additional copies also can be requested (see ADDRESSES). Public Hearing: DOE will conduct a public hearing on May 21, 2013 at the Jacksonville High School, Jacksonville, Illinois to obtain comments on the draft EIS. Requests to speak at the public hearing can be made by calling or writing to Mr. Whyte (see ADDRESSES). Requests to speak not submitted prior to the hearing will be accepted in the order in which they are received during the hearing. Speakers are encouraged to provide a written version of their oral comments or supplementary materials for the record. Each speaker will be allowed approximately five minutes to present comments. Those speakers who want more than five minutes should indicate the length of time desired in their request. Depending on the number of speakers, DOE may need to limit all speakers to five minutes initially and provide additional opportunities as time permits. Comments will be recorded by a court reporter and will become part of the public record. Oral and written comments will be given equal consideration. The public hearing will begin at 5:00 p.m. with an informational session. Formal presentations and a formal comment session will begin at approximately 6:00 p.m. DOE will begin the hearing’s formal session with overviews of its clean coal program, proposed FutureGen 2.0 Project, and the NEPA process, followed by oral statements by pre-registered speakers. Speakers may be asked questions to help ensure that DOE fully understands their comments. A presiding officer will establish the order of speakers and provide any additional procedures necessary to conduct the hearing. The public hearing will be accessible to people with disabilities. In addition, any individual needing specific assistance, such as a sign language interpreter or a translator, should contact Mr. Whyte (See ADDRESSES) at least 48 hours in advance of the hearing so that arrangements can be made. Dated: May 1, 2013. Mark J.
